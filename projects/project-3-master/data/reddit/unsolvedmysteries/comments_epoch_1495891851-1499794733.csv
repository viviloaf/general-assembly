2,Non-engineer seeking help creating device with laser tripwire,1499788288,"The gist of what I’m seeking help with: I need to build a compact, portable, battery-powered device that sounds a brief tone if a laser tripwire (5' end-to-end range) is crossed. I have no idea where to start.

&amp;nbsp; 

**What is this for?**

I train dogs for dog agility. Jumps are a very important part of competition (every course has 8-12 jumps). Jump bars are displaceable and can be knocked down easily. Knocking down bars is a serious problem, though – knocking down even one bar during a competition is a disqualifying fault.

One of my dogs is running fast, he’ll often mis-judge and clip bars. This sometimes causes them to fall down. For most dogs that do this, you can hear them “tick” the bar and adjust your training accordingly. [The challenge with my dog is that he has fluffy feet](http://i.imgur.com/MBPnWaT.jpg), which means I often can’t hear him tick the bars. The foot fluff has made it much harder to teach him that he needs to clear the jump entirely without scraping over the top. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What am I trying to create?**

I’m trying to create a sensor with a laser tripwire, that I can attach to a jump bar for use in training. I’d like to set it up so that if the tripwire is broken, a short tone plays. Basically an alert system to mark the exact moment the dog ticks the bar – I’m not trying to punish him with a loud noise, but just create a system where it’s easier for me to identify and reward when he puts in a good effort and clears the bar with some space to spare.  

&amp;nbsp;


**Background information on materials I'm building around**


[Here is a dog agility jump](http://i.imgur.com/mSrOys4.jpg). It has attached plastic jump cups on the side at 2” intervals. Jump bars are 5’ long and rest in the cups. 

&amp;nbsp;


**My idea so far...**

[My imaginary invention looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/6G42Gpz.jpg) (dotted line is the tripwire line). At this point I'm imagining sensors attached to the bar rather than the jump upright, so the jump can still be adjusted to different jump heights. I’m thinking perhaps a battery pack that sits on the ground next to the jump, with wires wrapping around the jump upright and plugging into a tripwire attached to either end of the jump bar. I don’t care where the tone comes from as long as it is physically on the unit somewhere. I don't care if the device can be transferred across bars - permanent installation on a bar is okay as long as the bar can still fall down if my dog crashes into it.

In a perfect world I would also be able to pick the noise that is made for the tone. But really as long as it's a short, medium/low volume noise I can probably make it work.

I have no idea where to start. I have no engineering background. I need suggestions for basic reading, ideas for potential materials, existing types of products I might be able to buy and modify. Even suggestions for where else I might post this would be helpful! ",AskEngineers,manatee1010,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6mn33d/nonengineer_seeking_help_creating_device_with/

10,UK engineers - Do you feel financially undervalued?,1499767290,"A question for my UK brethren; do you feel undervalued in terms of your base pay? Most specifically that which you received on first starting work? 

The question arises as I have been comparing starting salaries between the UK and US average. Now when we're talking about a country as large and complex as the US it's difficult to nail anything down for certain but as a back of the fag packet comparison it should do and I'll use an average Mech Eng grad's starting salary to try and keep it as even as possible. 

So, in the Red corner we have the UK with an average starting salary of £25,000 (Target Jobs, 2017) which is  approximately  $32,300 (xe.com) whereas in the Blue Corner we have the US with starting pay for the same at $64,100 (Payscale, 2016) or £49,620. In a general sense the cost of living is cheaper across the US compared to the UK and that $64,100 has 19.32% greater purchasing power (numbeo.com, 2017) and you start to see that engineers in the UK are really paid a pittance compared to our transatlantic counterparts. 

So my question again; do you feel like all your effort at uni (and later) is valued when you see those stark differences and what do you think can be done to redress the balance? 

Also remember that our US counterparts generally leave uni with a BS (and...this is going to be unpopular, sorry Amerifriends) that going by the rules of the Bologne agreement and the Davidson report is only valued at FdENG or Ordinary degree level and that many UK grads are leaving with an MEng these days (though I don't have solid numbers on that but would appreciate some) and if not the standard British Honours degree is valued, by the same report (when taking into account credits, cintact hours and subject speciality), as equivalent to a US MS.

In a bit of a pickle at the moment. Im set to graduate with a mechanical engineering degree in December,  but by the misfortune of a rough start to last semester, i received a D in heat transfer, which is a spring semester only course.

I don't know if this is possible at all. If there's a better way to tackle this, then I'm all ears.

I need to make a tube with OD 13mm and ID 11.5mm, of a reasonably easily soluble material, like table salt or sugar. 

I made a mold in SolidWorks and plan on 3D printing it. I would then create a supersaturated solution, pour it into the negative space and then heat it until the water evaporates off. Then I would pour more supersaturated solution in and repeat the process until I get my shape.

I don't know if that would work and I wanted to get outside opinions before I 3D printed it. Am I missing something easier? That seems incredibly time intensive. 

My actual design input is a hollow tube that protects an object inside the lumen until placed in water, at which point, the protection should (within 1 min) vanish and I don't have to worry about disposal of the tube. This is why I'm looking into dissolving crystals.

It doesn't need a lot of strength. Just enough to be handled by a reasonably careful gloved individual until it can be deployed.

36,Choosing between CE or an EE&amp;CS program,1499674218,"I'm a bit shy so this is a throwaway account lol

But some background info: I'm an incoming college freshman for Fall 2017, and currently in the Computer Engineering program. I initially applied for Computer Science, but was told that there was no more room so I got put in CE, and I was okay with that because CE is kind of a mix of EE and CS (pls correct me if I'm wrong). At an orientation a week ago, I learned that there was a special pathway for Electrical Engineering students to also major in Computer Science while graduating on time (in 4 years). To major in Computer Science as a Computer Engineering student would mean I would graduate in 6 years... 

I don't want you to tell me which program to choose over the other, (but if you want to share your opinion on that, that would be fine too lol), I just want to hear your experiences outside of college, like if you chose one of these majors, I'd just like you to share where that has brought you after graduating and finding a job, and some pros and cons..?

I have decided to start my Job Search today and I was wondering if there are other terms you can type in search bars to bring up Entry Level Jobs. Ive been searching using glassdoor.com and they have a filter for ""Entry Level"" but they tend to produce minimal results. I'm thinking the companies haven't classified them as Entry Level and maybe use a different classification/wording. 

From experience, what is the best way to populate these entry level jobs for recent grads/less than 2 years work experience.

In case this matters: I have been working for an engineering contractor for the past 2.5 years in its aerospace division. I was hired on after working there as an co-op for 1.5 years so I have 1 year full time experience since I graduated with my BS in Mech. Engineering from ABET accredited University. I think its time to make a change and I'm looking into jobs within the biomedical industry. I have been looking into Boston Scientific, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Medtronic along with others.

All advice is welcome. You will be see more posts by me in the future. :D

68,Can cars really be hacked remotely and then driven?,1499502219,"The question is the question but I have background that helps give important direction to potential answers:

- MOST cars do NOT have any form of self-steering capabilities, even if they are electric-motor-driven-power-steering. In order to even make a car with electric power steering steer itself you would need to develop an entire control module for that with its own array of sensors. AS FAR AS I KNOW.

- the security systems in cars don't usually provide a barrier between a remotely controllable a vehicle in the first place. They are meant to prevent theft. And hacking these security systems does not allow such a car to be controllable remotely. They are different systems with different security. For example, a Tesla or a Mercedes-Benz uses a key-fob to control the vehicle's remote controls. The non-remote automated systems on these vehicles are purely for safety (preventative braking) and steering control is not an active or passive safety feature. AS FAR AS I KNOW

- I've yet to see a car that is designed in such a way to be able to control its own throttle... this is differentiated from Cruise Control by the fact that Cruise Control requires ""user input"" in order to accelerate; AKA pushing a button. There have been reports of cars with ""stuck throttle"" but that is never a case of a car having an automated throttle that is malfunctioning; they are cases of throttle controls being literally stuck. AS FAR AS I KNOW there is no consumer-commercial vehicle designed with this type of remote throttle control in mind (important word here is ""consumer"" and not ""technical customer"" or ""military customer"".. please use common sense if debating this).

- No vehicle would be able to be remotely piloted or even self-piloted (like a drone) without cameras or sensors. Most of these cameras and sensors that DO exist are surely unlikely to be remotely hackable. For example, the cameras for rear-view backup are linked to the center-console display screens (AS FAR AS I KNOW, there may be some unique American-tech designs that allow for Law Enforcement backdoors). Sensors are almost exclusively used for their specific control module system and are nearly impossible to hack.

82,"Is grad school at a tier 1 university an option for me, given my poor undergraduate performance?",1499440025,"I attended the University of Michigan and graduated recently with a bachelor's in electrical engineering. My GPA was a 2.4/4.0. I am now working full-time, and my plan is to work for 2 years then go back to school for some graduate degree. My dad is pushing me towards getting an MBA, but I would heavily consider a master's in electrical engineering instead. On the website, the minimum GPA requirement is a 3.5. Research experience is also strongly suggested (which I don't have).

I was thinking there are a few factors that could work to mitigate my poor GPA - the obvious is obtaining an outstanding GRE score. I also plan to complete the FE Exam within the next few months, and assuming I get my EIT license, I think it could be a good resume boost. It's a nice comprehensive review of everything I learned in undergrad. I think I should also take some courses as a non-matriculating student and of course do well in them.

In the specific case of UMich, I think I have a slight advantage since I went there for undergrad. The advisers and some other staff of the EE department know me personally (granted, it was because I often had to visit the office since I was on academic probation a couple times).. but since they know me more intimately than other students, I figured it could give me a leg up. Also, they know I was struggling in undergrad with mental health which affected my grades. I kept my adviser updated so he knew what a rollercoaster my academic performance was. I would do exceptionally well on one exam (over 90% which is well over the typical EE exam average) then go through a period of crippling depression and totally bomb the next (obtaining something ridiculous like a 40%). I think he understands that my undergrad GPA is not a reflection of my potential. 

What are your thoughts? I used UMich to illustrate a specific scenario, but I would be open to other schools. I would really like to be able to attend a top 25 engineering program. Also, while we're at it, maybe someone could give me input on what my outlook is for grad school IN GENERAL, not just for engineering? Thanks!

93,What industry could use a small reciprocating compressor capable of handling CH4?,1499427287,"Hi, everyone!

I am currently looking for a compressor that is somewhat rare if existent at all. It must be pretty small -  25-35 l/min flow rate, have a decent power consumption (about 1/4"" hp), raise pressure at most up to 3 bar and be quite silent. The catch is, we require it to pump methane. Until this point, the working version was to use a semi-hermitic or hermetic air compressor. Yes, it is unsafe if air was somehow sucked into it and flammable concentration is reached. This is why we started searching something more suitable, something that could handle flammable gases.

At first, we tried to find a dedicated methane compressor. The search did not turn out to be fruitful, as most of these devices are huge. So, we went another way. Knowing of the flammable refrigerants such as r290 or r600, and as reciprocating compressors for them are quite similar to the air compressor we had been employing before, we acquired r290 one to test if it's suitable. Well, it wasn't.

The compressor proved to be much less efficient, as it drained almost three times as much power for a 20% lower performance. I am guessing it is due to the different densities of CH4 and C3H8, but I would actually appreciate if you could point me in the direction of the theory behind it, as most of the stuff I found was regarding centrifugal compressors.

Anyway, maybe someone on this sub in their line of work has met an industry where such compressor would be needed and where I can continue my search?

Thank you!

1,Would appreciate some help with Programs / Schooling Questions,1499405538,"Thanks in advance for any help

Hopefully this is not a question that is asked often, but I did search a bit and did not find anything directly relevant to this. 

I'm looking at going back to school. I've searched around quite a bit at different engineering degrees and ""technical diplomas"" and have a few questions about them. Ideally, I was looking at programs that were a bit shorter (I'm a bit older and don't think I can afford (both time and money) to take a 4 year degree from a Uni). I also don't think my High School grades are too competitive. I'm currently upgrading Math 30-1 for this reason. 

Ideally, I would like to get a job working in green energy / environment. In your opinion, is something like ""Energy Systems Engineer"" too specific? I have heard it may be best to go into something broader like Mechanical / electrical engineering. For me, energy/environment is something I am more passionate about, but don't want something that may be looked upon as ""too niche"" in the job market.

What is your opinion on Engineering Technology programs at Polytechnic schools? Can you actually gain accreditation to do engineering work or do graduates usually just end up as low level installers / salespeople? I have a background as a Sales Manager and as a Journeyman Mechanic, and since I already have experience in these fields, I am not looking to go to school only to get a job in fields I'm already qualified in.

One of the programs that caught my eye was the Alternative Energy Technology Program at NAIT in Edmonton. Hopefully it's ok to post the link:
http://www.nait.ca/program_home_76007.htm

Is it something you'd recommend in your opinion? 

This was a different course I was looking at for another example:
http://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/energy-systems-engineering-technology#GO-Graduate-Opportunities
(3 year Diploma)

Are these types of courses still something that require engineer-accreditations? I guess I am a little confused as to how that type of thing would work. And if you don't mind taking the time to quickly peruse the courses involved in each, which do you feel is the better option?

I am realistic and I realise there are other factors involved in getting a job than just an education. I'm not planning on leaving school and having several job offers waiting for me. I just want to make sure that I take a program that is relevant, adequate and fairly competitive for the energy / environment field.

- Is there something that can be put under the bed posts that will dampen the noise? The only ideas of the landlord and some friend of the other tenant is carpeting or ""some sort of rubber"". Styrofoam has been tried but did nothing. The idea is to stop the vibration before it propagates into the floor. Can such a vibration even be stopped or greatly dampened?

- Does anyone know if that sort of vibration can cause bodily harm? Perhaps I can build a case that what she's doing is damaging to my health?

38,Liquid level in a sealed stainless steel canister,1499309750,"I've been stuck for a little bit in this issue and am asking for a some guidance on the matter. 


Problem: The main goal is to determine when a stainless steel canister has run empty. The canister is around 70cm high and 20-30cm in diameter. I cannot modify the canister in any permanent way and thus it is necessary that the method of level monitoring is noninvasive. The media within the canister will be either HCDS or TiCl4, both of which are pretty nasty. The push gas being helium. The current method uses a simple scale and density calculations, but we would like something more precise. 


Possible solutions: Please forgive me as my knowledge and experience with sensors is limited to the research I've done in the last few weeks. I have been researching solutions for this and it seems like the best answer would be using an ultrasonic sensor. However, I'm finding that since we cannot open the top of the canister, it may not work, though we could place it facing upwards instead. Another thought I had was to somehow measure the density (or flow rate?) of the media out of the dipstick. My thinking was if the canister is empty, there will be a pretty large change since the tube will switch from chemical to helium.

42,(EE) Help Modelling Variable Capacitance with LTSPICE for a MEMS Device,1499298195,"Hello,

I'm a summer EE intern. I am designing several PCBs for a MEMS project.

&amp;nbsp;

The setup:

Input signal (0 - 5v) amplified via high-voltage amplifier.

Output of amplifier is ~200V command signal. 
      
Command signal is delivered to MEMS load. The load consists of movable paddles that are electrostatically coupled.
    
When load receives command, the distance between the paddles change, hence changing the capacitance of the paddles, slightly changing the node voltage.
    
The change in node voltage is sensed and filtered using a lock-in amplifier (synchronous demodulation).       

This change in capacitance (and voltage) is used to determine the current position of the paddle.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem: 

I have a decent idea of whats going on, but I'm struggling to simulate the board before designing it. Namely, I do not know how to model the change in capacitance of the paddles. I am using LTSpice. I have played around using the B voltage source (in an attempt to create a voltage controlled capacitor) but to no avail. 

&amp;nbsp;

The question: 

Is there a way to model a component with variable capacitance using LTSpice? Is my best bet to keep working with the B sources?

43,"How do you ""tare"" a Wheatstone bridge?",1499297820,"Lets say you want to read a small signal from a strain gauge with a full Wheatstone bridge configuration. There is a steady state offset between the two nodes you are measuring in addition to the actual signal due to loading that you are trying to measure. You have a circuit (perhaps an Instrumentation Amplifier) that simply scales up the difference in voltage between the two nodes. In software, of course, you can take a reading at no load and then subtract that from every future reading in order to ""tare"" your device. However, if the steady state offset is too large, your amplifier must be low gain to avoid saturation and you will lose resolution in your ADC. My question is how you would build a circuit that would remove the steady state offset from the signal entirely.

How would you make a circuit, that at the push of a button, would record the voltage difference between your nodes and then subtract that difference from the actual signals prior to amplification?

I don't view myself as a stereotypical prepper, but more as someone who solves problems seeking solutions. 

I thought of a concept that might save potentially hundreds of thousands of lives, and I'm looking for people who can contribute. In really any capacity. Volunteers who want to do good, I think good people exist still.

Ideas are a dime a dozen. Execution is what matters, and I honestly don't know much about anything in this area. I know enough to know generally what is required technically, but I haven't made sure on paper if this is even practical or not aside from some napkin math.

I also am 100% committed to my current work as a VR developer, so this is more just talking about things with reddit to see how out there this is. I realized that, you know, if an EMP strikes where I live, I and millions of people lose everything and won't be going to work for a while--if we can survive that long. It's had me questioning my decisions. Maybe I should have been working on this RV for a few years instead of fun visual candy.


OK SO..

**If there was an open source, crowd designed and crowd funded vehicle that could conform to this checklist, it could be important to exist:**


1) It must cost under $50K ideally, up to $100K if necessary (everything that isn't labor). Much more puts it as too pricey to be a thing. Should be in the $50-$100 per person range.

2) As many parts as possible should be sourced locally to keep cost down

3) 1 vehicle should be able to provide water and basic energy needs for a micro community of 1000 people

4) Contains electronics for Low power and cost water filtration system with good flow rate. 20GPM looks nice.

5) Contains within it a multi chamber Faraday cage system.

6) Contains within the center of the cage system

7) Contains an EMP hardened generator and solar array (what is the best semi-transparent film/coating that can be applied to a curved window

8) Vehicle needs to be movable

9) Vehicle needs to be huge, sturdy, and fully sealed

10) Stores a few defibrillators (what else should there be? electrically sensitive, space is limited) 

11) Become the hubs for communities to keep the peace. Provide primitive survival education.


**Some notes:**


- I live in Hawaii, so such vehicles would be able to drive to fresh (but not clean) sources of water. Not everywhere has fresh water sources, but I think something that works well in some places is better than nothing.

- I don't know how severely the performance of any solar panel would be impacted by ""good enough"" semi-transparent window shielding

- This is impossible, right? Mind mythbusting this and explaining what would be the most efficient mobile system (if you're cool with making that public)

- I'm a big fan of Open Source, so while there may eventually be investment raised to build these things, that will never change the Open Source-ness. People should be able to, if this is even a thing that can exist, crowdfund what it takes to either build one or buy one.

- I think finding a scalable model could be really cool. It would take 1000 vehicles (add a few more to be safe) to ensure 1M people on the island of Oahu have more hope than they do now of surviving a devastating disaster.

- There is a strange thing going on where everyone I've run this by IRL thinks the government has a plan for this, or ""no one would want to live in a post-emp world anyway, so don't bother"". I'm not particularly satisfied with those thoughts. Unfortunately, it also seems like working on a solution to this is taboo so even if I think it's important I might never speak of it again. Like I'm a crazy person for thinking it's pretty dumb that we don't already have a system in place that would make us laugh about EMP attacks.

79,Are many large engineering companies massive failure businesses with good marketing?,1499188150,"I work for a big defense company.  My organization hasn't built a successful product in decades.  Most of the work is really about fostering relationships with customers (by making promises during meetings, playing sports and golf with key individuals), in order to get funding that they have to burn before the next budget cycle.  Political, emotional, and charismatic skills are the only valued skills in employees, rarely technical.  

Most programs run for 2-3 years before hilariously failing, at which point a failure investigation is called - which rarely ever reports the real reasons.  Management sugar coats the failure as if it was ""high tech high risk"", and that ""we learned something in the process"" - but really it was some simple integration issues with 20 year old technology, internal strife between groups, and the engineers on the program not knowing what they were doing (some are randomly assigned highly technical tasks regardless of skill), and weren't really trying to be successful anyway (they know the game).  Higher management never cares as long as we spent our budget believably (on engineer salaries and equipment, and not what would look like embezzling or champagne).  In a few years, the project name changes, and it's tried again with the same people (who are really good at working a room during meetings, and playing golf at this point), and same issues.  A failure business.  Golf, soccer, and marketing keep this place open.

I would expect this from shitty kickstarters, and sketchy small companies.  At this point I even expect it in the defense.  But should I be expecting this in most big companies?  In other words, is it the nature of large companies, where there is so many people, so many managers, and a ""use it or lose it"" budget, where projects are just exercises in who can spend their budget on the most non-functional nonsense, and the best bullshitter who gets the most funding gets promoted?

My only problem is I have very little experience in electrical engineering (I'm a musician), and with all of the products out there to make things easier like Arduino, it's difficult to know which direction to head in. I'm even open to using a different kind of motor, so long as it can apply nearly instantaneous torque,  it's loud enough for the vibrations to be picked up effectively by a contact microphone, and I can control the precise speed-- it's not important to be able to control precise movements and positions.

Really, what I need to know are some of the better ways to accomplish something like this. The less parts I have to buy, the better.

I want to find a job and be able to move out of state after I graduate, and would like to start applying for job positions as soon as possible.

How should I approach this topic with my current company I am a co-op at (in regards to providing references from my current manager/colleagues, discussing my job search at work, etc.)?

The way i see it, a container ship gets by its own means out of the port and its hitched to a nuclear powered vessel that tows it across the ocean.

When the ship is near port, it loses the tugboat and docks under itw own power.

I think this nuclear powered tugboat would need to be big and heavy in order to pull a container ship, but it would save lots of fuel and probably cut travel time. 

Edit 1: I see the regulation issue in many answers. That's why this would be a tugboat. It would start towing the ship from entering international waters until they enter another country's sea soverignity zone. That would avoid most red tape, since each country would still receive a conventional powered container ship. The container ship would  work for the initial and last ""miles"" of the trip.

0,How are you supposed to fit pulley wheel / sprocket to gear motor?,1499107663,"Pretty sure it's very stupid question but I feel like I missed something obvious, since my mechanical engineering knowledge is very lacking.

We have a small project which use gear motors to drive a pulley or chain system.

The problem we encountered is that all the cheap motors (i'm talking about &lt;$50 DC motor here, we only need very little torque) are **D-shaft,** such as [this one](https://www.servocity.com/19-rpm-econ-gear-motor), while all the sprockets or pulley wheels either have a **round shaft or keyed shaft**. I have no idea how to put them together. 

I googled a lot but didn't find anything useful about this - maybe because it's too basic. I only found answers like ""glue them"" or ""weld them"".. like really?

Could someone guide me to some resources, especially online vendors that I can find sprockets and motors that can fit each other, and within reasonable prices? I can find a motor with keyed shaft on mcmaster carr, but it's $500 and totally overkill in term of torque and power (and weight for sure). 

Any general information will be very helpful, too.

2,Deciding between types of Stainless Steel: 304 v 201,1499106311,"I'm ordering stainless steel trays from China and am trying whether it's worth saving money by going with 201 grade stainless vs 304 grade. The trays will be used in a dehydrator up to 60-100°C and will be exposed to water and vegetable leaves. The trays will be heavily used, up to 16 hours a day. However, I haven't been able to get a good understanding to how the inferior corrosion-resistant properties of 201 would actually impact the quality long term in the relatively mild conditions the trays will be subject to.

Another factor is that the trays are coming from China which definitely impugns the quality of the material. Aside from getting a lab to test material (not feasible as this will be a relatively small order, &lt;$5k) there isn't really any recourse I can see to understand the provenance of the material better. I'm conflicted whether it's wiser to get the higher quality steel to further ensure it has satisfactory anti-corrosive properties or to go with the lower quality based on the assumption that it's all shit anyway.

23,Recent mechanical grad looking for advice on how to enter the tech field,1499018748,"Hi Everyone! 

I’m looking for some career advice and pointers. 

Background: 
I’m a recent mechanical engineer grad (Dec 2016), who specialized in mechatronics. I’ve made two CNC machines (2 and 3-axis), plus a small robot rover. I have experience coding in Matlab, I’m familiar with C,  and I’ve been exposed to a few other languages. Along with several different microcontrollers. 

When I graduated I landed a job in a consulting firm that specializes in industrial plants. It’s been a great experience seeing how monster projects are managed and executed, however it’s not where my passion lies. 

Currently: 
I really want to be more involved in the tech field, I would love to work for a smaller company and/or start up. I want to be a part of a positive and forward thinking culture, combined with a socially conscious product. I see myself in a position that combines software and hardware.  

Dilemma: 
So here’s the thing… I’m not sure how to get there. At first I was set on taking a coding bootcamp, like Hackeryou, but then I realized it won’t be putting me closer to my goals. Yes, it’s coding, but it’s centred on web development, and I’m not sure that would pair well with what I want to do. So now I’m back to square one. In the mean time I’m learning Python, which comes easily because I know Matlab. 

In the coming months: 
I’m planning on moving to a bigger city, right now I’m considering Toronto, Ottawa, or Vancouver come Fall / Winter because I believe these cities would have more opportunities. I would love to land a job within the tech field. I feel like I’m contributing now at this global company, but sometimes I feel like I’m just a cog in a large system, and I think that I would prefer to be somewhere, probably a smaller company, where I could express my creativity and problem solving abilities to the maximum, and feel like I’m contributing even more. 

I’m not sure how to get myself from here to there, and I’m wondering how I should best position myself to make this jump. 

If you know of any companies, or extra training, (in either city) that might help with this, I would love to hear your suggestions. 

Looking forward to the future,

Welcome to the AskEngineers biquarterly thread to apply for contributor flair!

**Contributor flair** is both the [icon and text](https://i.imgur.com/ECzkrGp.png) next to a someone's username which indicates his or her engineering specialization that you may have seen while browsing AskEngineers. Flair with no icon does not necessarily indicate demonstrated expertise. We're always looking for new contributors, so if you think you have what it takes, keep on reading!

* A list of our currently flaired users can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Askengineers/wiki/flairedusers#wiki_flaired_users).

* **If you previously applied for flair and did not get a response:** please [**message us**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers&amp;subject=Flair%20application) or simply apply again in this thread. Sometimes applications get lost or neglected over holidays when the mod team is on vacation, etc.

---

###Requirements for Contributor Flair

* **Expertise in an area of engineering.** Expertise means degree-level academic knowledge (min. Bachelor's or BSc), or an equivalent amount of self-study, work experience in the field, or research.
  * **Note:** we will not ask you to verify your credentials, meaning this is a purely merit-based system.

* The ability to **cite sources from engineering literature** for any claims you make, especially within your area of expertise.

* The ability to provide **high-quality answers** in accordance with [**our answering guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_answers).

#### Expected behavior

We afford a certain level of trust to flaired members of AskEngineers, as they are the face of the community and represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole.  Because of this, we take into account every flair applicant's user history when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history contains any form of racism, sexism, and other types of bigotry.  Such behavior is not tolerated in AskEngineers as stated in [**our rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_civility), and we do not tolerate it from our panelists. Additionally, applicants who participate in discussions that are anti-science, pseudoscientific, or otherwise not supported by peer-reviewed scientific literature will be rejected. We also reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. AskEngineers is a space for engineering discussion based on science and verifiable facts, and the attitudes described above have no place here.

### How to apply

Simply post a top-level reply in this thread, and include:

1. **The desired [icon and text](https://i.imgur.com/ECzkrGp.png) of your flair you want to be designated as.** Try to be as specific as possible, but be aware that there is a hard limit of 32 characters (including spaces).

1.  **Links to at 3-5 comments that you've made within the past 2 years, answering a question in your field of expertise.** Your posts do not have to be on AskEngineers — if you answered questions in /r/Engineering, /r/AskScience, or another relevant subreddit, they will be accepted.
  * **Note:** we may ask for additional comments beyond what you initially provide if some of them are considered insufficient (length or depth), or irrelevant to the expertise you're claiming.

### How to nominate

Follow the same instructions above, linking 3-5 comments that *another user* made that you think would qualify him or her for contributor flair. Be sure to tag them in your comment by including `/u/username-of-nominee` in your comment. If the user doesn't claim the nomination, they will be given a generic ""Trusted Contributor"" icon that they may opt out of at any time.

### Revoking flair

Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules or fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise.

My story:

After graduating with a BEng Hons in Mechanical my first role was for a small company, within two weeks my boss who had hired me had a big falling out with the managing director and left. The MD was a very difficult person to work with, but it came as a shock to me as my boss who had promised to mentor me had now disappeared. I decided to stay at the company and during my time never received any formal training. I just put my head down and got stuck into the designing as best as I could and worked hard. It turned out that the company had a very high turnover of designers and staff in general. 


Finally I left as I wished to gain new experience and I felt I was going no where at that job. My second job was for company specialising in large fabrication. This started well and I received good performance reviews. However things took a turn for the worse when the company began to take on work with very tight lead times. I was still learning the ropes and trying to get designs drawn up checked and into fabrication, I struggled with the pace ( I feel this is why I am maybe not suited to be a designer). I was responsible for some errors but also felt that I was hung out to dry by my manager. I was fired the day after I came back from my honeymoon.


At this point I was feeling I was not cut out to be a designer, perhaps foolishly but also spurred on by the need to be in work I took on a role with a company civil engineering company as a CAD designer. They used AutoCAD, my background was primarily in Solidworks. I made them aware of this and the fact I was not familiar with the construction industry. They said this would not be a problem and I would receive training. Training was non existent and I battled on doing research in my free time to try and make the job easier to do. 


I have since being let go from this role (I was not kept on when the six month probationary period I was on was finished). I am glad to be not working for them as the last month was hellish. I was under a lot of pressure and was starting to look for a way out. It was a fast paced, high pressure role. The company was aware that I was not from a civil/construction background when they took me on.


My designer manager and the contracts director who I reported to had a very demanding and over bearing management style. On one hand they wanted me to be an ""autonomous"" designer but on the other hand when I tried to work by myself and tackle problems I was constantly being undermined and belittled. The contracts director has threatened to fire me about a month before I was actually fired and also said to me that if something went wrong then ""woe betide me"". I was responsible for an error about 3/4 through my probationary period which cost the company some money but no one had checked it despite my requests. I completed many projects which were fabricated, assembled and delivered to site correctly though so I did plenty right too. 


As with previous roles it turns out that there were several other designers at that company in the past, most have not lasted long by the looks of it and were probably ""rinsed"" and then left/ were fired. When I was fired I felt it was a good thing as the stress was beginning to effect my personal life. As a result of the above experiences my confidence is at an all time low.


I think I should look for other roles that are not a design engineer. I feel I will always struggle with the fast paced, high pressure, small engineering jobs. These are the type I have worked in so far. In my opinion I am not a great draughtsman so I need a change from this. 


I have previously applied for roles as maintenance engineer and production planner but I think I may be ruled out of these roles as my experience is solely in design. Perhaps there are other roles in the engineering sector I could work as?


Recently I have signed up to do a course which is one day a week in rail maintenance and am really enjoying it so far. Railways are something I am passionate about and it is mostly hands on role. I worked on a building site as a labourer while younger thought I was suited to it. It was one of the few jobs where I was told I was good at it. Possibly this is the future for me? It allows me to still use my engineering knowledge and experience I have gained so far but to apply it in an area that is possibly better suited for me.


Any thoughts/advice would be much appreciated.

I'm an engineering intern this summer, and recently I learned that some people think it's rude if you walk by someone and don't acknowledge them. 

The only people I say hi to (if I pass them in the hallway) are my manager, my mentors, and the other interns. But people that I've talked to only once or twice, I generally avoid eye contact and act like I haven't seen them. There's no malice in this behavior, I just feel too awkward to say anything and don't mean anything by it. Now I'm kinda worried people think I'm trying to snub them, which is the last thing I want to do as I really like the company I'm working for.

At one point, two of my fellow interns started having a conversation without me while we were at a social event. Then they saw me, and said ""Hey, we didn't see you there, otherwise we would have came and talked to you! Sorry, if it seemed like we were being rude."" The thing was, I didn't think they were being rude at all? I just thought they were having a conversation and were so immersed in it they didn't notice me? Not sure why that is offensive? I'm very worried that other people have a much lower threshold than me for what they think is rude.

Now, I've got a background in Computer / Electrical engineering. I'm familiar with control theory, so I can imagine a PID controller working to precisely measure the amount of pressure the feeder places onto the stack of paper. But... I'm not so good from the mechanical / materials perspective.

Is the most effective force at ""picking up one page"" a sheering force? Does a motor pull the top piece of paper, while pushing the 2nd piece of paper on the stack backwards? Or is there a simpler mechanism, like a spring or some mechanical device that can separate pieces of paper easily?

I'd imagine that the full solution is a combination of some mechanical movements, a spring (or PID controller measuring the pressure placed on the pieces of paper), some motors to spin a wheel through the feeding tubes... and likely precision made wheels and springs that match some sort of standard ""paper specifications"".

The code is written in Matlab, and just solves for 2 unknown coefficients for the parabolic temperature profile in each region using matrix inversion.

I have a few theories as to how this might be so and I was hoping some more qualified minds might weigh in on them.

1. Peak hp. I'm guessing the 400hp figure is a peak figure, and it would have no hope of producing 400hp continuously as would be necessary in an industrial application. 

2. Final drive ratio. I believe the model s (at least the original one) had almost a 10:1 final reduction. This allows the motor to spin quite fast. I believe that like gas engines, spinning an electric motor faster can result in greater output.

3. Cooling. The motor is liquid cooled which allows for huge current flow for short periods.  ",AskEngineers,ironburger,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6kg6pu/how_does_tesla_get_so_much_hp_from_such_a/

I bought a new apartment last year, and since the beginning of winter this pipe in the parking level has been leaking a little bit. Over the last few days we've had unusually heavy rain and it has been leaking quite a bit more...

http://imgur.com/gallery/RRlUr

I've emailed the management company to ask them to take a look again, but they looked before and their fix appears to have been just painting some latex paint over the concrete - i.e. just patching it over, not fixing the actual problem. They claimed that it was caused by a problem with some pipes in the next street along (around 30m away) and there was nothing they could do (i.e. they just fobbed it off).

Now I know with absolutely no context it's impossible to say exactly what's going on, but I'd just like to know you opinion based on what you can see in the pictures, of how bad you think this is? I'm concerned that as the water is coming through the concrete it's going to cause it to start falling apart. 45 is my parking space, and it already drips water on my car and it's hard to remove the residue.

For a bit more context this is the -2 level of the car park, above it is another level of parking where there are no leaks or surface water, and then above that there are 5 residential floors. The orange pipe is a drainage pipe from the parking above. The silver pipes are ventilation. Next to this wall (with 45/46 painted) is 5m of gardens and then a 2 floor residential house, and on the other side of that is the street I was talking about. Next to the other wall is a small park.

I work for a small (medium?) manufacturing company (under 100 employees).  It's a family company with a lot of nepotism among the higher ups and lack of formal education. I have no problems with non-traditional education, but these family members grew up in the company and have never experienced anything outside of it, that lack of diversity really hurts.  And the general feeling of the manufacturing team is the leaders have gone from be 'leaders' to 'bosses.' And the company 'isn't was it use to be.'  The high turn over rate of employment and lack of quality control leads to increased stress levels and increased demand among all the workers, a lot of blaming and 'holding accountable' to nearly impossible standards. It's a circular problem that just keeps spiraling. It makes it a pretty toxic place to communicate/work. 

**
I have good relationships with a lot of the non-nepotistic manufacturing team members. And when our engineering team tries to help out with certain problems we just get bogged down, our own work slows and our projects solutions die because the leadership won't allocate more time for people to preform quality checks/simple cleanliness. A general feeling of ""not hitting these numbers"" means the wip cracks harder.

I honestly don't see my self at the company very much longer. But also don't want a different company/same story situation. I guess i'm venting/looking for advise. I'll be starting my online ME masters program soon, so my stress of not growing will probably lessen. 

I feel this isn't a unique story and would just like some input if you've experience the same thing and found some solutions that helped. 

 
Thanks in advance

98,Asking for experience - Mobile Workstation VS Remote Access for Simulations,1498736823,"Hello everybody,

I already asked this over at /pcmasterrace, but the result was not as I wanted, so here I am again.

A little bit of background, the *real* question follows below.

I work in the engineering department of an injection molding company, mostly doing the product design, so my PC-workday revolves around CAD and injection molding simulations. These often get delayed due to other activities that need to be completed 'asap or the whole company goes down', which I trust all of you know. There are days/weeks when I really need to get the design and/or simulations done and those disturbances are just dragging projects out. So the idea is to work from home/remotely, not every day or on fixed dates, but when it will be helpful to finish important projects. There are still some other things to consider, like manufacturing companies wanting their people in the bulding or overcoming the 'that's not how we have always done it so we won't allow it', but thats not why I am here today. I will be finishing my Masters soon (got Bachelor and Master while working for this company) and this will be a part of my 'I would like this if we continue our road together' ;) But I want it to be worthwhile for both parties, so that's why I am asking for your expertise.

**without background**

Does anyone have experiences running SolidWorks and Simulation software like Moldex3D, Moldflow, CADMould etc. on a mobile workstation vs. remote access to a 'regular' workstation with a regular laptop? 

I am currently running the following setup

- Xeon W3565 (4(8)x3,2GHz)
- Nvidia Quadro 4000 2GB
- 24GB DDR3

This is the oldest workstation in our office and really due for an upgrade, so I would like to get experiences for these options. Other options are welcome as well. I would love to get a server to handle the calculations, but sadly that is not happening.

Our Software suppliers aren't really helpful, since for CAD applications mobile workstations are no problem and the simulation guys really want to sell their cloud-products, which were already rejected by management.

My question is about whether this green rod can also be ferromagnetic, like carbon steel.  The resources I've found all say that this component is non-ferromagnetic, like brass or plastic.  But my suspicion is that having it be ferromagnetic is ok, but there will be reduced sensitivity in the LVDT related to the relative volumes of the blue core and green rod within the span of the LVDT.  Do I have that right?  I figure that even if the green rod and blue core are both, say, soft iron, moving the rod and core in one direction will still couple one of the secondary coils to the primary's excitation current more strongly than it will the other, generating an expected amplitude and phase from the secondaries that can be used to determine the core's position.",AskEngineers,fluffynukeit,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6k5uyj/can_an_lvdt_have_a_ferromagnetic_material/

23,How to calculate a dynamic load due to changing acceleration at the end of a cantilever?,1498626460,"I am working on an application that involves a cantilevered tube. At one end the tube is fixed to a roller assembly that can move the entire cantilevered tube along another tube that is 90 degrees to the cantilevered tube. Think of a T where the middle I is the cantilever tube and it can move along the fixed rail (see here for a concept http://imgur.com/a/b30re). The cantilevered tube will have another carriage (not pictured) that will roll along it's length that will hold a tool. I want to calculate how much 'whip' will occur at this carriage when it is all the way at the end of the cantilever and it experiences maximum deceleration, stops, then goes into maximum acceleration in the opposite direction. Once I have this maximum load I should be able to calculate the worst case deflection to see if I can live with the results or if I need to stiffen where necessary. The relevant parameters are below. Even a rough simplified estimate will help me immensely since I do not know how to perform this type of analysis.

Effective Cantilever Length: 29 inches.
Cantilevered tube cross section size: 2"" x 3"" x 0.083 wall thickness steel tubing.
Total Carriage Weight: 5 lbs.
Carriage Length: 4"".
Maximum Acceleration/Deceleration: 0.040 G or 40 milligee.
Maximum Velocity: 300 inches per minute.
Loading Scenario: Carriage is at the very end of the cantilever. The cantilever is moving at 300 ipm then decelerates to a stop at 40 milligee then accelerates to 300 ipm at 40 milligee.

Any input or relevant equations would be immensely helpful!

Hi there, I'm new to reddit and this is my first post so nice to meet you all! Since English is my second language, I apologize for some odd sentences.

I'm a 4th year university student and currently has an internship in a Press Shop of a car manufacturer in Thailand. The project has been given to me by the training staff to find a solution for quality problems in a specific part stamping operation due to the reason stated below.

For a quality problem, a specific part has die marks (a scratch caused by lower die setting is not in a right position when upper die is stamping). A cause of the problem is two pneumatic cylinders installed in the lower die(in order to set the die in the right shape prepare for stamping) are not supplied by proper amount of compressed air within the set timing(in short, like pneumatic need to complete its cycle within 5 seconds for the lower die to set in a right shape, but right now the pneumatic spend like 10 seconds per cycle).

My solution for the problem is to redesign pipeline, valves or add an air tank to the line. This idea is coming up because when I calculated the air flow rate using the current pipe size a result shows that compressed air flow is not sufficient for the current operation.

The question is ""How do I know that my calculation steps utilized are proper?"" so I'm here to ask experts!

Given Specs: Bore diameter 250mm , Stroke 200mm, Rod diameter 60mm , operate at 5 bar at STP.
The cylinder is a Double-Acting type with required Extend Stroke 1.177 sec and Retract Stroke 2.200 sec.

These are the steps how I design for air consumption, required flow rate and pipe/valve sizing.

- Calculate pneumatic air consumption in SCFM (SCFMtotal = SCFMextend + SCFMretract)

- Pipe Sizing and system specs (pipe size, length, fitting) by using SCFMtotal obtained from (1.) to select a proper Pipe Size and effective length.

27,Is there any practical way to use slides as a fire escape mechanism in large buildings?,1498616106,"This may sound like a silly question (and may be one for that matter), but in a discussion elsewhere on Reddit I got to thinking about ways to evacuate large numbers of people from tall buildings.

Not sure how this sub feels about linking to others, so I'll just quote my post here:

&gt;I've always wondered if you couldn't have some kind of shaft, that people could jump into and freefall down, which gradually curved into a slide at the bottom so they end up coming out horizontally.

&gt;You'd need some way of getting people out fast at the bottom so they didn't collide with each other, but it'd be able to move a lot of people fast, and it's mechanically simple, so relatively inexpensive, and not a lot to go wrong. Of course, it wouldn't work for everyone, but it seems like you could move quite a lot of people fast that way.

&gt;That said, I'm not an architect, and I know that the best in the industry have thought about solutions to tall building safety for decades, so I doubt this is anything which hasn't been thought of before, and there's probably a good reason why it isn't used.

&gt;Actually, now that I'm thinking about it.. it may sound silly, but what if you had a spiral slide going down the whole building. 

&gt;The problem would be that someone from the 50th floor may already be coming down fast, and you want to get on at the 30th floor. If you get on they'll run into the back of you before you get up to speed. But maybe there could be some kind of slip lane thing into the slide from each floor so that everyone is at full speed by the time they merge in to the main slide? 

&gt;I swear this sounds like stoner engineering, and that's probably about the level I'm on here, but.. just the idea of using gravity to get people out of a building fast and safely seems like a concept with potential to me.

I'm curious as to what people who know about these kind of things think - is this a completely ridiculous concept? Or has anything like this ever been tried?",AskEngineers,noodhoog,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6jxm7g/is_there_any_practical_way_to_use_slides_as_a/
28,Help with engineering career advice,1498614897,"Hi, 

I am in need of some career advice, and wasnt sure where to ask. Im a recent Mech Eng grad (2016), and im stuck between two jobs. In the summer of my junior year and the beginning of my senior year I was desperate to get a full time job lined up for graduation. I had a good GPA and had some internship experience, had interviews but had no offers for about 6 months. Around February 2016 I heard from a big defense contractor recruiter, went to the interview and got an offer. Since i was desperate, and was back in the same area where my parents lived it seemed like the perfect match.  The work was controls heavy (systems engineering) so it seemed like i would enjoy it. What i didnt understand was that the job was contingent on receiving a security clearance and the length of security clearance investigation. I had a job offer, but I couldnt work until I got cleared. I talked to the hiring manager and he said that there was nothing he could offer me to do if i had no security clearance, and the recruiter said the same thing. I was informed that i shouldnt work anywhere else since it would delay or potentially stop my security clearance. They also informed me that a TS SCI would only take 5-7 months. Turns out that was not the case. I applied for my TS in March thinking that by the november of 2016 at the latest i would be working.  I waited, and I waited. Nothing happened, and after contacting the hiring manager all i got was: the process takes a year now, the process takes 13 months now, etc etc. I know he had no control over it, but I couldnt sit at my parent's house without doing anything for a whole year.  I applied for a job in a smaller construction company as a systems engineer thinking I would at least be getting some experience. I got the new offer and the title said office engineer. I asked the manager of the construction company about it, and he said it was just for HR to handle salary and such. I started working and turns out they put me in construction management, and never got exposure to anything i did in school. I was sad for about 2 months, but i thought i should make the best of it. I have been working here for about 6 months. The work is basically sending out bids for projects to GCs, and we mainly specialize in Electrical work (I have some electrical background but dont know much about switchgear, and automatic transfer switches for generators). I have teaching myself every aspect of the job, and have finally started making sense of the components. However the work is extremely dull. 

Now after months of working at a different job, I heard back from an investigator and got interviewed. Then a new hiring manager from the defense contractor contacted me, and told me the old hiring manager left the company and that he would like to bring me in. Soon after that i heard from him about a week later that my security clearance went through, and Im cleared. He gave me dates to start and be on boarded. I thought about staying in my current employment but i dont feel excited about the work and i dont feel like i fit in even after 6 months. Im ecstatic and want to move on with my career but dont want to leave my current employment without something concrete. I have the old offer that was signed in 2016, but im not sure if thats as good as a brand new offer. How do i transition from my current company to the new company?

38,How long did it take you to make a meaningful contribution to your company?,1498595864,"The reason I'm asking is because I'm a recent grad who started my first full time job about three and a half weeks ago. It is a pretty small consulting firm that specializes in wastewater treatment, and there is only one other electrical engineer at the company I can go to for technical questions. 

The structure of the company is pretty flat, so distribution of work is a bit confusing to me. Every engineer has a few ongoing projects that they are responsible for, and so far I've been dabbling in a few without much focus or learning any single one in depth. Last week and the week before I was primarily working on site lighting plans for one of the projects. I completed them with heavy guidance from the other EE guy. I thought I did a decent job, considering I've never touched on any of this stuff in school. Now it has now been a few days since I've actually *done* anything or made any real progress. I approached the other electrical engineer a few times asking if there was something I could work on, and instead of letting me dive right into things or giving me a hands-on assignment, he keeps telling me to read over a bunch of documents so I can understand how things are done in industry. Today, he cc'd me in an email to our boss for revisions that he recently made to a draft, and when I went to go talk to him, he quickly told me that he only sent it to me as an ""FYI"" and he doesn't need anything from me.  He seems reluctant to let me do anything. I understand that I'm a beginner, but how else am I supposed to learn?

I'm concerned that my progress is slower than it should be. Am I doing something wrong? I had assumed that I would be acquiring my assignments from the senior EE guy and working closely with him, but should I be communicating with my boss for assignments instead? Last time I spoke to my boss, he told me that if I had any questions, I should ask the EE person. So I thought it was implied that the EE person would be the one telling me what he needs me to assist him in. 

I'm not sure if I just need to be patient, and the whole ""reading over documents"" is just part of the learning process, or if I really need to do something differently/be more proactive in asking for assignments.

The specific destroyer i'm thinking of modeling it after is the [Fletcher class](http://www.pwencycl.kgbudge.com/images/F/Fletcher_class__schematic_full.jpg).

Now for the questions:

* Making a less wide, but longer hull will compromise hull stability when the sail is taking winds from the side, do you think it would be practical to compensate for this with a longer/heavier keel?

* For the required length/mass of the keel, can i assume that the boat will rotate around the center of mass of the hull, and do a moment balance considering the force from the wind on the sail, and the mass of the keel?

* Would bulging out the hull [like in this rough sketch](http://i.imgur.com/bsQ3fw4.jpg) be a way to help improve stability against rolling?

* what other considerations do you think i am missing? Is my concept just so far off i shouldnt even consider it?

- Vacuum in the bottles
- There should be a way of knowing how much liquid is left in the bottles.

Given the size of the insulators on the transformer, it seems like it wouldn't be trivial to to isolate such a high potential section of the network through switching every couple of weeks just to mow the lawn, or would it?

57,Need help negotiating salary for my first engineering job (2 years out of college)?,1498537743,"Hi all,
So I have an electrical engineering degree. I started my first job out of college about two years ago, which wasn't a traditional engineering role and paid a bit less according to salary.com (66.5k instead of the average of 68k).

I've now received a job offer for which the listing asked for a MS in EE and and a year experience in a niche field. I'm working on my MS and have been working in a related field since I graduated.

I asked for 88k and other things (stocks, vacation, sign-on) but their initial offer was 65k. They then came back with 70k +5k sign on. I countered with 85k today, and the HR rep said that this is still a big gap on salary and we may have to part ways but that he'll run it by upper management. I had initially given a range of mid-high 80s before I was interviewed, so I asked him why this is such a big difference and he said that he wasn't sure why it was never addressed but that they really liked my experience. He cited that their local salary surveys show I should be in the range they are offering, and that they can not offer me more than people working there 5 years who make in the 70-80k range.

What doesn't make sense to me is that this position (according to salary.com) pays between 75-85k for someone with two years experience. I also have multiple friends in the geographical area with the same degree who started out of college in low 70s, and they're not even offering me that. The one person I know who has the most similar job to this (same title and industry, different company) is making low 90s on contract (so no benefits). This is also with a fairly well known company (most people have heard of them) so I don't know what gives? Are they really just underpaying their engineers that badly or are they just screwing me offer? I don't get this?

I don't want them to pull the offer because I'm excited to move into a more traditional engineering role, and this job really aligns well with my career goals. I just feel disappointed and want to get paid market rate.

82,I'm wanna make a Lipo battery pack out of 18650 cells from an old powerbank. Need advice,1498474735,"My plan is to harvest 4 or 6 cells from a powerbank or two, but the powerbank that I'm planning to use has 5 cells and I was wondering if I could use a cell from another powerbank? Must the capacities be the same? Because from what I understand all 18650 cells are 3.7v (healthy ones at least). 

From what I understand from my Physics class, (I'm 16 and in high school btw), two batteries in series, doubles the voltage and two batteries in parallel doubles the capacity(charge) . So based on that, I'll make 2 units of 2 cells in parallel and then connect them in series. That way I have double the voltage and capacity of a single 18650 cell. Is that correct or am I totally wrong? I'll be using a multimeter to check the voltages. 

I also plan to connect a balance lead with 3 prongs(since it's a 2s), 1 to ground and 1 to each cell. I've got the wiring diagram from this website : https://www.offshoreelectrics.com/lipo.php. The settings I've used there were 2s for the series option and 2p for the parallel connection. They also help with the wiring diagram for the balance lead. 

I plan to use the pack with an ESC to control a harddrive motor. I want to regulate the esc output using a servo tester. 

So, as a summary, these are my questions;

 1. Is there a flaw in my general plan? 

 2. What is the minimum voltage of an 18650 cells before their wasted?

 3. Is it safe to mix cells(potentially different capacities) from different powerbanks? 

 4. Is it safe to use a Battery Voltage Monitor( https://banggood.app.link/uYVHZOORhE ) while using the battery to prevent over discharging. 

 5. Is it safe to balance charge a pack like this using a balance charger like this; https://banggood.app.link/KhmxHpIRhE and can it be used to test the capacity of the cells? 

 6. Can I use a servo tester to controller the speed of the esc? 

 7. What gauge wiring should i use for the LiPo output? Is 14AWG enough? 

 8. What is the maximum draw from the pack? Does it depend on the cells I use? 

 9. Is a 30A esc sufficient?
10. Are there any dangers with using a cheap esc? I'm talking 5USD cheap.

* What is your average workload?

* What is the work environment like? Would you recommend a big company or a small one?

* Why did you choose this profession? Was it worth it?

* If you had to do it again, what would you do differently?

* Are there any companies you recommend or would avoid?

Quite frankly, I'm terrified of actually looking for a career in this field. I'm afraid of finding that I will be bogged down with delays and terrible management to the point where I dread work. Or I find a place where people are happy to be there but the workload gives me 6 day weeks with 12 hour days. 

Honestly I just want to be happy with whatever I choose. And I'm not confident I'll choose correctly. I want to be treated well by my employer and not be so overworked I can't have a life out of the office. I know thats asking for alot, and I have no idea where to start. 

Thanks for the help guys. Really any advice you may have will help. No matter how small. I'm just tired of giving myself anxiety attacks over it.",AskEngineers,Joman101_2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6jbntt/any_advice_for_an_aspiring_aerospace_engineer/
2,"Being that human blood is (supposedly) substantially cheaper than printer ink on a per-volume basis, how hard would it be to make a printer that uses blood to print?",1498344732,"I don't know if I should ask this here, on /r/askscience, or /r/morbidquestions, or elsewhere, so I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for this kind of out-there hypothetical.

Basically, it is an often-cited statistic that human blood (at 1500 USD per gallon) is cheaper than black printer ink (at 2700 USD per gallon), which naturally leads to jokes about using blood in place of printer ink. Regardless if the veracity of said statistic, I'm asking if it would be at all practical, or possible, to make a printer that uses Human blood as the ""ink"".

3,x-post with r/chemicalengineering - Partial Retirement Lifestyle as a chemical engineer?,1498344283,"Since this sub is more populated than /r/ChemicalEngineering, I figured I'd cross-post my question here.

I am looking to retire between 45 and 50 if possible. Both my girlfriend and I would like to do this (she's a process engineer as well) and both have the mindset of living below our means and retiring early. We've been together for several years and are somewhat ahead of schedule compared to where we thought we'd be in regards to this. Hurray for Houston's low cost of living.
However, paying insurance is a looming expense on the horizon and Medicare doesn't seem at all to be guaranteed once we reach our golden years.
My question is, does anyone know of chemical engineer type roles that can be done on a part-time basis or preferably know anyone who does this? The main reason I would be hesitant of full retirement that young is the cost of insurance.
I've asked around and it doesn't seem like it's that common in the company I work for. Basically, someone that works 20 - 30 hours a week (or less), with insurance doing engineering type work. Pay isn't necessarily a huge deal but having someone cover insurance would be a major plus and I'd think it would prevent at least one or both of us from being bored just sitting at home between times where we'd travel.",AskEngineers,Willskydive4food,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6jb0um/xpost_with_rchemicalengineering_partial/

7,High School Student Seeking Help For Science Project,1498337280,"For a science competition I have to build a small, compact hovercraft that is about the same size as a shoe box. The goal of the project is to make the device move across a track and reach a certain distance in a specific amount of time. These values are different for each competition too. For example, the target distance and target time may be 1.7 meters in 15 seconds for one competition, and 0.9 meters in 27 seconds for the next competition. Because of this, I need to be able to alter the speed of the hovercraft to meet the requirements. However, I ran into some technical problems and I was wondering if anyone could provide a solution.

The hovercraft works by using two fans. The first fan directs air downwards, which supplys lift to the vehicle and decreasing the friction between the device and the floor. The second fan directs air toward the back of the device, which pushes the device foward. 

Here's where we run into some problems. For any object, the force of friction is always greater when the object is still than when the object is in motion. This is why it may be difficult to get a sofa moving by pushing it, but once you get it moving it becomes a lot easier. The same is true for the hovercraft. Once I set the hovercraft down on the track, it doesn't move because friction is holding in place. However, if I give the device a slight push, it travels along the track without a problem. 

I need to find a way to give the device this ""slight push"" without actually touching it (pushing yhe device is a clear violation of rules). So, What I am looking for is a way to give the hovercraft a ""boost"" of speed for maybe 1 or 2 seconds just so that it's able to overcome the friction and start moving. This could be done by increasing the voltage slightly for that small amount of time and then decreasing immediately after. I am unable to to make the vehicle run at full power right from the start as the battery drains extremely quickly and I need to be able to run the device multiple times at the same competition (you aren't allowed to charge in between runs). Also, I can't decrease the voltage because you aren't allowed to touch or interfere with device while it's in motion. I know you could possibly accomplish this with a microcontroller but the use of integrated circuits are not allowed in this competition. I was thinking I could use a timer or a capacitor of some sort but I have very limited knowledge on what they do or how to use them.

I work as an audio engineer. Tonight I noticed I was getting a lot of RF interference on my wireless mics, despite them being off.

After ruling out other wireless sources, I listened to the noise and discovered it roughly followed the bass player.

Commence troubleshooting. I replace the DI box, no luck, after the set I keep the bassist around and swap the head and still use his bass to rule out a fault in his equipment. Works fine through new amp. Ok it must be the amp. Pull the amp, show ends I begin inspection. I rig it up to receive signal from my console which is by our wireless rack. I send pink noise through it and start cranking the volume while keeping an eye on my RF rack. Lo and behold, it starts going crazy. After more inspection. I can hear something in a tube physically oscillating. The amp is an Ampeg SVT-VR. The preamp tubes are (2)12AU7, (1)12AX7, and (6)6550.

Unfortunately hiring freeze came and froze out my position so I have been applying like mad and trying to reach out to my network and expand as I go along.

It has been a year since I got my degree.  I am becoming very concerned that when interviewers look at me they'll see this gap and without any internships to back up my resume they'll know I have no professional experience and only an EIT to show for it.  I feel I'm perpetually stuck in this loop and no one seems to want me. 

I've decided I want to try to become more marketable by taking adult classes in my field to expand my knowledge and even taking on smaller jobs such as tutoring but I feel like I am sidetracking myself.  My question is how are you guys dealing with the fact when you have no professional experiences and very little calls coming back?

42,MSEE vs. second Bachelors (BSEE) without experience?,1498176942,"Hello,

I checked the FAQ, and  there are a few past posts about similar situations, but I didn't find the answers to a few specific questions.

I recently graduated with a degree in Physics/Astronomy from a state school (unremarkable in physics, but very good astro program; probably not relevant now, of course), originally with the intent to pursue a research career in astronomy.

I didn't quite appreciate just how bad the odds are for that career path until now, and I'd like to revert back to my original plan, which was to pursue a career in ECE (I'm particularly interested in embedded systems, but I develop passions for tech subjects easily). I'm still technically an accepted student at the University with an incomplete ECE program on my record.

The advisors in both departments during my undergrad assured me that I wouldn't have much trouble getting a position in engineering should grad school plans change, but so far I'm finding that they've overstated their case. I have a decent GPA (3.44), but the research and department jobs I did during undergrad aren't very transferable to engineering jobs (except for some programming; a lot of Python, some C/C++, and a tiny bit of Fortran), and I don't have much in the way of connections.

I'm weighing two options now:

MSEE: I met with an advisor at my former university (its ECE program is ranked ~40-50ish, if it makes a huge difference) a few days ago. I was told that based on my GPA and coursework I would be accepted if I applied, with a guaranteed two-year scholarship covering half of tuition (I currently work at a call center; the pay isn't great, but I live modestly enough in a low CoL area that I would be able to pay the other half without taking out any loans), but I'd have to take around 5 undergrad ECE classes as background coursework.

Second BS: The physics degree covers a lot of the pre-reqs for the BSEE, but I'd have to take an additional two years of classes. I know I won't qualify for Pell grants, but I will qualify for Federal loans (my credit score is high enough that I should be able to get a private loan without much difficulty, should it come to that). If I kept my GPA as it is now or higher, I'd be eligible for an accelerated MS afterward (which I'd probably wait to act on, to see if I could get a job that would pay for it later).

Both have a similar time investment, and I had a few questions related to each option:

MSEE: Do companies hire people with an MS but no experience, or will having the MS but no prior work in engineering make me look overqualified for entry level positions? I know there are some people here who did an engineering MS after a physics BS; if you're reading this, how long did it take to catch up to those who had the full knowledge base of someone with a BS in your discipline?

BSEE: In some industries, having two bachelor's degrees looks bad (looking like a perpetual student is seldom good), and can detract from one's ability to get work. Is electrical/computer engineering one of those?

43,How do you keep track and organize research conducted for a new project?,1498172064,"Hello,

I am a senior electrical engineering undergraduate student and have recently started my first internship at a national research lab.

By and large, I understand the broad strokes of the project I have been assigned (good news). However, there is a substantial amount of additional research that I am conducting in order to get up to the point of being able to contribute to the team. I have spent my first week reading a variety of journals/articles/textbook entries in an attempt to fill the knowledge gap.

This is working, sort of. I'm at the point of approaching two dozen articles that I need to be fairly familiar with and am no where near the end. I am concerned that I will begin confusing facts/forgetting key points. I have attempted to annotate the PDFs, but this seems cumbersome and decentralized. The variety of papers and formats also do no lend themselves to my typical academic note-taking approach.

46,"Is the ""critical speed"" of a ballscrew/leadscrew the same as ""whip""?",1498165715,"This came up recently at work and I'm trying to get my head around it. I understand a supported beam will have a first resonance frequency roughly in the shape of a half-sine; basically, nodes at each support with an anti-node in the middle. This happens as a result of the material properties and doesn't matter if it's rotating or not.

I can also see in my head a separate phenomenon that's caused by rotating, where as a shaft increases in velocity it transitions from rotating along the center of the profile (i.e., the neutral axis, shaped as a caternary between the supports) and starts rotating along an imaginary line connecting the two supports.

Another way to look at this would be to say that the position of maximum compressive stress goes from being the top of the beam (staying the same in global coordinates but moving around the axis in an axis coordinate frame) to being the same spot on the beam (but rotating in the global coordinate frame).

Looking around online I only see discussion of the critical speed of the ballscrew being its resonant frequency, and making sure  not to hit that frequency. It seems to me that the two things are separate phenomenon, similar to the way column buckling differs from compressive failure.

Are those phenomenon the same thing? It would seem to me that a resonating beam would be a function of the spring rate of the material transferring strain back and forth, and it doesn't seem like that's the same phenomenon happening when a beam ""whips""... but my research so far seems to suggest there's only the one failure mode.",AskEngineers,BScatterplot,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6iwirk/is_the_critical_speed_of_a_ballscrewleadscrew_the/

I work for a railway and I've noticed phantom grounds show up fairly often, but I have no idea what causes them. 

Maybe there is a different term for it, as a Google search gives me zero relevant information. 

To check if our batteries have a short to ground, we will connect a meter to ground then look for voltage on either end of a battery bank. Ideally, there will be 0 volts. 

Sometimes, you will see some voltage (say, 2 V on a 15 V scale). So, you drop the scale to 3 V, and the needle doesn't move. Now it's showing about half a volt. Drop the scale to 0.6 V, needle still doesn't move, showing about 0.1 V. Take your lead off the battery, and the needle goes to zero. Our instructions tell us to ignore these readings and proceed with other tests like there is no ground. 

What causes this? Are there ways to prevent this from happening?

What I don't get is what kind of wave it is. Is it a positive or a negative pressure wave? We know the valve side is a closed end, so that makes a positive pressure wave that goes back up the intake. When it reaches the other end it gets reflected back but how? It's an open ended pipe so shouldn't the wave that gets reflected back be a negative pressure one? Wouldn't that create a lower pressure area in the intake valve? Or is the lower pressure helping suck in more air and that creates the super charging effect? Does the wave instead bounce off the plenum  and thus a positive pressure wave is reflected back and reaches the valve when it opens creating higher pressure which pushes more air in? 
If so how does it work with truly open ended intakes that have no plenum or airbox?????",AskEngineers,PckMan,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6imyts/question_about_resonance_supercharging_automotive/

80,[Photonics/Electronics] How does a coaxial cable's impedance influence the way instruments measure tension (specifically when a photosensor gives a tension).,1498058095,"I’m trying to understand how instruments measure tension.  I’m running an experiment that involves a few different photo-detectors, but they all give me a response in A/W.   This confuses me because the output is measured in volts using an oscilloscope or a multimeter.  I understand that the coaxial cable used to bridge the connection between the sensor and the osci has a 50 ohm impedance, and you can use a terminator resistor to cut the impedance in half (thus enabling more current to pass).  And I know that most multimeters and oscilloscopes have a big 1 megaohm resistance that means they won’t interfere with whatever it is they’re measuring (in most circumstances).

But, what exactly does the 50 ohm impedance do?  Is it in parallel or in series with the oscilloscope.   For example, in this picture:  http://i.imgur.com/asS95cS.png Let's say R4 is the big 1 megaohm of the oscilloscope, and the tension source is the thing we are observing.  Where would the 50 ohm coax cable be?  Is it R2 or R3?

In my current setup I have a 400 mW beam going through an attenuator and into a sensor.  The attenuator says it should bring the beam strength down to 0.28 mW (cutting the beam's intensity down to 0.07%) and I want to make sure that’s actually what I’m getting.  The sensor outputs around 1.2 volts.  And in the specifications for the sensor I have this graph.  http://i.imgur.com/Rt8sgX8.png
(reference taken from ThorLabs DET10A-manual.pdf  https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=DET10A )

I’m using a 1064 nm laser, so the response here is around 0.03 A/W.  Assuming my attenuator is working well, and I am getting a 0.28 mW beam at the sensor aperture, that would mean I’m getting 0.0084 mA.  For a tension of 1.2 v, that’s an impedance of 142 Kohms.  That seems... odd, it’s not the 50 ohms of the cable, and it’s not the 1 megaohm of the oscilloscope.  

I actually spoke to ThorLabs technical support and straight up asked them, what is the response on this sensor in V/mW, but they were very evasive or they didn’t understand what I was asking them.  I can tell from the beam size (observed using a revealing card) that it’s probably around 0.1 mW to 10 mW, but beyond that I’m not sure.  Is there a straightforward way of determining the beam intensity in mW, or am I missing something needed to find it?

EDIT:
Since I believe it's pertinent, I feel I should add that for now I'm using a continuous beam, no pulses.  So the frequency is zero.  Eventually I'd like to try pulsing the laser, but I want to get a handle on the basic functionality first.",AskEngineers,PhilippeASP,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6img5e/photonicselectronics_how_does_a_coaxial_cables/

* Carbon Fiber rod with tightly cinched O-rings?***

The bracket materials are not set in stone either.

18,How would you make a low friction roller mechanism for a trackball mouse?,1497919368,"In case anyone hasn't used one, a [trackball](http://www.kbdmania.net/xe/files/attach/images/6474008/345/097/008/c38943da50a7ca0656c3efcab72f5aa6.JPG) is a type of input device or mouse where instead of moving the entire device, you move a sphere whose movements are interpreted to move a cursor or something like that.  I've been working on a trackball design for a while but there's one part I think the vast majority of existing trackballs need improvement on.  The system that allows the ball to move freely within the socket.  It's not that existing trackballs don't do this, it's just that they don't do it as well as I hope they could.  From what I've seen, there are only two options that exist right now -- spherical non-spinning contact points to keep the ball in place (made from steel, synthetic ruby, or some kind of ceramic I believe) and mechanical rollers (like [these](http://www.madox.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170616_223526-COLLAGE.jpg) or [this](http://kabinett.homepage.t-online.de/knowldge/stick/pics/tbopen1.jpg)).  Another option although not used in any commercial trackball is [ball transfer units](http://www.statewidebearings.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Mini-units-group-web-image.jpg) (see the one on the far right in the first picture).  These come with the downside of being difficult or impossible to clean when they begin to spin less freely as well as being made for much larger loads (so they aren't as low friction as they could be).  Then there are more theoretical options like levitating the ball on a cushion of air or water like a [kugel fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugel_fountain), which would be great but there are so many reasons that wouldn't be practical.  Right now I'm considering something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/vGJVwOR.png) where the ball is being pushed up by a magnet into a pair of retaining rollers -- when the user puts their finger on the ball to move it, the ball will be pushed away from the retaining rollers and have little to no contact with the socket (depending on the strength and distance from the magnet(s)).  I'm wondering if anyone can propose other methods to go about this (or if that is even a viable option).

32,Google's HDR+ technology using dual cameras,1497872220,"Hey guys, just been thinking about phone cameras lately as I've got a new GS7 coming in (GS8 didn't wow me).

Google's HDR+ technology, from what I've read, takes 9 photos at a lower exposure and uses an algorithm to match and combine them. The idea is to reduce noise and improve detail, as apparently adding/averaging certain values of multiple photos is better than simply taking one of longer exposure; plus you don't need to hold the phone as still while snapping.

**My thoughts are:** would it be possible to have two of the same camera stacked side-by-side, similarly to how many other phones are designed these days, to basically double the number of photos you can take in the same amount of time, or halve the time it takes to reach the same number (ish, as it's 9)? It would also make taking videos a lot easier to apply the HDR+ algorithm to. Not to mention all the other benefits of having two sensors, such as faux bokeh effects.

If so, wouldn't this be *hugely* advantageous on the PIxel 2? Or any other phone for that matter?

35,"Storing surfboards on poles going across a garage, structurally sound?",1497833937,"Hey all.  I'm trying to brainstorm for ways to store 3 surfboards in a garage.  It's a small single-car garage (likely built back when cards were fairly small), and ideally, I would be able to retrieve these surfboards without having to move the car out of the garage.  This makes mounting on the walls hard because I need to put the surfboards in a place where they won't interfere with opening doors, in which case it will be difficult to retrieve them without moving the car.

One of the ideas I had was to install a couple metal poles across the width of the garage underneath the garage door runners and store all three across.  This would allow me to open up the door, and simply reach up and pull whichever surfboard off the poles (with some sort of roller over the metal pole).  

I have no idea if this is structurally sound.  I would be drilling some sort of flange into the walls of my garage, but I'm still hanging things across a fair length of a pole with no support in the middle, so I would imagine storing a surfboard in the middle of the pole could be questionable.  One of the surfboards is quite light, maybe 5 lbs,  but the rest would be about 15 lbs (two longboards).

So, how doable is this?  I've created a diagram with the idea:

I have read about escape hoods that promise to filter out toxic gases. But would there even be enough oxygen in the air if the stairwell is already full of smoke? 

What about rappelling or fast roping down the side of the building presuming that side is not on fire? Some training would be required as well as a place to anchor the rope but other than that it seems pretty solid idea to me. 

I have also found a parachute based escape system but this doesn't seem like a good option in my opinion. It is basically BASE jumping and that does not seem very risk free. You could land badly, hit your head, and die.

Before you ask, I've already checked all of my textbooks and exhausted my google-fu. Any help or even suggestions of search-terms I may not have tried would be greatly appreciated. 

1.  Imagine dunking your straw into a glass of water and covering the top with your finger. You can then withdraw the straw, and the water will (usually) stay inside! I'm looking for some sort of derivation or discussion of stability criteria for this condition. For example, is there a dimensionless number that relates the relative densities of the two interfacing fluids (water and air in this example) to the surface tension of the interface, the contact angle at the tubing , and the diameter of the tubing? Ideally I'm looking for some criterion that says for a given viscosity, density, surface tension, contact angle, don't exceed a particular diameter. There is *some pretty intense* discussion of this [here](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~ajm8/Hydrostab/kelvin.pdf) in the section ""Fluids in a Rigid Cylinder,"" but they are just somebody's course notes and therefore cannot be cited in a technical document, and some terms are not explained. For example, what is ka_min? The result doesn't make sense to me. 

2.  For bonus points, how does this situation change if the tubing is suddenly moved vertically up or down, or is already moving and suddenly stops? Or does it change at all?

3.  I'm also looking for some sort of closed-form expression relating capillary forces to pressure-driven flow. For example, how do you describe the moving boundary of the air-water interface if you suck on or blow into the straw?

62,Is it possible to always determine a DC or brushless motor by turning the shaft by hand to 'feel' the type of resistance?,1497719881,"I'm purchasing a new desk fan which claims it is brushless, but I have my suspicions (I don't want to open up the motor compartment however).

My limited experience shows that with standard AC (or brushed?) motors, turning the shaft by hand is either stiff (like with the lawnmower or old desk fan), or it turns easily but at a constant level of resistance.

Whilst with a DC or brushless motor (e.g: Battery lawnmower or computer fan), I find that turning the shaft feels like a resistance which alternates between easy to turn, and slightly harder to turn. As If the magnets are attracting/repelling at different strengths throughout the turn.

Is this always the case? And if so, is it the DC motor type which produces this latter sensation, or the brushless type (which AFAIK can be either DC or AC) ?",AskEngineers,twinbee,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6hul2j/is_it_possible_to_always_determine_a_dc_or/

66,Three Phase Electric Power Accidents,1497704438,"Hello


I'm asking this question here because i don't know a better platform for this kinds of questions. I assume that most people here are american, whereas i'm interested in the stiuation for a home powersupply in my country (Austria), tough as far as my understanding goes the slight differences in voltage and other parameters shouldn't matter that much from a the theoretical perspective. I have only dealt with this stuff in german, so I'm not familiar with the english terminology all that much.
The base voltages are 230V for a single phasewire and 400V for rotary current where i live.


I'll refer to the following image from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_basic_3-phase_configurations.svg


I have three main questions:


1) What happens if i touch one of the connectors in the delta configration?


2) What happens if i touch two of the connectors in the delta configration?


3) What happens if i touch two phasewires in the Y configuration?


As far as i know in a typical socket installation if i touch the phasewire, the current will go trough my body and then exit my body and flow towards ground in whichever way the lowest resistance allows it. I this situation 230V AC (in Austria) will flow trough my body and my body will be exposed to whichever current this results in given my bodys resistance. The Residual-current device should detect the issue in a split second and turn the system off to prevent further harm.


at question 1) Is there a closed circuit in this situation? Does anything happen at all. If so what circuit gets closed, and how much current will flow trough my body?


at question 2) I assume now my body would basically act as a resistor and take the full hit, until the safety devices intervene? My body will have to take ~400V (in Austria) until that happens.


at question 3) In the event that just a single phasewire gets touched this should behave exactly the same as touching the phaswire of an ordinary socket, so everything i have written above should also apply here. However what happens if i touch two phasewires? How much current will flow trough my body and for how long?

87,Automotive valves vs General Valves,1497605631,"Greetings to everyone on this sub.

I have a question about the difference between solenoid valves in automotive industry and general. To be more precise, we are building a home appliance and we require high-pressure (200 bar/3000 pis) shut-off valves. Initially, we wanted to use NGV 3.1 certified automotive valves. However, our certification agency insists that we use UL-429 valves. This is quite unfortunate, as they are either under qualified to do the job or overqualified. The former is self-explanatory, but  the latter shoots their prices tens of times higher than what we could pay for an automotive valve. 

So far, the certification's agency argument was that the automotive valves would not comply with National Electrical Code (NFPA 70). And I get that, though I do not possess the standards. However, I was wondering, what is there to comply to? All valves are 24V DC and controlled by a ECU, which itself is connected to the residential power network through a power supply.  The device itself is placed outside of the house. 
So, considering the all above, is there a real technical reason, that NGV 3.1 shut off valves would not comply with the NEC, which may prove hazardous in some way, or it's more of a legal question that may be debated?

I was wondering if, from a technical perspective, this is more efficient than a single large rotor.
The way I see it, you'd need a certain amount of force to get off the ground no matter what you use. So that force is constant.

Will 100 small rotors provide the same force as one large rotor with the same input?

There's probably some minimal loss in each rotor because some energy is lost as heat. Then there's also the issue of thrust to weight, I wonder if all these small rotors combined weigh more than 4 large rotors.

6,Staging central chilled water coils vs. glycol coils,1497558967,"Hey all, I work mostly with healthcare systems trying to find energy savings falling through the cracks. I've had this opportunity come up but have been discussing some drawbacks with on-site guys.

&amp;nbsp;

A large AHU serving surgery has two sets of coils, first one fed by a central chiller plant (kW/ton in the 0.7 range) and a second coil fed by a seperate glycol unit (kW/ton in the 1.1 range). I was thinking if we can stage the cooling so it tries to satisfy with the chilled water, and then switches to the glycol only if necessary, we could use the more efficiently produced cooling first before using the ""expensive"" glycol.

&amp;nbsp;

BUT, the onsite guys have come back with ""the CHW doesn't get cold enough to take out the humidity."" Now, psychrometrically, if you're cooling air down to 52 degrees, it's going to follow the same path regardless of what's in the coils. 

&amp;nbsp;

What I'm wondering is, **is there any kind of strange boundary layer affect on the coils that would result in more dehumidification from colder coils, even if the air temperature on the other side is the same**.

The new schematics need to be sent out on Monday so he's asking that I have my part completed by tomorrow. For some background, I am a recent grad with a bachelor's in electrical engineering and just started work last week. Today, my boss had me download a software application called Visual 3D which is used for lighting system designs. He gave me an AutoCAD file for the structure of the building, and my task is to import it to the Visual software and make decisions on where to position the lights, what lights to use, etc. I believe that if I enter the necessary quantitative data (such as room dimensions, reflectances, etc), the software will make suggestions for me on where to place the lights. However, this concept is COMPLETELY new to me! I have NEVER learned about this lighting stuff in my coursework. 

I have the dimensions for length and width of the room, but aside from that, I have no other information or specs. I'm feeling overwhelmed and I have no fucking clue how to proceed. Since it is a small office, there's only one other EE person who could potentially help me. I spoke to him today, but he mostly just talked in generalities without telling me what to do. He gave me a piece of paper that described the steps to the lighting design process, which seemed like common sense (identify the problem, gather data, begin design, etc).

On the landing side, accelerometers could be used to detect fall speed and pack orientation to slow descent. Heat and fuel usage should be less of an issue. Thanks!

I've printed out a small prototype and while it works, the fan rotation is way too slow to be of any use. I have a couple of questions regarding the whole thing:
- Is it even possible to drive a fan fast enough using only a hand crank?
- Should I be using different kind of gears?
- Was it wrong to have all the gears on the same ""plane""? Should one gear drive a shaft of another gear rather than connecting directly?

39,"How to estimate effectiveness of a radiator given some notion of a fluid flow rate, surface area, and airflow?",1497420674,"I've been considering building a ""reverse radiator"" to cool my apartment while my AC is out. My tap water comes in around 19 °C, and while that won't bring a ton of cooling power, anything is better than sweating at 28+. My ideal case is that at the drain-end, the water would come out only a degree or two below the air temperature. 

I've thought about flowing the tap water through a few meters of ~7mm diameter copper refrigerant tubing and having a fan blow over it, but I'm not sure what length of tubing would ensure near-full heat transfer between air and water. Alternatively, aftermarket radiators for cars seem like they could work, given they are not terribly expensive and have metal fins jointed to the fluid tubes for better heat transfer.

In either case, I'm wondering if there is some way I can estimate the necessary length of tubing (or radiator area) necessary to get fairly good efficiency out of the system. Does anyone know of a way to determine this? Or have some experience with such systems that could be helpful?

Thanks!

EDIT: After digging around for some heat transfer equations, I came across this:

http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/convective-heat-transfer-d_430.html

Given an airspeed of ~10 m/s (rough estimate for a common fan) and a temperature difference of 2°C, I'd need ~75 meters of 6 mm diameter copper tubing to get a measly 100 watts of cooling power. In practice, the ∆T will be larger for most of the tubing, but it seems like this is going to be more difficult than I thought. I thought perhaps that the equation for heat transfer rate is off in some large way, but a handful of other, more sophisticated equations for convective heat transfer yield similar results.

Now that I have an equation, I should be able to better gauge the size/length of radiator that I'll need.

47,Regenerative Brake + Electromagnetic Brake = Speed regulation?,1497402249,"I live in a huge hilly areas and I'm curious as to some novel ways to slow down human powered transportation (bicycles and longboards) that get rid of the drawbacks of some of the more conventional ones.

Something I was curious about was the feasibility of using electromagnetic braking using an induction rotor to power it off of the rotation of the wheels. This seems like it should be torquey enough to keep me from having to take a lot of hills at 50mph, but not have to set my skateboard wheels, brake pads, etc. from starting on fire.

The problem is that I don't have much of a background in this area of electro-mechanics, and most of the available information is for heavy automobiles and trains.

The back is made up of 2 different Gorilla Glass types, with one surrounding the cameras in the top center and then the rest of the glass surrounding that. I have asked a few people who had the glass break if their phones had had any large heat changes right before breaking and was told a few times that it happened after taking it off of a car mount and then placing it in their pocket and going inside a building. 

I guess I am really asking if smart phones or similar devices would actually experience the types of temperatures required in order to have the class expand dramatically in order to shatter? Does the use of 2 different strengths of glass increase the chances of one section of glass breaking spontaneously if one part was hot enough to expand and then the other part was not hot enough? 

Corning states that the types of classes can be between 0.4mm – 1.3mm thick. The coefficient of expansion for the smaller glass over the camera (Gorilla Glass 4) is 86.9 x 10-7/˚C (0 ˚C - 300 ˚C) and the coefficient of expansion for the rest of the glass back (Gorilla Glass 5) is 78.8 x 10-7 /°C (0-300°C). Is that enough of a difference to cause something to shatter?

86,Can saturated steam be used effectively to drive a turbine?,1497284784,"I am performing a study to determine the best way to use excess steam produced by a combined heat and power plant. The plant uses exhaust from a natural gas engine to produces saturated 100 psi steam for use in the campus steam loop, however during the warmer months the engine still runs but the exhaust is diverted as there is little steam demand.

I would like to use the excess heat to produce the 100 psi steam and then use that steam in a turbine to drive the compressor of a steam driven chiller or a small generator. I have been told by vendors and from searching google that this works in practice but I am confused as to how this can be effective from a thermodynamics standpoint.

Assuming that the work done by the turbine is equal to change in enthalpy of the inlet and outlet steam then 100 psi steam (2768 kJ/kg) being reduced to 1 psia in a condensing turbine (2571 kJ/kg) provides little work (~200 kJ/kg) to the turbine compared to the latent heat required to produce the steam from condensate (~2500 kJ/kg).

From my thermo classes I had always assumed that the majority of the work provided by a turbine is from the super heating of the steam since in a real rankine cycle the outlet steam must be saturated and 100% quality to prevent condensate from forming and damaging the turbine so I am confused as to how saturated steam can be used in turbines effectively.

90,[Dynamics] Machine frame excitation/resonance,1497259770,"I have a testing rig which runs on air bearings and am testing it for issues.


It is intended to run at 4bar abs, but I find that when increasing the air pressure to all the bearings (one regulator) eventually the frame becomes excited, this happens just around 5.5bar abs. As far as I can tell, this is due to increasing the air bearing stiffness which causes excitation and resonance. This is very observable from the noise being generated.


When returning the pressure to 4bar abs however, the resonance remains. The only way to remove it is to turn off the air supply and start again. Could someone explain to me why this is? I would expect that returning to the normal pressure would eventually dampen the frame so it falls out of the resonant region.

95,Security Clearance with Issues from my Past,1497249688,"Hello Reddit, 

I have a question about obtaining security clearance. 

I just graduated with a BSEE and got a job offer with a government defense contractor. 

The interviewer mentioned that I would need security clearance but did not specify whether it was secret or top secret. 

Some of my past activities have got me feeling really uneasy. 

I used to use weed regularly from about 2007 - 2011. During this period, there was even a span of time that I was selling it (just small scale stuff only to friends). I stopped the selling stuff, but my marijuana use continued sporadically until 2012 or 2013, when I completely stopped. I haven't touched it at all since I stopped.

Ever since I dropped my weed habit, I've completely turned my life around. I've been employed the entire time, have no debts and have excellent credit. I have a completely clean criminal record. Also possibly relevant: I have a Chinese girlfriend (she's not a US citizen but is here legally). 

After researching this issue, I fully intend to be totally candid during the entire process. However, I am extremely worried about getting a denial. It's been eating me from the inside and I can't even enjoy the two week break I get until my start date at my job. I hate to think that some poor decisions from when I was a teenager could come back and haunt me like this. I've worked incredibly hard to get to where I am at and the thought of denial is heartbreaking. 

Is there anything I can do at this point? Is this as big of a deal as I'm making it seem? What are my chances at obtaining a clearance? 

Thanks to all who are willing to help. Sorry if I am polluting this subreddit with my baggage. 

Best wishes.

This is a 2 wire motor with an earth, and I initially measured the resistance across the winding to be 235R (shortly after removing power). I checked again some minutes later and it was 230R, and a few minutes after that it was 220R. 

I just want to know if this is the correct resistance, or if the insulation is starting to go between some of the wraps..

My math tells me if its rated at 1 amp, it should be 115 watt, 2 amp should be 230 watt and 12 amp should be 1380 watt. If it was in fact 2 watt, then the current should be about 17mA. So first question, why doesnt the voltage, current and power rating add up?

Second, can I simply calculate the proper resistance from the ratings? ie. 115V/0.017A = 6.7K Ohms, so then my 230R measurement would say that this motor is gone?

While I've found out about some basics, I would really appreciate it if someone who knows something about it could tell me a couple of things.

1) How much isopropanol is actually used for making semiconductors? is the relationship more ""per dollar"" of SC or ""per wafer"" of silicone? Additionally, does use increase with smaller architectures (as there might be more thorough cleaning and drying required)?

2) Is the IPA recycled at all? I would assume that compared to the giant cost of a semiconductor plant, recycling facilities are dirt cheap, but it would also make sense to get someone to recycle all the nasties at the same time - or is IPA just too cheap to be worth recycling?

3) From what I know, the IPA purity required for SC manufacture above 99.8%, is this correct? For anyone who knows a lot about IPA, is this sort of high-grade stuff used anywhere else?

4) I have read on a 3M brochure that IPA is not useful for the cutting edge of small architectures because it can etch the silicon - this sounds like marketing wank to me, but I still would like to ask someone knowledgeable: Is IPA going to be used in the way it's used now in the future or will some other solvent that can get deeper into the nooks and crannies replace it?

33,Degree Advice: Mechatronics vs Software?,1497056206,"Hey!

I'm currently studying Mechatronics and am going through an early mid-degree crisis! I'm half way through my 2nd year and have finally started to get into what seems to be the gist of it: combining the software and hardware side of things. I'm not enjoying it as much as I had hoped and am wondering if Mechatronics is the right degree for me.

My major assignment for the semester was based around object detection and area evaluation using a LIDAR on a tilt-pan unit which we were forced to write in ANSI C. It was not enjoyable to say the least...

I really enjoy writing software (teaching myself python, java and a bit of C++ on top of the C I was taught at uni and frequently using them to just write some random hobby projects) but as soon as hardware gets added to the mix I find myself getting quite frustrated - I can no longer reliably say that the errors being encountered are entirely my fault with the possibility of dodgy hardware / hardware not doing what its expected to do. Now obviously these errors are still my fault but ... they feel less so and arent satisfying / rewarding to find, rather annoying. 

With this in mind, I am considering switching over to just doing software engineering. All of the (undergrad) mechatronics engineers I have spoken to have suggested I pick up a double degree in science, majoring in computer science to add a bit more software to my degree. This seems like a decent idea except for the fact that I would still have to complete the mechatronics side of the degree with its dreaded hardware. I could suffer through the quite archaic mechatronics units and get out the other end with no desire to ever continue in the field which makes it quite a painful waste of time.

The undergrad software engineers I have spoken to have talked about some really interesting sounding subjects which I think I would enjoy doing.

So I guess my main question is: what is actual mechatronics like? Obviously the units I am doing are very archaic and arent good representations of what its like in the industry (for the most part) but ... is it still filled with annoying hardware?

Looking for general advice/what to expect.,1497039902,"I graduated last month with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and EIT. I have my first real interview/first engineering interview on Monday for a civil design engineer for a consulting firm in the Seattle area.

Aside from school, I do not have any engineering experience.

I've never had a real interview, let alone one for an engineering job. What kind of questions should I expect? I'm assuming school will be a frequent topic as I just graduated. I had a pretty practical capstone project that will be relevant to talk about but I'm not sure how to discuss my work experience in a way that makes it sound relevant without lying or sounding fake/rehearsed.

43,Question about type and thickness of steel and aluminum,1497036061,"Hey everyone, I am new to the is subreddit, and am in high school so please excuse any of what you may consider dumb questions. 

So, for a while now I have been designing a computer case and have got to the point where I am looking at material thicknesses to make my design around so all parts fit together. 

For materials, I was thinking of doing a steel, aluminum combination for different parts. 
For those of you that are unfamiliar with computer cases, a case frame is made up of three parts. 1. A Frame. 2. Basic component support. and 3. External Aesthetic stuff. (These aren't technical terms, this is just how I have broken it own to make a little more sense for myself). The frame and sometimes basic component support is made with steel. The basic component support is sometimes made with aluminum if it isn't steel. The external aesthetic stuff, I don't care about right now. 

For the frame, I estimate that the total weight of the final product, including components, will be about 25-35 pounds. I have looked at a few other sight and some of said that 1/16"" thick should be enough but that number doesn't sound right
 For basic component support, such as fans, and HDD/SSD mounting I was thinking of using 14ga aluminum (subject to change). I am still undecided on what type of aluminum to use, but then again I don't fully understand the pros and cons of each type.


Any help would be greatly appreciated, and not just on this question, any tips for designing, fabricating would be super helpful.

54,Why is stainless rebar so uncommon in municipal reinforced concrete structures such as bridges?,1496979132,"I've wondered and inquired about this for years without a satisfactory answer. As I understand, concrete structures often fail over time due to the expansion of the iron in the common steel rebar into iron oxide which breaks up the concrete. Stainless would presumably solve that problem. How come the use of stainless rebar is so uncommon?

Points I understand:

1 - Stainless generally has lower strength per given dimension.
    Why this isn't an acceptable answer so far  -  You can just use slightly bigger rebar


2 - Stainless is more expensive
    Why this isn't an acceptable answer so far  -  The cost of a new bridge on an interstate highway, for example, is usually in the milions, not counting the danger to human life. Stainless is generally about 2.15 times the cost of steel rebar. According to my own calculations using stainless rebar adds less than 10% to the cost of a typical bridge but can extend the life of the bridge to cover the initial cost of the stainless rebar. The cost to benefit ratio is very low.


3 - Using stainless rebar requires changes in other materials and techniques
   Why this isn't an acceptable answer so far  -  It's worth adapting those things if it means ultimate savings in money and increased safety through the life of the bridge.

I'm not saying my assumptions are right. I just want to know if/why they aren't. Just to be perfectly clear, if you mention a reason why stainless is a problem, please explain why it's one that can't be overcome.",AskEngineers,LucidPlusInfinity,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6g5yaf/why_is_stainless_rebar_so_uncommon_in_municipal/

65,How complicated are home appliances and how are they designed?,1496924541,"I am interested in knowing how complicated are home appliances are to design / manufacture. I'm currently a second year MechE student. I plan to go into Manufacturing Engineering but I'm also very interested in the design of machines and machinery.

What would you have to take into account when designing a, for example, stove/oven. 

* determine temperatures needed for preparing food 

* select materials that are stable at needed temperatures and ""food-friendly"", also select materials that are not heated e.g. for the casing, handle 

* design all the elements keeping in mind the general dimensions of the whole appliance 

* perform fluid analysis for gas flow and elements that are in contact with gas 

* create the (simple?) electronics and electrics: e.g. oven stops heating when reaching a certain temperature, shuts down after timer finishes, wiring, the heating elements, general energy requirements 

* incorporate it all inside a design that looks like something you would actually buy 

* analyse wire isolation requirements and wiring 

* analyse final design for functionality and manufacturability, select paint that is suitable for these temperatures 

* calculate cost of the whole process?

For a simple hand blender: 

* start with material selection (plastic, rubber and stainless steel or inox) keeping into account the budget 

* crudely design the mechanism and calculate the lifespan of certain elements (e.g. bearing and electric motor), determine thickness of shaft 

* design the casing for manufacturability e.g. injection molding 

* design the ""blade"" and perform fluid dynamic analysis for it? 

* calculate what kind of motor it would need, calculate energy requirements, wiring and isolation 

* put it all together so that it looks like something 

* evaulate final design?

All this is done without much market research or with regards to consumer needs / wishes / constraints (price), although I know that also needs to be done. I just wish to know the general steps one would take in designing such an appliance / machine.

This is what I think needs to be done. I would like someone with more experience or knowledge to comment and correct what is wrong.

I'm an entry level plumbing engineer. My previous boss/mentor has left the company and left in my hands a client whom we focus entirely on provider SPH designs. Anyways, since I'm entry level and my supposed current boss is very busy, the CEO has been undertaking my training and reviewing the projects for this client, rightly so since its his stamp on the plans. 

My previous boss had designed systems using a single walled heat exchanger or internal coil storage tank heat exchange systems using a 50% food grade propylene glycol solution. Well, after reviewing my previous boss's designs the CEO has done some research regarding the glycol and decided against the previous designs and will not sign off on any of the designs unless they are double walled air gap designed because of health concerns regarding glycol ingestion. 

I understand the CEO's trepidation to use a non air gap design because you want to be an ethical engineer and not put consumers in danger.  But for simplicity, thermal efficiency,  and cost,  I see the advantages of internal coil. Also the health concerns about propylene glycol were about ingesting 100% propylene glycol,  5-10 gal of diluted 50% solution, even more so diluted in a 500 gal exchange tank, and with a periodical testing of the storage/exchange tank, i think those concerns can be mitigated.

76,Which is more effective for a cannon: springs in parallel or series?,1496883607,"For one of my engineering classes, we were assigned a project to build an object that can project a small steel ball (weighs less than a pound) as far as possible using ONLY two identical springs. My team believed that, *theoretically*, a parallel arrangement would be best (which I later verified with my dynamics professor). However, most other teams in our class went with series, and their balls launched significantly farther than ours (on average, about twice as far). We did the math and we concluded that the potential energy of the springs are equal in both arrangements (if you follow the simple (1/2)kx^2 equation where k is the equivalent spring constant). I asked other teams and even the professor of the class why series performed better; they didn't know. I understand this is a simple question, but I don't think it has a simple answer. You can argue design flaws may be the factor, but I am fairly certain those can be ignored. We were limited heavily on what we could build, so most teams went with simple designs that basically resembled a cannon with a base.

81,Can a diffuser allow constant flow from low pressure to higher pressure in certain situations?,1496868953,"I was recently thinking about how a diffuser takes advantage of changes in the dynamic of pressure to change pressure to velocity and vice versa.

Suppose we assume a tank that is constantly maintained at a certain lower pressure. (Perhaps another compressor), and we allow a large intake from that low pressure tank to a diffuser converting it to velocity pressure. (Non static)

THEN we convert that back into static pressure but with a smaller outtake which acts as the exhaust

Would this allow a constant flow to occur from the low pressure to the higher pressure exhaust? Lets assume the low pressure tank isn't greatly different in pressure and that it is constantly maintained at that specific pressure. And lets also assume we somehow established that initial flow from low tank out to exhaust to get it running.

87,Electric motor suggestion for reciprocating knife,1496852321,"Hi all,
I'm a little out of my element with this type of thing so hoping someone can give me some suggestions. Looking for a small electric motor to create a reciprocating knife as part of a CNC. I've used stepper motors and such, but for this application I have no need of knowing the motor position and I don't need a forward/backward ability, just the ability to control speed so I'm assuming there are better options than a stepper motor. Ideally it would go to at least 500rpm and be sturdy enough for regular use, so I don't want a little hobby motor. The plan is to use a scotch yoke (unless you have a better suggestion) to convert the rotation of the motor into a reciprocal movement (looking for at least 1/2"" to 1"" total vertical movement, but the exact distance is not that important for a knife blade). Size-wise I'm thinking something along the size of a (Nema 18 or 23) stepper motor? Any suggestions on what type of motor I should use and good sources would be much appreciated, thank you!  Power-wise anything from 5v to 110v should be fine, the plan is to have an independent power source of the motor controlled by relays.

TLDR: Building a reciprocating knife as part of a CNC build, minimum reqs of 500rpm and 1/2"" vertical movement of the knife, what is a good motor to use?  And any idea if pre-made scotch yokes (or another method of converting rotary to reciprocal) are available for purchase or do I need to make from scratch?

Watson 4 animals pull with the force of 3, and 6 - with the force of 4. So extrapolating this trend, 20 mules should pull with the force of only 6 mules or so, what means 6000 kg per mule.

1) Electrolysis using modern, efficient catalysts to produce hydrogen gas from water

2) Storage capacity for large amounts of hydrogen gas

3) Fuel cell or gas turbine to generate power from the stored hydrogen gas

Such a plant could store energy generated by solar or wind plants and release it during the night or when the wind isn't blowing.  Or, it could store energy generated when a base load plant is producing more power than the grid is demanding, and release it when demand exceeds the base load.

How efficient could this process be with current technology (energy out / energy in)?  What are the engineering problems that need to be solved to make this system viable, and could a hydrogen storage facility compete with current battery-based energy storage?  It seems to me that a hydrogen storage plant might be the best option for some use cases, because it is not limited to the storage capacity of the battery.  It can continue to produce and store energy indefinitely as long as there is tank or balloon volume, or solid or liquid storage medium to spare.

The minimum to renew my lease would be a 20% increase in rent if I renewed for 13 months, shorter is even higher and it's just nuts. The prices they want to charge would make sense for a luxury apartment in like Chicago.

I told my recruiter at the defense job, and they said that the government doesn't round up when it comes to experience. I started working my current job on September 1st 2015, and I plan on leaving here sometime in July before my lease is up. The HR recruiter said she would have to talk with the manager to find out what happens if I don't meet the 2 year requirement. She says the government does not round up, and from her email it sounds like my compensation might change or I may not get the job if  I don't have that month of experience.

I guess I was arrogant in not applying for jobs since I had accepted this offer, but I'm going to start doing that again. I only have this apartment because of my job, and it doesn't make sense to renew a lease. I'm currently in a small town with one major employer.

17,Today was my first day of work and the company didn't go over a benefits package. What should I do?,1496704643,"I graduated in December and this is my first full time job. I'm working at a pretty small company that does projects in the region concerning wastewater treatment and clean water distribution. In my interview with them a couple months ago, my manager mentioned a 401k plan as part of company benefits. About a week later, he sent me an offer via email for $55,000/yr and said that the HR lady would go over all benefits with me on my first day. Today, I didn't have any sort of new hire orientation. All the woman did was give me a W4 form and employment eligibility form to fill out. 

Also, on an unrelated note, they have both my first and last name spelled wrong in the system which weirded me out too. Now my company email is something that's a completely inaccurate reflection of my name. They have my resume and information on file so I don't know how they would have botched my name up so badly.

I know a camping kettle doesn't sound very ""engineering-ish"" but I feel that structural/materials engineers might have the best insights and experience on how to combat acid corrosion on anodized finishes, hence my posting here!

I have a ""hard anodized"" (satin blue-gray finish) camping kettle that has started to corrode and pit in a few spots inside. I believe it is due to using it to make tea with lemon juice, as I read that acidity can cause pitting in anodized finishes.

I wanted to know if there's a (food-safe) way to stop and ideally fix the pitting as the kettle is made from pretty thin gauge material and I fear it might soon spring a leak if this keeps on progressing.

We are currently working on some self branded parts and have been outsourcing to some local shops. I have a few parts on my own car and have done some small things for others, and mentioned to the guy that is heading up the new parts that I have done some pieces and asked if he would be interested in seeing them.

One is a 12 month contract as an engineer/lab tech role where I would be working with engineers doing tests on various products, collecting, graphing and interpreting test data, and talking to engineers about changes to be made to the test procedure and fixtures. Based on the interview, I definitely get the sense that they intend this to become either a permanent role or a stepping stone to other roles in the company. They also said that they are open to people taking extra responsibilities which could be an opportunity to get myself some tangential experience. The second job is a design engineer role making large systems for liquid processing in the biotech field. It's a permanent role but the primary responsibility is taking 2D process diagrams and turning them into 3D models in CAD software based on the constraints the customer provides. They said that they rarely need to do structural design or anything like that, and they typically outsource it when they do. On a side not, the first job is 30-35 minutes from where I live, and the second is 50-55. I know this shouldn't factor into the decision but I will have to make the drive every single day so I feel like I can't ignore it. They also both pay roughly the same amount. On the one hand, the second job has a better sounding title and has CAD design as part of the role, but I am worried that I will end up stuck in their specific industry, which may or may not be a bad thing in the long term. The first job seems like it has more room to grow (the company is also way bigger), but initially it doesn't seem quite as exciting.

I graduated with a good degree in EE two years ago. I took a job as a technician to stay in the same area as my wife. In my current job I repair and manufacture devices from scratch. I have found it very tough, as the culture in my office is very DIY, and people do not respond well to questions.

The work I do goes beyond soldering (which I was good at before I started the job); for instance I make cable harnesses and manufacture enclosures.

I guess this sounds quite simple, but the truth is that no matter how many NASA standards I read and YouTube videos I watch, when my stuff gets reviewed, there's always some new detail that I've missed out. For instance when I started, I didn't know about using p-clips to keep cables tidy inside an enclosure, and to help protect them if they got pulled. I've recently had something rejected because it didn't have drain loops in it.

Maybe the job isn't a good fit for me, but I can't understand why two years later, I still can't finish a product without having to redo it. I can't figure out what I'm missing. I can spend days thinking and planning, but still miss stuff out.

A quick Google search showed me the high leg delta used to split one of the phases by tapping the neutral in the middle of one leg of a delta orientation. This makes sense to me on the output side of the transformer but I find myself confused on the input side...my understanding/recollection was that all three phase power came with three lines and a neutral..as I think about it I'm wondering if maybe this is only for a Wye configuration and that delta power from the service provider does not have a neutral. What has me confused is my understanding is that there are always four conductors in a the phase transmission system and that it is the end user who decides whether to hook these lines up in either a delta or a Wye..is this still the case except that if the client chooses a delta connection they can simply ignore the original neutral on the input side (and choose their own neutral on-site which will have a potential difference compared to the input neutral)? Thanks in advance to anyone who can shed some light on this for me

Edit: also what does this mean for a delta system wherein they choose not to split a phase? Is one phase simply tied to ground...this feels silly to ask because technical earth ground/neutral from the power generation while physically very far from the end user should have a potential compared to the line. I suppose the physical distance is enough to consider it open circuit and yet is seems like there would still be some (very tiny) power dissipation...is this park of what they call leakage current?

I am a pretty new engineering (been at my firm for 1 year) and I have run into a situation where I think my firm is acting unethically and I am seeking some advice.

Basic situation is as follows: I spent time during work planning an event for the office and I billed the time to general overhead expenses since I wasn't working for a client. I was approached about my timesheet and told that I should have billed that time to a project and charged a customer for that time. The person went on to say, ""we don't bill time in the bathroom to overhead, so why would we bill this to overhead."" This individual is pretty high up at the company.

First question: is this unethical? I feel like it is, and that seems like enough reason for me to be uncomfortable with it.

Second question: how do you proceed in this situation if your entire firm is participating in unethical behavior?

Honestly, thinking about it makes me feel very uncomfortable and I have been strongly considering quitting since that day. I would love some advice on this.

Lastly, my direct boss left 2 months ago so I'm one of the two that has knowledge on my position in the company and it will not be easy to find a replacement for her. I've thought about leaving but maybe these types of problems exist regardless of where I go. 

This leaves me thinking if I want to be an engineer anymore. Coming out of school I didn't have a particular field I found interesting until my 2nd to last semester taking an RF class. That's the industry I am in now but maybe it's not working out. I've always been interested in technology and understanding in how things work but I'm not particularly passionate about any topic (that I know of) in engineering. Now I just feel stuck because I don't know what I want to do next and if I wait too long I might be too specialized

Again I'm not necessarily looking for advice (but would be appreciated) but it would be nice to see if/how other's have overcome similar issues? Did you find a new job and realize it was a better working culture/interesting work? Did you transition to a different field altogether? etc..

4,Grad school or industry?,1496301157,"Hello! So this has been on my mind for a long time. I'm graduating next May with a BS in mechanical engineering but I am not sure what I want to do yet. I have been thinking of both industry work and going to grad school (potentially a career in academia or R&amp;D). From what I heard from my friends, they found industry work to be quite boring (or should I say, not what they expected it to be). They were telling me how it is mostly CAD work which does not really interest me. I know the best way to find out is to try it myself. I landed an internship this summer but could not do it due to family reasons, really disappointed about this. I guess what I'm trying to ask is your experience in industry or grad school. Is industry work what you expected it to be in terms of hands on work and all those fun things like solving complex equations and applying what you learned?

So I need to calculate how much heat is lost to the environment as the air travels from the compressor, to its destination, and thus what it's temperature at the destination will be.

If I have air at temperature T1, flowing at a volumetric flow rate Q, through a pipe of length L (as shown in the diagram), and the temperature of the environment is TE - how can I model how the temperature changes along the length of the pipe, and thus calculate T2?
(http://imgur.com/a/8RHBf)

The equation: Q= 2 * (pi) * k * L(T1-TE)/ [ln(r2/r1)] 
shows the rate of heat loss via conduction from the surface of the pipe to the air, but, presumably in my situation, T1 is not constant through the length of the pipe. Does anyone have any idea how I can model the temperature change?

I guess I need to get an equation for dT/dL =  ?? and then integrate that over the entire length?




Edit: Am I thinking about this the wrong way?
If at a distance of, say 5m away from the heat reservoir, the temperature was lower than at 4m away, wouldn't the heat energy from the higher temp at 4m transfer to the cooler air at 5m? And by the same logic, the 3m air to the 4m air etc, so that ultimately T2=T1?

43,Dear Mechanical Engineering grads in Oil &amp;a Natural Gas: care to share your experiences?,1496143058,"Let me start by saying yes, I am aware of the [work experience posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/workexperience#wiki_work_experience) on this subreddit and I have read through each of the Petroleum and Mechanical posts. While I really enjoyed reading through these, I'd just like some more current info (and hopefully some personal questions could be addressed rather than general ones).

I'll try to keep this brief. It's been a long process:

- I'm a sophomore in college (around 50 credits completed but most are just the general ed garbage courses I don't care for and just wanted to get out of the way) who is going to have to transfer to a new school by fall 2018 at the very latest since my current school only has electrical engineering. If I get accepted, I won't really have any general eds left so it'll probably just be major coursework for the next 2 years.

- For about a year now, I've been thinking that I really want to have a career that's centered around oil and natural gas exploration and extraction. I'm pretty confident this is my passion. I want to be upstream. Yes the salary is attractive, but that's not my only reason. I'm genuinely interested in the process and want to be a part of addressing our energy needs.

- Was considering Penn State as my transfer school but they told me I will not be able to pursue Petroleum and Natural Gas engineering because I have too many transfer credits. I also won't be able to take most engineering degrees at PSU for this same reason. However, initially being told I can't get a petroleum engineering degree made me reconsider some things and though I'm eligible to pursue that major at a different school I'm looking at, I've realized that I want a more versatile degree anyways (but still wanna work in O&amp;G). So I've been thinking ""chemical or mechanical it is!""

- Took my first chem course ever during the spring. Was interested, but struggled. Mainly because we had a horrible professor. The curve was huge. I should NOT have gotten anything above a high C, yet I got an A. He had to save his own ass

- Reservoir engineering really interests me. I know geoscientists are really the main people involved in seismic exploration and stuff like that, but is there any chance that a ME can be apart of this process? 

- I'm not necessarily saying that I'm not willing to travel, but if I had a choice I'd prefer to be working with computerized info in an office. No, I don't want a computer engineering/computer science/software engineering/anything computer degree (despite having a high interest in tech). Is it at all possible for an ME to be involved in this aspect of petroleum engineering? Is it possible that a ME will never work with software like Petrel/won't be involved in locating oil and natural gas? Is a ME basically guaranteed to be on a rig/working as a drilling engineer? (Not opposed to time out in the field, however I want to have the option to eventually settle down in one location and potentially get an office job)



TL;DR:

If you majored in mechanical engineering and originally went into O&amp;G, share any experiences you got! I'd like to learn more about what ME's typically do in this industry and look for patterns based on responses

Any chance a ME in O&amp;G can be a reservoir engineer?

Is it harder for a ME to be a petroleum engineer than a Chemical Engineering grad?

46,From Anthropology to Civil Engineering - Quarter life crisis.,1496119228,"Hi all,

First off, I want to start off by asking commenters to be kind and open minded. Please utilize your professionalism/expertise and advise me to the best of your ability.

My background: I had a really rough time in college. Spent my years being psychologically tormented by someone dear to me. I was in an extremely abusive relationship with a major case of psychological manipulation. I was young and dumb. I messed up really badly in college and ended up graduating with a niche major (B.S in anthro). My graduation GPA is below 3.0. Barely scraping by, I know. My early 20's was a train wreck. I was hopeless and deflated. I felt worthless and dumb. What to do with my BS in Anthro? 

Fast forward a couple months after my graduation, I found a job as a bid coordinator for a construction company that deals with engineering and public works project. This job gave me the introduction that I believe I needed. I got to meet various resident engineers throughout my period of employment. A handful of them offered to help me get into engineering. This was a glimpse of hope I had not seen in years. Admittedly it has not been more than 3 months since I started working. However, this job had delivered the self confidence that I had not felt in what feels like an eternity.

I now have people trying to help me get into civil engineering by advising me on how to put one foot in the door through such things as the EIT and taking autocad/microstation courses. However, with my current educational standing, I do not feel like I can simply study to pass the EIT. I am honestly having a quarter life crisis (lol) and am seriously considering applying to local colleges for a secondary bachelors in civil engineering.

What I am considering: I messed up big time during my few years of college. I have racked up major student loan debts. I have terrible GPA and risk being rejected by schools even if I do decide on applying. I know I did poorly in my prior years of psychological fragility, but I swear I have become a much stronger individual now more than ever. 

What are your opinions on this? 

TLDR: I f-ed up through my first BS in Anthropology. I want to try for a second bachelor for Civil Engineering. Should I or should I not? ",AskEngineers,tokekitty,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6e57v4/from_anthropology_to_civil_engineering_quarter/

So for example It says:
Comprehensive error: 0.05% FS
Non-linearity: 0.05% FS
Hysteresis: 0.05% FS
Repeatability: 0.05% FS

Usually selecting other combos of faces/edges gets me options that I didn't have before and it ends up working but I would like to know why or why not for example, coincident is an available option or is greyed out.

So, essentially, what are some very important/basic fundamental topics or even intermediate stuff related to assemblies and section views/drawings that any modeler worth one's salt should have strong control of?

 I recently graduated with a BS ME from an ABET university with a pretty bad GPA [2.75], no internship experience, but quite a few projects and some team lead experience. So far I've been on about 4 interviews this past month but nothing has stuck and I'm starting to panic about being a lazy shit who isn't working an engineering job. What can I do to aleviate some of this feeling as I'm searching for the first job?

90,"Mechanism behind this ""No glow"" area?",1495960808,"My understanding of green glow chemicals is that they are usually greenish in hue (strontium aluminate).

So on a poster, the glow in the dark areas will have a film of greenish white paint, that when illuminated with deep blue/UV will glow nice bright green.

But I saw this poster below - when the room the poster is in gets dark, the green glowing moon has a silhouette of a bird on a branch, or lighthouse, amongst others.

This is what I don't get - if the silhouette was simply missing glow-in-the-dark-paint, it'd be visible as a darker/less green area of the daytime moon image.

That made me think that perhaps there's another layer - a transparent UV filter ink that's printed on top, so the glow-in-the-dark is never activated,producing the silhouette in the dark. That would mean there's no missing whiteish/green glow ink to ""give away"" the silhouette in daylight. 

So four layers: Paper / black ink (for the moon shading) / glow-in-the-dark-ink (filled ink layer, the blank ink behind adding the shading) / UV filtering ink (removes the light energy that makes the GITD ink glow)

I suspect there's a simpler/cheaper way?

I'm 21 now and realistically I could be in my late 20's by the time I decide to come back to engineering (if I do decide to come back). 

While in the military I would take the opportunity to do further study by distance learning if I could. I'm also interested in grad school so that is an option if industry doesn't work out.

I understand that this is a highly competitive field (and that I will more than likely need a Masters degree) so I am tempering my expectations but in the pursuit of my goal I would like to ask if you could help me make a list in what can I do as an Undergraduate to best prepare myself to go into that field?

My current thoughts are to focus on Verilog programming but I'd like to expand that and see what your opinions are. I am a competent C, Assembly, and Python programmer.

97,Measuring Torque with a Prony Brake,1495910325,"I was studying prony brakes the other day and thought they were quite simple: just attach an arm to the output shaft of the engine, put weights at the end of the arm until static equilibrium and calculate the torque using M=b*P. But after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSy_UmdgNg) and reading wikipedia's definition of prony brake as below:           
&gt;the measurement is made by wrapping a cord or belt around the output shaft of the engine and measuring the force transferred to the belt through friction.                       
                         
I realized that Prony Brakes are not exactly what I thought they were and I don't understand them.How can you get the torque with precision using a belt wrapped around the output shaft?

99,Rotational unbalance from non-rotating load,1495891851,"Suppose you have a rotating shaft with a rotational unbalance caused by a transverse load except that the load does not rotate with the shaft and continues to act in one direction (e.g. a strong gust of wind or a bearing arm).

To correct this unbalance would simply require another non-rotating load of equal magnitude acting opposite to the current one, correct?

Also, is there any kind of shorthand terminology to distinguish between static/couple/dynamic unbalances caused by non-rotating loads and rotating loads.

EDIT: Forgot to ask, is the inertial axis still off-center if the unbalance was caused by such a non-rotating force? Would it make a difference if it was either a mass pushing against the shaft from one side or a magnetic force acting against the shaft from one side?

EDIT2: Is it even called an unbalance if it isn't caused by an uneven mass distribution but an uneven force distribution?",AskEngineers,Newbie_to_sound,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6dnp4c/rotational_unbalance_from_nonrotating_load/
