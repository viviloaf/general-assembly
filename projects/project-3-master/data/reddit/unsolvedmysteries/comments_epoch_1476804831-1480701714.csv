0,Leaving job after 3 months after being recruited,1480700559,"I just started a job 3 months ago with a start-up second generation biofuels company. After 1 month at corporate, they decided to move me to the plant. Another advanced biofuels company is trying to recruit me in the same area and I am trying to make a decision on whether I pursue this opportunity or not. The second company is much more stable and established and is offering what amounts to a promotion with better compensation. 

A little background on me. I just graduated with my M.S. Before that, I worked in the biofuels industry for 2 years with 2 different companies. My concern is I will be viewed negatively as a job hopper, especially after leaving a job only 3 months in. I am not unhappy with my current company, and the compensation is nothing to scoff at. I am just wondering if I should seriously consider this opportunity as it does feel like an advancement in my career.

Anyways, imagine a circular cross-section with a rope passing over it from vertical to vertical so that it only contacts the upper hemisphere. The line is under tension with differing masses on each end. The rope and cross section have the same diameter. I know the friction coefficients.

There's obviously a considerable friction force over the surface, but it's difficult for me to imagine how it is being applied. I can imagine that the force acting on the surface* is fully normal to its surface, so the normal force is a pretty simple integral, but I can also imagine that the force from the rope acts at an angle from 0 to pi/2 as the point of interest moves further from the apex. Also an integral albeit more complicated.

23,How to reduce bed vibration from subway?,1480631201,"I recently moved to the top floor of an old house that's near an infrequently used subway tunnel. Trains pass through, on average, less than once per hour. 

The sleep app I use records all sound through the night. I don't wake up from the occasional train passing through between 11pm and 4am (but I might enter a lighter stage of sleep), but the one at ~5:10 shakes me enough that I generally can't fall back asleep. If I'm sufficiently exhausted and do go under again, the ~ 6:10 one will also wake me up.

This waking seems relatively new, as I don't recall experiencing this in the first weeks of moving here. I sleep with the strongest ear plugs I could find. It's the the deep vibrations that startle me and keep me awake. The lack of sleep is starting to destroy memory, focus, and general quality of life.

(Once a month, I also feel what purports to be a washing machine. The vibration is faster and lighter and makes me a bit dizzy while I'm trying to sleep.)

Any recommendations for my room/bed? My mattress is made of foam and my wooden-slatted bed frame is kept on risers. I'm also enormously sensitive to smells/scents/off-gassing.

It should be close to 100% relative humidity at the heater inlet, and then we raise the temperature by dT=5°C. The only way I know of to have liquid knockout after the heater is to have temp drop due to cooling, or pressure raise. There are no compressors after the heater so it can't be pressure raising. Although I also understand that an ideal gas will lose temperature after a pressure drop. What happens when a high %RH vapour experiences a pressure drop due to friction? The gas pressure will go down, and by PV=nRT, temp will drop. BUT at the same time the fluid energy lost due to friction has to go somewhere. So my question is kind of two-fold. Will the temperature of a gas drop due to pressure drop from pipe bends/valves, or will it go UP due to friction heating? Do the two effects fight each other?

28,Modifying older Petrol engines for lower emissions?,1480605635,"Hi there, I'm not sure whether this is a question fit for this subreddit but I'll try to be detailed. 

**Basically, is it feasible to modify older petrol engines for lower emissions?**

The reason I'm asking is that there are a lot of older vehicles around which are physically sound, and often built to a higher standard of durability than newer ones. For your daily driver it's obvously best to stick to new tech for reasons like road safety and low emissins, but for some use cases like pulling trailers, transporting goods short distances, road assist during swedish winters and such it is often not worth putting down the money for a new, less sturdy vehicle. 

I've looked around a bit and all i've found are discussions on how to increase performance, cheat emissions tests, or increase MPG. 

Take the GMC L35 engine- used in a wide array of vechicles, insane amount of spare parts and know-how available for it.
Would it be feasible to modify this engine in such a way as to significantly reduce emissions and allow one to use it as a workhorse with slightly less bruised conscience? Decreasing fuel consumption is important as well, but I think in some cases (mine for example) it would be better overall to be able to use a cheap car like this on the few occasion I need to drive my bike to the track for example and drive an efficient compact hybrid the rest of the time.. Instead I find myself needing to buy a larger, heavier allround vehicle and use that all year round, which i think has a bigger negative impact in the long run, as well as perpetuating the attitude that everybody needs a fully capable car. 

If anyone has any related papers or links or whatnot I'd gladly consume them. 
In Sweden taxes are high for cars with high emissions, and fuel is very expensive. Vehicles built for heavier duty are much more rare than in the us and cost a fair bit. Meanwhile a used &lt;2000 Chevy S-10 with a vortec V6 that with proper maintenance might last forever goes for less than you'd pay for a new set of winter tires on aluminum rims.

30,Nichrome wire heating: Diameter and temperature stability,1480600938,"**TL;DR: Need to make heating element of resistance wire, it's gonna be in a glass jar and heat 5 cl of water. I'm probably going to use &gt;0.2 mm thick NiChrome wire&lt; and am looking for answers to the questions down bottom.**

Hi, we are having a group project in electrical engineering of which one part involves **boiling 5 cl of water.** Having absolutely zero experience with thermodynamics and heating, I've tried to learn what would work best in our situation.We are supposed to design the entire heating element ourselves and so far we've decided to use NiChrome wire as a heating element, as it has a high resistivity and is rather cheap, and a glass container with styrofoam insulation to contain the water. However I've had trouble finding real world demonstrations and I'd be delighted if anyone with experience in the matter can answer a few questions. I also got a little bit of conflicting reports for example using [this calculator](http://www.jacobs-online.biz/nichrome/NichromeCalc.html).

---



**My options for wire:**

1. **0.2 mm** diameter, 32 gauge wire. Resistivity 0.67 mm^2 /m equaling ~22 ohms/m?
2. **0.4 mm** diameter, 26 gauge wire. Resistivity 0.67 mm^2 /m, equaling ~5,5 ohms/m?



and I've calculated that for a resistance of 13 Ohms we need about 60 cm of the thin wire or about 2,4 meter of the thicker wire, which is very long for a fairly small heating element, *so I'd rather use the thin wire, but I'm afraid it won't work.* The wattage is at most 50 watts.

**My questions are:**

1. Does nichrome wire this thin deform or break when heated a lot? **(Most important)**

2. If submerged in water, would a tight coil of said wire get short circuited between the windings?

3. We are planning to contain the heating element in a glass container. When filled with water and the heater is submerged, can any damage be done to the glass?

Since we are on a 30% incline hill, we don't know what kind of problems would arise from this for the surrounding houses, especially for the existing foundations. (There is no word on whether this is approved by the city or not; I plan to ask them very soon.) The street we are on also has an incline, descending towards the neighbor.

Any insight greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Edit: Some more specific questions (note: we are in Canada, if this changes anything)

* Presumably, they would not be able to maintain a 6' line all the way down the proposed 30+ ft. What would be the impact on the surrounding foundations? Would settling occur?

* Are there any common issues that may arise from the adjacent foundation being so close?

* Have there been any issues with shotcrete foundations? Google has only turned up tutorials and companies that install it.",AskEngineers,CocoaCerebellum,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5fu06n/question_30_ft_excavation_on_a_30_incline_hill/

Im in my final year of my engineering studies and am required to complete a group design project. We meet tomorrow to put forward ideas on what the project should be with the only guidance being ""something mechanical"". 

I have a few ideas that I intend to put forward however I would like to bounce them off you guys prior to gain a more rounded view on them.

* 3D Printing - My first project idea was to develop and affordable desktop sized 3D printer. The 3D printing industry is booming and current offerings are typically extremely expensive, poor quality or come as a kit. I believe, with mass manufacture in mind, an affordable and quality printer could be produced. 

* Robotic Arm - Robot arms are 'cool' and are very in fashion at the moment. There are however very few models for the desktop or lower end market. I believe that developing an arm target at low cost education environments could facilitate better teaching in the areas of control and robotics and could also be utilised in small batch production lines or as an assist at a workbench for assembling small parts, holding work parts etc.

* Camera Stabiliser - Autonomous drones and camera drones are becoming popular for research but more importantly filming. A lightweight camera stabiliser that isolated the image from vibration would fit perfectly into this emerging market.

55,Help designing a thruster for skiing,1480509863,"Hey

I recently saw a really cool video of a girl using a bar with 4 electric thrusters attached. In all its simplicity, it generated thrust, which propelled her while wearing skis. They apparently had plans to manufacture and sell it, but for a pretty prohibitive price of like $10 000, which is a bit ridiculous for a recreational toy.

I've given it some thought and want to crunch some numbers to see how feasible it'd be to build one for myself. Primary motivation is to do it cheaper. More than $1000 isn't likely to happen.

First of fall: **How do I estimate required thrust?** Price increases fast with increasing thrust, so I don't want more than necessary to provide a decent amount of fun. IIRC the product I mentioned has about 50 kgf. They reached speeds of 50-60 mph with this, and while it sounds like a lot of fun, it seems grossly overpowered and obviously expensive. It's just a novently

My requirements are basically: I want to be able to **climb an incline of say 20% at a pace of at least 4 m/s, on cross country skis**. This should be enough of a specification to calculate required thrust, but I'm not sure how. Is the required thrust basically equal to my weight multipled by the incline plus drag from the skis? How to guesstimate ski-drag? Air resistance seems insignificant in this context, since top speed is probably gonna be plenty anyway. **10 m/s top speed** seems like an okay goal, secondary to the climbing speed.

Then: **Knowing the required thrust, how do I estimate the required motor power?** I realize this depends on a lot of things like propellers etc, but I'm not talking precision calculations here. +-25% is good enough for a result just to pick a motor.

**Having a motor with a given rpm and power, how do I choose the best propeller?** I suppose constraints need to be applied, like maximum size, since bigger is almost always better in my understanding, but after applying a maximum size constraint, how do I choose the best propeller? There are plenty of R/C airplane prop calculators, but they do little to help with the choosing process, and finding a prop with this method seems to boil down to choosing from hundreds of propeller products and just trial and erroring your way to a decent one, and it doesn't seem very efficient...

And finally **Is there an obvious winner between gasoline, nitro and electric BLDC motors when it comes to cost for this application?** I'm inclined to believe that a couple of small hobby gasoline motors, say 20-30 cc would do this cheaper than an electric equivalent, but without all the data(which I can't yet work out) above it's hard to make a fair comparison. It seems like electric motors lose big time because of batteries not being nearly as economic as a tank of gasoline, but that's just my hunch. Plus, you can have basically unlimited range with gasoline. Maybe a nitro motor is a good candidate too? On the other hand, an electric motors relatively quiet operation is a big plus, and I'd rather not stink of exhaust when using it. Plus, electric motors come in handy EDF-modules, which are compact, easy to use and offer some degree of protection thanks to the cowl.

Hope someone can help me in the right direction with any of these steps. Thanks!

Maybe you could help me out? At least, show me the direction. How is this part called in a proper English or engineering slang? Hopefully, I would be able to find, who produces these.

Generally I'll do some low-pass filtering on it and get some sorta-usable results, but typically taking the second derivative of position data doesn't result in usable acceleration data due to discretization noise.

I'm doing this in post, not realtime, so I have a variety of options as far as post-filtering goes. I also generally know the masses/inertias of my system, so some model-based signal processing could help, but I haven't found anything super useful. I believe a Kalman filter might be what I'm looking for but most examples I've seen are either super math heavy or super math light, neither of which help me out a lot. It seems that Kalmans are generally used for real-time filtering (which is certainly fine for postprocessing but I wonder if there's something better since I'm not limited by processing speed). I've also wondered if some type of upsampling function would help me out, interpolating points between real samples by assuming constant acceleration or jerk, but I don't know if that'll really help or not.

Right now I generally make due with rolling average filters or simple lowpass filters, but I'd like a better way to analyze my data. It only sorta works sometimes, not always

6,"Cleaning up ""noise"" in low voltage even with good shielding and proper grounds. Motec data logger vs DAQ/ Control PC. Sorry for Long question.",1480379033,"This has been an issue for about a week at work. I'l try to make this question as simple as possible. (I failed)
 
We have an IR sensor that has a common, power (8v) and signal (0-5v)
We send the signal to two locations. One is the control PC that we use a DAQ pack and Computer to control a VFD for our machine. It also gives feedback. The split IR signal also goes to a Motec data logger analog input for feedback as well. This is simply to review data at 100hz. It makes no decisions. It's only for data acquisition. 

Using the same equation provided by the IR manufacturer in both devices, they don't match up. 
Our computer that we have coded displays some sort of noise at very low voltage. (say from 0-60mV to 70mV) The Motec does not.

When we read the data from our pc, the voltage spikes all over the place at these low voltages. 
 We called the manufacturer of our DAQ and they assured us that it can read .001v at a time.

We tried running the signal through a conditioner and it still didn't help. 

At the end of the day, we started working backwards. We disconnected the IR. Sure enough, the needle on the gauge (and the corresponding voltage read out next to it) did not change. This made us think there was some noise somewhere. We are using CAT6 twisted pair shielded cable.  Even holding the signal wire coming out of the conditioner would show a voltage change. Not touching the copper wire itself. 

We've realized that it's not our IR, but some sort of noise coming from somewhere. All the grounds are good. 

The shielding is good. (so it seems) 

As a last resort, We shut the power to our main box that houses all of our conditioners and power supplies and relays and the DAQ. The readout did not change. It still jumped from 0 to around 60mV. I then realized that our DAQ is powered by the USB from our pc. Could that possibly be causing some interference? 

The other question (which I've had little success getting an answer from Motec on) is how the Motec is not seeing the signal problems. How is it dealing with the voltage variations from within the hard code? They claim it's accepting the absolute voltage and not averaging the samples. 

**Where is this crazy voltage coming from? And how can we isolate or prevent this noise outside of what we've already done?**  Our IR sensor has the capability to send these low (**absolute**) voltages and give us a proper/stable low temp read out but when the low voltage spikes we are getting (to the control pc) translate to a couple hundred °F, we are unable to control our machine like we want

I searched around and this sub seemed to be the best one I could submit this to. I'm no engineer. But I can provide as much information as I can. Thanks in advance for any and all help. 

**Sorry for the long question. I wanted to provide as much information while keeping it simple. Hard to do I suppose **

19,Strongest M6 spring ball plunger (strongest spring load N),1480325124,"Hi! I have a kind of odd question.
Does anyone know which M6(or Ø6mm) spring ball plunger that has the strongest spring load?
There is a huge amount of different plungers and it takes forever to search through them, especially since most sites does not index their plungers by multiple criteria(size + strenght + material) and most don't even index but just link to each specific product by name and maker. 

Thought someone might have looked for this before me and have an answer or a good estimate.

Currently the strongest one i have found is 18 Newton top load - 53 Newton bottom. http://www.springandballplungers.com/-c-50_55_160.html

20,help with fatigue analysis of a spring in surge,1480321885,"My boss is trying to have a closed form solution for the stress values that a spring is experiencing when it is being excited at its natural frequency. When this happens the spring goes into surge which makes the coils clash against each other. We set up strain gauges on the springs and excited them at there natural frequency at 1g,3g,5g, and 10g.  The springs were attached to a housing that fixed both ends of the springs. The housing was attached to a shaker table.The only type of help I could find in literature was "" design the spring so that the natural frequency of the spring is 10 times greater than the driving force"" which doesn't really help me. If anyone has any experience with this type of situation please help me answer these questions:

1) If the strain gauges were set up 45 degrees to the axis of the coil to measure the pure shear will they actually be able to record the the strain that is experienced by the spring when they begin to  clash against each other?

2) Will the coils begin to clash against each other no matter what G level is applied or is there enough internal damping to stop that at certain G levels?

3) How can I get some theoretical stress values for the spring per G level that the spring is experiencing in this set up?

My idea is to use thin gauge galvanized pipe because it's relatively cheap, stiff and easy to do large circumference bends which my wallet,  the acoustics and desired terminal points of the pipe call for (PVC would be another option but it isn't quite as easy to bend and is probably not as good as a thin gauge steel with respect to the acoustics). I figure the gauge of the pipe isn't very important for the application because it is going to be backed by hard packed dirt which will make up for any stiffness lost to the thinner gauge.


The upshot is I am  looking for an epoxy that will join a thin gauge, unthreaded galvanized pipe ( I believe the thinnest and cheapest guages of pipe don't have threads---plus it's probably marginally  acoustically preferable to not have threads---though I'd guess the difference would be unnoticeable. ). I'm guessing any epoxy that works on galvanized steel will do, the joints quality will probably have no noticeable effect on the sound ,  but I figure if I'm going to get one the ideal would be to get the stiffest epoxy, not necessarily the strongest.

33,Electricity generated in power plants vs car engines,1480273017,"I keep seeing arguments against electric vehicles using the thinking that some 67% of electricity comes from fossil fuels in the form of natural gas, and coal power plants. Citing that even if you're driving an EV, you're still burning fossil fuels and not making a lick of difference, sometimes arguing so far to say that the environmental cost of producing the batteries outweighs a relative fuel efficient hybrid engine. 

From my understanding, the enormous turbines that generate our electricity from natural gas of coal have huge systems to be as thermally efficient as possible, and also have the capability to put large exhaust mitigation like  effective scrubbers or catalytic converters (not sure if they actually use cats but I assume at least scrubbers).. 

So by the numbers I can find, a turbine is something like 45-50% thermally efficient, with some probably very effective pollution mitigation systems.. Whereas an average automobile has about 20%, reaching as high as 35% on some hybrid type setups.. 

Is this a correct line of thinking that even though your electricity may still be ""dirty""  it may be even as much as 2x cleaner than producing the energy directly in your vehicle?  
What kind of systems do they implement in energy production to mitigate pollution and increase thermal efficiency? 
Are these figures even correct?

58,"Electrical: How is it possible for a battery charger to reverse polarity and start charging at the same voltage etc, yet with negative voltage?",1480104271,"Context:

This is a 'dumb' 18650 charger. It has a small IC, 2 elec capacitors, 2 diodes, 2 signal diodes, 1 2color LED, a small transformer, a medium sized transistor (possibly a mosfet) resistors, and some other minor components.

I accidentally inserted a cell backwards and it started charging it that way. After I discovered it, I put it (the charger) to the multimeter and it had reversed polarity.

It did this until I inserted a fully charged (partially charged wouldn't do it) 18650 in the proper orientation at which point it switched back.

I would expect the diodes to prevent this switch, yet could it be explained by over-voltage in the wrong direction to the extent that the diode dead shorts? Could the IC be doing the switching and handle such current? It is small, 8 leg 1/4inch X 3/8inch.

79,How to make a concrete block,1479994483,"Hello, I collect minerals and an important part of the hobby is trimming the final samples. This involves placing the specimen onto a surface and then reducing its size with a hammer a chisel. 

At the moment, I do not have a dedicated permanent surface to do this on that I can damage. Instead, all that I can do is put the specimen into a rock flower bed and break the specimen on other rocks. This works but it is not as controlled as I would like and the rocks eventually crack and break underneath the specimen over time.

I want me make a dedicated plinth for trimming my specimens. The dimensions of this would be reasonably small (about 1 foot square or maybe a tiny bit larger). I want to make this plinth so that it does not (easily) break and crack while trimming specimens on top of it. 

I plan to place this small plinth block on my outside patio slabs. These are 40x40cm slabs about 5cm thick. It is essential that I do not crack these slabs. My idea was to place my plinth in a bed of sand and then put that on the concrete slabs. I was hoping that this would dissipate the shock experienced by the patio slabs?

Can anyone tell me if its worthwhile reinforcing the concrete block? I have a whole load of rebar offcuts ranging in side from 5mm up to 40mm in diameter. I can weld and machine so it wouldn't be difficult for me to turn these scrap bits of bar into a mesh lattice. Is this a good idea for a small 1 x 1 foot block and if so, what is the best size of rebar to use. Should I use the smallest size, the biggest size? 

Lastly, can anyone offer any advice about surface toughness? I will be breaking a wide variety of mineral specimens on this, some of them could things like quartz conglomerate which is really hard and really tough. I suspect that over time the surface of the concrete will be heavily beaten and crushed. Is this just an inevitable fact or are there ways to extend the life of the surface? Would placing a toughened steel plate (like what they use in construction equipment digging tools) on it before use be worthwhile? 

EDIT: Obviously I will be using some ready mix concrete bag as the volume is too small to buy from an actual pre-made concrete supplier

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

83,Induction motor slip vs temperature and estimated power output,1479961041,"I was hoping to use the measured motor slip to estimate the water flow for a centrifugal pump driven by a 1kw induction motor. A few seconds after initial switch on the slip is about 4% and this climbs to 5% over a period of a few minutes even through the actual water flow remains essentially constant.
If I switch it off for a couple of minutes then switch it back on, the slip starts at about 4.5% and again climbs up to 5% over a few minutes.

Am I effectively measuring the temperature of the stator winding instead of the flow rate?
None of the web sites I've looked at mention how the slip varies with temperature.

The resistance temperature coefficient for copper is about 0.4% per deg C and the surface of the motor is just about too hot to touch so I guestimate that the temperature rises by about 50 deg C above the 20 deg ambient, so that would increase the resistance by  20%. Does that sound about right, and would that amount of resistance increase cause a 1% increase in the slip?

The line voltage and frequency are very stable and the motor bearings are less than 6 months old. Are there any other effects that would likely to be causing the slip variations? I haven't used any other induction motors or centrifugal pumps so I have nothing to compare against.

20,Help me size an AC inverter duty induction motor,1479771274,"Hey guys,

*quick note: I've left out a lot of technical details for simplicity

Working on a project where the goal is to construct a platform+control system with two degrees of freedom: pitch and roll with 30 degrees and 45 degrees respectively. The platform and average load will be about 2500 lbs. I'm planning to use 2 AC motors with gear boxes connected to a VFD, and controlled with a variable joystick.

My question regards how to size the motor properly. To get to the real meat and potatoes, The motor with the most demand handles a torque of 38,030 lb-in. At a speed of 6 rpm.
So power in hp is around 3.62

This motor/gearbox combo must not have the ability to be back-driven. In other words if there is a force applied to the motor shaft, it will not turn. The motor must only turn when an electrical signal is applied to it.

I understand that sizing the motor is dependent on the gear ratio within the gear box, and that a worm gear is perhaps the way to go in terms of not allowing the motor to be back driven. However, as an experienced reader can probably tell, I am not an expert, and I may be off in my descriptions or understanding.

My project partners bring up the fact that on top of our calculated torque, the motor must also overcome the initial starting torque to move at all. We're debating on whether this initial torque is provided by motor specs from the manufacturer, or if we're supposed to make some assumption on the acceleration required to move from a stand still to our desired velocity. From there we can calculate the starting torque.

My question is, if you had to, how could you individually actuate/move the pins from a set 0 starting point to a variable, controlled distance? 

Edit: 
Wow, truly amazing responses. Thank you kindly.

Once the pins are in their correct locations, I planned on locking their position with a third perforated panel using a thumbscrew to put pressure on the pins to keep them from moving. I suppose if each pin had a small amount of tension applied before fully locking them that it would be enough to use a single head to move each pin based on x/y coordinates.

The goal of this project is to make a rapid prototyping table. The simple version would allow you to simply imprint an existing object into the pin table and then immediately lay a substrate (fiberglass/clay/carbon fiber) directly on to the pins (over a release sheet). It would remove a step of making the mold.

The second version would be able to export a 3D map directly to the pin table from CAD. That is where I'd need the pins to be actuated.
On first glance for linear actuators, size would be the challenge as well as cost. Hundreds of pins could grow the price to a level a bit outside this project's scope. A single actuator would be much slower, but that is not a huge priority and could be acceptable.",AskEngineers,sprfrkr,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5e4vp4/how_to_actuate_metal_pins/

These things don’t suck at least for me, I can code and sleep in the same couch, as it is what excites me for now.
 
Is it possible to leverage my skills in computers and engineering to make a product out of it? Let say building ERP modules - consider as an easy to use and perceive front end (when compared to SAPs transaction codes or their boring data querying and display engine) for niche companies. This is something I would very much work on, considering that I have knack for business processes and analytics combined with coding, and I can make a full-fledged product out of it.

I have long fighting confusion on or not to pursue Industrial Engineering degree for the very same reason on what it has to offer on the above perspective. Is there any grad school offering any course, which place much emphasis on coding in engineering degree and which encourages to make business ventures of it? By that I mean it makes use of systems problems and programming mind to delve into and make a successful venture out of it.

37,Dealing with positive feedback loops and user input for a steering wheel game input,1479688387,"Hi there, I asked this question over at /r/learnprogramming, but this sub is probably better suited for this.

The problem:
When giving my electronic steering wheel a jerk and letting it do its thing, the car in-game will go that direction. Due to my force feedback modelling based on centrifugal acceleration of the car, the wheel will go back. (Correct me if I'm mixing up centripetal/fugal!). At higher speeds depending on the vehicle, it'll start to fishtail soon after this. At lower speeds this is attenuated out. The problem is in the output being used as input, I think. 

Some information needed to understand my issue:

I'm accepting a steering wheel with force feedback as input, to control a vehicle in a game. The game does not natively support steering wheels and I'm hacking it in. For the curious - [source](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVManualTransmission).

On the input side, things are working well. There seems to be a small input delay which I can't pinpoint right now, but that's something for me to fix at another time. (125ms onscreen delay, not sure if there's a delay between device in/output and car movement though!)

It gets nasty on the output, the force feedback side. I'm interfacing with the steering wheel device with DirectInput, to read input and send back force feedback effects.

For the G Force, I use GForce = (vehData.RotationVelocity.z * vehData.Velocity) / 9.81f; RotationVelocity is in radians per second. I roughly validated it by driving in a circle with known radius at a constant speed and used (v^2 / r) to check against RotationVelocity*velocity, which worked out. The GForce is multiplied such that 2G gives a maximum DirectInput output value.

The end result is that the physics feel good while driving and cornering, but once the hands are taken off the wheel at high speed, the car will crash itself rather quickly. I do not dare trying this out in real life, but other proper sims don't have this.

The title Assetto Corsa seems to be able to distinguish the user input from the force feedback input caused by itself. I'd like to make something that does a similar thing. I've thought of filtering the output force with input, but it's hard to match two different quantities (encoder position change per second - G force) and it would also mean the wheel would probably only give a countering force, and not make the wheel turn itself for corrections or oversteer.

I have no idea where to continue from here.

Stuck on how to prototype the sheet metal part.  Given thickness (&lt; 1mm) of material, don't think I'll be able to get away with 3d printing a ""stand-in"" for the sheet metal--so think I might have to go for the real thing.

Individual parts are relatively small, blanks maybe 2 x 2 in (50 x 50mm) at most. Assuming I can work out w/ local makerspace to get blanks cut from the metal sheet--however, not sure if the bending part is something I could make happen on my own--bends are not complex, basic ""U"" channels, but at minimum radius (.5mm ID) bends.  

Curious if, with a little patience, the right inner forms (square stock? wood?), and a little persuasion (mallet? DIY press?) I could get something relatively close with 20 gauge (.813mm) aluminum bending at home?

50,Texas Laws on 33cc chainsaw bike.,1479635823,"I'm planning on making a ""motorcycle"" from a mountain bike and a 33cc chainsaw engine. I was wondering if I could use this to commute to and from high school and googled the laws in Texas.
Here is a section from http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/TN/htm/TN.551.htm
Sec. 551.351.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:
(1)  ""Motor-assisted scooter"":
(A) means a self-propelled device with:
(i)  at least two wheels in contact with the ground during operation;
(ii)  a braking system capable of stopping the device under typical operating conditions;
(iii)  a gas or electric motor not exceeding 40 cubic centimeters;
(iv)  a deck designed to allow a person to stand or sit while operating the device; and
(v)  the ability to be propelled by human power alone; and
(B)  does not include a pocket bike or a minimotorbike.
(2)  ""Pocket bike or minimotorbike"" means a self-propelled vehicle that is equipped with an electric motor or internal combustion engine having a piston displacement of less than 50 cubic centimeters, is designed to propel itself with not more than two wheels in contact with the ground, has a seat or saddle for the use of the operator, is not designed for use on a highway, and is ineligible for a certificate of title under Chapter 501.

Focus on the lines:

(1)  ""Motor-assisted scooter"":
(A) means a self-propelled device with:
(iii)  a gas or electric motor not exceeding 40 cubic centimeters;
(B)  does not include a pocket bike or a minimotorbike.
(2)  ""Pocket bike or minimotorbike"" means a self-propelled vehicle that is equipped with an electric motor or internal combustion engine having a piston displacement of less than 50 cubic centimeters,

So it is a ""Motor-assisted scooter"" if the engine is less than 40cc, but not if it is a ""minimoterbike"" which is anything with less than 50cc.

Here is my [current blueprint](http://puu.sh/snFTM/26116a1a0e.jpg).

I want the spike midway down the handle to be a lever that I can pull to push the blades open and after a little research it looks like a bike brake cable could be a really good option when paired with a brake lever.  Basically, a brake cable runs down the pipe and connects to the brake lever which can be incorporated into the design and hidden away and once pulled it pushes the blades apart.

There are several screws securing the frame to the 2x4, but it's not tied in to or part of the engineered truss frame on the opposite side of the wall.  The walking slats are 2x2 cedar.  The frame sticks out from the wall approximately 28"".

Right now the walkway supports weight fine, but it is a little creaky.  It also has no handrail.  I will be building a railing for it and would like to tie the top of the rail posts in to the cathedral roof with chain to help reinforce the weight on the walkway.  I will be using 2x2x1/8 aluminum posts bolted through a 2x8 facing board and in to the walkway frame with 6"" long 3/8 lag bolts.  The top of the post will be capped with 1/4 plate and then I will have a wood toprail screwed in to the plate.  

I wanted to secure the chain through the top of the post, but am at a loss on how to do it.  I originally wanted to thread an eye bolt in to the post cap, but the pullout strength of aluminum threads is not high.  Even if i oversized the hole and used a riv nut or threaded insert, in still a little uneasy about it.  Also the eye bolts are like $50 each.

I don't want to thread in to the wood hand board because there's going to be unions over the posts.  
 
Would it be reasonable to weld an eyelet to the walkway side of the post?  Or weld a bracket to the overhang side, then use an eyebolt through the hand board? Or is there a better option?

I realise this might have been SUPER confusing, I'll try and upload an image of what I want to do if I figure out how (this is my first post.)

Thank you so much in advance!

89,What is the mathematical function describing the bending of optical fiber under certain constraints?,1479449153,"I don't have a mechanical engineering background and am trying to analyze a design problem. Essentially, I'm bending optical fiber and want to assure myself that the radius of curvature does not shrink below a critical value where the fiber is likely to fail. I'm also curious about the general functions governing the bending of narrow rods like this.

Let me lay out the models in increasing order of complexity.

Model #1: Fiber of length L is fixed between pivoting endpoints a distance H apart (H &lt; L). Essentially, think of bending a strip of wood by simply compressing the two ends together. Is there a general equation for the shape of that curve? I couldn't find it by googling.

Model #2: (more like my application). Instead of being allowed to pivot, the two ends of the fiber are fixed in place such that the tangent of the curve at the ends is horizontal - so now we're forcing it into a bell-curve-like shape. 

Model #3 (even more likely for my application) same constraints (tangent at endpoints is horizontal), but instead of a single hump like bell curve, now we have a sinusoidal curve, presumably symmetric and passing through the midpoint between the endpoints.

In each case, what I care about is estimating the radius of curvature (I've been approximating the curves as circular arc segments), or deriving that from the second derivative of the shape function.

Bonus question: am I wrong to assume that a glass fiber would want to bend in a plane? Is it possible there is more stress relief in, say, a spiral or other projection into the 3rd dimension?

one thing that popped into my mind was the Joule-Thompson effect that will occur after supercritical CO2 directly expanded in the separator (probably the temperature will drop so much it will freeze the oil).

23,"Getting to grips with the relationship between power, rpm and torque (mainly SI engines).",1479345215,"Okay so I'm in my second year of automotive mechanical engineering, and after working on a project involving Diesel-RK (really interesting software btw), I'm trying to get my head around this whole phenomena around torque and power and how it reflects in the performance output of an engine/car.

Firstly, I'm aware of the relationship of:

P = (T*N*2pi)/60 

Therefore it's clear to see that torque is inversely proportional to crank RPM. I'm also aware that in this context, the torque is the force of the piston multiplied by distance of the centre point of the big end journal to the main bearing journal centre point and that power just the rate of work done on/by the pistons, therefore without that formula earlier, common sense would dictate power will increase with RPM; more crank rotations per minute, more explosions and power strokes etc etc.

I'm also aware of the volumetric efficiency of an engine, and that peak torque is produced when volumetric efficiency is at it's highest across the rev range because obviously, with a better volumetric efficiency, a more powerful combustion can be produced, therefore exerting a higher force on the piston during the power stroke. Then, past that, as the RPM increases, volumetric efficiency decreases due to the valve train becoming less efficient not allowing the engine to 'breathe and exhale' properly, thus causing the torque to decrease. 

Now on to my main question really and sorry if I dont do a good job explaining this. If under full throttle (and ignoring gear ratios and transmission), the torque decreases past peak volumetric efficiency, what is causing the RPM to increase which enables the power to increase? Or if you like, how does an engine still able to cause a car to accelerate and we feel this sensation as 'performance' as the RPM and power increases if the engine's torque is decreasing as an engine goes through the RPM range and therefore reducing in torque and 'force' of the engine to pull the car.

Is it to do with inertia of the flywheel that is able to keep the crank rotating which is obviously then connected to the valve-train via belts/chains and then it's almost like a snowball effect where RPM just keeps building up and as a product of this, the increased rate of work just takes over and compensates for the weaker force of each explosion on the piston by just having more of them per unit of time,and as a driver we experience this as an increase in performance?

Another way to look at it I guess is using F1 (a subject im massively interested in both as a sport and engineering/career wise) and the days of the 3.0l NA V10's in the early 00's that could rev up to 20,000.

I know those engines had low torque outputs, but they were still able to seriously huck a car down a track with vast acceleration. Were engineers forced to produced engines that revved that high just to counter act the low torque outputs of those engines and almost have to go with quantity over quality in terms of combustion and getting the piston to do work?",AskEngineers,KyogreHype,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5dd1f6/getting_to_grips_with_the_relationship_between/

So, my assigment is to research and put together, along with my own opinion, the future of cooling circuits in electric vehicles. For the last three weeks I have been researching the current electric cars and hybrids and their cooling. I also covered bikes but I will return to that later.

Anyways, now that I am informed about the subject to a certain level, I have a few questions.

First, why none of the cars uses oil as a cooling liquid? I found water, water mixed with glycol, different refrigenrants and air as ways of cooling, but never oil. I found out that bikes are using it, but cars no. I am interested why is that, and do you think that will change with the technological advancements?

Second, to continue on the first question, is it not easier to use oil? Less maintenance, simpler architecture (no need for separation as the electrical components can be submerged in oil), and it is generally safer?

Third, I understand that water is heavy in weigth, but it is far more effective than air cooling, so why are some manufacturers, like Volkswagen deciding on air cooling on their new models.

And of course, if you have time and will, I would love to hear what do you think how the future of cooling circuits will look in the field of electric engines and batteries.

I graduated a little over a year ago and did two internships with this company before graduation so I've been with them about 2 years total as a field engineer.

I am looking to build a new stand for my aquarium.  I have done this quite a few times in the past, and due to the design, never questioned if it would hold the weight, this time its a little different design, and hoping someone can tell me if its a disaster waiting to happen.  

I have an aquarium that is 24"" X 24"" X 24""  this means it holds roughly 60 gallons of water.  The tank itself weighs roughly 100 lbs, adding the 480lbs of water, I am nearing 600.  Some of that water will be displaced by sand and rocks (100+ lbs of rocks) so I Am guessing in the 650-750 lbs range when all is said and done.  

[This] (http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm289/RocketEngineer/StandTemplate.jpg) seems to be the ""standard template"" most people use, but they are planning a stand that is similarly sized to what they are putting on top.  

I need the stand to be quite a bit bigger than the tank to hold everything underneath that goes along with maintaining a box of glass full of coral.  So, I need to make this stand in the 30"" X 30"" x 36"" range.  This means I wont have the 2X4 directly under the tank.   

My plan was to create the top by having a 30 X 30 2X4 frame (red and yellow in the pic above) , and having 2 addtional 2X4 1.5"" inside that 30X30 square (blue on top in the pic above but i would have 2 and they would be towards the front and back) , so these new 2X4 will be 24"" apart.  Then I would use 3/4"" plywood top, and then the tank on top of that.    

The tank itself has a plastic frame, so all the weight is on the edges of the 24X24 base.  I will have to cut out some holes in the plywood to allow for plumbing to pass though.  These would be 2"" diameter holes, around 5 or 6"" from one of the corners (only 1 corner, not all 4)

Will the plywood on top of this frame hold the 750lbs?  Are the extra 2X4 inside the 30"" frame required?  


To me, the green vertical pieces seem overkill.  but maybe not?

Can I get away with a single 2X4 in each corner (fuchsia in the pic) ? or do I need to double up and have 2 in each corner?

Can anyone tell me if it's feasible or not? Is it possible but very expensive? Is it possible but very dangerous?",AskEngineers,c0d3s1ing3r,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5d4c4s/why_cant_we_properly_build_a_human_powered/

64,Confusion on determining IT Grade of a process,1479234310,"Hello everyone, I work as a junior quality engineer at a 3D printing startup. We are trying to conduct an experiment to determine the ISO International Tolerance Grade capability of our printer. Basically at the end of this we want to be able to tell people our printer is capable of IT Grade X precision. Using the equation seen on [this page](http://www.engineersedge.com/international_tol.htm) I've got a table built out for the tolerances associated with the specific part sizes that we plan to test. My confusion is how to apply this table to precision and process capability. My two questions are:

*Do the numbers given in these tables represent the +/- of a symmetrical tolerance zone, or are they the width of the tolerance zone? It seems that when applying this to fits (H7/g7 and all that) it is the width of the zone, but I can't seem to find any information when applied to a process.

*Once I figure out the width of the tolerance zone implied by the IT Grade tolerance numbers, what significance level should I use in determining which grade our printer falls into? I would assume 6 sigma (+/- 3 sigma from the mean), but I can't find anything to confirm this.

Does anybody have any experience with this? I want to avoid purchasing ISO 286 (the standard that lays these tables out) because I'm afraid even that won't answer my questions. Thanks!",AskEngineers,pro_pain_accessories,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5d43jl/confusion_on_determining_it_grade_of_a_process/

76,Solution for irregation,1479214299,"I have a garden of about 100 square meters that I would like to irrigate from an alternate water source to save council water. There is a storm-water stream running past my house (usually flowing). I came up with this design: https://postimg.org/image/h0kd6movn/ 

I would like people's opinion on it in terms of feasibility and what pump technology (capacity / type etc). would be most suitable. The reason for the green and orange ""circuits"" is to indicate that I plan to use the pump to fill the tank as well as a booster to the irrigation. Note that only one of the 2 circuits will ever be active at any given time (the other circuit will be isolated - hence the 3 way valve).

The more research I do, the more I find that this is something that needs to be planned very carefully and that you don't just go and start buying stuff. For instance, someone mentioned I need a pressure valve on the inlet side of the tank to sustain back-pressure so the pump can run on its curve? Someone else mentioned that this design will not work due to priming issues that will frequently occur as well as cavitation?

The pressure switch is there to shut the pump down should the storage tank full up or if the irrigation system upstream is blocked - don't know if this is recommended.

I only need about 2-3bar of water pressure to have the irrigation system work effectively (current pressure of council water).
The reason for pumping the water into a holding tank first is so that I will be able to store water should the water in the stream be unavailable for a period of time for whatever reason.

As stated in the title I am not getting a steady flow coming out of my pump, so it seems that my voltage is dropping out and coming back up in quarter second bursts. However when I drop my voltage down to 7.5V my stream is constant. The pump is rated for 12V at 2 amps.

I'm in 2nd year civil engineering, and I think its fantastic, but I just can't shake the feeling that I'm completely separated and isolated from the rest of what uni has to offer. This is okay for the majority of the rest of the student body who are primarily focused on jobs an launching their career, but personally I just don't feel comfortable jumping straight into real life without developing a stronger base in other fields. 

Right now, I think I'd love to go into economics (probably for a major) and philosophy (probably for a minor). Both these subjects are fascinating to me, and honestly feel they would both compliment something as concrete (funny pun) and streamlined as engineering... not to mention the direct role that each one has played in each other throughout all of history.

However, this would require doing four more years of expensive schooling, during which time I could be cruising through the corporate pipeline and setting up a productive and comfortable life for myself in industry, all the while making significant bank and winning the affection of all the ladies with my sporty sports car, swanky bachelor's apartment, and expertly tailored suit. 

Anyway, all romantic impressions of professional life aside, is it really wise to commit myself to so much extra ""fluff"" after I've already graduated with a degree as strong as engineering? Or should I remain focused on the path I've chosen now, and make the most of what it has to offer?

This centrifuge system has a number of small stepper motors to put in the reagents into the centrifuge chamber. From what I read online, the main failure modes of a stepper motor is bearing failure due to wear and tear. And if you know FMEA, you know that there are three grades per failure mode - Severity of the Failure (S), Probability of Occurrence (O) and the Detection Rate (D) and RPN= SxOxD. My question is about the O value - what should it be? Because if I put O = 10 (almost absolute certainty) then the RPN paints a pretty skewed picture IMO. As S = 10 (motor stops working), O = 10 and D = 2 or 3 (based on detector used), which gives a very high RPN of 200 or 300 - which probably means that this item should be dealt with.

I am looking for some general information on how to design cooling systems. Since I don't have any experience in control engineering a webpage or book teaching the basics would be really appreciated. 

The task itself is pretty straight forward :
- single heat source that produces constant heat (1000W)
- closed water circle necessary (stand alone device)
- Ambient cooling with radiator 
- temperature at heat source should be cooled down and hold at 30°C
- temperature range at heat source should not exceed +-0.5 degree

So, here is the catch: The temperature at the heat source should be the same every day, no matter if its 45°C or 15°C outside. 

So, how would I start regulating this? Over flow volume or cooling fan speed? Or should I use a cooling compressor (like in a fridge) and try to keep the water-basin at a constant temperature?

Anyway, thanks for reading. If you guy can help me that would be great. Or just point me in the general direction where I can learn and understand this issue myself. :)

My question: what size, depth, and volume of tunnels can be created in two years. And can nukes help?",1479025762,"From the wiki, and no spoilers (all of this is revealed in the first chapter)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves

&gt; At some unspecified date in the near future, an unknown force causes the Moon to shatter into seven pieces. As the shattered remnants of the Moon begin to collide with one another, astronomer and science popularizer ""Doc"" Dubois Harris calculates that the number of collisions will increase exponentially. A large number of moon fragments will begin entering Earth's atmosphere, forming a ""white sky"" and blanketing the earth within two years with what he calls a ""Hard Rain"" of bolides; this will cause the atmosphere to heat to incandescence and oceans to boil away, and make Earth uninhabitable for thousands of years. It is decided to evacuate as many people and resources as possible to a ""Cloud Ark"" in orbit, including a ""swarm"" of ""arklet"" habitats that will be able to avoid the debris from the moon — both to attempt to preserve the human race and to give the remaining doomed inhabitants of Earth something to hope for, to prevent civil disorder from breaking out on earth before its surface is destroyed. Each nation on Earth is invited to choose by lot a small number of young people to become eligible to join the Cloud Ark.

So humankind tries to escape the Hard Rain by traveling to space for thousands of years.

My question is, what about tunneling, which early on in the novel is [link goes to pastebin to reveal a minor spoiler](http://pastebin.com/3gEsbvYA)

Ignoring the rest of the novel from here on out, what in real life could be accomplished in two years of humanity turning into diggers, and what technologies would they use? And specifically, could nuclear explosives be used to create large volume chambers deep in the ground?

So I am curious about what can be accomplished in two years of digging in terms of:

+ horizontal depth
+ vertical depth
+ overall volume

if nukes could be used to create small, medium, large chambers quickly, how radioactive would such chambers be, and what if anything could be done to make such chambers useful for storage, living, or even just future use. If a nuke could blow a big but radioactive chamber in the ground, I actually think that would be very useful towards a digger society as a place to dump trash, including dumping any soil and tailings from future tunneling after the earth's surface is uninhabitable.

Then knowing the state of the industry, how about a wild ass guess as to how many such tunnels humanity could create in two years?

37,How to build a horizontal centerless abrasive wheel machine for sharpening shop?,1479010676,"Hey. I need help designing the ideal layout of a horizontal abrasive wheel machine used to reprofile and thin bladed objects, mainly kitchen knives. By horizontal, I mean that the wheel is rotating on a horizontal plane as opposed to a vertical one. Yes, I know there are some machines out there that fit the bill, such as the [makita](https://www.amazon.com/Makita-9820-2-Horizontal-Wheel-Sharpener/dp/B0000223JC) and others ( including the typical vertical [tormek](https://www.amazon.com/Tormek-T-7-Cooled-Precision-Sharpening/dp/B0026LVYYC/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479008300&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tormek+t7) )

I do not want to use any of these. Please do not suggest a prefabricated machine. After hours of conversations in the cutlery online world, horizontal centerless designs are the way to go. They are all custom built (by a subcontractor or by the honemeister themselves), and are a trade secret. I cannot find any designs anywhere (if you can, that's awesome - I'd love to see them). 

Horizontal because it largely eliminates convex grinds that a vertical wheel like the tormek would shape into the blade, and centerless because of the precision a small surface area creates, as well as eliminating dishing that eventually occurs when the entirety of the surface area of a full wheel is not used over time.
I also know that there are horizontal abrasive wheels out there (can't find them online right now - too tired). I do not want to use any of those either! My shop is all about using natural stones (mainly). I have access to a wheel-shaped Japanese stone (I will be using mainly Japanese whetstones) that I will be using. The wheel can be found [here](http://current.aranyik.com/2016/04/building-330-mm-amakusa-wheelstone.html) as well as a similar build by a friend of mine. But the tolerances are too low, the rpm too low, and it's not centerless. But it's a start. It might weigh a 100 pounds or so. It doesn't come centerless, but carving it out won't be much of an issue.

That being said, I am trying to emulate the wheel used in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aytbv06h7B8)

Rudimentary water system and splash guard. I have access to a wheel as mentioned. But I don't know how to put together a motor, preferably with variable speed, and the wheel. Like how do I connect them? I also need to be careful about the water (although there won't be THAT much).

The best lead on a motor with variable speed is using a treadmill motor, which the basics can be viewed in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ6i-CWvgXk)

These are often used for DIY projects such as this, often for ceramic wheel hacks. Anyways, I need it to be precise as to create a even plane of abrasion, so whatever I have connecting the motor and the wheel, needs to be sturdy and well machined. Can a motor be vertically integrated and bear the weight of the wheel? Or should it be set off to the side to avoid such weight, as well as be away from any possible water leakage? I've read somethings thing about direct drive motors. Any input on them? Do I need a gearbox to adjust the speed, or does the treadmill motor and wiring work well enough? I'm able with my hands, but have limited knowledge in electrical and serious mechanical work.

Budget would ideally be under $1k, but the less the better. I appreciate any help you can give. I'd love to crack open this closed secret with your assistance.

The battery hasn't increased in any size since I purchased it. It still fits in my phone, and if I didn't apply any pressure to the lower half of the phone, I wouldn't know which battery I had in my phone. If it had been non-removable, I would have had no idea it was larger than normal.

When comparing the batteries, the swollen one doesn't sit perfectly flat on a flat surface, as I can rock it back and forth about 1mm, while the original doesn't rock at all.

For reference, I've taken a few pictures of the batteries:

[Swollen](http://imgur.com/a/mPbfw)

[Original](http://imgur.com/a/YUNGW)


Given that I've been using it for so long, and it isn't swollen too much, is it safe for me to continue using it? Or have I been fortunate so far, and it's best to dispose of it?

-----


I would really like to continue to use the battery, since I live in Australia (WA), so (AFAIK) purchasing a new (genuine/reliable) battery isn't cheap due to Australia's strict import laws (Anker battery will cost around AUD$50-60 (US$40-50).

My usage so far has been fairly normal, draining it to about 20-30% daily, and then charging it overnight, every night either in a cradle or in my phone using either a 1A, 5V or 2A, 5V charger. I rarely let it reach 0%, only once a month to calibrate it as per Battery University recommendations.",AskEngineers,ldAbl,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5cjq2v/is_it_safe_to_use_a_slightly_swollen_battery/

I understand the basic operation of a coal-fired boiler in a power plant. The coal is crushed to a powder, then blasted into a furnace where it burns to heat water to produce steam. What I am curious about, is what sort of ignition system is needed to burn the pulverized coal? Is there a gas burner used during startup to light the coal and then it burns on its own?

51,Is pursuing a career in Engineering really for me?,1478924278,"I'm currently a 23 year old reluctant college student still trying to figure out just what it is I want to do for a living. I was currently majoring in computer networking but recently began to second guess it due to stress, along with the fact that transferring to a new school basically results in me having to start over. 

My stepdad is constantly telling me that I should pursue engineering because of my passion for building model kits, claiming that I'm already sort of doing engineering type stuff with them. The thing is, this statement makes me a little incredulous because to me the models seem fairly simple and It seems to me that he may be overrating them a bit due to lacking the mental capabilities to do it himself (his words). What do some actual engineers have to say about this? What do simple model kits have to do with engineering?

The position is mid to senior level and requires someone with at least 4-5 years of FPGA design experience. The company is pretty well renowned and numbers between 50 - 100K employees. They seem to do a lot of high-speed SERDES type stuff.
The phone interview will have me writing RTL to solve some presented technical problem for around 30 minutes. This will be my first kind of over the phone code writing interview like this for that long and I'm feeling nervous about it, even after being a hardware engineer technically for about 7 years. While I have written widgets and designs, the past 2 years I've shifted into more of a systems architecture position with little actual writing of RTL. The systems architecture is very specific to the company I currently work for and I don't like it as much.
So I've compiled a list of concepts I should go over and make sure I can code inside and out. I'm seeing if anyone else would have any other ideas of concepts and RTL constructs I should review and add on. It's a broad question, but it can't hurt if I get some idea of something to review that may be prevalent with high-speed SERDES designs I haven't thought of before.

I have offers from two Big Name DoD contractors on the East Coast of the US and need help deciding between the two of them. Pretty pivotal choice for the next 5 years of my career.
****
    Option A:
&gt; **Systems Engineer II [Massachusetts]** - I would be a Reliability, Availbility, Maintainability Engineer for the Whole Life processes. It wouldn't be much of an engineering position as it would be a Managerial position. Using database's, customer facing, doing reliability analysis.

&gt; Pros:

&gt;- I'd probably live in/near Waltham, MA which is a decent area
&gt;- They offered me a... very nice relocation package
&gt;- I have two sets of friends (married couples) within driving distance of this location! Easy to grab a beer after work/go rock climbing.
&gt;- They are an international company which may offer a lot of other positions that I could possibly end up doing down the line.
&gt;- I'd likely travel to a different country once a year, for a week.
&gt;- Sizable salary! Really high. As if they wanted to beat every other offer straight off the bat. Sounds like they really want me.
&gt;- Prestigious name would carry weight on my resume down the line. 
&gt;- The team i'd be working with is senior and could lead me in the right direction if I sway out of my wheelhouse.
&gt;- It's most likely a comfy job.
&gt;- Commute would be opposite peak traffic.

&gt;Cons:

&gt;- Don't know if I'll enjoy doing more management. May be boring at times?
&gt;- If I don't like what I do, it may be harder for me to try and get into a design/testing role
&gt;- I could peg hole myself into a management position and never truly get hands on with the products.
&gt;- I might snub out taking a job that would be more exciting, perhaps more challenging work. :( self doubt
&gt;- I might hate dealing with probability and Poisson's ratio.

****
    Option B:
&gt; **Dynamic Analyst (Systems Controls Modelling) [Connecticut]** - I would be doing design, analysis, and validation testing for fuel injection systems in jet engines which has been my focus of study for the past year. 

&gt; Pros:

&gt; - I would be working with the equations that I was formally taught in undergrad and graduate school.
&gt; - The team I'd be working with is very knowledgeable and willing to help out if I'm ever in doubt. 
&gt; - It's what I went back to school to get my Masters for.
&gt; - Jet engines. Pretty killer and challenging!
&gt; - Systems and controls are exactly why I got into the game. 
&gt; - Is an actual traditional mechanical engineering design role. 
&gt; - Can transfer to a management role later on in years easier.
&gt; - This work would fulfill my validation for getting both engineering degrees... finally haha.

&gt;Cons:

&gt; - I have no friends in the immediate CT area. :( 
&gt; - Slightly comparable salary to option A but under by 10k.
&gt; - Small relocation package.
&gt; - I don't know why, but I never really saw myself living in CT. I may have a undeserved dislike for the state. Meh...
&gt; - [Self Doubt] I'm nervous that the liked me too much and I may fall short of their expectations with these complicated systems :(

The hot plate consists of a large aluminum plate 32"" x 44"" and some sort of heating and control system. The off-the-shelf product heats up to 220 degrees F using 16 100W incandescent lightbulbs.

Aquariums often have a display tank with fish and below that a sump, which is a secondary tank which houses the filters and other unsightly equipment that maintains the water. Typically a return pump in the sump constantly pumps water up to the display tank and an overflow or siphon returns water passively to the sump.

I am wondering if it is possible to have a drain or elevated drain pipe of some diameter that will maintain the water level in the display tank given a constant rate of return.

85,How do CES locks work?,1478778235,"So quite recently someone asked me if I knew how you can make a set of keys, all of which fit the same lock but all of them also fit a different lock only that exact key can open. Like you often see in appartment blocks. After some googling I think they're called Common Entrance Suite locks.
So I thought for a bit about how they might work and to me it would make sence that the common lock simply uses less pins, so the ""base""(?) of the key is the same across all keys, and is used to open the common door, while the tip of the key is unique to that key and is used to open your personal lock. 
Now, like I said I did some googling however I can't find an explaination on how these locks work, and so I have no way to verify whether I'm right. 
Is there anyone here who can tell me if I'm correct, or if not how it does work?

So I want to use a four bar linkage to actuate a flap.
I tried to calculate the required torque at the motor link dependent on its angle (see picture below). I have a simmechanics model for the linkage (based off the four bar template).
What I'm doing atm is giving a constant input torque at the flap's link. I made the motor's link a weld joint so I can read and output the constraint torque to workspace. I am then setting the angle via the rigid transform to say 10 different values. I simulate each position and collect the constraint torque. I can then graph the torque and angle.

I kinda think I'm missing something out. What can I do to make this simulation better, so I can try out different geometries without all the pain of manually entering angles? It would even be enought to get the rigid transform angle from workspace but I can't find an option for that...

Plus the enclosure is terribly sealed and leaks all over, so adding some gasket material should help the low end.

40,Second Degree in Engineering? Too late in the game,1478540424,"Hey all, 

I'm a junior in college at a large state university.  I did my first two years with full intent of going into an allied health career.  When I transferred to a university I was talked into becoming a microbiology major. BIG MISTAKE. I found out I hate microbiology.  Well, then I started questioning my entire career outlook. I just switched my major to kinesiology with the hopes of getting a masters in biomedical engineering with a specialty in biomechanics/muscle and joint mechanics.  However, I'm still hung up on possibly nursing. I realized that my favorite classes are math and anatomy, sometimes chemistry. What I deduced from this is, I love problem solving. I also love building things and putting things together, I like mechanics in a way.  The reason I was drawn to nursing is it is hands on work with a medical aspect to it.  What I am hung up on now is, what do I do.  My kinesiology degree lines me up well for both. I have done my research, there is a school that will allow me to do a masters in biomedical engineering without a BS in engineering. There are also plenty of accelerated nursing and direct entry masters in nursing programs. My thoughts are this: I don't want to spend all day in a cubicle. The more hands on the happier. I want regulated hours where I can go home and have a life of my own. Possibly have a family one day. I don't want to struggle to eat, but I don' want to become a workaholic. 

I feel like I can only see myself in nursing for a few years. Unless I switch to primary care nursing, it is not a job I want to retire from. I don't think running around 12 hours straight is something I will want when I am 40 yrs old.

As of right now I don't know what to do. I was told that a biomedical engineering degree is useless and to do a mechanical engineering program with a focus in biomechanics. What ever gets me good pay and as much hands on work as possible the better (yes I can handle some office work). 

So where does that leave us. I'm three semesters away from graduating. Its going to be tough to finish on time. My main focus is finish this kinesiology degree asap.Then figure out how to do the rest of this. I'm okay going back to a community college for a semester or two to bang out some unfinished prefers. But I ideally wart to begin working as soon as possible. I know I messed up and wasted a lot of time. But I just need advice on how to sort this out.

41,[UK] Advice on how to get my first non-production engineering job?,1478538717,"So far all of my work experience has been in and around shop floors and I'd rather move towards a more design/development based role.

Firstly I worked for a few months at an Automotive OEM shop floor restocking their kanban system before going to university and gaining a degree in BEng Automotive/Mechanical Engineering. During that time I did a year's internship for a Tier 1 supplier doing projects based around the principles of lean and six sigma, I didn't particularly get much satisfaction from that type of work but it was the only internship offer I received.

I graduated in 2015 and applied for ~100 jobs in all relevant engineering roles before eventually being offered a role last October for another Tier 1 manufacturer as a group leader. This was a decent step up from my previous production jobs but I still find the work unsatisfying and honestly quite boring.

I always feel prangs of envy towards people who have more design based roles as this was by far my favourite part of my degree and the reason why I went for the degree in the first place, yet with all of the internship roles I applied for, ~100 applications in 2015 and the 48 applications I've done over the past month I've had a grand total of 0 interviews for design jobs. 

My CV has been checked by enough people to know its as good as I can make it, so I must be in need of something else to make myself more employable as I don't really have a portfolio due to lack of real work experience in this area, only really consisting of course work and formula student.

I am hoping this is the right place to ask my question so here it goes.  Is there technology or methods used today to test an active pipeline for its metallurgy without having to take the pipe out of service, remove a section of pipe and have it sent out for testing?

If the only way to determine a pipes metallurgy is by removing a section, how long does it normally take for a lab to run a test on the pipe and come back with a pipe spec?  The reason I ask is because I would like to replace a section of pipe at a power plant.  It is in our best interest to have the pipe correctly specified per-fabricated before installation because the new pipe section will be welded to the existing.  Due to issues with dissimilar metal welding it is imperative that we determine the grade of pipe being used so we can mimic it and reinstall without an issue.

I'm turning here initially, because I don't want to be *that* guy who shows up to his interviews completely clueless :).


With that context, my questions are for the software engineers in this fold of the industry (or nearby).  What is the nitty gritty of the workplace environment?  Which skills are valuable in finance, in contrast to the standard tech company (expressed differently, which sections of my education and interests should I emphasize or ignore)?  What systems are you building that are unique to finance?  What are the industry's characteristic problems, and who are the leaders in solutions?  Are there any resources allocated towards research that us university-children are so excited about, like [buzzword warning] block chains/cryptocurrencies?  What's the day-to-day work environment like?  How integrated are the various software teams (i.e. developers, security, admin, etc.)?  Overall, how intellectually engaging is the work compared to other industries?  Answers to any questions will be met with smiles, up-votes, and warm-fuzzy-feelings.  If you'd like to PM me for privacy reasons (talking about employers publicly on the internet is scary!), that's all good, too!


Thank you in advance!  P.S. If you have any recommendations for other places to post this question, they would be very much appreciated!

67,Resources for firearms engineering,1478388899,"( Let me know if this is more appropriate for another subreddit, and I will gladly move it) 

Some background: I am a senior mechanical engineering student trying to figure out what I want to do with my degree. I am also very passionate about firearms. Next semester I have a relatively light load of 9 hours to graduate, and I am trying to prepare for a possible career in firearms engineering. I am interested in the internal mechanisms that make firearms work, as well as the aerodynamics involved in projectile flight. 

I have been looking for resources to learn more about these subjects with little success. Most of the literature I have found is geared towards lay men rather than engineers. My current plan is to study these subjects in my free time next semester, and if anyone can recommend any good texts to that end I would greatly appreciate it. 

Additionally, if anyone is willing to be ""interviewed"" or just offer career advice, talk about what it's like to work in the industry, maybe good industries to start in and transfer to firearms? Part of the problem I've seen is that the industry seems to be fairly small, especially in America, and not close to where I currently live.

He converted to full time from an intern. When he was an intern his performance was, ""needs improvement, but shows promise"".

Technically he is average, but he has huge gaps with attention to detail, dependability, and follow through. Numerous small issues.

I feel that PART of the situation is that he's not motivated to work harder due to his remuneration. But I have a hard time preemptively increasingly compensation when the performance still isn't there.

83,Mechanical questions from an EE,1478311684,"I'm looking to build a pickup winding machine, of which there are many, but I haven't seen any DIY designs that fit what I want to do. 

The general design requirements are to be able to spin a pair of bobbins at least at 1000 RPM, being fed 40-45 AWG copper wire, with a servo controlling the position of the wire on the bobbin. If the bobbin is spinning, the second motor should raster the wire across the coil. 

The number of rotations needs to be programmable with a tolerance of 2-5%. Meaning if I tell the motor to spin 10,000 rotations I want to have it spin exactly between 10k rotations, give or take 200-500 spins. 

What I'm thinking is a stepper motor that turns an axle, with the bobbins affixed to each end of the axle driven by a gear mechanism. 

The maximum weight the axle should handle is under a pound, and I'd like the mechanism to be reliable for 150k rotations. 

For the servo mechanism, I was thinking of a 180° servo moving a lateral gear mechanism back and forth, with wire guides on either end. The catch is the force it takes to split the wire is tiny, and I would like the pulling force of the stepper motor (which im under the impression needs to accelerate) to be compensated for, making the force the wire undergoes to be constant throughout the winding process. 

What I don't know is what kind of gears I should be looking at, reliable manufacturers, what my motor specs need to be, and how much I should budget for these requirements.

Edit: additional things that would make my life easier are stepper/servo motors with accurate position feedback, but I don't know what specs to look at or reliable sources for that kind of thing. ",AskEngineers,Holy_City,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5b7q8z/mechanical_questions_from_an_ee/

Recently, I have been considering changing careers, and I think electrical engineering sounds like a challenge that I can also enjoy.

98,Building a 777-ft tall stone tower,1478230999,"I'm writing a story set in a secondary world in which some lost culture constructed a 777-ft tall, 7-sided tower of stone (specifically, marble... but with granite load-bearing walls perhaps). Magic exists in the secondary world, but it is limited, so I would like to try to stay closer to reality with regards to the issues that such a building would face (hence my questions below). I am by no means mathematically gifted, so I need help working out a few of the details of the structure. 

1. How thick would the walls have to be at the base? I understand that the Washington Monument was originally supposed to be 600 feet tall until the Army Engineer Corps calculated that the 15-ft thick walls wouldn't support a structure of that height, necessitating it being only built to 555 feet; and I understand that Philadelphia City Hall (height: 548 feet), made of the same materials I mentioned above, has walls 22 feet thick at the base. For a 777-ft tall stone tower, what would this number be? 

2. Wind resistance? Modern towers are somewhat flexible, or employ techniques like a buttressed core, so they sway but don't topple. Stone towers, however, need to be able to resist the vector forces of wind, right? Or find other ways to mitigate it. The Pharos of Alexandria (350-450 feet tall according to ancient sources) seemed to have a lot of windows in its lower level so as not to be blown over, but the tallest freestanding masonry structure in the world, the Anaconda Smelter Stack (height: 585 feet) has no windows at all, though it is fairly aerodynamic (being a cylinder). 
How would a structure like this -- especially one located in a seaside harbour -- counter the wind influence? This is the one and only part of the structure's engineering that I am comfortable attributing to magic but, if there are tricks that the builders might have used, I'm happy to point to those first.

3. Earthquake proofing? I've mentioned the Pharos of Alexandria, which was an amazing feat of ancient engineering -- one of the Seven Wonders of the World, even. It stood for more than 1,500 years until it was finally toppled in 1303 AD... in a massive earthquake. Is there anything the Egyptians could have done to better earthquake-proof the Pharos? Anything the builders of the 777-ft tower could do?

8,"Flow rate through a pipe, but reduced to smaller diameter.",1478207683,"I work at a marine terminal where we receive crude oil from barges. Barges dock up, and hey discharge approximately 50,000 BBLS of crude to us each transfer.

Okay I have a question. A marine terminal was designed to have 10 inch piping from terminal to the storage tanks. All of our other terminals are either 6"" or 8"". They were thinking (in theory) that if they designed this one with 10"" pipes, flow rate would be faster. Well the problem, is almost every header manifold that we hook up to (barge side) their barge is only capable of connecting to an 8"" pipeline. So we have to send over a 10"" to 8"" reducer, and they install the reducer which connects their 8"" piping to our 10"" piping in order for them to pump off their crude oil.

So is there really any benefit of us having 10"" diameter pipeline when in essence it is just being reduced to 8"" VIA the reducer? Isn't it true that the limiting factor is the smaller piping. We have 200 ft of pipeline but it's coming from an 8""inch pipeline.

9,Will this passive desiccant attachment set up in a pressurized gas tank work?,1478205280,"Okay so I am working on a school project that involves moisture and a compressed gas, the gas is compressed to about 100psi/6.9bar

So the tank will have an attached cartridge with desiccant to suck out the moisture out of the air (my idea for moisture control). You can put desiccant in the tank already, but I want to come up with an easily removable cartridge for it. I can think of a few applications for this if i prove it works.

My question is, will the gas inside the tank be able to saturate without any cycling through the cartridge (because it is not an option)?? 

The set up will look something like the attached picture

Since there is no motion of the gas other than heating and cooling down (the pressure vessel will be outside in the sun) I'd like to find out if anyone can simulate this situation in their minds

* Can we build robots, autonomous ones, purely out of a simple electric source and lots of gears?
* Can we build a computer with the same power as modern ones?
* Are cars possible with just a huge battery and more gears?

18,Calculating objects of different sizes and their visibility inside tubes of various diameter when scanned with an x-ray.,1478163397,"Hi, 

First of all I'm on a mobile phone and apologize for any mistakes below. 

I'm wanting to put together a calculator in excel to assit me to work out how visible objects of different densities will be while being scanned inside a tube that can vary in diameter. I'm looking for the most simplistic equation to use. I understand that x-ray absorption isn't limited to an objects density but for this calculator denisity will be fine. 

Example:  An x-ray machine is scanning a tube with a diameter of 100mm inside the tube is water with a specific gravity of 1.0. The x-ray machine performs an offset calibration before the tube fills with water so the tube is essentially invisible. If I introduce a 1.0mm stainless steal ball into the water flow and this ball has a specific gravity of 8.0 its visible due to the denisity difference and the detection threshold I've set in the scanning software. If I introduce a 1.0mm aluminum ball with a specific gravity of 2.5 its no longer visible at the same detection threshold. So my options are to change the diameter the tube the water flows through or to increse the size of the aluminum ball. 

What would be the best way to calculate the detectability of different sized objects if I know their specific gravity? The variables will be the size of the object, the diameter of the tube and the specific gravity of the fluid traveling through the tube.

I think I understand the math but I'm not very confident and kind of hope to have a bit of a discussion about it.

The scope is to pretty much relocate a portion of a 24"" natural gas main underground.  From the gas house the pipe is initially underground but protrudes through the earth, is elevated about 20 feet (to clear an obstacle) then runs about 200 ft horizontally and goes back underground.  I am taking out this obstacle and per request of the owner they would like to relocate the above ground pipe beneath the grade at the same elevation of the pipe coming from the gas house.

The job is pretty simple I guess, but I would like some nationally recognized standards to read and refernce to make sure I don't miss anything, but don't want to spend $1,000 on different books looking for the right one.

The NYC building code has info on gas pipelines but I think it is only refereeing to residential use and not industrial.  I also found the AGA-Z380115 and NFPA-54 but not sure which ones trumps the other.  The NFPA 54 book has some good info on pipe sizing, installation and inspection and looks like it will be sufficient but I don't want to do all the work per this code and have someone tell me I should have used AGA instead.

**EDIT:  1**

I read some of the applications for the NFPA 54 (or also known as AGA Z223.1) and it clearly states that the code does not apply to fuel gas piping in electric utility power plants, and since this gas main fuels a power boiler, it seems as if NFPA will be a safety reference, or secondary code for educational purposes.

I have also came across ASME B31.1 which is for power piping used in industrial plants for electric generating stations, as well as ASME B31.8 which is the gas transmission code.  I will skim through each one and see if they reference AGA at all as an applicable reference.

My gut is telling me to go with ASME over AGA but I will update once I know more.

**Edit:  2**

Just got done reading the NYC building code at it too states that the code does not apply to fuel gas piping in public utility power plants and atomic energy plants, so this code is out as well, although it does state the NYCFD has to oversee everything if the operating pressure is above 15 psig....

**Edit:  3**

Just read ASME B31.8.... and well now I'm more confused than when I started.  Basically, from what I read so far, this is the only book that can be used for fuel gas piping in electronic utility power plants.  With that being said it also stated that it cannot be used for piping after the meter set assembly.  This is pretty much the take off point from the main natural gas supplier to NYC.

ASME B31.8 is a code for piping from the gas manufacturer/refiner to the gas meter and not beyond.

I'm back to square one, and it looks like the only one left is ASME B31.1.  After lunch I will read this through once more and try to find a statement or requirement that won't allow me to use this book either.

**Edit:  4**

I think /u/TrainOfThought6 hit the nail right on the head.  It make sense that ASME B31.8 is used for gas transmission up to the meter where as ASME B31.1 would be used for any piping after that.  Still doing my reading on ASME B31.1 but I haven't found anywhere that says I cannot use it as my governing code for this project.",AskEngineers,bnich11,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5apz4p/natural_gas_pipeline_code/

* Let's say we've got a stream of gasoline that's come from the FCC at a refinery which contains significant amounts of sulfur in it. Far too much sulfur for that FCC gasoline to be blended into the gasoline pool and sold. My understanding is that that stream will need to go through some form of hydrotreating to remove the sulfur before it can be sold. When it does go through hydrotreating, how does that process affect properties of the gasoline like Octane Rating and Reid Vapor Pressure? Does Octane rating fall after going through that process?
* What are typical sulfur limits like for Alkylation processes? Do the limits change depending on whether you run a HF Alky or a SA Alky? Will sulfur poison the acid catalyst or cause increased acid usage? Will sulfurs in the reaction retard conversion?

35,Variable Amplitude Fatigue Analysis - Super Confused on how I proceed,1477749673,"Hey everyone I'd be really grateful if anyone could help me out here, been going round in circles for two weeks now and I need to get going soon. Jumping right to the point, here's my problem:

We are currently working on a student project and designing a Wind Turbine for future opensource use, much like the NREL Wind Turbine project, but this time with a 150m Rotor diameter. I must say that it's a part of our course and each of us are looking into different aspects. I'm working on the FEM and Fatigue analysis of the Hub and Machine Bed.

Here's what I already know:

Use a SN curve, Modified Goodman diagram and Miners rule to predict failure. I've got a load time series and I wrote a rain-flow count script to give me the range and the number of occurrences of each Force range.

I've been reading a lot of papers and watching a lot of videos, what I fail to understand is this:

SN Curves are generated by plotting varying amplitudes with a mean stress of zero and joining the points on a log-plot. But what I've been seeing around is references that say you need to make sure you consider a SN Curve with the same ""range"" as your stresses in consideration. I know that the Range = (Minimum Stress/Maximum Stress). But how does this influence the outcome? Can I not just consider my amplitude and use a general SN curve as my first step? If not how do I get a SN curve based on my Range? 

Once I figure out the range issue, I put in all my correction factors onto my SN curve and proceed with a Modified Goodman Diagram. Here I'm not sure what I need to take on the vertical axis. The horizontal is the ultimate stress (mean stress) and the vertical needs to be the amplitude. What I'm seeing in references is that they pick the amplitude based on the number of cycles they want the component to survive, then go to their SN curve and pick a corresponding Stress Amplitude. I'm going to have quite a few stress ranges and I was wondering if I need to pick a stress corresponding to 10^6 (which is what we usually design a component if we seek infinite life) or maybe 10^3 (in case I got a range that happens just 1000 times). As both the cases are going to give me very different slopes. 

Once I got my Goodman line drawn, I put in the yield stress line at a 45 degree angle from the horizontal axes (mean stress) and get my enclosed area where the component would be safe. Let's say the component is safely under the curve. How do I count this into the damage criteria (Miners rule) since I do not have a relation between the stress and cycles to failure anymore. I need to somehow take my information from the modified Goodman diagram and implement it onto my SN Curve - how do I do this? Do I get some kind of constant from the modified Goodman Diagram that I need to multiply into my SN curve? Like some sort of correction factor?

Thanks a lot for those who went through this post and everyone who can help in any way. Answering or pointing me in a right direction regarding even a single of the three doubts would help me a lot.",AskEngineers,kepler456,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5a0k35/variable_amplitude_fatigue_analysis_super/

48,Using an antique US 110V lamp in UK (230-ishV),1477690822,"So, I'm a UK guy dating a US gal based over here for a few years. She has a bunch of US electronics, some of which require a transformer for use - mainly things that have motors or circuitry that can't handle the beefier 230 (or thereabouts) volts we have here.

She does have an antique lamp that she's lamented she doesn't have a transformer for. It's a simple lamp with three screw-type (Edison?) bulbs, and it had three filament 60W bulbs in.

Now - I have a PhD in Aeronautical Engineering, but Electricity has always been a bit of a mystery to me. I tend to say it's because you can't *see* electricity, but then my job title includes the word ""aerodynamicist"", so that's not the best excuse, really.

I changed the plug from a US to a UK one today (complete with a 13A fuse), and swapped the bulbs for three 7W LED ones. My thinking was that with the higher voltage, they'd draw less current for the same wattage (P=IV, right?), and with the reduced wattage, the lamp would use less power overall.

She came home today, and is worried about using it because she's worried the internal wiring can't handle the higher voltage. I've assured her that the only thing the internal bits might not tolerate is increase current, and this setup means it won't happen.

I've only really used college level (UK college = high school) physics to arrive at that conclusion, so I'd just like to double check there's nothing I've done that could cause an issue.

Can anyone tell me I'm OK/going to start a fire?

If it's OK, the next step will be to replace the flex with a decent, earthed, cable since the support on this lamp is made of metal. ",AskEngineers,thesaxoffender,/r/AskEngineers/comments/59x5cq/using_an_antique_us_110v_lamp_in_uk_230ishv/

53,Continuous pad dyeing machine: keeping the fabric centered,1477672129,"The fabric is 60"" wide, and folded down to 30"". The selvedge edge curls a bit and so it a little thicker than the other edge. The length of the folded fabric is 60"", and is baste stitched or safety pinned to form a loop of ~30"". 

Another problem I haven't been able to solve: as the fabric loop moves over and between the rollers, it wanders toward one end and bunches there. In the commercial process, the fabric is on a roll at each end, and thus each inch of fabric only passes through the mechanism once. In mine, each inch will pass through at least 5400 times (60RPM for an hour and a half), so a little bit of wander adds up. I need to eliminate that or compensate for it.

Taking a cue from my bandsaw, I tried the idea of a crowned pulley and added a convex rod below the spreader (ti bends toward the inside of the machine, which also holds the fabric tighter against the spreader) for the fabric to flow over. The fabric is not under tension so I wonder if that doesn't make the bar ineffective. (Edit: I put a bit of pipe as a temporary bottom roller and it seemed to help a little.)

My wife and I have a business where we dye a lot of fabric, so the whole point of the project is to create a process I don't have to babysit for two hours like I do with conventional methods. I've enjoyed the project so far, and learned a lot, there's just this one issue left.

I'm the lowest level engineer in my department. My job is to test our product to make sure it works according to the customer's specifications. For this latest project however, the customer has not provided specifications. The lead project engineer in my company was very concerned about scope creep, and his solution to this problem was to write out exactly the tests I am to perform in the contract in very specific detail.

The problem is, this contract was written long before analysis of the product revealed the key areas in which it needed to be tested and also long before the customer's test review process approved the planned tests. This has never been done before on any project at my company! My boss and I raised hell at a status meeting because we were bound by contract to these specific tests when the customer might not even be interested in them.

Our leadership relented and negotiated with the customer to remove the clause blocking us from adding additional tests, but left a clause in place that says we need to perform those contractual tests at a minimum.

Now, several months later in the bowels of the customer review process, the lead project engineer and customer are singing a different tune. They've identified several tests that they don't believe are relevant or were incorrect... and these tests are delineated in the contract. This is exactly why my boss and I raised hell about the contract.

Now, my boss is on family leave for several months so I report to *his* boss, who is brand spankin' new to the company. He doesn't share the same view about the contract and thinks I ought to ignore the contract and perform the tests my lead engineer and customer agree on; that way I don't rock the boat more than I already have.

People keep saying how **business as usual** is not sustainable, but I don't think many people realise this doesn't only mean what governments and huge corporations do, but also what we do as individuals.

78,Help understanding 2^(k-p) Fractional Factorial Experiment Design and Analysis,1477588154,"Hey, I am trying to understand what my title mentions and I am running into two primary questions:  

1. What is the pattern to the pluses and minuses in the design matrix. I understand that they are all orthogonal and can be checked by equations to ensure they are orthogonal but I want an equation that provides how to design it, not how to guess and check it. (e.g. if I want to run a 2^(3-1) experiment, how do I set up the design matrix?).  

2. How do I calculate percent variation? 3 examples I found online don't show or explain any equations to calculate anything in the design matrix. They don't explain why I need to divide the q-values by the number of experiment, nor how to calculate the percent variation.

I googled and googled and found this study, ""Acoustical Application Tests of Perforated Metals"" Which showed that no matter the type of perforation, there was little to no change in the amount of sound that is transmitted through the panel.

A [popular modification](https://oscarliang.com/eachine-e010-mods-1/) is to cut two of the four blades off each propeller; this slightly reduces the quad's thrust, but also makes the props more efficient so they load the motors less. As a result they draw less power and the battery lasts appreciably longer, going from around 5 minutes to around 6 (this is with no additional weight; people like to put tiny first-person-view cameras on these, but I've kept mine without as I intend to use a bigger quad for that). However, because the two-bladed props have less air resistance they also cause the motors to spin faster, which is evident from the higher sound pitch of the quad in flight.

I've done the mod and though the quad is a slight bit less peppy in flight it does stay longer in the air. I don't mind the decreased performance as I only ever fly the minuscule thing indoors, but I worry about motor life - these tiny motors are already expected to eat their brushes in a matter of hours to begin with, and I'd rather not have to replace them any more often than necessary.

1,"I'm a first year engineering student. I'm doing well, but considering switching career paths to being a teacher. Help me decide?",1477512332,"I enjoy studying math and sciences. I enjoy designing things to solve problems. The engineering itself doesn't worry me, the stresses involved do.

Most engineers I hear from work between 60-80 hours per week, with engineers at the most innovative companies typically working closer to 80. This is obviously much more than the ~40 hours per week a teacher would put in. Engineers don't seem to make much more money to compensate for that amount of time, especially considering they work 4/3 the time as teachers.

As an engineer, what kinds of stresses do you face, whether directly or indirectly, due to your job? Can you easily balance family life with work (my biggest worry)? Do you face financial hardship?

3,Seemingly easy Geometry question but it seems impossible to me. Need help! Rhomboids.,1477502562,"Well, I'll be quick. You know rhomboids, those shapes that look like a slanted rectangle. The thing is they usually say ""You can transform a rhomboid into a rectangle by cutting from this point and putting the triangle on the other side."". [This, basically](https://puu.sh/rWoAr/0f7b5d2eaf.png)

That's fine, and true, area remains the same, fine. But there's a problem. In real life, if you shear a rectangle to transform it into a rhomboid, it comes out shorter in height. Then you do the cutting thingy and you end up with a rectangle the same base length as the rhomboid, but less tall - with less area. This can't be possible because you didnt remove anything, just slanted it. You can check some drawings I made.

[Here](https://puu.sh/rWoNY/a0fd10d13d.png) that rule is valid, you end up with a rectangle like the left one, but it's because the rhomboid sides are longer than the rectangle's. It has a larger area.

[But here](https://puu.sh/rWoUB/f9a202b9e3.png) the two shapes are techically the same area because the sides are equal (you can measure it) but the rectangle you end up with after the cutting thing is less tall. When you do the cutting process, the blue one has less area than the red one.

But how does this happen in real life, if slanting a rectangle (not changing side length) makes it shorter, but area has to remain the same because you didn't remove any material?

Edit: I know this sounds like a 3rd grade question, but I do think this is more complex. All of my friends are baffled by this.

17,Advice for a young engineer,1477465370,Hey engineers. Senior ME needing some advice from whoever. This is my last year at university and I have absolutely no idea the direction I want my life to go. I have enjoyed every second of undergraduate work but I have been rather pessimistic about the 'real world' after hating my summer internship. I dreaded going to work everyday as I mainly worked as a CAD monkey for a small company. I realized sitting at a desk everyday staring at a computer screen really doesn't give me something to look forward to when I wake up every morning. I did not come here to sob about my problems rather to look for advice from engineers that have gone through what I am going through. How did you find the job that best fit you? I fear that since I have experience as a design engineer that is where I will end up working right out of college and never stray from that path. Will I find the right job eventually if I am persistent? ,AskEngineers,abilligmeier6,/r/AskEngineers/comments/59g7gr/advice_for_a_young_engineer/

19,"What happens to static pressure in a closed loop pipe that is originally at ambient after a pump is turned on, aka velocity increases?",1477446843,"I'm looking to characterize loss coefficients of a number of fittings in a closed loop (picture a simple oval, or elongated rectangle).  The system will basically use a pump to bring the flow up to a high speed, and have pressure sensors upstream and downstream of the fitting.  

To fill the system, there will be an opening where it can be filled with water.  Once full, it will simply be capped off.  Prior to turning on the pump, I can only assume the static pressure must be atmospheric.  Once the pump is turned on the dynamic pressure will obviously increase.  However, what happens to the static pressure?  I'm looking to ensure my sensors are manufactured to the correct range, and my pipes can withstand the pressure.  Generally, you would lose pressure as you incur losses around the corners, drag on the walls, etc. so pressure would decrease around the loop (from pump outlet back to inlet).  However, in this case, would my pressure drop below atmospheric?  Can I assume 1 atm at the pump outlet?

20,"Let's talk Haydon Kerk/AMETEK drives and motors, specifically ASCII control of them... with linux.",1477444017,"More than anything, this is a bit of a ttyUSB0 question. I can do what I want in windows, but I need to get this going on linux. I'm willing to bet a dollar it is a simple thing I am overlooking.

Here's what I'm doing-

A Haydon Kerk PCM4826E motor drive and 57F4A-3.25-099 motor, controlling it via a manufacturer provided instruction set. A DC power supply is powering the necessary components.

The end goal is to send ASCII commands to the drive for operations as referenced in the comms manual:

http://www.haydonkerk.com/Portals/0/IDEA%20Support/IDEA%202013%20Manuals/IDEA%20Drive%20Communication%20Manual.pdf

The catch here is that I am tasked towards using linux to send commands from the in-house control software to a bicycle hub psuedo-CNC machine.

The rig takes a DXF file and parses it into a script for the machine to control the position and diameter of a ball end mill live tooling head. The machine uses a main spindle motor on a VFD to turn the part, a stepper along the axis which essentially ping pongs along the axis to move the live tooling head, and an iris arrangement of end mills to cut the part. The DXF parsing software sets the speeds and feeds, so the rig itself just chugs along with a few through beam eyes to make sure material is where it is supposed to be and etc...

In the past, I've used Thompson Linear motors and drives on a PLC to do this. The direction we're looking to go is to get away from that and towards controlling via a PC. The HK/AMETEK guys do not have any documentation towards linux, and probably never will. I think it is a problem on my end that they will likely not be too helpful with.

Referencing the HK comms manual, page 5 and 6:

http://www.haydonkerk.com/Portals/0/IDEA%20Support/IDEA%202013%20Manuals/IDEA%20Drive%20Communication%20Manual.pdf

The ASCII command language can issue commands to the PCM4826E drive for control.

Great, easy to do in windows.

Linux... not so much.

I pulled up gtkterm to throw out an ASCII file with the command:

Q-3200,1200,2000,40000,100000,1600,500,1900,2000,50,8

with a carriage return at the end, which more or less runs the motor backwards.

The problem seems to be that despite setting the comms parameters for the drive on page 6 of the manual:

BPS: 57600
Data/Parity/Stop: 8N1
Flow Control: None

I am getting no results. I'd like to solve this on the bench before getting the HK/AMETEK guys on the phone, since it is probably a very simple fix.

The end result will be using the program command in the instruction set to parse the DXF file, generate a program for the drive, upload that program to the drive, and have the machine ready to run for a batch of parts.

However, getting a simple command issued to run the drive isn't working, much less uploading a program to it.

Is there something I am missing here?

I've tried cat'ing to the usb device via ttyUSB0, tried writing to the /dev/bus/usb/00x/00x file, all to no avail. gtkterm doesn't seem to want to play. lsusb shows the device, dmesg shows the right entries for plugging it in and what not.

21,What is a formula that represents motor runaway?,1477442704,"Im looking to explain why a DC series motor would runaway when a load is disconnected. From my understanding, its the following:

As the load is disconnected, speed increases. This causes Eo (armature voltage, counter-emf, induced voltage, etc) to increase and current to decrease. To compensate the loss of current, more flux is produced with the rising voltage and therefore speed increases. This is a cycle that happens until the motor fails.

What I'm looking for is a mathematical explanation for why this is. If somebody could point me in the right direction as to what could support this assumption, it would be greatly appreciated.

51,Crystallization Process Queries,1477364840,"
Hi! As the title suggests, I would like to clarify a few doubts which have surfaced as I have started to read on industrial crystallization processes. Specifically sugar production.

Books on crystallization such as (Crystallization Fourth Edition) and (Handbook of Industrial Crystallization) have given be some knowledge of the basics of crystal formation and growth.

So my question would be, I have read that for continuous processes we are able to utilize the MSMPR model to design a crystallizer. Is there an equivalent design method for batch processes? If I were to use a continuous process, is it prevalent in the industry to use multiple crystallizers in series to obtain products of different sizes? I cant seem to visualize the production line right now.

I would also like some advice on how to move the crystallized products. If a significant amount of the crystal is produced in the crystallizer via a continuous process, how would said crystals be transported to the downstream processes of drying and sorting?

I would appreciate any advice I get. Especially if you are currently/or have ever worked in a sugar production plant.",AskEngineers,SaviorOfTowers,/r/AskEngineers/comments/598vk8/crystallization_process_queries/

Currently I'm using a heatsink and fan which works fine, but I would rather use passive cooling for a variety of reasons.  I'm planning to just use some solid aluminum bar stock, but I'm having trouble figuring out how large the heat sink needs to be to actually dissipate the heat.  Aluminum 6061-T6 seems to be the most commonly available bar stock, and from [this page](http://www.engineersedge.com/properties_of_metals.htm) I worked out that a 2in x 1in x 24in bar of aluminum would weigh 2.134kg, and that multiplied by 1256 J/kg-c (specific heat from that page) would mean that it would take 2679 J to heat it 1 degree C.  So my 50 watt LED (assuming it was only producing heat) would take ~53 seconds to heat that bar of aluminum 1 degree C.

So I think I have half the solution?  

**My question is:** how do I then figure out how quickly that heat dissipates.  I assume it's something like surface area * conductivity or something like that, but I haven't been able to nail down any formulas from my searching online.

And my second question would be, was my first half even right?

Oh and a bonus 3rd question: is there a better assumption I can use for how much heat my LED's will produce?  I'm using a watt measuring thingy, so I know the LED is using 50w of energy, but obviously that doesn't all go towards heat.  Any ideas what a good estimate would be for what percentage of that is actually heat?

Assuming you get the steering wheel to mate-up to the column correctly, and get the wiring done correctly, with the inertial sensor installed*, would there be any deployment-related safety issues? 

The recipient car will not have the same impact behavior as the donor (different crumpling/impact absorption).

From what I've read elsewhere, all airbags deploy at approximately 7 Gs of force, regardless of vehicle.

It works, but I would like to improve it.  I already understand that I can use more turns of a  thinner wire to yield a coil which operates at higher voltage and lower current, or reverse that and have a lower voltage higher current setup- maybe the overall watts remains the same and the resultant flux is the same, or maybe one would make the case that more turns can fit onto this coil when they are a smaller diameter wire and so that is the way to maximize gauss in something like this.  
Secondly, I took a guess at the core profile ratio and diameter- I think right now my diameter is around .1"" and the overall diameter at the flanges is around .24""  What dimension(s) will most effect my overall magnetic pull?  Are the steel (I don't have any pure iron handy) flanges helping, hurting, or not effecting my magenetic output?  I could press on some plastic or other material flanges if needed.

I have literally been told my structural design was in valid due to an extreme torsional irregularity because of a 0.003 inch diaphragm deflection.

My thought is: why does torsional irregularity matter if your structure is so rigid? I'm curious if anyone has experienced this issue and if so, how did you get past the plans examiner/ building offical/ third party engineer review?",AskEngineers,legofarley,/r/AskEngineers/comments/58vpyx/rigid_diaphragms_with_torsional_irregularity_us/
91,Improving Rainwater Capture during a Storm,1477160372,"I have a water tank that stands on ground level.  I have a pipe that runs from the gutter outlet at roof level into the TOP of the tank.  So the water exits the pipe and falls to the level of water in the tank.

Problem is the PVC pipe cannot handle the volume of water during a rainstorm, so water ends overflowing at the top catchment and I lose a bunch of water.

My feeling tells me that I should connect the pipe to the BOTTOM of the tank.

This will mean that there is a higher water column (from the catchment at the top, to the level of the water in the tank).

The higher water column means bigger pressure differential and thus higher flow - especially when the tank is empty.

Am I missing something fundamental here?",AskEngineers,ProviNoobVet,/r/AskEngineers/comments/58uez9/improving_rainwater_capture_during_a_storm/
92,Help sorting/sharing email between co-workers,1477159836,"My division in the company works on a few hundred jobs a year. In a given year I get about 10,000 work related emails (averaging 30 / job).  We constantly have clients coming back to us looking for work we've done 5, 10, or 20 years ago.  I'm looking for a way to store/sort these emails by job where everyone in my division can have a papertrail of the back and forth with the client.  We typically copy everyone into an email chain already so I'm not overly concerned with sharing information related to the job.  I do not want to share my entire inbox because there are some company related documents that come through (paycheck, company health, etc.).  Also my inbox is just a dump of everything. No sorting so far. So going through 100k emails to find an old job can be daunting (especially since some clients don't use the best subject lines).

Here is what I've tried and why I haven't found a solution:

* Try copying emails into the job folder (this is just a server folder sorted by client and job # - it's currently used to hold our analysis files, design inputs, drawings, and calculations). My problem with this is that for some reason Outlook copies the email by the subject line. So if someone replies to the email it wants to overwrite it. Unless I want to manually change the file name for each RE: email this seems like a pain.  Also I think it could be hard to track which emails are copied over and which are not due to this poor copying technique.
* Sort emails into Outlook folders then share the folders with my team. I think this could potentially work well but it seems like permissions are set on a per folder basis. So if I want this to work I have to re-share each folder with everyone on the team.

Our current method is to print every email that comes through, and everything we send out. Then we store everything in binders.  While this works really well for looking up old work, I can't help but think that there should be an easier way.

I am not looking for a content management system. We looked into those last year and didn't like the loss of freedom that came with them.  I'm just looking for a way to create a papertrail for a job that individual engineers can access.  Any ideas?

93,Mechanical AND gate for rotating shafts?,1477157841,"Does anyone know of a mechanical AND gate for rotating shafts?

I'm working on a personal project that's a sort of mechanical puzzle box.  I want to take 2 rotating shafts as input, and have the output shaft rotate only when both inputs are rotating in the same direction.  All shafts rotate at the same speed, but can have different directions, below's the logic table I'm looking for.  I'm not too picky on the direction of the output since I can use a rectifier built from 1 way bearings to set the direction.  I'm also not picky about the output speed, so an output speed of 2 or 0.5 is fine since I can gear it up/down on the output.  I can have a reference input that's always turning if it's needed, but I'd prefer not to if possible.  0 is no rotation, +1 is CW, -1 is CCW:



A | B | Out

0 | 0 | 0
0 | +1 | 0
0 | -1 | 0
+1 | 0 | 0
+1 | +1 | +1 or -1
+1 | -1 | 0
-1 | 0 | 0
-1 | +1 | 0
-1 | -1 | +1 or -1


EDIT: The puzzle is set up like this; there is a hand crank on one side and a music box on the other.  The objective is to place gears in between to get the crank to power the music box.  However, to make it more complicated, I wanted to force the user to split the gear train in 2, so that they need to make the crank power 2 different endpoints.  This AND mechanism would combine those 2 endpoints back together to power the music box, but only if the user has the right number and configuration of gears to get both endpoints turning in the same direction at the same time.",AskEngineers,killerguppy101,/r/AskEngineers/comments/58u7b5/mechanical_and_gate_for_rotating_shafts/

Im a business student with a Bachelor of Commerce who is regretting every decision I've made up to his point. I hate having left school with no hard skills, doomed to try and climb a corporate ladder in search of a career I can brag about (which seems like the whole end game for this degree). 

In school I loved math and calculus, but having spoken to my math major friends they all said they wish they'd done Engineering instead since the career applications are that much better. So right now, I'm planning on going back to school for an Electrical Engineering degree specializing in DSP. ""The Dream"" job is to one day design/work with audio equipment and peripherals, although of course I understand that the chances of actually ending up there are slim. I'd be taking at least they first bit of my degree at the University of Victoria, if anyone has experience there.

So my question is: what does your average work day look like? How much raw math do you use on a daily basis? Hiw integrated is programming/coding in everything you do? Do you find you get to do much designing or is it mostly repair/maintenance/improvements/bureaucracy? Do you enjoy what you do? Would you recommend your field? Most importantly, what would you have done differently during your schooling/career 'structuring'? 

Please give me real honest answers and not the gushy ""OmG I love my exciting career!!!!!"" nonsense, Ive had enough of that for a lifetime from the useless Business degree. Thanks a million for your answers.

I am a 3rd year student finishing my degree on EE and going into an integrated Msc on EE. Integrated means I dont need to apply/fight for a masters or scholarship, I have a spot and its supposed to do the whole degree with MsC included from the beggining of the degree.

 I only have to pick one general area of research of 5 for my Msc (Control and Automated systems, Telecommunications, Energy, Electronics and Computers). The computers one is a mix of cpu, gpu and low level software area. I was thinking about picking Electronics because its what I identify the most but I fear its not what I think. I liked studying BJT and every circuit with MOS with detail and also some diodes. I liked studying the characteristics, the conduction zones and whatnot. I think I like theory a lot but also a little bit of experiments with oscilloscopes and other analysis tools.

HOWEVER, I feel that if I enter in this major I will work on a non-related field to electronics or that the jobs I will have in the future will only be focused to please the client. My deepest wish is following research after the Msc but I dont think I have the grades for it on the degree  (70/100%). Maybe I can work harder and have a good masters?

For example, a fixed cantilever beam with a force at the far end. The structure with the fixing point will have reaction forces due to the force applied to the beam. There will be a moment reaction F*a, but will there also be a reaction force which is just the inverse of F? Also, what about the weight of the beam?

38,"What impacts sealing (melting?) temperatures for plastic tubes, specifically what's the reason behind different sealing temperatures for different plastic polymers?",1477004985,"Hello,

We have two tubes, same resin composition and dimension. Resin composition is 70% HDPE and 30% LLDPE. First tube sleeve is made of Purell PE GF 4750 (HDPE) and Dowlex 2045G (LLDPE) and the second tube is made of Petrothene LB5003 (HDPE) and Dowlex 2045G (LLDPE).

When we run these tubes on our machine, the first tube seals at a higher temperature ~ 370C and the second tube seals at a lower temperature ~295C.

I've been looking for a reason behind this temperature difference and noticed that the vicat softening temperature between the two polymers (LB5003 and PE GF 4750) are different. Googling vicat softening temperature tells me that this is the temperature of the plastic's softening point. How is it then that the first tube made with PE GF 4750, which has a lower vicat temperature ~ 70C, seals at a higher temperature than the second tube made with LB5003, vicat ~ 122C? Is it wrong to think that the polymer with a higher softening point would require higher heat to melt and seal?

There's this part my boss made that has already started to be manufactured, but a company we're working with on the project wanted to revise it slightly. My boss decided that, even though I'm not on this project and didn't make this part (he did), I should be the one to make the revisions. He forwarded the email to me, which listed 2 revisions that needed to be done: increase a certain diameter and remove a certain hole.  They included a step file of the revised part, and my boss superimposed the revised part on our old part so I could see where changes needed to be made.  I made the proper changes exactly as the email stated. When I looked at the two parts superimposed, I noticed there was still a difference in the parts: this hollow cylinder extruding from the part was conical, and part of it was cut out on theirs and our part was straight with no cuts. When showing my boss the revisions I made exactly as I was instructed, I pointed out this difference and asked if our part needed to have the same cylindrical shape. He said yes, it needed to look like that, and asked me to make that revision as well. I revised the cylinder feature so it looked exactly like the step file that was sent to us. When my boss looked it over again, he got really upset that I changed the inside of the cylinder as well. Apparently, that company that sent us the revision didn't update the inside of their cylinder when they sent us the step file. Like I said, I didn't make this part so I had no way of knowing that the inside of that cylinder hasn't been revised,  It just made sense to me that if the outside was different and I needed to change it, the inside should be changed as well. I've never seen my boss more upset with me, he gave me a hard time for the rest of the day, and at one point I was fighting back tears. I don't know what I could have done differently.

Consider I have a small piece of copper filament (about 3 nanometers long) which heats up to 400 deg Celsius for about 30 microseconds (the heat source, then shuts off) . The heat is allowed to dissipate to the surrounding materials (which are at room temperature) without any restrictions. Would this temperature vanish as soon as it's source is turned off ? or would it take some time for it to cool down ? 

Common sense dictates that it would be the second option, but in my experiments , I'm never able to feel the heat from the devices. Could it be attributed to the small size of the filament ? Because the area of heating is so small , would the amount of heat dissipated be low ? 

Also this is a for a single device. If I had an array of millions of such devices closely packed (such as in a typical RAM or other electronic memory) , would these short lived , localized bursts of heat cause a significant increase in the temperature of the device as a whole ?

- At no point can an animal be harmed by the mechanism.
- An animal may apply pressure on the door while closed, and when I want to open it, it still needs to open, so friction caused by the pressure applied can't prevent operation.

Another important factor is the ""buy/build it for life"" philosophy (/r/buyitforlife plug) that I've gotten into as I've gotten older.

So, I want this thing to last. And because the home will be custom, I'll be dying it in and passing it onto my kids.

70,A simple question from fluid flow....All engineers are welcomed... (Specially Mech and Electrical),1476884917,"So for a household project I've been working on needs to draw a continuous flow dripping at constant flow-rate. 

[The design I've been working on](http://imgur.com/VDzo62G) has a piston being pushed at constant velocity which would give me constant discharge.

The fluid I'm working with has very high viscosity, about 1000 cSt.

My question is, **would I require some sort of flow control valve or some other device at the opening to ensure reliable flow?**

If you can suggest some simple mechanism for attaining the constant dripping flow, that is also welcomed.

Edit : 

1. The container is perfectly sealed, no way for air to enter in.

2. The tank would have capacity of about 100ml.

3. The flow-rate would be a small drop per 6-7 seconds.

4. The fluid in the tank is a type of oil which is very very costly. Cannot waste (much). Hence constant low flow-rate is required.

5. I'm majorly concerned about what would happen at the orifice than the constant velocity part.

I'm building a foam teardrop camper that will be pulled behind a hybrid. I want to save as much weight as possible.

I have found plans for a very simple A-frame trailer that uses 2x2x1/8"" angle steel. I would like to replace the longer sections with aluminum angle. I can't weld aluminum so I'm going to have to drill and bolt. 

Would I be able to use the same dimension aluminum angle or would I have to step it up to 2x2x1/4"" or some other variant?

If I have to use a thicker aluminum would I still save weight over steel or will it  only be negligible?

Would C-channel be a better option for aluminum, and if so, what dimensions? Example: Legs 1"", Back 2"", Thickness 1/8""

Will drilling through the aluminum weaken it too much?

There are parts that will still be steel such as the hitch mount and the mounts for the axles. Will there be a problem having aluminum bolted to the steel? (as in a chemical reaction that would weaken either metal from touching each other)

Do I need to use special metal bolts?

Here are the plans, I'm using the 5ft bolted version:

https://web.archive.org/web/20160402111735/http://angib.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/teardrop/tear57.htm

I also plan on adding the cross bars that the example pictures use, but again, they will have to be bolted.

75,Controlling EC fans through input voltage. Advice appreciated,1476868544,"Hi all,

I'm trying to speed control an EC fan in a heater battery, its operating at 100% currently which is too noisy. 

Obviously for EC fans you'd normally set the speed with a 0-10V input to the fans, but unfortunately this is blocked up within the heater battery enclosure and inaccessible.

In my mind I should be able to install a variable resistor in series with the fans where I can access the power cabling, and control the ammount of power they see, and hence their running speed this way. Just worried  incase the fans will fall over if they don't get their design voltage.

Well, this group of friends are pagan and would like to build a monument of sorts. I've been asked to assist with the logistics.

So here's my plan. The task is to locate about an eight foot tall piece of limestone from the nearby creek bed, haul it up about a 30-45 degree incline a hundred feet or so, and stand it up on end. I think we can get this accomplished by using a system of rails, rollers, and [flip flop winches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFDGGht3CQU). 

I've located on Amazon [this](https://smile.amazon.com/30-5m-DynaTech-Forged-Breaking-Strength/dp/B01BO260HO/ref=s9_simh_gw_g60_i1_r?_encoding=UTF8&amp;fpl=fresh&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-1&amp;pf_rd_r=MJN5CDSN8BEVN2EBB39A&amp;pf_rd_r=MJN5CDSN8BEVN2EBB39A&amp;pf_rd_t=36701&amp;pf_rd_p=6aad23bd-3035-4a40-b691-0eefb1a18396&amp;pf_rd_p=6aad23bd-3035-4a40-b691-0eefb1a18396&amp;pf_rd_i=desktop) tow rope with nearly 15,000 lb breaking strength. I think we can get four of these so that we can have two winches working together, and when we get to the end of those ropes we can set up two more winches further up the hill to take over the job. Keep swapping back and forth.

We'll have one team of two men on each winch, and one team of two men moving the rail and roller logs as we progress. 

Once we get to the top of the hill, we'll have a hole dug about 4 feet deep and filled with two feet of gravel. I think I can throw a rope over a nearby tree limb and do a sort of spanish windlass type deal to lift the stone upright.

Some safety aspects that have come to mind- we should never have anyone standing directly behind the stone for obvious reasons. We should utilize stakes and prussik knot loops on the ropes to stabilize the winches as we go.

The big thing I'm concerned about is hitting the breaking point of those ropes and having one of them fling a piece of metal at a winch operator with 15,000 pounds behind it. What are your thoughts on this? Is there any way to make this safer?
