6,Would carbonic acid provide greater efficiency for steam engines and steam turbines?,1596375711,"If CO2 is dissolved into water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3) this increases the mass of water (H2O) by nearly up to threefold. Over 90cm of CO2 can be dissolved in as little as 100ml of water. This co2 could be liberated from the water using lower temperatures and less BTUs than would be needed to heat water into a vapor and superheat to steam. 

So given the increase in mass in liquid state, wouldn’t using carbonic acid in a steam engine greatly increase the efficiency? Could CO2 be harvested and dissolved into water and be used as a viable source to increase energy output for steam turbines or steam engines? 

What about cars? Could a hybrid gasoline and passive steam engine utilize carbonic acid for greater efficiency and higher fuel efficiency with lower carbon dioxide fuel emissions because the co2 is harvested and used for the steam? What if electric vehicles instead worked by collecting co2 and turning it into carbonic acid to use for steam engine/turbine which were heated by electrodes?

21,I want to combine my alarm clock and TENS unit to create an even worse alarm clock but I need help,1596340966,"**To preface this, I have trouble waking up on time.** Be it with alarm clocks, music, or my phone on full blast right next to my head.

What do I have that can easily give a controlled amount of pain? My TENS unit! So thus combining the two seemed like a sensible idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer! I have 0 knowledge on electrical engineering, soldering, or how to tie the two (clock and TENS) together. test

&amp;#x200B;

my first thought was to try and see if there was any accessible internal storage onboard the TENS so that I could program a function with a time or create a clock that turns it on at a set  time. But when plugged into a computer via the Mini USB nothing shows up.

&amp;#x200B;

Second idea, wire the two together so that when the Alarm clock starts beeping I could use that signal (running to the speaker) to turn the TENS unit on. and that's what I've stuck with, I've figured out what leads trigger the buttons as well as turn on the device, (Used metal tweezers to bridge connection) and you can see [that diagram here](https://i.imgur.com/guVc12e.png)

One of my issues is that once it's turned on I need to be able to increase the power (It always starts at 0) as well as disabling the auto shut off function (After awhile the device turns off and requires the on/off switch to be re-toggled.)

I graduated mechanical engineering in 2014, in the middle of the last recession and was unable to find a job for over a year and a half. My attempts at finding work in engineering was difficult but I eventually accepted a position at a military contractor working in technical writing as a contractor. It is important to note that I was told that I would be able to apply for an engineering position at a later date - however that was a lie. The truth is that I would first need to become a salaried employee (which was basically impossible at the time). I became disheartened and felt taken advantage of, so I decided to find a new job. Which I did.

In May 2017 I started my new position once again as a technical writer, but at a much smaller company that works in custom automation for automotive and food industries. For the first two years I was happy and motivated, and was quickly promoted within the first year to a position that handles administration of CAD systems, 3d modeling and drafting. I thought it would be a step closer towards working properly in engineering. I was wrong, once again. My time was spent mostly by writing manuals and setting up and maintaining the PDM systems, with a sprinkling of drafting every now and then. My motivation was still high but I was becoming jaded.

In 2019 the automotive sector began to slump, causing the volume of jobs we were working on to plummet. Our company was forced to lay off employees (including one of the drafters), increasing my drafting workload but at the cost of reduced hours. For about of half of last year I was rushing to finish all of my workload in the limited time that I had. 

Then naturally, Covid happened. While this will be a boon for automation when the pandemic is over, I can't help but feel like it is still time to leave. I have been on reduced hours for the entirety of this year, severely effecting my paycheck and I have not been motivated in my work at all.

In general I feel like my knowledge in engineering and manufacturing processes is severely lacking where it needs to be, as I have only been drafting and modelling. I had found a job description in another field that might more closely be related to my skillset.

My depraved mind immediately started to explore the possibilities. What if [Thomas Midgley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.), inventor of CFCs AND Tetraethyl Lead, had survived his entanglement with his homebrew traction machine, and in 1974 turned his destructive talents to uniting these toxic miracles into a single, composite material: LeadBestos? 

Drapable, workable, and strong- LeadBestos offers the best of both worlds. An amazing insulator, puncture-resistant, and... other stuff? What possible uses would this material have had?

43,How can I build a washing machine platform that isolates vibrations?,1596318911,"I am posting here after following the [r/engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/) flowchart.

I'm renovating my 1900's house and the only layout that makes sense ends up with a stacking washer/dryer on the other side of the wall as a large format tile shower, and just a few steps away from a bedroom. I want to prevent as much vibration as possible from shaking the house and the shower for all the obvious reasons.

The location is on the ground floor with an unfinished basement below, against an exterior wall. Also the room already has a newish strapped and leveled plywood subfloor over the original subfloor, raising it about 3 inches in that location, which allows me to cut out a square and build from the original subfloor if needed.

Currently I'm thinking of reinforcing the floor from below with extra bracing between joists, cutting out the washer sized square from the top subfloor, leveling that location, then building a concrete pad on top of the rubber matting (or legs or something). The washer would go on that.

Is this insane? I don't care about overkill. Will this even work? I'm thinking the extra mass of the concrete would help dampen the vibrations. Should I skip the rubber part? Does anyone have any ideas to toss in for fun?

So today I have had a discussion with my GF on why golf balls actually compress as much as they do when hit by a golf club, even though they feel absolutely rigid.
I remember something my old mechanics professor was talking about, materials changing their modulus and strength at high velocities (and I thought maybe this applies here, too.)
He said this effect is why Kevlar is working as bullet-proof vests, because the material gehts stiffer when subjected to a high-velocity impact. I remember him telling us that even steel exerts these propterties.

48,Adding speed controller to blower motor?,1596314710,"I have an evaporative (swamp) cooler.  It works well.  Too well.  It has a switch for High and Low speed on the blower.  Even on the low speed, it's too much.  I'd like to add a speed controller so I can turn it down even more than ""low.""  Note, when it's on low speed, it's not very low when compared to the high setting, if high was 100%, I would guess low feels like 85%.  (I have two of the same units, and they act the same, so it seems that those are the ""correct"" speeds.)

I am an avid DIY'er, but when it comes to anything more than basic home wiring, I get lost.  I found the below-linked speed controller, and it would seem that adding it to the red wire leading to the blower motor would do the trick; however, in reading the reviews and other online forums, I am not sure this is the speed controller that would work properly with the blower motor.  In reading about how these motors work, I can't make heads nor tails of whether the motor uses resistance or capacitors to control its speed.  

The blower motor is 7.3 amps at 120 volts AC, or about 876 watts.  (Hey, that math I can do).  The speed controller says it's rated for more than that, although one comment says it's for 16 amps and not the 25 it says, but 16 should be fine.

So, it my plan viable, or am I going about this the wrong way?  Again, I would connect this controller between the red (high) wire on the speed switch and hook the common wire to the common connectors (if that's even necessary).

82,Can a Grad EE student feeling lost in job search get some advice?,1596233484,"Hello all, 

I'm a 26 Female in the process of finishing my Master's in the Fall. I have been applying for jobs the past months but haven't heard back from anyone. I would love to get feedback for my resume:  [https://imgur.com/a/gTZ9kG8](https://imgur.com/a/gTZ9kG8)  and some advice for my career since I have been trying to figure out what kind of job I can fit in. 

**Study background:** In my undergrad years, I focused on Circuits Design but besides my class projects, I have not done much circuit design anywhere else. The only reason I studied circuits design was because solving circuits was the only thing I felt more confident doing than other depths (ML, DSP, Computer Design, Material Devices . . . ). I've never been good at coding and at the time I thought it took me much less time to solve circuits than trying to write a program. Therefore, I went on attempting to get a Master's degree focusing on Electronic Circuits and Systems, just to realized I hate sitting in front of the computer to run simulations all day so much. I tried really hard but only managed to barely pass my grad RF classes, did okay on the grad CMOS analog IC sequence but again, I can solve a complex circuit but class pace was always too fast I would forget things easily.

**Experience background:** I spent time on fabricating sensors in a material science lab and had a chance to incorporate the sensing device with a circuit board (was designed by a PhD student) to calibrate, characterize, and test the sensors as well as the board. 

Beside that, I was working for a PI in making medical device, but it was mostly CAD work and assembly. I know I'm interested in wearable sensors, medical devices, or anything that bridge Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. I know a little bit of everything but I'm not an expert at one single thing, including the field I have chosen. I've been so depressed and unmotivated in looking for jobs because I don't even know if there's anything out there that can fit my skills.

Anybody got tips on what I should be looking for? I'm pretty lost on what kind of jobs I can do as an engineer given my experience. Thank you so much for your time and advice!",AskEngineers,False,hearts_rule,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i1gpzt/can_a_grad_ee_student_feeling_lost_in_job_search/

85,"Bolt Single Shear, with two unequal forces",1596228785,"Hello. I am familiar with finding average shear stress on a bolt from single shear between two plates. Seen here. (https://www.engineersedge.com/material_science/bolt_single_shear_calcs.htm). 

What I don't understand, is that why in all these examples are both the loads from the plates the same? I can easily imagine a situation where plate A exhibits a load different from plate B. 

I am asking, because I am getting the loads in these plates, from principal stresses from my FEA, which are different. Do I just use the maximum?

87,First engineering job and feeling frustrated. Is my situation as bad as it seems?,1596226121,"I graduated in 2018.  Was offered a temp-to-hire role in a public transit organization I interned at throughout most of undergrad doing technician level work.  I accepted and worked 6 months on contract.  I ended up sitting out the rest of the year as there was a ton of red tape in getting the permanent role approved, but I started again in January of 2020.  Other than state mandated budget cuts or gross negligence, it's basically a ""job for life"" situation with lifers in all departments.

My frustration comes in how the job was pitched to me and what it turned out to be.  I was initially told it was a new role and I would be working fairly independently of my former unit.  The job description was 90% design and implementation of new support equipment for our engineers, 10% assisting my old unit with occasional technical work.  However, when I started up again this year I had a new manager.  You can see where this is going.

Flash forward to today I have been made the de facto head of my old unit. Our interns and part timers have been let go due to Covid with the extra work falling on me.  The percentages have basically flipped, as 90% of my time is spent doing technician and clerical work.  I had a senior engineer assigned to assist me who is a micromanager and has removed all sense of autonomy in the role.

On top of this the previous unit head was never told they'd been demoted, and I was told to just work together without worrying about title.  This has caused constant friction between us as he sees the writing on the wall and will drag his feet on any task, ""forget"" details of conversations when it's convenient, and generally make life miserable.  Management knows this, but again, the workplace is basically ""job for life"" and the only feedback I've gotten is praise for my patience working with difficult employees.  My last performance review was nothing but positive.

93,Need recommendations for an insulating spray or paint,1596220829," I am a grad student who researches electromechanical fracture response of composites under dynamic and static loading. My composites generally are highly electrically conductive, I use silver paint to apply voltage and current probes to each sample. For dynamic experiments, I need to put a thin line of silver paint ahead of a precrack in each sample that breaks when desired fracture is initiation. Since my voltage probes are along the thickness and current probes are on each face, I usually insulate where the fracture initiation silver paint probe is and area for soldering. However, I have to put over 5-7 layers of polyurethane to adequately insulate the fracture initiation probe, and this polyurethane stretches to much before fracture initiation, causing my fracture initiation time to not be exact. I would like to use something else to insulate below fracture initiation probe, I need it to be nonelastic and a good insulator.

I guess I could summarize my question by asking if I took a handful of fresh concrete right out the the truck and stuck it in a ziploc bag, would it cure to the highest strength possible, or would I still have to add some water over the curing period?

This question was spurred by my recent placement of a pad in brutally hot southern Arizona.  I covered the pad with 10mil poly.

I graduated with a 3.33 GPA and passed the FE on first attempt, not that it seems anyone really cares about that. The biggest hindrance is the fact that I didn't get an internship. This was almost entirely up to the fact that the state I went to school in essentially had 0 opportunities and I couldn't go out of state.

I've sent hundreds of applications the last two years to almost exclusively silence. I've only had one one interview, because the CEO told them too, which I was well qualified for, took 5 hours, and subsequently told they couldn't find a place for me. It also seems that a majority of the job postings are straight up choke full of lies. As in, posted for recent graduates, but what they actually want is a M.S. with extensive experience, or posted as entry level graduate development programs with no requirements, but then they ask in an preliminary online survey about my management experience, followed by silence.

Sure, I expected more difficulty with no internship but this is simply ridiculous. I'm applying country wide, and have immediate availability. I'm sure now coming up on 2 years since graduation is not helping me either.

I'm considering graduate schools simply so I can get a co-op (mine didn't have them), but I really have no interest in going back to school.

27,Ready to implode. Need advice.,1596157131,"I'm an electrical engineer who has been working at the same wireless components vendor for the last 4 years. I have been customer-facing for the last 3. My job consists almost entirely of customer support projects that continually creeps in schedule and scope, mostly because our sales team has no boundaries and treat value added services like free candy. I have asked my manager to move me away from customer focused service work and onto internal design projects. I have been recently assigned more design work, and have enjoyed doing it somewhat, but I am still having to deal with all the ongoing service activities, with no firm commitment that that is going to stop. I was able to sustain the load for a couple months, bringing work home multiple night a week/on the weekend, but in the last few weeks I'm getting to a point where I cannot cope. My attention wanders, I have no energy, and work I was excited to do only a few months ago I can barely stand looking at. My productivity is sliding precipitously, and I've been having thoughts of self-harm, and fantasies of quitting and never looking back. I've told my direct manager that I'm struggling, and he says he understands and wants to help me, but there's been a distinct lack of follow-through when it comes to actually lightening the load in a meaningful way and moving me away from customer support.

I really do enjoy electrical science/engineering, and want to continue in the field. But the constant expectations of customers who don't know how to design wireless devices and are looking to me to fix the last-minute program blockers is getting extremely tiresome. Also, the lack of follow-through on management's part to address the problem is very disheartening. It's literally having an impact on my will to live at this point. I came to a similar crisis point around this time last year, but was met with disappointment when I couldn't get offers for anything non-customer facing (apparently years of fixing other people's broken designs doesn't qualify me to do my own?), at least in my market, which is why I ended up staying with my current company. I've thought of maybe asking to take a sabbatical, but I don't know how well received that would be with how badly the engineering department is hurting for bodies.

30,Click type torque wrenches,1596154902,"
I recently got into a discussion with some coworkers about a click type torque wrench. 

My claim is that it is a basic lever operation where the force pivots on the pivot of the head and this force is what causes the click. With this, where the force is applied to the handle portion does not matter for measuring the output or click of the tool. Moving your hand towards or away from the fulcrum only decreases or increases the effort required to exert the same click output. 

Their stance is that hand placement is critical, though I don’t see how this could be when the output past the fulcrum is still going to click at X lbs. Ft. Of force. 

I hope I’m describing it well. I believe I’m correct, but I lack the educational resources to best describe it.

31,Leave of Absence Advice,1596153105,"Dear Ask Engineers, 

I'm an upcoming sophomore at Stanford University majoring in mechanical engineering, and I'm planning on taking a leave of absence since I felt that the difference between quality of education online and in person was very stark for my freshman year. 

My passion is in automobiles, both electric and internal combustion. I'm obsessed with wanting to start my own major car company or work in an executive position in a pre-existing one someday. However, I feel that spending a year just staring at a wall for a whole year during my leave of absence would be a complete waste. Lately, I've been looking at technical school as an answer this issue. 

I understand that technical school has a reputation of taking in regular people and giving them skills to prepare them for a wrenching job, but I've always wanted to learn how to actually work on cars. I also believe that it will help me out in my short term goals for obtaining internships, as I'll be able to snag a local internship with the knowledge from a technical school and then eventually one at Tesla HQ sometime in the future. For long term goals, I feel that someone who is both experienced in traditional wrenching work as well as engineering work would be unique and help me stand out from the crowd. I feel like the hands on experience that I can take away from the school would prove invaluable, yet at the same time I feel conflicted for some reason.

36,Proper and formal way to ask for a pay rise?,1596148050,"Hi,

Just wanted to throw a question out there to see of anyone had some helpful advice to point me in the right direction.

I am currently in the final stages pf a surveying degree and have worked casually within this field for the past ~7 years. I have also completed a Cert 2, 3 and Diploma previous to attending university. I had originally taken on a role of a surveying assistant until I completed my Diploma which then turned into a surveying technician role. 

I had been out of work for a few months until about 2 months ago where I found a job at a local surveying firm. It was advertised as a survey assistant role which my university professor sent an e-mail put to see if anyone was interested. I showed interest and successfully got the position. Now to the crux of my post, there was only a hand shake agreement with no formal contract being written up to sign. I'm nearing the end of my probationary period and as soon as this is up I plan on asking for a pay rise as I am still performing the job in full as a survey technician  wiith Diploma qualifications. Now my main question is when I approach the higher ups about a potential pay rise as I have taken a $7 AUD pay cut compared to previous companies, I was wondering how I should word such a thing?, in order to not sound rude as I do have an inadvertent tendency to be very blunt and straight forward which can get people really off side at time as I would assume they think I'm sounding rude (although not intentional).

65,"Design help for a quick disconnect, horizontal mounting solution for the Stinger missile on top of USMC pack",1596123377,"\*All following information is open-source and easily found on the internet\*

If am in the wrong place, please let me know. Engineers are the best people I know to help solve bad military design problems. I humbly bring my ask before those who know much more about design and ergonomics than I do. 

I am looking at designing an add-on to the top of USMC FILBE main pack that will allow for a more stable carrying solution for the FIM-92 Stinger missile. The two most conventional carrying systems we  utilize are simply wrapping the carry sling around the top of the pack frame or placing it into a zippered and cushioned bag and doing the same thing. Both options do not lend themselves to being able to quickly get the missile up and into the fight, as they are merely attempting to keep secured to the top of the pack. And unless you are rigging up some 550 cord through the MOLLE on top of the pack, you are going to have to continuously keep the missile aligned in the center or else it will slide to either side and take you down (because it was tied through your frame).

My attempt at fixing the connecting portion went alright: I simply wove some web-belt material through the MOLLE on the top flap and back through a loop on either shoulder. Add in some buckles and boom, easily disconnected carry system. The problem continues to be in the stability of the missile itself. The missile is 33.5 lbs, 59.8 in long, with a diameter 2.76 in. It is weighted a bit more on the firing end due to the handgrip portion, but not by much. A cut out portion of a foam sleeping mat helped slightly but just couldn't find purchase.

So far, they have made it clear to me that they foster a great work environment and encourage a healthy work life balance, both illustrated by some nice benefits/perks. They have also expressed that engineers in this company have a lot of trust and autonomy. The position I'm applying for is new, and I would be trusted to form it as I see fit. They said they have been totally stable and relatively unaffected by the pandemic, with the exception that 95% of employees are now working from home. They offer relocation assistance (once covid levels out), and it's in a location close to my family. They've also told me the starting salary, but did indicate it is non-negotiable. I was pretty happy with the number they gave me so this isn't an issue for me. Overall, it sounds like a great opportunity and exactly what I'm looking for in my next job.

I'm looking for any advice or red flags I should be looking for while interviewing for a start up.  From my (limited) experience, it seems that start-up companies can be run by people who are either very grounded and practical, or ego maniacs. I'm a little spooked at the Theranos story and want to make sure that premature marketing doesn't put the engineers in an impossible position.

Should I be concerned about the longevity of the company?

I do have coworkers and a supervisor to bounce ideas off of, but I wanted to try to figure this out mostly on my own, so I've been running the results through my spreadsheet, Arrow, and Hysys.

The superheated steam is 865 psig, 700 degF. I've got some piping that guidance, based on velocity. Trying to be around 250 ft/s. In Arrow, everything is Isothermal..so 700 degF, even though my piping eats up 32-36 psig. If I use the discharge pressure from the piping.. which is 865-36 psig at 700 degF.. then my h increases slightly. So my ideal turbine in Hysys produces more power, because there's functionally more superheat available to remove.

Intuitively, I don't think this is going to be true.. If the turbine takes it lower 32-36 psi lower steam, then it's going to have less driving force to turn it, and produce less power.. And, misusing these results, it seems like the thing to do would be induce a HUGE pressure drop, and utilize all of the superheat to produce more power - which isn't true..

In reality, it can't be a constant temperature process.. the dP will raise the temp, volume will increase and lower the temp, high velocity would increase friction, which would increase temperature. There's a few complex effects that would modify that T.

98,"How do I join 2"" PVC cut at a 45 to the curvature of 6"" diameter PVC?",1596065361," 

Hello engineers,

I have a question and it may seem simple, but I am out of my element on this one.

For background see bullet point 1. If you don't care about the background, please see bullet point 2 and onward.

1. Background - I have dabbled in building [aeroponics systems](https://imgur.com/CKDn8NU) for fun for the past few years. I initially started working with bins and cheap misting heads. I eventually upgraded the misting heads, the water pumps and tried different kinds of tubing to see what worked and what didn't. I really enjoy the challenge it brings and wanted to try to expand my operation and use a [different method of growth](https://imgur.com/DLud3sp). I am trying to do all of this manually, and on my own, because when I tried to hire an engineering firm to do all the work, just the design alone was quoted at over $3K.. It did not include the actual prototype. I thought to myself, why would I pay $3K just for a design when I am only building a prototype and it only takes 4 cuts (it was technically 54 cuts) with a saw and dremmel on \~$45 worth of pipe. Big difference in the two prices, right? That now brings me to why I am posting here today. I am on the final portion of the project. I have two towers prepped and nearly ready to go, but I ran into a road block. I am hoping to get some input on how you would solve this problem (bullet 3)
2. Materials
   1. [6 inch diameter PVC](https://imgur.com/K350IDF)(8 ft. in length)
   2. [2 inch diameter PVC](https://imgur.com/xY98sOO) cut at a 45 degree angle and \~4 inches in length at the longest part.
3. Problem - I am trying to figure out how to join two pieces of PVC together.. Silly right? It seems so simple. Why not just use primer and cement? Well, I want the primer and cement to seat almost perfectly around the PVC pipe to eliminate any potential air gaps. See gaps in the [image link](https://imgur.com/OQh5qw1)
4. What I have tried-  

   1. Sanding down the curvature with the dremmel. The gaps are still too large, I would have to use caulk and I am not sure I am comfortable having caulk near the roots of food I plan to eat and sell to the general public. 
   2. I tried to buy a larger sanding drum (2"" diameter) to take care of it, but it didn't seem to work either. 
5. The questions I have for the community:  

   1. What tools (clamps/cutters/drills/bits/etc) would you use to get a cut or to sand down on the 2 inch diameter pipe so that it seats flush or nearly flush on a 6"" diameter pipe? 
   2. I would have to sand or cut on both the top and the bottom. How do I ensure they are equal in depth and curvature? Is there any math I can use to solve this?  
   3. lastly, is there any resource I could turn to that wouldn't cost me a fortune to get this last cut? 

I have been trying to do this for a few days now and have run out of ideas on how to tackle this. I am hoping to at least find out who **you** would turn to do the implementation of this. Thanks in advance for this assist on this.

4,How do I join these two pieces of PVC?,1596060287,"Hello engineers,   


I have a question and it may seem simple, but I am out of my element on this one. 

For background see bullet point 1. If you don't care about the background, please see bullet point 2 and onward.  

1. Background - I have dabbled in building aeroponics systems for fun for the past few years. I initially started working with bins and cheap misting heads. I eventually upgraded the misting heads, the water pumps and tried different kinds of tubing to see what worked and what didn't.  I really enjoy the challenge it brings and wanted to try to expand my operation and use a different method of growth. I am trying to do all of this manually, and on my own, because when I tried to hire an engineering firm to do all the work, just the design alone was quoted at over $3K. I thought to myself, why would I pay $3K just for a design when I am only building a prototype and it only takes 4 cuts (it was technically 54 cuts) with a saw and dremmel on \~$45 worth of pipe. Big difference in the two prices, right? That now brings me to why I am posting here. I am hoping to get some input on how you would solve this problem. 
2. Materials
   1. 6 inch diameter PVC (8 ft. in length)
   2. 2 inch diameter PVC cut at a 45 degree angle
3. Problem - I am trying to figure out how to join two pieces of PVC together.. 
4. Silly right? It seems so simple. Why not just use primer and cement? Well, I want the primer and cement to seat almost perfectly around the tube to eliminate any potential air gaps. See gaps in the image below: 
5. What I have tried-
   1. Sanding down the curvature with the dremmel. The gaps are still too large, I would have to use caulk and I am not sure I am comfortable having caulk near the roots of food I plan to eat. 
6. The questions
   1. How would you approach this problem? 
   2. What tools could I use to get a cut on the 2 inch diameter pipe so that it seats flush or nearly flush?",AskEngineers,False,AeroponicsPrototype,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i09sk7/how_do_i_join_these_two_pieces_of_pvc/

15,Could an 'inverted space elevator' of sorts be viable?,1596048919,"Preface:  I apologize if this isn't a topic suitable for this subreddit -- as far as I can tell I believe it is.

This is an idea that I can't seem to escape from.  It just keeps popping into my mind from time to time and I'm simply curious as to the potential viability of such a build.  But with that said, imagine we had a 'space elevator' housed in planetary orbit, outfitted with a large basket of sorts linked to a chain-like attachment designed to raise and lower this basket.

This is effectively a space station.  It remains in orbit.  But it is designed to facilitate dropping this basket down into the atmosphere that is then boarded and slowly retracted back up into the space station.

Of course this concept is wildly loose in structure.  At what depth of orbit does it remain?  How far down does this basket lower to?  What kind of stabilization mechanisms are built into the design?  What kind of weight capacity are we working with?  What about materials?  You get my point:  the concept is VERY loose.  But that's intentional in so much as I believe it better to allow any potential engineers wiggle room so that they can creatively stretch all of these variables in ways that would facilitate functionality, rather than present a rigidly designed concept that is liable to fall apart under immediate observation simply because I'm no engineer by trade.

As far as I'm concerned I don't care how the thing gets the job done.  I'm simply curious to see the general thoughts on the concept of what is essentially a space station that pulls people and materials up into space rather than lifting or launching from the surface up.  So long as the items can be pulled up, I'd consider it a success no matter the specifics.

However in my mind I presume this type of thing would require a partner object on the surface of the planet to better facilitate loading.  Like having the basket splash down into the open ocean and board from a ship, allowing us to be quite flexible with the accuracy of landing the basket device.  Or perhaps building a landing pad of sorts at the highest feasible elevation so that the device doesn't have to use nearly as much energy to fulfill retraction and stabilization.  Etc.

My hope in posting is that engineers play with the concept however they'd like in their own minds and determine whether or not it could be of any viable use to us.

I'm using the [DC0-25V](https://www.amazon.com/Diymall-Voltage-Sensor-Dc0-25v-Arduino/dp/B00NK4L97Q) sensors which can handle up to 25V (with a 5V ref for the voltage divider circuit).  The solar panel is 100W,  17.9 operating voltage, and about 5.72 operating amperage at full output.  Now I know that with strictly voltage readings, there's basically no current flow so what I'm assuming is that I should be able to get away with a smaller gauge wire to run from the panel and battery output to the sensors, but I'm not 100% on that.

46,Solar refrigeration - University Project,1596019285,"Hi guys,

I am designing a solar refrigerator for small businesses in rural sub-Saharan Africa as part of a university project. I am looking to build a model of my design, so I can change variables like ambient temperature, target temperature and light levels to see how it affects the power consumption of the system, which will affect the size of the power system needed (battery and PV panels) or the monthly bills of the user.

I am looking to develop the refrigerator first and then work towards a suitable power system. My target energy consumption is below 0.2kWh/day.

I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on how to describe my refrigeration system mathematically.

The project scope doesn't include redesigning a compressor. Instead I will use existing technology. I have opted to use a variable compressor because of its improved efficiency and durability. Embraco have manufactured and impressive compressor specifically for a solar refrigerator called the Wisemotion. I think this is part of their Fullmotion series. (COP compressor = ?)

I will also use R-600a as my refrigerant which is compatible with this technology.

I know some of my variables:
Ambient temperature = 32⁰C max
Internal cabinet temperature = 5⁰C - 8⁰C 
Insulation material = unknown (U=?)
Insulation thickness 
What am I cooling - beer, water, milk food (U=?)

I also want to know how long it would take to cool the contents if they were at put in the cabinet. As the fridge is for retail, one of the design specifications was for rapid cooling. However this may not be possible because the target market has economic constraints and I first need to make it affordable for any technology adoption to occur in the market.

I am looking to make a modular refrigerator, where customers can pick technology to suit their needs. For example, insulated panels to create a cabinet with the correct volume. This will also allow them to scale up when the time comes without disposing their whole system. This is why I am keen on creating a model (maybe on excel) which can be altered so I can find the best combination.

I'd be eternally grateful if someone could help or recommended any free programs that could help. I am a product designer, this isn't my strong point :P",AskEngineers,False,bludclatt,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hzyhzm/solar_refrigeration_university_project/

48,Career advice for new graduate - Engineering/construction/management industries specifically,1596016638," 

Hello all,

I am a long time lurker here but figured I'd finally call on some of you experts out there. I am a recent graduate of Environmental Science (hons) with a 2.1 from a good uni here in the UK. With COVID causing a some-what ''dry'' episode job wise, it seems like a good idea to stay in school and get a masters. So, here I am.

So far I have been applying for masters programmes in **Management, Construction Project Management and Energy/Environmental Engineering**. I am hoping anyone out there who is experienced with these particular disciplines can offer their advice and perhaps the pros and cons of their respective industries. I am looking to bolster my undergraduate degree, as environmental science BSc on its own can be a little underwhelming and more often than not, result in underpaid consultancy roles (nothing wrong with this, but I feel a little more ambitious).

A little about my goals. I am very keen to work abroad in some fashion. I am particularly interested in working in Switzerland, so that does influence my decision making to some degree. I am primarily interested in the overall enjoyment of working, i.e. making sure I don't spend all day in an office, hands-on tasks, problem solving, varied work environment yada yada... but I would be lying if I said a large salary does not play a very large part of my overall interest in a role. This is the crux of the issue. I want to achieve stable passive income. That is one reason why I am leaning more towards construction because of the general affiliation to property, where I hope to invest.

So far this is what I have come to learn about each of these roles, as well as my personal concerns for each, but please correct me if I am wrong as I want to be as informed as possible.

**Management**

1. It is a masters that is (debatable) a replacement/alternative to an MBA (in Europe)
2. Applicable to almost any industry due to its nature, but difficult to actually use the degree to better your position within a job market.
3. Useless in US due to their lack of acknowledgement of it being a real degree, especially compared to an MBA.
4. Good if you want to work overseas.
5. Can pay very well and lead to many different roles

**Construction Project Management**

1. The construction industry often favours experience over fancy degrees, even in upper management (any point to a degree then?).
2. Good job opportunities, abundance of jobs (especially surveyors) and pays well, but its a slow burner and definitely not get rich quick.
3. Good opportunities abroad (especially for surveyors).
4. Very interesting job with lots of variety (specifically PM's)
5. Managers and building surveyors (my two main interests in construction) have lots of opportunities to travel and get out of the office.
6. Future opportunities in BIM seem limited currently, but time will tell.
7. I have read some construction managers can charge £1000-2000 a day for certain contracts, is this true?

**Energy/Environmental Engineering**

1. Good pay and abundance of jobs
2. Energy engineer's specifically might be more sought after in the near future due to climate responsibilities (better pay)?
3. I personally will find it more difficult or take longer to achieve charter-ship in engineering as my undergraduate is not in an engineering discipline.
4. Opportunity to work abroad (noticing a theme?).
5. Lots of outdoor work, but apparently working offshore can pay something ridiculous like £2000 a day?

Are these assumptions correct? While I have undoubtedly forgotten and left out many important pros and cons of each area, this is simply what I could remember. But please, do feel free to tell me where I am wrong.

In general, I wish to know your thoughts on these areas if you have any, and what someone with my goals should ideally be looking to head for. I appreciate much of this is anecdotal in nature, but I do appreciate any help with this.

70,Pneumatic rocket cart design for a work of fiction,1595973757," Hi Engineers,

I am writing a fiction novel, in this world super compressed gas (assuming air) is possible and widely available but otherwise technology is in medieval era. Assuming compressed gas tank is the size of a medical E-size cylinder (about 25""H, 4.3""D, empty weight 8lbs).

The idea here is pretty simple: a crew is stealing a cart of compressed gas cylinders by puncturing them/opening valves to make a sort of rocket cart. The cart (wood, 4 wheels, sturdy) needs to carry the aforementioned cylinders and a single rider (under 140lbs). The cart needs to go straight, blast through a shed door (swing door, wood, not reinforced, unlocked), cross the front yard of the warehouse (assuming under 100ft of well-packed dirt) and similarly go through the front gate of the encampment (swing door, heavy, reinforced, unlocked or if not feasible then open) and then some more until it crashes in a ditch at a relatively safe distance from the front gate (another 200ft, or more if possible).

Questions:

1. What is the minimum pressure in the cylinder for this to be possible. Assume there is no restraint on how much pressure the cylinder can hold (magic tech).
2. How many cylinders can this cart carry and still move
3. How many cylinders need to be punctured and how many can be saved
4. How fast and how far can this thing go

We live in Kansas (ag. zone 6, iirc) and the average high right now (July) is in the 90s and in January the average low at night is in the 20s, and its highly variable with heat waves in the 100s and artic blasts in the negative teens. So it gets both hot and cold. 

We have a gas furnace and a conventional central A/C. Both are over 10 years old.

The AC is low on refrigerant and I would hate to ""pump and dump"" R22 every summer (very harmful GHG). The tech said the compressor is giving up the ghost. The whole thing is over 10 years old and my wife and I agree it's time to replace.

Heat pumps are the future, right? And it replaces natural gas with electricity that can be made with renewable energy, so it's fossil fuel free, or potentially. I like that.

My wife is skeptical though,and she is lobbying to just replace the compressor and not the whole air handler. Is our climate too cold for a heat pump to work in the winter?

84,Designing a solar tracker for a large mirror?,1595960869,"I work in the video/film production industry and we frequently will use a special 42x42"" mirror mounted in a yoke to redirect the sun for lighting daytime exterior scenes. Because the sun moves throughout the day, you have to constantly readjust the mirror so that the reflected sunlight lands in the same spot. I've seen a couple videos of small scale hobby projects using photodiodes to track the sun and move a motor accordingly. How can this kind of design could be scaled up to automate the movement of a much larger panel? Or is there an entirely different approach that would better solve this problem?

A couple other design considerations for the intended usage:

• I'd want to be able to easily and quickly override the stepper motors and reposition the panel by hand, and then continue tracking from that new position. Would this require some kind of friction clutch element?

• The motors would need to be strong enough to resist strong gusts of wind. Small movements of the mirror wavering can be really ruin a shot. I assume something like this would require a lot more power than the tiny solar trackers I've seen so I'm not expecting to be able to power it from the sun or with a small battery. We're used to running very long extension cables outside to to power cameras/lights/etc. We also use industry standard 14.8v ""v-mount"" and ""gold mount"" batteries frequently so if that was enough to power something like this, that would also be great.

• It to be be built like a tank. Like most other grip equipment, these mirrors/reflectors are usually rented by local crew members that have no incentive to be gentle with them, so they get pretty beat up.

The question relates to a a crane on a ship. As the crane lifts something heavy out of the water the ship deck compresses on the side toward the load. The operators have notices that the bolts lose their pre-load and can be turned by hand. My initial advice was to leave them alone as I was concerned about overloading the joint. As the load comes back on and they have been re-torqued, I am assuming the tension in the bolts would skyrocket.

The next problem is the bolts when they lose pretension, due to the motion of the boat and the vibration, must be working loose as the operators have taken to retorquing them  when the crane is unloaded. This i dont have much of an issue with and can understand. I had suggested using some thread lock on the bolted connection but there are concerns that this would eventually foul the blind hole that the bolts bolt into.

22,On the subject of friction limiting work done in a mechanical system,1595905865,"Apologies in advance for the clunky phrasing of things, this isn't my area of expertise. Also, in observance of community rule 3, I did try to find some information on this on my own, but I either didn't articulate my search well enough for Google to find what I wanted, or what I want to find exists in a very niche corner of the internet that I failed to find.

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCI3lxkpO2U), some archaeologists have built a watermill. They have some trouble in the beginning with getting the wheel to turn sufficiently fast in order to turn the mill stone and grind the flour. The problem they believe is due to the friction caused by the wooden gears. They appear to solve the problem with lubrication in the form of pig fat.

Elsewhere in the ancient world, the Chinese [devised a water mill](https://imgur.com/a/Lxq3cR4) in which the shaft driven by the wheel has three gears attached to it. Those three gears each then drive another gear set at a 90 degree angle. That gear, plus two adjacent gears for each of those three, in turn drive a mill stone. In total, the single water wheel drove nine two-ton grist stones.

**My question is this**: How can you know when you've added too many things to a system, and the friction of making those things move makes it impossible for them to actually move? I suspect someone from almost a thousand years ago would have used a lot more trial and error than mathematics. They could have just as well tried to make twelve stones work, and the machine shuttered under the stress, and so they took three off and settled for nine, but that's more guess-work than proving why nine works and twelve won't. Armed with a modern understanding of physics, carpentry, and CAD software, could we do much better at designing such a system, or is it really a matter of material limits?

Although the friction between one or two wooden gears may not be substantial, across the whole system it would add up to quite a lot of resistance in trying to get work done. The forces involved in making all of those stones move must be enormous.

Im studying in germany btw and Im a german citizen if it is relevant.

So I had last semester an internship on a wastewater plant in a lab. It was a pretty chill and cool experience, it was very interesting to get to know the wastewater plant more deeply. Since a job as a process engineer on a wastewater plant would be something I consider, unfortunately they dont hire engineers on wastewater plants in germany.  As well I dont want to work in a lab too, I want to design and calculate something. 

I think that my internship experience wouldnt be helpful in my future job search, so I want to write my bachelor thesis in a company with a relevant topic.

You now need to produce a short report that considers the ‘lessons learnt’ during the process. To do this: You will need to collate all of your work for Assignments 1 and 2 into a single portfolio. You should then review and reflect on the activities that have been completed for assignments 1 and 2, and make notes about what went well and what improvements could be made. You will also need to consider what would be done differently next time. You will then: Produce a report that will include three sections; a) a review of your practical work; b) a reflection on your personal behaviours; and c) a summary conclusion. Your report should: 1. review and reflect on the practical activity to investigate and explore electronic devices and their use in analogue and digital logic circuits, including: · What you have learnt through carrying out the activities in terms of knowledge, skills and techniques 

 2. explain the importance and use of behaviours in improving your personal performance, including reference to:

Introduction

The report covers my personal achievements and problems with producing two assignments and creating circuit diagrams, researching; analogue and digital circuits; and flip-flops, diodes, transistors and amplifiers.

What does this report layout and what summary can I write? The report  

This report lays out my reflection of what I have learnt and mistakes I have made in unit 19: electronic devices and circuits 

Review of practical Work

Introduction – don’t forget you need to open the topic with an introduction.

What was your attitude to practical work- did you keep your station tidy- minimise hazards?

My attitude to practical work was a good one I was already looking forward to when I would be creating circuits and working with electronics

§ How to safely use a soldering iron, when turned on to not touch any metal connected to the tip because of heat transference betIen metals.

o When soldering parts of the solder can jump off and hit the body burning and harming the person and may create other dangers

o When solder is heated up it creates toxic fumes which can be dealt with by using extraction fans to mitigate the toxic fumes. 

o With the heat generated by the soldering iron it is very easy to damage heat sensitive devices and instruments

§ How to correctly stop static electricity damage parts

o When static charge is built up in a person or circuit it can damage the circuit parts by overloading and shorting parts of the circuit

§ How to safely create a circuit

Knowledge 

I knew the majority of the skills needed to use the hand tools as I had done previous soldering with my pervious school, I had not known about electrostatic precautions before I was taught about it at college.

Did you know all the skills you needed to use hand tools? 

· What hand tools did I use

o Soldering iron 

o Pliers

o wire strippers 

o clamps

· What Ire new tools

o The clamps were new tools as I had not previously had the chance to use them to support the work and to hold wires and other pieces in place to stop me burning my hands

· Did my skills in already used tools improve?

o My skills improved with the use of the soldering iron and the wire strippers and the pliers with more experience using them I felt more comfortable 

· What was the most fun tool to use?

o The soldering iron was the most fun and enjoyable tool I used as I found it easy to use and satisfying to see the results

· What was the least fun tool to use? 

o The wire strippers Ire probably the least fun tool to use as when I used it occasionally the wire strippers would cut the wire instead of just removing the outer casing 

Did you know the electrostatic precautions?

The only perceived barriers I have had has been learning the different names of the parts and remembering the circuit diagrams for when building the circuits on the breadboards and the stripboards.

Did you have any perceived barriers (was the subject of transistors too difficult to understand and constraints (never used a soldering iron, bread board before?)

The subject of operational amplifiers was a bit confusing to understand at first but given time it made better sense. 

How did you interact with the Lecturer/other student customers in order to better understand the subjects?

Skills and Techniques 

The skills I learnt how to correctly use a soldering iron and set up a circuit to be used correctly. 

I also learnt how to create a digital circuit in software called multisim

Having undertaken some practical work do you think you have improved? (-think first solder compared to your last, cutting wires to correct length, using similar colour for same function (red + ve etc), handling components (electrostatic precautions – did you use them did you maintain those standards or did complacency set in and you let them slip). No one gets things perfect on the first (or even second) try, but what did you do to make things better with every iteration.

I feel as if my soldering skill has improved since secondary school because the solder quality when melting the solder and applying it to the circuit board, has improved as in the secondary school the solder would form in beads and not solder correctly to the board and wire, whilst now at college, the solder is forming the correct shape for soldering and connect to the board and wire fully and create an electrical joint.

Did you take ownership of problems and create solutions without seeking help?

How could you improve (consistency of weld, not rushing to complete, trimming wires so they are neat etc?

To improve the consistency of the solder I could try and practice more with soldering iron to produce a better-quality weld and practice with applying the solder wire to the soldering iron and the wire and board.

When using the soldering iron, I tried to not rush applying the solder to the board and wire so that the solder would form correctly and connect the board and wire.

When the solder was put on incorrectly, I had to use a suction device to suck the solder off of the board and reapply it so it was correctly applied to the board.

When cutting and stripping the wires occasionally they would split and they would require them to be either recut or twisted back together.

Personal Reflection

Time Planning

When writing the assignments, I would start them on the day they Ire set and slowly build them up over the assignment period and them in the final few days put it all together and them check my grammar and punctuation in the final day.

Activities scheduling appropriate order and timings (did you miss a step and go back what mistakes?) wrong pinhole/ LED wrong way around

When building circuits it was often the case that I would put the LEDs or the switches or the transistors in incorrectly and have to switch them around in the breadboard but on the stripboard, I would have to heat the solder again and redo the solder when it was correctly slotted in and working

Following Instructions

When building the circuits, I had instructions on what parts Ire used and Ire they Int by the form of a schematic diagram showing us what parts Ire connected to other parts and how they Ire connected.

Safety and Hazards 

When I was building the circuits, I would have to worry about;

Static electric discharges that could damage the components meaning they would have to be replaced.

When the soldering iron was hot it was easy to place down on the table and forget it was on and nearly reach for the metal bit but I realised halfway through that I was about to burn myself so from that point on I tried to remember to place it in the holder correctly and grab it by the handle and correctly operate it

When stripping the wires, it would occasionally cut one of the smaller wires that make up the wire leaving it with a sharp edge that was easy to cut yourself with.

When soldering the wires, I tipped the wires with solder so that they had some already on so it would solder easier when doing this I had to be careful of the tip as it was hot from me applying the solder to it.

Design

I was tasked with building off of a diagram into I a program called multisim were we had lists or different components and where we could colour code wires and move components around so that the diagram was easier to understand and work from.

Manufacture

If we were building circuits, we would be given a diagram that would have a list of all the different types of components we would need and a number next to them so I could see where it relates to on the strip/breadboard

Interpretation of documents

When I was first given the first diagram, I was confused on how everything fitted together as I couldn’t make heads to tails of it but when I started to place things down trying to keep as close to the diagram as possible It became easier to use and produce from.

Writing skills – how did you find writing the report talk about the research you did internet searches, use of Wikipedia not always academic studies.

When researching for reports I would type the question from the question sheet into google and read and make notes from the multiple websites I visited and then pool that research into a single document and then write it to fit the style of my writing and for it to answer the question.

How can the skills learnt to be taken forward – think of a role in aerospace or future study modules

With the skills I have learnt I should be able to correctly solder a wire into place on a circuit board in multiple areas and for it to be of high quality.

In aerospace, the skills would cross over very Ill as it would allow me to on the job repairs of equipment and electronics.

Skills:

Soldering

Manufacturing

Computer skills

For example, if I was to build a satellite, I would need to consider the following

Colour coordinating wires to recognise their roles in the system

Soldering to attach wires and parts

soldering to attach different parts

Just a few months after I graduated from my bachelor I was offered an internship in IT company to be a consulting/support technician of CMMS software and I accepted it (it's for 9 months). 

In the present I'm not doing much in the intership (~~maybe because of Covid-19~~) and I'm starting to think if this is a good path for my career since I'm a mechanical engineer and this area it's more for an IT person  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ . All of my  job colleagues are from the IT area, and they all say that “I shouldn't be here” (in a good way) because it's a completely different area then the one I studied for. 

I liked what I learned (like programming languages such as SQL/JavaScript/JSON/.NET even though I had to learn by myself with a BIG help of the Internet \^-\^)  and I understand that this is the future of engineering  (I think it is, since it's what it's taught now days...). I like reading code and understaing the logic of things so this new area fascinates! but I'm so uncertain of what I want for the future.  
I would like to see the world but I also want to have a decent job (not saying that the others aren't, I already worked in many retailers companies like supermarkerts/restaurants/wine stores and I have a huge respect to those people who work in those jobs) but a career of a engineer seems so complicated.

Any thougths if I should go abroad (Currently in Portugal)? Or should I remaing in this company for a little longer? If this intership is good for the curriculum and will companies give a thumbs up when seeing this? Any other tips?

66,Engineering Management after Chemical engineering,1595857679,"Hi, 
Nowadays I’m doing some research regarding what Masters would suit me after Bachelors in Chemical Engineering. There are some questions that I need answers to in order to make my decision.

1- Is Masters necessarily harder than a bachelors degree if I continue to study in the chemical engineering field?

2- What are other opportunities for me in terms of masters degrees like management, business or any other field?

3- I’m from Pakistan and I want to explore other countries to study for practical exposure and different experiences. What countries would be best for me to study in?

4- Plus I want to move permanently to another country so what fields would be best to study to live abroad?

5- Please clear me one thing, I was suggested to do a masters in polymer engineering and I’m interested in my field too. I have a fairly average GPA in my bachelors so I was thinking will I be able to do a masters in chemical engineering branched field? 
This decision is very critical for me as my sponsor(my father) would be spending a fortune sending me abroad to study and I don’t want to hurt my parents expectations by failing at this.

83,NPSHa and NPSHr for a ring section multistage centrifugal pump,1595821058," I would like to seek advice from you guys related to the NPSHa and NPSHr because I found this topic very useful for the industry and it is not  quite clear to me. 

I work for a Hot Strip Mill  as a maintenance supervisor and the reason why I ask this is because I\`d like to improve my general knowledge on centrifugal  pumps and increase my troubleshooting abilities and improve pump reliability but I still have some doubts and I was hoping you could help me understand on this topic.

This is the operating sheet of one of my High pressure centrifugal pumps:

[https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjZ0121a7YFQnHoP\_CDI5boaVVID?e=x9ii42](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjZ0121a7YFQnHoP_CDI5boaVVID?e=x9ii42)

[https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjZ0121a7YFQnHteviYjQx-8HpWF?e=LmcVu5](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjZ0121a7YFQnHteviYjQx-8HpWF?e=LmcVu5)

The NPSHr curve just for 3582 rpm.  


I  know that NPSHa is inherent to the system and its configuration and  that it is made of ""Static head, friction loss, vapor pressure, velocity  pressure and atm pressure) in other words is the pressure acting on the  liquid. (It represents the total pressure at the pump suction) I know  that the NPSHa changes with flow because of friction losses, so the more  flow the more losses in the suction head. This suction head can also be  affected by a reduction of flow. 

NPSHr is the minimum pressure head that must be present in the suction eye impeller to prevent the pump from cavitating. 

According to my pump sheet I have;

NPSHa of 50.72 m and NPSHr of 7.786m.

If  I understand correctly the NPSHa is the one that I can see in the pump  suction pressure gauge and the NPSHr is the one that I can see in the  pump characteristic curve so I must not let my NPSHa goes below my NPSHr  to avoid water reaching its vapor pressure and cavitation occurs.

NPSHa &gt;NPSHr  


My  doubt is that the Pump operating sheet shows that the pump works at  35°C but when checking on the water phase diagram the temperature for vaporization to occur at the NPSHr specified in the pump operating sheet  is almost 80°C.

What I mean is for a NPSHr of 7.786m, the temperature for the water to start boiling is almost 80°C

Where;

NPSHr=7.786m = 75.9Kpa at 80°C to start boiling

Now for a 35°C temperature that would be my operating conditation, the pressure needed for water to evaporate is almost 3kpa.

Why would the pump start cavitating at a pressure of 7.786m if the operating temperature is 35°C and not 80°C?

88,"What type of structure would you build to cover a 1 to 3 acre ""ecosphere""?",1595809228,"Hello Engineers of Reddit,

Myself and a fairly large group of like-minded individuals are building a ~~cult~~ private community on a former (and run-down) golf course. Most of us are pretty successful and want to build something really cool to serve as the feature of the whole property. We live in the Midwest, and the 6 months of the year you basically can't go outside is a real bummer. So, our idea is to cover a 1 to 3 acre area in such a way that it can be heated during the winter and kept relatively cool during the summer. We understand this will not be cheap and costs could get into the 7-figure range depending on what type of structure it is. Here are some of our considerations:

1. We have a huge, overbuilt, high-output renewable energy grid. The large amount of power to climate control this type of space during the extreme parts of the year is doable for us without massive energy consumption from our municipal energy provider.
2. We would like as much of the roof to be transparent as possible. Glass or polycarbonate seem like logical choices, with glass having awesome longevity but a big initial cost. Having some or most of the area made of a material that is transparent but could block some/most UV radiation would be great, but possibly not feasible.
3. For the actual structure, a geodesic dome seems like it would offer great strength without a (relatively) massive cost, but they are usually much smaller than what we are looking for.
4. We really want at least 20' ceiling/roof height. A large glass greenhouse may work if there are not significant drawbacks to that type of structure.
5. Because the structure will be heated in the winter, holding the weight of snow will likely not be an issue.

This structure would contain our community pool, ""outdoor"" office space for those of us that work from home, a small theater (really just a projector), and potentially some raised-bed gardens for year-round gardening. We're essentially looking for a community hub that can give us some of the feeling of being outside during the winter, and keep a little more cool than the 90f it frequently gets during the summer in our area.

Once we get this project out of the exploration phase, we will definitely hire one or more engineers/architects to oversee the project. Our total budget for the project is something like $2,000,000. We could go higher, but it wouldn't be ideal. Less is obviously great so we could spend more on upgrades and things to put ""under the dome"". We are not a bunch of rich folk (it's all relative, I suppose), just a few dozen middle-class people that pool our collective resources for this kind of thing.

92,Gas or Electric (Motor Assist),1595800927,"As we've started to do our own research to continue with my senior design project, we've run into issues when considering our device to be electric vs gas-powered. As a bit of background, the device my team and I must come up with will be used in the Middle East where they have arid/dry ground, but we are expecting it to be tilled fairly well. This device will be dragged along this plastic they throw over the crops while discs (more weight = more depth = more dirt = more resistance) push dirt along the edges in-order to hopefully keep the plastic from being pulled up from the wind.

We are looking to implement a feature that acts sort of like an assisted lawnmower, where the back wheels would possibly be driven by some sort of motor that'll help cut the manpower needed from 2 to 1 people. I envisioned pulling a shopping cart, and how you pull up and towards your face when going backward (as the user would), so driving the back two wheels would allow the user to pull up and over rough spots. The sponsors have mentioned that they would prefer solar or something green, but I've explained it may be tough to get it started and running, especially on these small farms with minimal workers. As of right now I have been considering: Electric (plug-in), Electric (solar), and Gas. Diesel was quickly thrown out of the picture because of the yucky maintenance, and it totally goes against the green theme. Doing some basic research I know that the electric assist sounds great, but relying on batteries may cause issues if they don't properly charge them, although I would plan a schedule when it came to keeping the batteries healthy since they only would be using this machine when they need to plant crops and throw this plastic down. Gas in the Middle East is quite plentiful as you all might know, so they have no issue with a simple gas motor but that isn't necessarily my area of expertise either, but it may seem like the best route to take.

I've been doing research, but I was told to use my resources, and to be completely honest Reddit is filled with some brilliant minds and amazing people. I'm hoping that you guys can help steer me in the right direction, or tell me I'm a complete idiot for thinking some of these might work. Again, this device wouldn't be a power hog but it definitely would need some juice to propel itself forward with a helping hand. Any tips/ideas appreciated.

Note: If you would like to see a very similar device, but manually pulled, the link will be below. This is where we got our basic idea from, so now we are trying to modify the idea in order to better help small farms.

93,Are jobs/internships for business majors PURELY based on connections? Is it near impossible to get an internship with just a few connections like engineering?,1595797449,"Engineering Question

(This question might be better in a business major subreddit but I want to hear what you guys have to say)


Its pretty obvious that a business administration major whether it’s specialization is in finance, marketing, MIS, supply chain, etc all require networking and connections. But are internships PURELY based on your connections and how well you’re able to present or network with professionals? I know sometimes they might want some software skills like excel or adobe stuff but those skills are needed anyway for an engineer. To me it feels like business majors don’t typically need a prior set of skills beforehand when applying and all you really need is to have a lot of friends. The same applies for getting jobs after college which typically comes from internship experience anyway. Does that mean that without having like over 500+ connections , you’re essentially gonna suffer finding jobs? There’s also 2x more business majors in the US than engineering so that makes it even harder. 

Like for engineering majors it’s not all connections because recruiters  do want to see some prior experiences in clubs with designing, autoCAD, using engineering softwares or even coding skills. And once you have these skills, I feel like it’s almost impossible not to get a job. Connections and networking still need to be done but it’s not like you need over 500+ connections. I’ve seen plenty of engineering majors with just one skill such as in autoCAD and like 5 connections get internships 10x more easily in their sophomore or junior year. 

So the question I’m simply asking is,

My idea is to get a cooler, drill holes in either side, and one in the back. The back hole with get a small fan. Pushing air inside. The side holes will get tubing of some sort attached and then threaded up the sides of our table and lead to the cases. The bakery cases will also have a hole drilled into the side. Once the holes are attached via ducts or tubes, I thought about first placing Ice, but then thought dry ice may work better, into the cooler.

14,Requesting advice on career transition from manufacturing to data science and machine learning,1595771733," Hey fellow engineers,  


I was hoping to get guidance on how/if I can switch fields from chemical/process/materials engineering to data science and machine learning (ML).   


I am in my mid-20s with a masters in Materials Science. I have been working for a small chemicals company on the East Coast since the beginning of 2019. While work has not been boring because it is a new challenge every day (start-up life....), I have been growing weary of my tasks lately.   


The only time I find joy at work and feel really engaged is when I have to do data analysis or write software (mostly in Python) to solve the plethora of problems we have. This sort of work is sporadic and usually involves 30% of my overall time. The other 70% is project management, systems engineering and material testing. Over the past 2 months, I've not had to do much coding and feel miserable showing up to work to do the other tasks I don't care about.  


The obvious thing to do is request management for more coding related tasks, but I don't think this is an option for a variety of reasons. First, developing software/data science/ML was never a part of my job description. I enjoyed doing it (did a lot of projects on the topic in grad school) and worked on my own time plus at work. Everyone loves the tools I created, but this is not sustainable given all the other commitments I have. Second, I really don't want to work my current job anymore because of dangerous work conditions (don't want to get into the details of this), extremely long hours and horrendously low pay.   


My biggest worry is that a transition from my current role to data science/ML sounds too big of a change from the eyes of an HR/hiring manager. I am worried that they will look at my degree (Masters in Materials Science) and job title (Materials Scientist) and immediately reject me for not having a CS background.   


What I do have going for me are, a Masters degree from a university world famous for its CS/ML program, numerous data science/ML projects and coursework from grad school, database development experience from my old part-time job, lead developer (data analysis and viz) experience from my current job. While I have not done it professionally, I am (or at least I am based on reading) well versed in data science/ML theory, tool kits and work flow and have written numerous online articles on these topics.   


I would be happy to provide more details, but based on what I've described here, and the current state of the world, is a transition from my process engineering role to data science/ML feasible? What steps should I be taking to improve my chances? Are there any specific companies/roles where my experience will be valued?   


I would love to hear from others who have undergone a similar transition. Any advice you can provide is appreciated and will go a long way towards preserving my sanity.

27,Can I use this Solar Charge Controller as a DC-DC step-down regulator?,1595755020,"I'm in Asia and I can't find the parts I want.  Ideally It's a sealed DC buck converter outputting 12V 10A.

35,Opinions about this offer I was recently given?,1595738951,"Currently an Aerospace Engineering student working at this composite manufacturing company as a co-op student composites technician. 

My shop manager recently gave me an offer a couple days ago. He said that I can contact them once I graduate if I want to work there as a composite technician, and then transition into the ""office"" after a couple years of shop-floor experience; a transition which my manager said my 'guaranteed'. According to my manager they want engineers who have shop floor experience before they make start making designs. From their perspective I can understand why but I have many doubts at the moment. 

Whoever is reading this, what is your opinion about the offer? What are some facts/circumstances I should factor into my decision making?

For some (long) context, here's a list of pros and cons about the circumstances of the offer that I thought about:

Pros:

* Becoming a manufacturing engineer is my dream job. I've wanted to go into manufacturing since my second year of university and my first shop-floor job. 
* The people in the company are great. All my current coworkers, and everyone in management are super friendly and chill, even the CEO who I had the pleasure of working with in the shop-floor is a chill dude. This is my second shop-floor job and I'm surprised there are next to no people I find insufferable in the entire shop.
* The company is apparently going to grow larger. From what I was told, the company has been doubling in size every year as they acquire more contracts. This seems like it's a good sign for job security (albeit, with some ambiguity). 
* This is a great chance for me to enter the work force once I graduate. The current pandemic crippled the civil aviation industry. I can always consider working in defense but regardless, the job market isn't exactly the best in the country I currently live in (Canada).

Cons:

* My main worry is that the offer is a 'bait'. I can imagine being two years into the job only for my manager to suddenly 'forget' that he said I was 'guaranteed' an office job. I'd prefer to have an engineering related job, not technician work.
* Two years is somewhat a long time for circumstances to change. I don't know if they'll be looking for new engineers by then and if they'll even guarantee me a position, regardless of whether or not I sign a contract stating so. 
* I going to rack up quite a lot of student debt, and from what I heard about the average technician earnings in that company, it's not as high as a entry level engineer. I'd prefer to earn more so I can have a head start on paying off my students loans. Albeit, money isn't a big concern to me compared to the first two above.

How do you like your job? What is the day to day like and what are you exactly responsible for doing?

How easy was it to find employment? Do you know the general trend in the coming years? Ive read that the demand is somewhat lower in Canada (and Alberta where I live) but to my understanding it's still a really good choice among all the engineering disciplines.

54,Career Crossroads: Technical vs. Management Path/Advanced Degrees,1595710050,"I'm wanting to go back to school soon with the goal of advancing my career but am stuck between choosing an MS and MBA (or technical vs. management path in general). My two main career goals are to (1) maintain a good work-life balance with plenty of energy left by the time I get home and (2) have a $200k+ salary by mid- to late career. (Disclaimer: this figure is based on living on the U.S. west coast) 

My pros for an MS are that I feel I would be more passionate about the topic (therefore would leave me feeling a little less exhausted at the end of the day) and being able to get my hands dirty. I love the idea of actually being on a factory floor or in a lab building and testing physical products. If going down this route, I'd probably get an MSME with a focus in mechatronics since I've found that field the most interesting from my career to date. My assumed cons with the technical route are doubt whether I'd be able to achieve my salary goal and the possibility of getting pigeon-holed with specific processes/types of projects at a certain level of seniority (I much rather prefer to know a little bit about a lot of topics than a lot about a few).

The pros for an MBA would be the assumed greater salary prospects in management, I already enjoy being a mentor to young engineers, and having the ability to enact/enable real change within the company. The cons are that I would be more removed from the actual product, would be stuck in meetings all day, consequently end up coming home more exhausted, and otherwise never really be 'off the clock' once entering mid- to director-level management.

In summation, I'm looking for sanity checks regarding my assumed pros/cons above and any advice from the engineering community in general based off of their own experience in pursuing the technical vs management career paths and/or MS vs MBA. Any resources or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

55,Really Stressed and struggling like crazy at job and want to explore potential solutions.,1595709514,"Hey Ask Engineers,

Thought I'd write here regarding some issues I am having with my current job. Without going into too much detail(for the sake of anonymity) here goes.  

The Problems:

I started working at a small company where testing is my primary function about a year and a half ago. I was hired by a person with 20 years experience, as well as expertise in the field while I was a noob out of college haha I got hired in due to him being behind on projects(he was the only person there, and get loads of work so a two person team is necessary).   I got hired as a technician to perform all of the tests he needs results on and overall despite the obvious beginner mistakes I was doing well after the first month actually, and working hard. Eventually I was even told that my testing results are trusted as we get 100s of samples and about 20 test requests at a time. Overall things were very smooth as I even stayed late whenever needed. Mainly I did all the testing and he did all the advanced analysis.

9 months into the job I get called in and I find out the person is leaving. Then couple days later I find out that management is giving me all the work making me perform the work of 3 people.

While I initially looked at it positively as this means I can get more experience and building my resume to the T, it is putting me under loads of stress as I am constantly in situations involving customers where I literally don't know how to perform tasks and a lot of times the management rushes to getting customer work. This in addition to the very high work load stresses me a bit to the point of anxiety.

Another stressor is I notice The company I work at is not in the greatest shape, and they said they aren't hiring anybody. Additionally they are desperate for money, as one of the managers told me ""we aren't making much money, we spend more than we earn at times'. Also I have noticed management knows nothing of my field and what I do, and I am the only person in my field in my entire company making me feel like I am on an island.

Any solutions you guys suggest?

Solutions I am thinking;

1) I like my field so one solution I am thinking is Leave and get another job. Study the skills on my own time given I have saved lots of money. --&gt; most likely wont do this

2) Look for another job while working and developing skills.

3). Keep developing my skills to make job easier to fill knowledge gaps. 

4.) Call external sources for assistance on tasks whenever needed. As in when I am uncertain on something despite trying the tasks, I can show them what I tried

5) Invest in better and more automated analysis tools(already coded my own thing for this, but I think there are faster solutions out there which I am exploring, but you have to lease things)

6) Find another path.

management has said I am doing good job, but I feel incompetent at the moment due to feeling 'in over my head'. With my inexperience I don';t want to worsen the status of the company as its already in somewhat poor shape(the general vibe I get kinda indicates it). Most of the good employees have resigned already, and lots of people have been laid off.  Also equipment is poorly maintained and is outdated. No one seems to do anything about it so I may intervene with this.

- it has an amazing ability to develop the most complex geometries and functionality (albeit with the right licenses)
- the modeling is extremely robust provided you select tree features
- master modeling is smooth and enables complex assemblies to take up little RAM
- it is well set up for large assembly + large workforce access (i.e. 1500 engineers working on the same product)
- 3D GD&amp;T is great so I don't need to manage a separate file (but exporting to suppliers without capability to read it required a custom macro export)

Cons:
- cost (it is ridiculously cost prohibitive for any medium or small company)
- the controls are vastly different to other CAD software and require adjustment (considering most Eng Degrees learn solid based modeling softwares)

Features:
- the publish bodies tool is amazing for master modeling
- the surface modeling generation has much more freedom than most other CAD

Autodesk Inventor (with PDMC):
Pro's:
- Autodesk is very involved and receptive to feedback (for me at least
- they are transparent on cost (but it is still negotiable to lower), and their PDMC is a reasonable cost compared to other companies
- integrated CAM is great for CNC machines if you have a workshop
- other users who just need basic controls can get Fusion 360 licenses at a fraction of the cost

Cons:
- Solidworks is a much more used industry standard and people will likely need training (I use solidworks presently, I find it buggy and updates are rarely on issues I face - it seems Dassault Systems is more interested in CATIA than Solidworks)
- the factory design aspect is nice but buggy (and AutoCAD is a strange tool to use to define layouts when coming from Product Design)

Features:
- 3D in built tolerance analysis tool (it is great for simplistic analysis, haven't used it for GD&amp;T
- Factory design utility for layout and finding bottlenecks up front

Fusion 360
Pro's:
- extremely intuitive to use
- integrated basic CAM
- cloud based tool for collaborations 
- low cost
- it leverages the computers hardware for processes (big plus after using Onshape)

Cons:
- unable to do complex surfacing
- unable to do complex molded parts (a specific example that prevented me from using this was drafting specific faces of a complex object in a strange die line, based on  a 3D curved interfaced surface - long winded but hopefully makes sense)
- many features are basic and not that advanced (yet apparently, from the discussion I had with a rep with Autodesk it seems there intent is for this to replace the need for Inventor long term, but I cannot verify this, and I think it has a long way to go).

Some additional mentions:

Solidworks - it is widely known and capable of doing most tasks without much head scratching, I just find it doing buggy things too often, and the crashes are unbearable.

Onshape - it is the most intuitive CAD software I have used. It is highly configurable and capable of quite amazing things. The support team is very responsive and updates are swift (i.e. I flagged the molding draft issue to them and they had an update the following month - can't confirm if they were already working on it). CAD is visible and editable via phone. The big and only reason I didn't have this as my front runner is that is does not leverage your computer hardware at all - I stared at a loading circle more than working, and my models were not even that complex.

63,Am I about to get fired?,1595694827,"Need outside perspective

In the interest of maintaining anonymity I will generalize some details.

Some background...I graduated with a civil engineering degree about 10 years ago and got experience early on with a heavy construction contractor. I had my EIT so after a few years of that I started work for a small geotech firm to pursue my PE. Fast forward enough years in the field with random time in the office throughout the years to meet experience requirements in my state to sit for the PE exam, I got my PE and was slowly transitioned into the office in a lower mid level management role.

It’s now been about a year in the new role and up until about a month or so ago, I had been doing pretty well and taking on new challenges with positive feedback from my primary manager.

Incident of note, nearly two months ago I was assigned a relatively small assignment but one that was similar to work I had previously worked on in the past year. Work in the office had just begun to pick up and scheduling was a little chaotic between different managers and getting assigned tasks and field work. In the middle of the scheduling chaos I tried to pass this assignment onto a colleague fearing I would not have enough time to complete the work within the deadline but my primary manager insisted I should work on it so I did. Long story short I failed to meet the deadline due to some last minute errors (from trying to rush and meet the deadline) and left my primary manager to complete the assignment himself (due to being assigned to the field at the time coinciding with the deadline).

Since then, my primary manager seems to constantly go out of his way to nitpick any possible mistake or anything that could potentially result in a mistake. They have also pointed out one thing they insist I must improve on, any attempt to make improvements on that one thing have resulted in further comments of that one thing needing improvement.

During this time they have issued a written warning as well as a communication to HR about me needing to improve on the one thing. Prior to these past two months, I have never had any issues outside of the random late time sheet entry.

I’m starting to think I’m being pushed out and that they are trying to make a “mountain out of a molehill” in an attempt to establish a record of me not meeting expectations. I’m relatively close with two coworkers with similar work experience and they have not experienced scrutiny to this extent.

I have started updating and fine tuning my resume and have started to keep an eye on the job market as a precaution but don’t intend to pursue anything new right away, although the past two months have been incredibly stressful from all the extra scrutiny.

70,Bolt preload and external load summation considering the joint stiffness ratio,1595683319,"Hello, it is my understanding from reading shigleys that bolts in pre tension see a load of 

Total = pretension + external_load* C

Where C is the stiffness ratio of the bolt to the total stiffness of the joint (bolt+plates).

My question is, what happens when a pretension of 75% of yield is applied and the external_load*C of 25% is applied after the C factor is applied such that the bolt is at yield point.

Would the bolt fail before joint seperation occurs?  

If so would the solution be to reduce the pre tension to be less than yield? I see in many places you should pre tension as much as possible as it is ""free"" safety margin. 

It seems counter intuitive that:

if the preload*C &lt; 0.25yield SAFE 

if 0.25yield &lt; preload*C &lt; 0.75yield FAIL ON BOLT

In British Standard and/or American Society for Testing and Materials (specifically BS 443-82 and ASTM A90/A90M), the mass of zinc coating in a galvanized steel wire ,C, can be calculated using this expression:

C = (W1-W2)/W2\*D\*1960

In College, I want to major in engineering (don't know exactly what type yet) and hopefully become an engineer one day but I don't want to end up as someone who spends all day in a cubicle, staring at a screen.  what I'm trying to say in a not so elegant way is that I want a job that would be challenging and interesting, I don't want a boring 9-5 job and go home hating my life.

Is engineering still a good option? If yes, what type of engineering should I look into? 

Also is there any place where I can talk to an engineer one to one and ask questions and get to know what exactly they do?

Some say the distance from the axis of rotation to the cylinder rod * force (F) output put by cylinder rod is enough. Neglecting angle of engagement altogether.

Others say you have to use rFsin(theta) between the rod and the linkage, then use that new force to calculate rFsin(theta) between the linkage and lever arm.

Essentially I am trying to record the pressure response as I inject air into a porous medium.

To do this I have a tool with a chamber. The chamber has a pressure transducer and holes to let air escape into the medium.

My flow is: Air tank (100psi) -&gt; pressure regulator(down to 60psi) -&gt; tool (recording psi) -&gt; porous medium.

Will the pressure regulator mean that the pressure inside my tool will always be adjusted to 60psi? For example if the tool is in not in a medium the psi recorded by the transducer would theoretically be 0 but because air is restricted by the size of the holes there will be a pressure. If the tool was in a solid medium, the tool is essentially ""closed"" and the pressure should be 60psi.

Will the pressure regulator allow the pressure inside the tool to vary between that baseline and 60psi or will it always be adjusting to maintain 60psi at the output?

53,"Vehicle Engineers: Where's the line between ""Repaired Statutory Write Off"" and ""Used a substantial portion of the old car to build a new car""",1595588295,"So I have a car here that's been punted up the back end, statutory write off despite running and driving, no airbag deployment, etc.

Anyway, I was wondering at what point does the lime occur between it being a statutory write off, and using the front cut to build a new car, for example, an ICV?

Can I cut behind the A-Pillar? Do I cut behind the B-Pillar? Is it a cut forward of the firewall? Or is a front cut not an option here?

There's a tonne of options I have here as all the damage is located behind the B-Pillar, and that's mainly because the roof is minorly buckled just in front of the C-Pillar.

So it would be an ideal setup to cut rear of the B-Pillar, insert a wall and rear subframe, and build a ute out of it. Fabrication of a rear subframe is fairly straightforward, you can also get them off the shelf if you know where to look. So it's doable.

I'm just wondering at what point is the tip between ""You've used a bucketload of the car, and the undamaged bits"" and ""Dickhead, that's still a statutory write off, you're wasting your time""

Because I have seen cars mangled and fused, with one of the cars being a stat write off, the other being close, and an entire body transplant from the B-Pillar forward being conducted, with everything rearwards being thrown away.

I've also seen cars that have been crumpled at the front being rear end donors for cars that have busted up the back, so I know a fusion is possible, I've gone through the writings and I just can't locate a defined delineation or line in the sand here.

Location is Queensland, so QCOP comes into play here as well as NCOP, and I know I'll still have to follow NCOP13 and NCOP14 here as it's Electric, and that's part of why I want to salvage a substantial portion of the parts that revolve around the compliance of those parts, as that is a colossal undertaking to comply with in some ways.

Good morning!! it’s 5:51 am atm

First I must pay my respects to any of you in these majors, because almost every wElcome/get to know uS/prep for my Uni, has a kind method of noting the gruesome workload math alone pertains. The placement exam to get Cal 1 has already incited an indistinguishable mix of anxiety and excitement in me for the fall. You are all really epic for working toward or already have graduated from a STEM field, and I hope I can be disciplined enough to make it to where ye guys are. qvq 

With that said, I wrote the linked post above when I was a Junior in HS! I’m a college freshman now :D I hope anyone who was from that time and sees this now is doing successfully even in this ooF time.

At the time Environmental E was something of interest to me because i really like gardening hehe; I’ve managed to figure out more things I like for a clearer direction (or as much as a freshman would know). The hardware aspect of Comp E still interests me to this day.

LEGIT as I was writing this I looked at the academic map thinking it was CS and thought it sounded a lot more fun than my initial opinion. Then i looked up and nah it was engineering. It’s odd because I feel more gravitated towards it, despite being aware of the excruciating amount of effort i’ll need to put in Cal and Physics. In every major there are parts that will be difficult right? Maybe that’s what I’d need to compromise on (will utilize every help outlet the ambassadors have ever mentioned too since math do be scary alone) IT STILL FEELSS SO GREAT TO FINALLY GRASP CONCEPTS THO &gt;:00 After those classes, I feel like i’d love everything that would come afterwards even if difficult. Hands go büild e désign.

My views conflict once I get to CS because I’m all for going for something you like and working hard against the odds, but do I want peace of mind more often and less unidentified adrenaline? A lot of now CS majors yeeted Comp E bc the workload became too overwhelming and the amount of hours put on hw alone do make me worried. 

Freshman year isn’t too different for the two since it’s mostly just core classes, Cal, and depending on which it’s either Chem or Programming. I wonder now if i’ll ever truly love math, rn it feels like we’re in a courting phase and are differing on how to raise our kids. Like CS promises me a content life but Comp E is like a whole baddie who swoops ye off your feet.

Comp E seniors aRE STILL PUSHING OUT A WHOLE SCHEDULE AT SENIOR YEAR while CS (and i’m sorry if i’m undermining this, surely it is difficult) only needs to take two advanced electives per semester. I don’t understand why i’m not more inclined toward CS despite the subjects not creating a sporadic or wavering sense of worth in myself. It seems more welcoming to me like a suburban grandma on her patio. Like I know I can say Hi to her if I just walked up to her. Like a clean faced guy my parents could approve of (esp with the 1k less in tuition per semester). I heckin enjoy statistics, algorithms are sensible, and programming is fun. I don’t have a hidden voice to grows if I seem to be taking too long to understand a concept. I’m likely to be confident in this field, but hardware is still something I’d like to spend my time on.
 

Both these fields have their strengths and I think I’d ultimately vibe with either at the end of the day, though a decision must be made. My advising isn’t for another week, so I have a bit of time.

I’d love to hear your experiences if you’ve been in any of these fields and your input! Be it your social groups, how your time was spent, did you remember to eat often, etc etc

I am in the process of building a robot and I am at a point in the process where I am building a dynamic model. I am working through some derivations for moments of inertia and I have reached a point where I am a bit stuck and could do with some outside assistance. I am linking an imgur album showing my workings: [Inertia derivations work](https://imgur.com/a/sGZGtWd). All my derivations so far are for cylinders, both hollow and complete. The axis system in all derivations are x,y for the Cross Section of the cylinder, and z is the length.

Picture 1 shows the derivation of Inertia of a complete cylinder about the z-axis, I am pretty happy that this is correct.

Picture  2 shows the derivation of Inertia of a hollow cylinder about the z-axis, I am pretty happy that this is correct.

Pictures 3 &amp; 4 show the derivation of Inertia of a complete cylinder about the x-axis at the midpoint of the cylinder, I am pretty happy that this is correct.

Picture 5 shows the derivation of Inertia of a complete cylinder about the x-axis at the endpoint of the cylinder, I am pretty happy that this is correct.

Picture 6 shows the derivation of Inertia of a complete cylinder about the x-axis at an arbitrary distance away from the cylinder. I am relatively happy that this is achieved by simply changing the limits of the integral as shown, but I would welcome any feedback on this.

Picture 7 shows the derivation of Inertia of a hollow cylinder about the x-axis at the midpoint of the cylinder. Here I am having problems, and I have highlighted where I suspect the mistake is with a green box. Google suggests that lots of people show the derivation about the z axis, but I have only found the formula for inertia about the x or y axes. Can somebody point me in the right direction? Once I have this derivation cracked I am hoping to derive both the endpoint and arbitrary distance as I did the complete cylinder, which will allow me to complete my robot dynamic model.

I am trying to make a zinc-air battery powerful enough to charge a phone (5V @ 0.5A). My latest attempt has given me .03 watts (.58V @ .05A) of power from a single cell. Both the voltage and the current are way too low. I was hoping to use &lt;10 cells in this battery

My design currently consists of a cathode and anode paste separated by filter paper. Both are \~8 molar solutions of KOH and thickened with xanthan gum and superabsorbing polymer as to suspend zinc powder for the anode and MnO2 for the cathode. The cathode has MnO2 to act as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction and has steel wool within it to act as a current collector. The internal resistance of the battery is high, around 600-700 ohms.

I lost the research paper I followed as a guide ;-;

A specific list of paste components:

\- 50 mL distilled water

\- 21.4g KOH

\- 1g xanthan gum

\- .1g super absorbing polymer

\- Drop of surfactant (dish soap)

\- 163g zinc powder for anode OR 10g of MnO2 for cathode

How much does the type/specialty of engineering degree matter after your first job?,1595546182,"I majored in Materials Engineering with a focus in metallurgy and applications to aerospace and mechanical engineering. I at first I wanted to do chemical or mechanical engineering but was stuck so I went into materials engineering. I now am realizing that mechanical engineering wouldve been a much better choice.

I did a Co-op in heavy manufacturing, operations and quality for an aerospace supplier. I then did two internships at major aerospace firms in quality engineering and materials engineering R&amp;D. My current job, which is my first out of school, is at the same company I did an internship with. This job is in repair/maintenance engineering and is really a support/field/project engineering job with a major aerospace engines company. I don't design components or do failure analysis. I work on maintenance and service requirement documentation  with customers, and other engineers in the company to deliver maintenance, overhaul and upgrade needs. I also work on delivering solutions and overhaul initiates across programs and customers. This is really project management based and a chunk of my co-workers aren't engineers. If a problem happens with a customer, we have to help communicate and coordinate solutions/initiatives and implementations from design and other technical support engineers.

I feel like my materials engineering degree is holding me back from getting a different job because tons of apps require only mechanical/chemical/aerospace and don't mention materials engineering at all. This makes me feel stuck because my app wont even be looked at and HR will filter me out, even with relevant experience and skills.

94,"understanding fundamentals of free fall, terminal velocity, and air resistance",1595530841," 

Recent  grad here. Took a shower last night and had some shower thoughts. I was  watching a video where a person went around asking strangers which ball  would hit the ground first when he dropped them from the same height: a  basketball, or an a heavier ball the same exact size. Most people  obviously assumed the heavier ball would hit first, but he explained  that objects on earth accelerate at the same rate, regardless of mass.

From  a theoretical standpoint this is correct, but this answer changes when  you take into account air resistance. I know that heavier objects have a  faster terminal velocity than lighter objects, and I know that it takes  *longer* for heavier objects to  reach their terminal velocity. My question is this: if you were to drop  two identical balls (same size, surface area &amp; therefore same drag  coefficient) from 6 feet, would the heavier ball *technically* hit first?

My  confusion is here: I know that terminal velocity increases with mass,  and I know that the objects are being affected by air identically. Does  this mean that both balls are decelerating at the same rate, and the  heavier ball can just max out at a faster velocity?

If  the balls were to be dropped from a plane, the heavier ball would hit  first because it has a higher terminal velocity.

Requirements; 4200 GPM, Filter 20 micron. Water temperature is around 150F. Particulate is hard iron powder. Material measured in water before sand filter, worst case 12mg/l.

We are filtering out heavy iron powder out of water before some pumps to prevent wear on the blades. There is a 10 micron screen before the pumps that can backwash.

Before the sand filter we have a small pond that is 250k gallons that flows into a 1 million gallon pond that then is pumped to the sand filter. The small pond is dredged yearly to remove iron powder. The idea is to backwash the sand filter into the small pond.

My engineering mind says that it's worked for 50 years, don't change it, but there is a lot of new ideas. We are trying to filter out iron, so magnetic is an option, and it's heavy. I like to play to its physical properties...

Negatives is that it is extremely hard iron, about as hard as iron can get. It will wear away pipes, gears, bearings or anything that it is rubbing against.

Ideas considered;

Llemela- Pro's Plays to the specific weight of iron and drops out quickly, no moving parts low wear, Con's very expensive to install.

Wet Magnetic Separator- Pro's plays to magnetic property, Con's by passes too much material, tough to work on and going to be huge due to flow.

Sock filter- Pro's can re-melt the material easily, Con's not sure of bypass and handling. 

Large settling pond- Pro's we have this and maybe i just need a different engineer to work out the volume we would require for it to all drop out of solution.

32,Providing a ground reference to a floating supply.,1595472562," The supply my TS100 came with is sadly typical of switchers of this kind and has a 48V AC at 1meg impedance (measured) leakage on the output from capacitive coupling of the transformers which is needless to say bad in some cases (FET gates).

Of course there's the grounding strap but after some careful work finding the clips I was able to cleanly disassemble the supply and I'd like to place a 10k resistor from the saftey ground on the input to the secondary ground so it has a basic ground reference.

This will drop the AC voltage to around .5 volts which should be ESD safe for my practical purposes. It's technically not isolated at this point but I see no reason for full galvanic isolation all the grounds in my house are good and there's no situations that I can foresee that would cause any issues. The resistor will be 6 watts (excessive but it's what I had) so even if the output somehow comes into contact with mains voltage or higher it won't explode.

I'll be using heat shrink tubing along the full length of the wired resistor on top of the normal insulation and there's plenty of space for good clearance, I see no problems with this, are there any concerns or considerations I'm missing?

39,What is an Applications Engineer?,1595463404,"Hi guys,

I'm an entry-level job seeking mechanical engineer and I realized that I have a huge problem.

I am the first engineer of my family and, while my support system is great, I have zero guidance in the industry. This year has been pretty grueling, I have put maximum effort into job seeking with little to no result. Believe me, I have re-evaluated my strategies multiple times, self reflected, tried many tactics and to be honest, it is a jungle out there and whatever this post is not about that.

*I put the main question in code block so you can skip the extras if you want.*

I would like to talk more about my absence of guidance regarding engineering things. I have never admitted it aloud but I really don't know what I want to do (which is a shame because, looking at my job search, it's not like I really have a choice). That is the root of the problem. I definitely know what I don't want to do: Civil, Electrical, Industrial, HVAC, etc...

But even then, I don't feel confident with my knowledge on what some of those are and I don't trust me judgement. To be honest, I want to have a job that values creativity, risk-taking, problem-solving, handling pressure, communication skills, and has me working on something amazing. I sound self-entitled, I know. But I don't know if to stifle these feelings or not because some people say go for what you want and others say take what you can. This whole post-graduation experience has been really draining and confusing and I am not my best right now. I have all this drive to be the best I can be but I am stuck in this limbo. I feel like a Scalar. I'm sure I just need some direction. Wow, sorry for that and the feelings pouring.

    Back to the question in the title. This is one of those examples on how I am so
    clueless that it is clipping my wings. I was on the phone with a hiring manager
    and he asked me if I even know what an Applications Engineer is? No, I don't
    know. Alright, then you should really look that up before the interview.
    
    (It is not to be mistaken for a software type job)
    
    I have searched and searched and nothing is consistent about defining that title.
    I read things about Material Handling (uh oh is that Industrial), or things like
    acts as an automation consultant to customers (Don't really understand and family
    doesn't either). 

This is the theme of most of my situations. 2 weeks ago I had waited 2 months for a phone interview just for the hiring manager to start by saying, "" I took a look at your resume and I'm sure there is a mix up. This job isn't for you."" (Distribution Engineer...) Again, clueless, confused, frustrated. That was my 2nd of two interviews in the last 6 months with 600+ applications since February. But just if you guys could give me some relief in this situation, it would save me so much worry. What the heck is an applications engineer.

54,Will the force be different enough to matter?,1595444549,"I'm asking regarding a black powder revolver and specifically, the nipple design. Blowback through the nipple into the hammer can sometimes affect your shot and over time, the firearm, from what I understand. I have been told a different nipple design minimizes that. So, here we are. 

Most of the common cheaper nipples have basically a straight pipe configuration. You place the percussion cap on the nipple, pulling the trigger drops the hammer onto the cap. The hammer striking the cap causes ignition which flows through a small hole in the bottom of the nipple igniting the powder charge and firing the gun. Sometimes, especially with a higher charge, a little blowback comes back through the nipple pushing the hammer up.

There are nipples designed with the ignition hole placed more to the side of the nipple, effectively making the blowback do a 90* turn before exiting the top of the nipple and forcing the hammer up. Does this effectively reduce the blowback or is it just something to sell? 

To me, doesn't seem that it would do much, as you are still dealing with X amount of force coming through the ignition port, up the tube of the nipple and onto the hammer. In my mind, it doesn't seem that a single turn would reduce that force that much. However, I am certainly no expert and would like to be educated on this particular topic.

55,How can I possibly turn this jumbled mess of an Environmental Engineering career into something I can put up with?,1595444454,"

Team,

This is as much a rant as it is a genuine plea for advice. I graduated about six years ago with a BS in Petroleum Engineering during the boom. I was lucky to have a field engineering job prior to graduation in 2014, but after nine months, the downturn claimed my job there along with just about everyone else at my shop. Fast forward a year and hundreds of job applications, I'd finally found a position at a state level environmental agency, and it was excellent. Unfortunately, the pay was only around 45k per year, so I had to sacrifice some comfort for my financial future. 

After about a year and a half, I moved to another state and found a Project Engineering type position with an environmental construction firm—an excellent transition from my former regulatory position. I did this for about a year and a half until the constant travel began to impact my psychological health--and I eventually moved on (after hundreds of applications, of course). I'm now with an environmental consultant in my home state, but now the economic decline brings this threat of once again traveling if I want to keep my job. The dread of again leaving my family and friends has hit me pretty hard. I'm in a tough place along with basically everybody else, and I haven't even started traveling away from home yet. 

Even if I force myself to go with the flow, as I've always done, I feel that there is no way my psychological health will permit the sort of work performance required to be a technical lead with all manor of yellow iron and environmental hazards about. Not to mention the pandemic which weighs heavily on my well being every single day.

I consider myself to be very competent and quick to learn--this is the only way I've been able to transition so easily from oil and gas, through to all manner of environmental work in three dramatically different focuses. Regardless of this, I do have difficulty convincing people to hire me. Whether it's the Petroleum degree on my resume, or my (sometimes) severe social anxiety during interviews, I've lost so many excellent jobs without without even having a chance. I see myself enjoying so many types of careers and activities, just not desolate field work in a depressed town left in the dust decades ago when the one employer was shut down for environmental non-compliance.

I have just about had it with my “engineering” career. Where are the bootstraps I need to pull on to get myself out of this rut? The ones I’ve been using have simply allowed me to sink deeper into a career that isn’t sustainable for me—based on my average life satisfaction over the last few years. I enjoy Environmental, but I will only be happy managing contracts and red tape with regulators, setting up groundwater recovery systems from an office downtown, or writing up and designing project proposals with a talented team. How can I possibly wrap up all of my useful skills into a neat bundle that will put me to work doing something I’ll actually excel at? My tenacity is running dry—I can only “push through” for so long. How long am I really going to be “putting my time in” until the Universe will bestow me with a job I enjoy? My current position is a slacker’s dream—half of it is just being a warm body overseeing contractors. I want to work on difficult projects, figure out the hard stuff, and make a difference in the bottom line. And if I can’t do that, I just want to join like-minded coworkers downtown for beers every now and then as we bitch about how we hate the TPS reports.

63,Am I unhappy in my career choice or just my jobs?,1595437344,"So I will start off by saying my first two jobs that I had as an electrical engineer I enjoyed for the most part. Until sometime Midway through my second job I came to the realization that I was doing 90% of the work and my manufacturing area and the other guy who was supposed to be helping was getting paid a lot more than I was and wasn't doing anything.

I was fortunate enough that I got into a program that allowed me to complete my associate's degree in electromechanical engineering when I graduated high school. I then proceeded to get my bachelor's in the same thing by the time I was 19. So for the most part I'm usually better at my job then the people I work with but each subsequent position I've had I've become less and less motivated to do anything and if I wasn't good at the controls aspect I probably would have been fired from one by now. I can't seem to see the point and putting forth the effort that I used to anymore and I don't know why. 

I've contemplated doing a career change because I hate having to go out and do maintenance jobs because maintenance is too incompetent to do it. It's a never-ending cycle and it never seems to change no matter what I do I can give them all kinds of help documents complain to managers it doesn't do anything they just don't do what they're supposed to and then come get me and I'm obligated to do it. I originally thought that I was upset because I didn't feel like I was getting paid as much as other people to be doing more work at a better quality but now that I'm closer in pay years later I still don't have the motivation to work like I used to work.

Then I thought of some sort of sonar technology. Maybe there could be something that attaches to your car and emits sonar waves. Ideally, these waves would reflect off the incoming car, but I don't know if sonar waves could bend up and over a  hill like that.

First post here. I am working with a vacuum chamber that has a movable material within it.

I have been working basically only in the oil and gas industry (currently at Suncor) but have most been on the projects side and not really done a lot of technical work. Obviously have dealt with the technical side but being with the client side do not really need to do a lot of the technical work myself. I would love to do some 3D modelling and some hardcore calculations and some pure technical work and the project side (cause I do enjoy that side). I am getting sick of the Oil and Gas industry and really want to transition out, more so want to do something more tehcnical and more alligned with my passions. I love technology and design and want to combine these two some how. I would love to do my own thing and venture out on my own, but its not possibly right now. 

I love technology and am learning to code by myself but I want to some how combine my love of tech and mechanics. Something in hardware design and integration and project management. I know its a huge thing, I think Tesla or something in Aero would allow me to do that, but how do I crack into these sectors? Should I go back to school and do a programming degree and then try and get in that way? How do I transition out of oil and gas, as I have only been a PE (Project Engineer) most of my career so far.  

Is going back to school the best option? I am really confused.

5,Should I stick with my technician job or pursue a degree in engineeing?,1595381148,"First off I like my job. Its stable, relatively easy, decent pay(mid 20s an hour), low stress and get along with my boss and most of management.

I went to a technical high school and ""majored"" in Electrical engineering. I really liked the method of designing circuits but we only went up to starting to work with 555 timers and the such before I got a job through the school which basically replaced the shop class where i was learning electronics(basic idea was on the job training was superior to classroom training for entering the workforce). The issue was the job was basically network administration and computer repair(not really EE). That job paid like crap, had no benefits but I was young and living at home and it gave me beer money. 

I was there for 4 years but got let go(I was only real employee and owner lost contract that he based 95% of the company on). After that I started at my current company as an operator. Basically a warm body to do simple operations, literally first job here was rub a metal unit with scotch brite to remove scratches. 

A job opened up as a technician, I applied and through knowledge and recommendations got the job. After about 1 1/2 years became scared over job security(long story) and talked to a staff engineer(highest rank of engineer in company below management) who I had worked close with many times and he pulled some strings and created me a job working directly under him as basically his personal technician. 

Some of the stuff I do ranges from writing manufacturing procedures, designing/running/analyzing R&amp;Rs, writing/executing IMVs/TMVs, acquiring equipment to improve processes(from purchase to writing specifications to process characterization , IQs, OQs, PQs, 1 PPQ. This is all in addition to helping sustaining fix any problems that arise and maintaning certain equipment none of the other techs are willing to take over(complicated multi-component systems).

I've had several people recommend I go to college and get a degree and become a full engineer. I know my company does offer tuition assistance(although unless they changed policy since a few years ago its limited to 2 or 3 classes a semester). That said I also see how overworked/stressed several of the engineers at my company are and at least one engineer I know used to be an technician and regrets ever changing(salary VS hourly+overtime, additional responsibilities etc).

I'm moving to Oakland, CA in the next month or two to do a data science bootcamp with the flatiron school and will be looking primarily for opportunities working with self-driving cars, autonomous drones, robotics or the private space sector (blue origin, spacex etc). I'm wondering what I should be keeping in mind going into one of these fields and what would be the best move for my career. I've also been thinking of getting an MBA with a concentration in supply chain management once I'm a bit more settled financially.

**Here's a bit of background:**

I'm currently finishing my degree (just have to hand in the capstone project paper and finish an online stats course). I spent a good bit of time working as a machinist, got into restoring vintage trucks, cars and now racing motorcycles. Also did an internship for a mom-and-pop engineering firm designing carbon fiber parts for private and defense industries and started an SAE club at the college and did 80% of the work for designing an FSAE car from scratch, outfitted the shop and dealt with a bunch of the beurocracy at the school (put together the material for the grant proposal). My degree project involved building a drone from scratch (sourcing all the components and a custom frame that I designed and 3d-printed/routed out of carbon fiber), equipping it with a raspberry pi, camera and getting it to track a ball.

My work experience has been **heavily** mechanical and hands-on. I'm looking to pivot into working in tech/robotics and climb up the ladder, preferably at a startup. I would have loved to have had more tech related work on my resume. Even though I have a lot of experience with personal projects I know it doesn't carry as much weight. Do any of you have suggestions beyond doing the data science coding academy on how to position or sell myself for a more tech-oriented role? I've been considering taking an AWS certification exam but also want to work with physical systems and am worried that might push me more towards a role like dev-ops and away from something that could be more hands-on. I'm planning on starting my own shop in the next ten years and would much rather get a lot of exposure to the general business operations at a smaller firm than be insulated from the higher ups FWIW.

I know that's a wall of text but I'd appreciate any input as to whether an MBA with a concentration in SCM is worth it or if there's other alternatives I should consider.

Studying petro eng (Now junior year). Will be graduating in 2021 if everything goes according to the plan. However. I dont want to work in petro eng for the rest of my life as my interest is in aerospace eng now so I can work for NASA or Space X.

The issue is that. I don't know how to transition properly  (because of where I live and my college reputation) and this is where I would need your suggestions, advice etc.

First of all. I do know that I will have to obtain an american visa or even PR in the states to get a job in these companies. But any tips on achieving this in a better way. Ofc you can say just get a job in any company but it wont be that simple cause rejection on American Visa are very high. So any better way to accomplish this.

Secondly. I have taken some steps to position myself in this direction. These include starting a rocket club at my university. Planning on learning python, matlab next year. However. As for my rocket club. I'm still figuring out activities that could help me in achieving my goal so which kind of activities would you recommend? Know that I'm planning to start with water rockets so as to avoid trouble with legal stuff.

Lastly. Since I havent learnt the courses that are needed for aerospace eng. What courses those would be? Any online free academies, books, YouTube channels etc would help me a lot. If you can recommend a chronological order of how I should learn these courses. That would be very helpful as well.

TL;DR Need help in these following points.
1 - Best way to get a job in america so few years later I can get PR and work in NASA or space X.
2 - Good activities for a rocket club that can help me land a job in nasa or space x. I'm going to start with water rockets and then transition to sugar powered rockets. Solid rockets are banned in the country where I stay.

I have 6 years in the military doing tech work, which is I think I got the coop since the coop was mainly being a tech and collecting data. My GPA isn't the best I sit at around 2.5/4.0. I also used to hold a security clearance. 

I've had my resume reviewed, and it seems like my resume is well made according to Engineering managers at a resume review event at the coop. You sat with them for like 5 minutes and they would critique your resume, I fixed the things that they thought should be fixed and used to it to apply to more locations after the fact. 

I feel like with my experience and resume I shouldn't be struggling to get at least some phone interviews. Around 10 in the past 4 years seems really low compared to how much I find myself applying.

It's been a bit disheartening seeing every company reject me. Especially for fields I want to explore and learn. Also, it makes me worried about my future job prospects.

Do most/all Engineer's taking a spacecraft from conception to reality work with it, designing it, and the processes that will take place on it the entire time, from beginning till end?

I had, until recently, assumed that Engineer's like Mechanical and Materials Engineers would be involved the most from the beginning to end of building, let's say, a space probe.

Same for mechanical, I would assume. They'd need to be there from the beginning to work with the materials Engineer to make sure a lot of the basic mechanisms happen and don't stop working for whatever reason relating to the materials properties.

And I'd thought that Aeronautical Engineers would come in later, maybe only at the launch to calculate presses and such only **during the launch.** But as the materials, mechanics of them, etc are all taking shape, they have to be tested for Aerodynamic properties, right? Because otherwise you might have the perfect weight, strength, every mechanical function would go right,etc, but then the outside of the spacecraft would deform under the pressure of wind because your shape needed very precise tweaking. So wouldn't Aeronautical Engineer's with say, a specific specialization in Aerodynamic properties be there every step of the way as well? And doesn't this same case apply to Chemical Engineers dealing with the propulsion? (What specific weight, amount, velocity it must be ""shot"" at, how it will react with the materials, I could go on for awhile).

&amp;#x200B;

And to add onto that, doesn't the same thing apply to essentially **all** Engineer's working on taking a concept probe, rover, rocket, or satellite to reality? Wouldn't they essentially all be there from beginning to end?

31,Why use longer groove than key?,1595354776,"Hi fellas,

I am designing a speed reducing gear box for school, and to do so I have searched a couple of commercial ones to get ideas.

I have taken a lot of inspiration on this design by Gamma Gears:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3oVqXW2\_7c&amp;list=PLC-liUikq3xtCV0bCi\_d2YCC4QhJbYygW&amp;index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3oVqXW2_7c&amp;list=PLC-liUikq3xtCV0bCi_d2YCC4QhJbYygW&amp;index=2) 

However, I cannot understand what they did with their second shaft, the one that's got one key for both gears. I get why using the same key for both might be useful to save space or stress concentrators, but why have they made its groove so much larger than the key?? Even the bigger gear has its groove all the way to the other side, where the key doesn't even reach.

And how does it not slide in the groove leaving the pinion with no support? Wouldn't it be easier to just make the groove the size of the key, making sure it won't move and still performing as well?

33,New civil graduate who doesn't know where to go from here,1595352988,"Hey all,

I just graduated this past May and am starting to feel like I messed up. I had originally wanted to get a Masters in Structural after graduating with my bachelors in Civil. After my school moved to distance learning, I started to do worse because it just wasn't for me. I've done fine the last two years but distance learning killed me. If it wasn't for the extremely low grading on my capstone course (&gt;50 passed), I would have failed the course. It really discouraged me about going back to school, let alone back to school with distance learning. 

I want to pursue a job in structural but it looks like you pretty much have to have a Masters to get an entry level job. 

Currently I am studying for my FE with the hope that it will give me an edge to get into a job when things start to go back to normal in the US and engineering jobs start hiring again.

Does anyone have any advice on where to go from here? I deferred the grad school admission to Fall 2021 so i still have that option open next year. Should I take (and hopefully pass) my FE and get any civil related job or should I just look for structural only?

Just started studying algorithms in hopes for BigN, but I don't know if I have the patience to stay for that. Advice?",1595339206,"I work at one of the top 5 defense contractors as a software engineer. I've been here for almost 2 years. I have 4 years of professional experience. My first job (prior to this) was also at another competitor. I would say the first 3 years of working were great and I've learned a lot. Last year I transferred to the current team and it was ok for the most part until 8 months ago. There has been pretty much zero direction, and we have fallen several months behind. I'd ask for help from several different people and would get led in several different directions. 

The past month, upper management has been micromanaging because we've fallen behind. I've asked my functional manager about switching teams and he has told me at this point, I've become too integral to the team that they aren't going to let me leave (I need team approval to leave). He has told me if this team I'm currently on goes under, he can place me in another team, but right now, the team has requested that I don't leave. 

The work itself is so brain dead and tedious and really has no technical challenge. The challenge is that everything is so obscure I have to pull different people from different teams and hope that they have enough to show me how to do things.

Last week, another manager told me that my sprint tasks aren't getting done on time. So I told him that I have to split time with person A in the lab and half of what I'm working on is reliant on his work and I'm doing my best to finish it. I'm also helping person A so we can finish it all faster together. Told me I should consider working a 3rd shift to get more lab time for myself and I say I'm not going to do that. Then says I don't have any skin in the game. This kind of pissed me off so I told him when this company decides to hand out generous bonuses and RSUs, then maybe I will have some skin in the game. Told me I'm on thin line and then I guess he talked to my functional manager about my behavior. My functional manager told me that there are other teams looking for engineers, but the current team won't let me go. Reassures me again that if this project fails, I'll always have a job since my skillset is far more diverse than most the engineers here. 

It actually feels like the pressure is due to how dumb everything is run here. None of this stuff that I'm working is challenging, yet somehow it is. The challenge feels like it's artificially made. I stopped trying at this job and am now starting to look for another job as of yesterday. I've been studying up algorithms in hopes that I'll get into a BigN, but I don't know if I can last another 6 months here. I had intended to study for 6 months, but with what happened last week, I don't know if I can last. 

Another software engineer on the team literally gave a 3 day notice to quit last week for a new job as well and morale is low. I knew he was sick of the work as well and saw it coming. After he left, the other engineers on the team have asked me to please not quit.

65,Highly reflective UV paint or chemical I can apply to a surface for video feed recognition reason?,1595302745,"**TL;DR**
I need help finding UV reflective paint or pigment. 

It's a very specific problem that needs solving. So if you want to read in depth into my project and why on earth I need this, it's a bit lengthy.

____________________________________________________
I think I've hit the knowledge limitations on a project I am working on. So I'm hoping someone with some expertise or random knowledge could fill me in on this or point me in the right direction. 

Let's say I'm building a robotic billiards pool game. It's completely controlled remotely from an app. This has an overhead camera so you can see where you're shooting. I've finished 80% of the project. This includes lining up with the pool cue, choosing the power and hitting the balls. Scoring, etc. Since this is controlled remotely, I've also engineered a tipping mechanism once the game has ended to clear all the balls into the holes and even automatically racking the balls up again to start a new game. It all works flawless.

Here's the bit of a snag I've ran into. My video recognition for ball sorting can be touchy. It gets the job done most of the time. But anyone who's worked in video recognition involving color sorting knows that the color white is notoriously hard to work with. Shiny things reflect light in such a way even a shiny black surface can come up as white. I've had too shiny of wood grain finish come up as white. So I have to reduce false positives that either result in unwanted ball dumps or doesn't clear the balls when it's supposed too. Changing the color of the cue ball is not an option. All other balls will also be kept with there default color. 

This is where I think I've come up with an ingenious solution. Using a light spectrum that is invisible to the human eye. UV light. And reflecting that off of only the cue ball. Using some sort of pigment or paint covering the ball. Buy a somewhat affordable UV camera. Run my video recognition software based on the UV camera feed instead. I would then mount an overhead UV lamp. Cancelling out all other colors and household light reflections, this should reduce false positives almost entirely.

This is what I theorize it would appear like under the UV camera feed.

https://imgur.com/a/cqDAImb

67,Job Hunt Advice Needed (Computer Science Major),1595300893,"Hey guys! 

I’m majoring in CS and need a real-talk from the older crowd.

My degree will be a BS in Applied Math: Computer Science at a small liberal arts college. It’s a decent program but they don’t cover things like networks, operations systems, etc. primarily algorithms analysis, data structures, and tons of math. 

I’m a senior this year and am wondering what I can do to better position myself for getting a job. I’ve met with our career center to set up a good resume, but I have yet to land an internship. 

I’ve done a few hackathons, should I do more hackathons to make up for not having a CS internship? Would that even matter to them.

I have an okay GPA, about 3.4 right now. Major GPA is about the same. 

I feel like my only hope is to do big personal projects to stand out, but do those even make a huge difference on my resume? Like, will I actually stand out that much more for building an app or something?

I live in the Bay Area but am open to moving if I landed a job elsewhere.

69,Would this method for laser cutting bevel gears work?,1595299590,"Hello! 

I’ve been wanting to build mitred gears for a personal project, but for a long time they’ve seemed like a tough nut to crack without specialist machinery and skills. 
I think I might have found a way around this issue, using a laser cutter and a table router - both tools that are common at makerspaces. However, my local makerspace’s wood shop is $40 per day to use, so I’d really appreciate your input on whether this solution would work before I do it. 

To begin, I would laser cut out your gears from a relatively thick, routable material. I would also cut a circle that matched the total diameter of my gear, and then fix these two pieces together. 
On the router table  I’d select a 45 degree bit with a bead on top. I’d run the bead along the full circle fixed to the top of the gear, and use the 45 degree bit to cut the bevel into the teeth of the gear itself. 

Would this process result in usable mitre gears?

I'm hoping to  test the range of the saturation by broadcasting a signal from 300w to  3,500w in short distance increments to find out how far the saturation will travel  versus the power output.  I plan on testing the reaction of the saturated field to a compound at different distances and see where the power rating has the most influence.

88,Controlled air release from CO2 cartridges,1595281237,"Hey all.

I'm currently trying to regulate air release from a 12g/16g CO2 cartridge, like the ones used for bike tires or airsoft pistols. My goal is to have a puff of gas shoot out of the tip of whatever valve I end up using, and have it be automated/controlled by a button or trigger. Ideally, based off a 12g cartridge having about 850psi, I'd be trying to release \~140psi with each trigger. These cartridges are meant to be replaceable on the build and the threaded kind, since they'd likely need an adapter.

My project is essentially a custom airsoft pistol, but rather than have the shape be angled, my goal is to have a linear shape, where the gas goes forward out of the cartridge and straight to firing the pellet out. I'd also like to keep it as compact as possible.

My current searches have led me towards solenoid valves that start closed, then use an electric signal to open, but I'm not sure if this would be near instantaneous enough for an airsoft pistol. I'm going for semi-automatic, though, hence why I need to be able to fire off gas then quickly seal it with just a push of a button or pull of a trigger.

From my searching around the internet the stories are pretty rampant about engineers who are inexperienced mechanically, have no mechanical aptitude, high GPA with nothing else, etc. etc. etc. It seems much centers on mechanical rather than other differences, that there are tons of only “in the books,” so to speak. But I’ve heard of other roles where junior engineers seem to lack actual experiential learning, so I’m curious if there are any other disciplines where it’s similar.

Mechanical’s always touted as the most general engineering discipline, so I think a lot of students who are just good at math and physics choose it without thinking much, leading to this issue. In general many students who are just “good” at math and science in high school seem to just go for engineering without possibly having the necessary workplace skills.

Do you think that this should be fixed, and students should be more hesitant in selecting mechanical engineering, or even engineering in general? Should studying these disciplines come packaged with a disclaimer that you should consider having played around a bit with tools?

So as my title says, recently I’ve been feeling like I need to make a change in my career, only I’m not sure which direction to go. I have always done well in school and I thought engineering was the perfect role for me: problem solving, visual spatial, physics and mathematical skills were always my strong suit.

Right out of university I started working at this company and it generally hit all of the marks for what I wanted out of an ideal job. It has a lot of open ended problem solving, I get to do some interesting and varied work including designing, calculations, simulation, testing and some hands on prototype building. I even have a patent on the works for which I’m the primary inventor. These are all things I thought I would love when I was in school. But after 1.5 years I’m already feeling... burnt out.. or bored maybe? Not really sure how to classify the feeling but I am just not finding the day to day work interesting anymore. 

Part of me thinks that it might be that I am not specialized enough and it’s making me think I may want to go back and do my Masters. I feel like I may hit a ceiling in my career that I cannot pass unless I get some specialized training. I enjoy R&amp;D but, in my current role, I am mostly a generalist, not an expert in any particular area. This makes me feel like I am selling myself short. But part of me also thinks I may be being undervalued in the role I have. I have generally been told I have been doing a great job for my work but the pay is not quite what I would like it to be. If i were payed more for the same work I may not be feeling this way. 

On the other end of the spectrum, I have also played around with the idea that I may be in the wrong career path. Maybe I am feeling this way because engineering is not as much for me as I thought it was. I have been passively looking at other career paths like finance, data science, etc and the idea of getting into another career (especially one with higher pay for my effort) is starting to sound more interesting to me..

Instead of 4 cycles  there are 2 cycles (doubling power). The gas pushes piston up and which drives the engine. And exhaust is fed back to the turbo.

I graduated from a top 5 engineering undergrad program with honors and have good extracurricular activities as well as a solid work ethic. I still don't think I've fully figured out how to grab hiring recruiters attention and at this point it's getting frustrating. I barely know how I got my current role.

I have a degree in BME, but with a heavy focus on EE applications/analog circuit design. I have been able to leverage my skills to gain an EE industry position where I am happy.

I love learning as much as possible outside of work, and I’m sure my career will eventually advance to the point where a master’s in EE would be desired (as well as having a formal EE degree in general). As a result I am looking to complete a master’s in EE on the side/outside of work.

57,Would diamond be an effective material for ballistic armor?,1595204248,"I’ve been researching ballistic armor a little bit recently, and I haven’t seen much discussion online about this question.


Some background:  
Diamond is incredibly hard, harder than any other natural material, and as far as I can tell this property would be very beneficial for an armor plate, because the harder material will shatter softer bullets. If we used diamond as a material for armor plates, it would jump us straight to the top in terms of armor hardness.


One counterpoint that I’ve seen brought up often in online discussions is that diamond isn’t suitable because it’s toughness is relatively low, making it prone to fracturing on impact. This seems to me to be a misunderstanding of how modern armor works, because ceramic armor materials also share this property and they’re generally considered to be a better material for armor than steel because of their high hardness, among other factors.


In my attempt to research this question, I came across the website www.diamondage.org for a company which is working on diamond armor plates. They seem to be the only ones publicly doing so. According to them, their bulk diamond plates are significantly harder and tougher than boron carbide, one of the best materials used in armor today. They don’t have any diamond armor currently available so I don’t think this is conclusive evidence for diamond being better, but it certainly raises the possibility.


I am not an expert and I cannot evaluate this information properly, so I would really like to hear some thoughts on the merits of diamond as an armor material. Would diamond work well for body armor? Would it also make sense in tank armor as part of some composite system?",AskEngineers,False,0045,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hubalm/would_diamond_be_an_effective_material_for/

We both met in the military, he is a brilliant aircraft hydraulics mechanic and is extremely knowledgeable in all things that move (mechanically speaking.) However, he quit high school and obtained his GED because he was bored with school and hated all things learning, aside from building and fixing things. Which is why he joined the AF. Here he has a steady job that he excels in. However, all good things usually come to an end. He will rank up and leave the comfy flightline and fixing of hydraulic systems. I have tried and tried to encourage him to go to college. He has the brain of an engineer and can talk physics and theory all day long. Really, he is super smart. But he shuts down at the thought of school because he is afraid of failure, boredom in irrelevant topics (to him, like basic core classes. Specifically English.) I am currently enrolled in school for aviation and have tried to convince him to go along with me and I could help him in the studies he struggles with, but no dice. He is completely turned off to the idea of going to school. He would like to be an engineer, but not willing to do the work.

I guess what I am asking is what are some options you think he could fit into? Any engineering programs that don't require basic classes? Or should I let it go? I would just hate to see him not fully utilize his talent.

The rotational program is low-paying compared to an actual engineering role, but I feel like it has provided me with many great opportunities (travel, connections, freedom to learn  and experience whatever I want). The company is growing quickly and we are opening new locations every year, but the experience I currently have makes it difficult to land a role that is technical in nature because they are all leadership positions (supervisor and manager level).

I have twice turned down offers to be a production supervisor because I feel that sends me further down the road that goes away from engineering and other technical roles. My program is coming to an end, and I am essentially being forced into a production supervisor role anyway (have been filling the role under my rotational program's title for 2 months, currently entertaining an official offer). The only benefit I see in the role is that it gives me experience managing direct reports.  I love my company and the plant where I work, but I have been extremely unhappy during the time I have been filling the position (night shift, poor nighttime leadership, way too much responsibility for the level of salary), so I feel like leaving the company to try to start again somewhere else in an actual engineering or technical role. 

I am hesitant because I have expressed these concerns to my team, and the overwhelming response is that I should tough it out for a while and then I'll be better prepared to land a job in a technical leadership role somewhere in the company.

66,Job Advice - Post Lay-Off - Ghosted Endlessly!,1595195933,"TL;DR Got laid off months ago and can't find a new job in LA. Looking for advice.

Looking for some input and advice on finding my next job.

I am an aerospace engineer 3 years out of college who moved halfway across the country to LA for my first job (mechanical eng. position). I was layed off (due to 737 MAX shutdown impact on company) back in Q1, and COVID spiked immediately after. Company has had to do more layoffs due to that as well.

I have been actively applying for 4+ months, applied to probably 80+ jobs. 90% I never see a response. I have done phone screenings and first &amp; second stage interviews with a few companies and I have either been told they can't actually hire anyone, or been completely ghosted. I am on 4 companies in a row now that I have done 2+ rounds of interviews and been ghosted after being told i'll hear something in a few days. It's been months since some of these. No responses to emails, voicemails (I haven't even received a no!), they just drop off the face of the Earth. I am really frustrated, and I can't seem to understand why you would interview someone for 2-3 rounds and then blow them off and ignore all correspondence. I feel like I have a strong resume, good GPA (3.8+), and can communicate well during the interviews. I have been actively reaching out to recruiters for companies I am applying to on LinkedIn and that is how I have gotten many of the interviews.

I'm looking for advice on what to do next. The extra fed unemployment stops at the end of the month, so I feel pressed on time now. Being out of work for 5 months has been tough on a personal level as well, I am the type of person who would do 50+ hour weeks so this is a big shift feeling very unproductive. Relocation out of LA/OC area is not really an option due to S/O, etc.

I wanted to do minimum Master's in in mech eng. I wanted to use my free-time, if I ever get any lol, to learn other skills like data science, programming, or interesting courses in EE or physics.

But I have changed my mind, I don't want to cut out my passion and other academic interests - but I do understand that during my time in university, I might not get time to follow these side interests, and I'm fine with that. Now I only want a bachelor of engineering which is 3,5 years (in Denmark you can either do 3 years, a regular bachelor, or 3,5 years, the extra semester being an obligated internship).

And in my free-time I do not longer wish to learn other skills related to engineering. But that makes me feel guilty, and that an engineering degree is not worth it, if I'm having one foot in something, and another in something else. For information, my academic interests in the humanities mentioned above are greater than my interests in mech eng. So why not study that? Because the pay and job opportunities are not even close to engineering, and no, I'm not only doing mech eng for the money, then I would just have picked something else. And with an engineering pay, I can also fund my own publishing to stay independent from publishing agencies (if it ever comes to that), and also fund my own little researches regarding the humanities. And hopefully engineering can give me a new perspective regarding the researches, e.g. it was in math that I learnt about that correlation doesn't necessarily mean causality, and that is very helpful imo when doing researches.

And instead of using my summer on engineering related courses, I want to take classes in communications or other English major classes. I have heard that it's a good skill to have as an engineer, and that my pay can be better and can get me further in my career as an engineer.

However, my goals for mech eng have not changed. I still wish to work in R&amp;D at some point, work as an F1 engineer, and maybe even become an F1 race strategist or race engineer one day. I'm also still interested in working for space agencies at some point (I know that they are different industries, I have not really settled with whether I want to work in the autom. industry or aerospace industry).

Is it even worth studying engineering if I'm only doing a bachelor of engineering in 3,5 years, and not wanting to spend my free-time on more engineering skills, but on my passion and other academic interests (I still plan to put my mech eng courses first during my 3,5 years of bachelor)?

* Get a a BS in Physics, Minor in Engineering, and at least a Master's worth of education in Engineering.
* Would build an Engineering related project, solo, to demonstrate skills to demonstrate competence for a resume.
* Would learn about the basics of Engineering, the real differences, and how to think when solving an Engineering problem so you're not clueless as to what you're doing.
* In college take as many labs as possible in physics and do as many experiments as possible to get familiar with having to be hands on and not just be doing theory.
* Get a PhD in Physics that is heavily related and more on the practical side of exactly what you want to work in within Engineering. So instead of specializing in QM, specialize in laser or semiconductors which could be more practical.
* And generally trying to shift your Physics education in the practical direction when you can, along with trying to shift it over to studying the specific thing you'll be doing (heat transfer, materials engineering, etc)

Hey guys! I'm a mechanical engineer that has been in industry for 6 years now and.... I hate it. (Have worked in aerospace and automotive)

I've always enjoyed math and science and I LOVE solving problems which is why I went to school for mechanical engineering, but I just get really bored once the problem is solved and I have to spend the next weeks/months fighting everyone and their mom to implement a solution. I've found I've been doing a lot more arguing than I wanted and I don't get any satisfaction out of the engineering jobs I've had. 

I have this problem where I tend to butt heads repeatedly over ethical/quality concerns and I refuse to lie to customers/clients about technical information and I get very VERY bored doing the technical stuff for more than a couple hours (ADHD ftw). I've recently been put in the position of project management roles and my current company wants to me to get my PMP but those roles are frustrating, too, because I basically have to be available ALL the time and as someone who is fairly anxious and a perfectionist, I'm good at the job, but it's awful for my mental health lol...

Even when I was in school, I wanted to switch by mid-junior year to something I enjoyed more but I had no idea what to do... It's not like I'm bad at the jobs I've had I just REALLY don't get any satisfaction whatsoever out of them and tend to come home tired, frustrated, or late...

I've dreaded going to work for 6 years and am one ""can you get this proposal done by tomorrow morning"" away from rage quitting.

I'm asking here because I feel in a lot of ways an engineer is a ""type of person"" instead of a profession and I was hoping you guys might have some insight as to potential options for those of us who don't quite fit a typical engineering role... (Doesn't even have to be in the field, I've considered teaching, even!) I'm not particularly ambitious, either, I just want to make a difference somewhere...

Just... If you know someone like me or you are someone like me... I'd love some advice :)

90,"If I want to work more directly on the development, materials, and structure of a spacecraft, then is Mechanical Engineering or Materials Engineering just as good an option as Aerospace Engineering?",1595174702,"It's often said (obviously) that if you know for sure you want to work in Aerospace Engineering then it's a good option, otherwise don't if you have any uncertainty. But I know I want to work on spacecrafts, but I don't want to work in the things an Aerospace Engineering degree would focus on specifically. 

If an Aerospace Engineering degree specializes you in calculating orbits, or aerodynamics, etc. But I want to work on the finding and implementing the right materials taking into account the spacecraft's structure, isn't either a MechE and MS in Materials engineering just as good or better?

Or if I want to work on the heat transfer from material to material within a spacecraft, then isn't a MechE degree with a MS in thermodynamics just as good or better?

I'm not saying an Aerospace Engineer wouldn't learn these things, but wouldn't a mechanical Engineer learn them as well and further specialization would increase your skills beyond that of what either alone would have?

On one of my projects, I was recently cutting up a failed cast so it would fit in the crucible to be re-melted. I was cutting it up with an angle grinder, and I noticed something very strange. Every so often, it would throw a spark. It did not look like there was any steel object stuck inside the casting either and it sparked in a few different spots. 

This is odd to me because aluminum shouldn't spark when it's hit with a grinder.

5,New Job and I Feel Depressed,1595148496,"First, a bit of background: I graduated from university this past May, and got hired as a process engineer at a manufacturing plant. I have no background in manufacturing or MechE and it's my first job at a plant.

And now for my dilemma: It's been a month since I've started, and I'm getting increasingly overwhelmed as time passes and I realize I still don't know or understand what I'm doing. There's another process engineer who started 6 months ago, and he seems to have an AMAZING grasp of the job (granted, he worked for a year at a different manufacturing company before taking up this role at this company). He will be moving on to a different role in September, and then I'll be assuming his responsibilities completely. As such, I'm pretty much watching how he works till we make that transition in Sept. There is no training structure, and on my first day, I was told to pretty much ""learn everything I can"" and was kinda just thrown out there. The technical aspect of the job is crazy overwhelming and just attempting to learn the interrelationships between the machines and the different processes that run makes my head spin (not having a MechE degree has hurt me here). Since it's been a month, I'm being asked to talk in meetings and send out emails about technical issues that I don't even understand because there's SO MUCH. I HATE doing this because I'm uncomfortable with speaking/writing on topics that I don't completely understand. So when people ask me follow up questions on the issues (regarding defects on machines, errors in process orders, etc) I've mentioned, I never know what to say. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel really hopeless and as if I'll never be able to grasp what's going on and be competent enough to take over the job in September. What makes this even harder is that I'm constantly comparing myself to the other process engineer (not comparing when you're supposed to essentially be him in 2 months is easier said than done) and feel like I'll never reach his level of capability (which he managed to attain in only 6 months). He's always being praised for his amazing work, so I'll have massive shoes to fill when he moves on in a couple of months. I feel like I'm in over my head.

39,Using digital isolator as small buck/boost converter?,1595096127,"I'm designing a board to amplify signals coming off of a pair of Wheatstone bridge amplifiers via a pair of INA333 amplifiers. The board will be connected to a NI USB-6009 ADC for conversion and interfacing with software. A different part of the board will operate a coupe of solenoid valves via a pair of MOSFETs, using an independent external 24 V power supply (they will operate at low frequencies, at most 15 Hz).

My issue is the USB power supply. The sensors and amplifiers will be using 5V single-supply to do their job, and they require very very little current. But USB voltage isn't particularly accurate.

I've been trying to find something like a switching regulator or a buck/boost converter that takes input V around 4~5.5V, and generates and output of stable 5V. I found a really nice one from Texas Instruments ([TPS630701](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps63070.pdf?ts=1595095702900&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FTPS63070)) which looks perfect for my requirements but the footprint is too tiny for a human to solder.

Either I'm looking in the wrong places or it seems that such a converter in a surface-mount footprint that's not too small for human hand soldering is really hard to find.

I found this other device, the [ADuM5010](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADuM5010.pdf). It's classified as an integrated DC-to-DC converter, and a digital isolator.

That last bit tripped me up a bit since I'm not familiar with such components. I read up on what digital isolators are and began to understand why the datasheet uses pin labels such as Viso and GNDiso.

Here's my question: would this work fine if I use the same ground for both sides? I don't actually plan to create an isolated area on my board. Can I use this device merely as a converter to get nice stable 5V out of it, and ignore the ""isolation"" features?

Or does such a device **have** to be used for isolation only?

whether voluntary or involuntary, Employee shall not be employed by, act as a consultant to or otherwise 
perform services for, or assist in the development of, any business which directly or indirectly competes with the Company worldwide (the “Restricted Business”); provided, however, that this covenant not tocompete shall not preclude Employee from (i) owning, as a passive investor, up to one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares in a publicly traded company for the shares of which an active public trading market exists, or (ii) engaging in such research as may be required as part of Employee’s employment with an academic institution, the purpose of which is not designed to circumvent this Section 1.1.

- 1.2: Works Made for Hire. Employee hereby assigns to Company or to any party designated by Company the entire right, interest and title to all Developments made, conceived or first reduced to practice solely or jointly by Employee, whether or not such Developments are patentable, copyrightable or developed during normal working hours, which: (i) were made, conceived or first reduced to practice in the course of performance of Employee's involvement with the Company, or with the use of Company's time, materials, funds or facilities; or (ii) are related to information, technology or investigations of Company to which Employee has access as part of work or involvement with the Company.

- 1.3 Severability. The covenants in this Section 1 are severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of any other covenant. If any provision of this Section 1 relating to the scope of the Restricted Business, the time period or geographic area of the restrictive covenants shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum scope, time period or geographic area, as applicable, that such court deems reasonable and enforceable, said scope, time period or geographic area shall be deemed to be, and thereafter shall become, the maximum scope, time period or largest geographic area that such court deems reasonable and enforceable and this Agreement shall automatically be considered to have been amended and revised to reflect such determination.

This model will be a very simple approximation of the radiator. I have a 1mx1m aluminum plate with a small thickness, \~0.003m. I know I have a heat flux going into one of the 1mx0.003m faces, and that the temperature of the plate will be highest at that spot and then decrease throughout the plate. I also know that there will be heat released through radiation from the plate as this is happening, and that the plate also receives radiation from the sun. There is no convection as it is in space. I want to find the temperature distribution on the top surface of the plate and I am a bit stumped on modeling this. 

The info that I have is the heat flux going into the side, the thermal conductivity, emissivity, etc. of aluminum, the temperature of space, and I know that the intensity of the solar radiation on it will be about 1370W/m2.

I'm struggling with where to start. I know I have the heat flux going in at one side and that there will be conduction through the plate, but I don't have an initial temperature at the point where the heat flux is.

54,[UK] Incorporated status application - IMechE or IET?,1595080175,"So I decided a year or so ago to apply for incorporated engineer status.

Reasons:

* To rubber stamp my credentials - I have a couple of interviews in the past where someone has questioned, rather loaded, whether I have the requisite experience / knowledge for the job - especially when it comes to mechanics.\* (the acoustics part of my degree seems to throw them off somewhat - see below ""about me"")
* Gain more certified experience and knowledge through the CPD programs

My original plan was to apply to the IMechE as they have more provenance and a wider reputation than the IET.  However, if I wanted to apply for chartership later I would need a masters degree which I don't plan on doing anytime soon, but not a requirement for the IET.  I also hear that the IMechE is getting a little behind the times and the CPD offered by the IET is better, and that the IET board is a little friendlier and it could be easier to get.

So my questions are:

* **Does the IMechE incorporation hold more weight than an IET incorporation?**
* **Can you ""defect"" to another institute later down the line?** (IMechE to IET?)
* **Do the CPD programs vary much between the two?**  (Looking at their website I think I personally prefer the IMechE's)
* **Is the IMechE incorporation harder to get?** 
* **Is it a good idea to become an associate member before applying for incorporated status?**
* **Please let me know any other experience / advice you may have to offer that would be useful**

About me:

My degree was a BSc in Design Technology with Acoustics, accredited by the IET and is recognised by the UK engineering council.  I graduated in 2009 with a Honours Sandwich award (1st + placement year), and have spent the last 11 years mostly working as a Design Engineer in various forms of manufacturing for the entertainment industry (events, film, exhibitions etc), except since lock-down where I have been working for a structural engineering firm as a Project Engineer.

My application is almost ready to go and, without trying to sound arrogant, I don't think it will be too difficult to get the incorporated status.

* Do propellers in general work better when put in series like a turbine? Or is this only done for compression for adding fuel? i.e. no benefit without the fuel injection

89,Best Angles for home squat rack,1595016278,"So I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this, but I'm looking at building an A-Frame style squat rack for my house, but I'm curious what type of measurements and angles will be strong enough to support the weight of a loaded barbell. My current designs borrow very heavily from this rack 
https://www.reddit.com/r/homegym/comments/g90v6z/my_homemade_squat_rack_attempt/

Now I can't tell exactly what measurements or angles the individual from the post above used, but I have created two rough blueprints here https://imgur.com/gallery/Zi8ErCM   

Note that I intend to use 2x4's exclusively for this project. The top design is based off a 90x20x70 degree triangle and the bottom is a 90x25x65 degree triangle. I don't currently have a design for 90x30x60 because that would cause the bottom to reach out quite aways and I'm trying to make it relatively compact.

Sorry they aren't the clearest and they certainly aren't drawn to scale. Essentially my design is two of the templates shown connected by two 2x4s roughly at the base roughly 4 ft apart. The slight variations of mine would be that where the first 2x4 ends would be where I would rest the barbell for bench, and the second would be for squat, so these are where the weight would be applied on the rack. Another variation is that I intend to place one, if not two main support boards within the A-frame. If two, these boards would roughly align with where the barbell would rest (seen in the top design with the 5ft and 3.75ft boards are.) If one, it would be positioned roughly in the middle (seen in the bottom design where the 4ft board is). I don't know if this makes any difference but I doubt I will be placing more than 250lbs on the rack at any given time.

So now to the main questions. What angles would be best for this type of project? Would a steeper 90x70x20 work? Or should it be more spread in the 90x25x65? Will it make a considerable difference how many, if any at all, inner support beams I use? Another major point I'm looking at is trying to efficiently use my 2x4s. All the 2x4s I want to purchase come in 8 ft lengths (there are other lengths available but for the purpose of this post I'm using 8 ft.)
