I am an undergrad 2nd year BEng Aeronautical Engineering student.

Basically I have 2 options for me at the moment and I am not sure which to take so I'm looking for opinions.

Option 1: Continue on the current BEng course I am on and finish university next year and go to find a job.

Option 2: Move onto the MEng course where I will get the opportunity to get a year-long industrial placement next year. However, I will have to complete the masters because if I drop out after I complete my 3rd year, I will not receive a BEng degree, I will receive nothing. 

Therefore my questions are:

1. How much better is having a masters degree over a bachelors degree in engineering, more specifically in aeronautical engineering?
2. How highly do employers credit students who apply for graduate jobs with an industrial placement?

This is a new position that they didn't have before and I am the only one doing this right now.

My boss wants me to push current open production runs through and to hold meetings if necessary for new models. There are two problems with this:

1) I don't know or understand who is responsible for owning each part of the manufacturing process to even push on them to get it done. Much less the fact that I've only been there three months and it feels like I'm telling them what to do. I tried expressing this to my boss and he says he doesn't understand and that it's straightforward. And then he threatened to fire me if I didn't get my act together

2) My boss wants me to hold meetings ""if necessary"" or ""if I have any questions,"" but I don't even know what questions I would have since I barely know the products we make. I tried to have a meeting a few weeks ago with the same people who would normally attend such a meeting.

33,Calculate time or power to pressurize a small steam boiler?,1588478316,"I was musing on some modifications to an old espresso milk steamer when I wanted to calculate something I couldn't figure out.  Googling led down too many wrong key words.

Say the total boiler volume is 1.5 liters.  Start with .5 liter liquid water.  Heating element is 600 watts.  How long will it take to reach 1 bar of pressure?  The boiler remains sealed, and for now we can ignore the energy to heat the boiler itself, as well as the energy lost through the boiler walls, I can account for that.  The volumes are a good starting point but are arbitrary, I want to know how to calculate this for any ratio of water and steam. 

I can easily calculate time to boil from ambient just based on specific heat and heat lost via boiler walls (5.5 minutes).  But then it boils and I get stuck.  I started to just calculate based on temperature at my desired 1 bar, but the specific heat of steam is different than water, and the mass of steam is increasing while the mass of water decreases.  Then I tried to do something with latent heat of vaporization to calculate how much steam the element is producing, but... I guess I need to know the density of steam at 1 bar?  But I have niggling suspicion that latent heat of vaporization changes with the pressure increase.

Finally it occurred to me that the boiler doesn't even start full of steam, it starts full of air and that is yet another specific heat to juggle. Can we account for that?  Or we can treat the calculations like pure steam because practically I'm probably going to vent the initial air/steam mixture before bringing to pressure, and it's (probably) the time from boiling and purged to 1 bar I really want to know, at least right now.

It was at this point I realized an engineer would probably know how to calculate this.

However,  ""the total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture."" 

So, the vapor pressure is just the pressure of the vapor...not any of the other gases in air, if I am understanding that correctly. So, how is the vapor pressure of water at atmospheric pressure 1 ATM if it is a partial pressure? Shouldn't it be more like .8 ATM to account for all the other gases?

Posting from a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

I am a staff engineer at a small engineering firm (2 principles, ~10 staff). We offer engineering consulting services in a few very specialized areas related to systems, electronics, and software engineering.

I am their most senior staff member (aside from owners and an admin/book keeper). My base salary is reasonably competitive for the location. Aside from some extended health benefits, salary is my only current compensation. 

I was recently offered equity in the company. Less than 5% share accumulated over 2 years. I would have to purchase this for a agreed upon price per share (which I am told is very low). This means I get profit sharing and access to a bonus pool. 

This discussed before COVID took off, it’s been on hold since, but expect to restart discussion later this year where we left off. 

I haven’t seen a shareholder contract yet. When It does materialize, what should I be looking for in that contract? 

A few things on my mind:

-	Is this really worth it? I think yes, but I’m curious to hear other’s experiences. 
-	Do I have a right to request the firm’s financial statements prior to purchasing share?
-	Does this expose me to any serious financial risk?

Depending on the type of rock at the site you'd need blasting (if its too hard rock) or heavy supports (if its soft rock) The 1/3 gravity would also change how much the overburden weighs and mean that supports would be less necessary as well. he said the best place for tunneling would be be somewhere with a lot of rhyolite near a reverse fault. in which case blasting would be our best bet, and given the hardness of the rock and the 1/3 gravity there would be no need for supports. But sampling would need to be done a lot especially if the tunnels extended over kilometers, as that is the range we would expect to hit different pockets of rock

**Vibration concerns**

Guys, it occurred to me, in #p1-regolith-housing there is talks of using reinforced ice shells for the outer shell of the housing. I'm just pondering, will any TBM activity produce too much vibration for such structures? I imagine ice is good for compression, not so good for shearing and torsion... I suppose explosives are ""no go"" within a certain radius of the domes.True. Explosions should not be used near areas which have structures on the surface. A normal TBM however shouldnt be problematic. Question is: Can you use one of these tunnel boring machines on Mars? First research seems to show it is possible, as is shown in the Mars Paper I quote here.

**TBM on Mars**

TBMs managed to drill trough the ""Chunnel"" and also through Gotthard tunnel. I assume Mars will not prevent TBMs from operating. I just believe it will require a special kind of TBM build with minimal machinery since resources on Mars are at Premium. Also, there has been a TBM which can work with variable density in underground structures, which can be seen here: [https://youtu.be/zRmczNZMxo8?t=73](https://youtu.be/zRmczNZMxo8?t=73) \- The world's first Variable Density Tunnel Boring Machine

Though the use of liquids in this design might be problematic actually.. But anyway, it IS possible to tunnel, but there are many unknowns.

For example:

\- material density and cavities (rock or sand?)

\- energy required to keep the TBM going

\- liquids required to keep the TBM going

\- wall elements to line a tunnel with during construction

\- large size and mass of the machine itself to be shipped from earth

**Radiation Protection**

So it seems that this construction method is not going to be used for the first 100 people on Mars, but is maybe a great solution later on, when you want to create higher density cities on Mars with enough radiation protection. The nice thing seems to be that in theory, you could make these machines run autonomously.. So you slowly build more habitable spaces underground.

**Why tunnel?**

Keep in mind that mining operations will need tunnels and tunneling in space will happen sooner or later. Depending on how many rare earth deposits we find out there under the Mars surface. Maybe not integral part of the colony, but it will happen. Also tunnels are free of meteorites impacts and radiation exposure, temperature swings and so on. They can easily maintain atmospheric pressure in case of major disaster. Some neutrino guys might want to compare notes with Fermilab DUNE experiment from Earth. Also a gravitational wave interferometer would need some safe housing as well. And worst of all, the doomsday vault sure needs tunnels.

**Why not tunnel?**

1 - tunnelling is slow. Even if you tunnel fast, you would be able to build a lot faster on the surface.

2 - Tunnelling is mostly a 1 dimensional exercise. You can only tunnel from one point, whereas you can build from all around your building, making it a lot easier to move material around. You can even use cranes to place heavy objects, you are limited by this in tunnels

3 - Building need to be serviced from multiple direction, air ducts, hot/cold water supplies, and additions and alteration.

4 - You want a habitat with multiple points of exit in the event of emergencies. Meaning that a safe habitat will be hyper connected with other habitats. Tunnelling makes this harder (not impossible)

**Futher Notes**

1. Domes are not pressure vessels. I know you really like domes, but they make absolutely no sense. Sure, if you have a strong enough material you can make a dome, but instead of making a dome you could use the same exact material and make a sphere 5 times bigger. There is no justification to making a dome pressure vessel. It is choosing a more challenging, more expensive construction technique to build something with LESS usable space.
2. We don't know much at all about the heat underground on Mars. That is what NASA's mole was supposed to measure, but it got stuck in the process of trying to dig underground. The statement about it being warm 1 meter underground on Earth is wrong. The temperature a couple meters underground on Earth is equal to the average temperature above ground year-round. So if you are in the far north and go one meter underground, the ground is frozen (permafrost). The same will be true on Mars. If you go some relatively small distance underground, the temperature will be the average temperature found above ground year-round. So that will generally be -60 C or lower, depending on latitude. If you start digging down kilometers it might start getting warmer, but we simply don't know the heat flux or temperature profile of the interior of Mars.
3. Yes, we will have to mine materials in order to process them. But the easiest form of mining is strip mining, and we have enough challenges already. We should choose the easiest form of mining. If we find a vein of some useful material, then we will dig underground to get it. But the mine will follow the vein, it won't just be a bunch of horizontal tunnels. There is no reason to believe that digging a bunch of horizontal tunnels underground will be a good way to get resources. In fact even if we are digging tunnels underground for habitats, the mine tailings probably still wouldn't be very useful for resource extraction. It would probably still be easier to gather regolith from strip mining instead of using the mine tailing we already have.",AskEngineers,False,JetFuelCereals,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gc7rr9/interesting_debate_ongoing_do_we_need_tunnelling/

I’m a newbie and am working on a project of my own.  My terminology isn’t the best but I hope I am descriptive enough for you guys to understand.  But I am looking to get a “back and forth” mechanism that is not too big, easy to use and I’m able to move around. So it looks like a linear actuator is what I’m looking for.  

After doing research into buying one, i see that It looks like many of them are for 200lbs and up and require high voltage and only extend out 12 inches. Are there any linear actuators that maybe only need 20lb of force at max? Are there any actuators that are easy to move from home to home and use regular power outlets? I would also like to be able to adjust the speed of it going from point A to B.  I would be using a remote control to go back and forth, but is there a feature to where it would automatically go back and forth from A to B? I see many that require you to reverse the polarity. 

Is a linear actuator what I’m looking for or is there another type of “mechanism” or “system” that would satisfy the needs I listed above? Can’t wait to hear the help/criticism...

58,How should structural steelwork be bonded correctly? (EU Based),1588351505,"Hello,

I work for an Original Equipment Manufacturer who construct modular steel framework (both stainless and mild steel painted) which we then mount our own machines, control panels, walkways  etc.

Typically on each completed (bolted together) steel framework we have our main control panel with the incoming power supply which then distributes power to smaller remote panels around the system. This incoming power supply connection in our main panel is the PE point which we connect all our earths from the distributed panels too.

Please would you help with the following:

1. Can we bond our structural steelwork to this PE point in our main panel? If so what regulations should we be adhering to?
2. I think where steelwork should be bonded to itself (i.e. from one modular section to another bolted on section) we can use supplementary bonding which requires a smaller CSA than equipotential bonding. Is this correct? Do we even need to bond it to itself or is there a test which is acceptable to prove that such bonding isn't required when the framework is fully assembled?

I've gone round in circles on this and not really grasped a good understanding of the requirements. Everyone I speak to has different opinions and previous examples. Legacy posts on online forums aren't making sense to my application. The 18th edition regulations feel geared towards domestic installations and don't immediately seem to help. There is a good chart in section 4.4 which may be relevant but I'm not sure if the CSAs mentioned really cater for the sort of currents we have (around 400A rated incomers).

We are based in the UK and sell equipment to EU Regs/Standards.

Setting aside concerns about whether this would be to code or would be allowed by inspectors, I am concerned that pouring the new foundation against the old by simply using rebar pins and bonding agents, i.e. established methods, will not be adequate to ensure the stability of the joint, as the soils are only moderately stable.

10,Why does y = exp(x-y) look so much like y = x?,1588286368,"So I was reading how negative feedback can help linearlize nonlinear systems. I played around with this and made up a system where the output y = exp(x), x is input. Then I fed back the output directly back into the input so the input is now my original input minus the output, so y = exp(x-y). 

I graphed this in desmos and it looks very similar to y=x, so I can see I linearized it. the difference between y=x and y=exp(x-y) only very slowly increases. My question is how does this happen. My guess is that if you were to take the taylor series of this function, and I dont even know if that is possible for a function that is implicitly defined, that the linear term for [y=exp(x-y)] is essentially 1, and all higher order terms are very small.

the more i look at this function the stranger it seems: if you write out what the function is essentially saying, its basically:

exp( x - exp(x - exp(x - . . . )   )  )

31,Increasing efficiency in small scale RC jet turbine engine,1588267441,"This may be entirely unrealistic/impractical/impossible but I can't let go of the idea.

To give some background - I have been looking into the possibility of making small adjustments to RC jet turbines to increase both fuel efficiency and thrust capability. The most promising path that I have found, would be to replace the kerosene fuel with hydrogen, as the energy-to-weight ratio is 3x that of kerosene but a lower energy *density*. So it seems that more so than weight, the issue with hydrogen propulsion is *volume*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where things start to get interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

In an internal combustion engine with a high pressure liquid hydrogen direct injection fuel system you can achieve [20% higher power output](https://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/tech_validation/pdfs/fcm03r0.pdf) than with traditional gasoline. What I'm unable to find, is if the same is true in a turbine engine, is it possible to increase thrust from a turbine without making mechanical adjustments?

Now to talk potential design changes. Since hydrogen produces liquid water when burned, is it possible to reclaim the exhaust and cycle it back through the engine, using the exhaust heat to aid in an electrolysis process to reclaim some of the raw hydrogen/oxygen and feed it back in as fuel and increase efficiency? I see this operating somewhat similar to a traditional afterburner, just with more steps. I guess the real question here is two-fold 1) is it possible/practical to reclaim the exhaust water? 2) will you use more energy on the electrolysis process than you would gain in overall engine efficiency? 

To frame the questions in context - I am working on a (entirely theoretical, and mostly a fun thought exercise to keep me occupied while quarantined) potential VTOL vehicle utilizing JETCAT size turbine engines. After running the numbers on different engines weight/thrust/consumption right now the most efficient engine would be the [JETCAT P100-RX](https://www.chiefaircraft.com/jc-p100-rx.html). Using 12 of this engine will require 21 liters of kerosene to lift an 90kg human off the ground for 5 minutes. For those that want the math I used to calculate this:

**P100-RX (1.07kg) - 10.2kg Thrust (12 engines = 122.4kg thrust)**

Combined engine weight - 12.84kg

A1 fuel weight - 0.79kg/liter

Pilot weight \~ 80-90kg

\----------

Consumption - 350ml/min at max

Fuel consumption per minute - 4.2 liters

Fuel weight required per minute - 3.31kg

\----------

Minimum thrust required (w/o fuel) - 105kg

\----------

Fuel required for 5 min flight - 21 liters

Total thrust for 5 minute flight - 121.59kg

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is if the proposed design changes would affect these numbers at all. What I know will change, is the physical volume of fuel required on-board, but that *should* simultaneously decrease the weight fuel required. 

For this application, the volume is not necessarily a limiting factor, until you get into flight durations requiring larger than \~3-5 cubic feet. The cost for production of hydrogen fuel is also not a limiting factor, as I have the required materials to create and store hydrogen gas as needed. Cost is less of an issue, my concern is viability of increasing thrust and efficiency on a small scale jet turbine using hydrogen gas and a potential electrolytic afterburner.

33,Why are storm sewer drains designed so that they hold water?,1588265485,"I'm used to house drains that immediately try to flush away everything to the mains.

  
But storm water drains in my area (bay area, California) seem to be different - they are a box that is buried in the ground with a grate over the top. They then have a pipe that collects water and flushes it away. But that pipe is not at the bottom of the box. In one near me the collection pipe is maybe 18"" above the bottom of the box - meaning you have to get 18"" of water in it before it starts draining.

&amp;#x200B;

Best I can guess is it is designed to buffer the water during a hard storm so that the storm drains don't get overloaded. But it also means mosquitoes have a wonderful place to breed.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to that - my county has a whole crew of awesome folks that go around and put mineral oil in literally every single drain a couple times a year. The mineral oil makes it so the fuckers can't breed.

Looking at the conduction paths / wires printed into the circuit board, I notice that there are some that have little squiggles, some which have broader squiggles, and some which have broad squiggles in parallel with a neighboring wire. Why are there these squiggles in the conduction paths on this board? I would have figured that for efficiency, the path of conduction for signals on a circuit board should be kept as short as possible, but these squiggles defy that intuition. My other guesses are that they're an attempt to keep the wire paths roughly equal in length so signals sent together reach their destinations at roughly the same time, though I can't imagine why the distances on a circuit board would need that, especially for such short lengths. Or, perhaps the squiggles interfere with the wires behaving like antennae so as to protect the board from interference, but if this is so, why is this so inconsistently done? Perhaps the squiggles break up some other quality such as inductance? Or perhaps they add resistance? But why are they selectively used in some places and on some wires and not others? Why not use actual resistors if this is so?

Could the squiggles really be purely aesthetic?

I have trouble waking up in the mornings. When i hear the sound of an alarm clock that has a piezo or something equally terrible i will do whatever needs done to silence the sound without fully waking up. I will disable any alarm and return to sleep without remembering. 

I need an alarm that stimulates my brain specifically, not just my auditory senses. 

Not just loud noises. Not just nice noises. I make them all stop. I have even tried various apps where you have to solve maths or whatever puzzle before it stops with the noises. I figured out how to simply turn my phone off or throw it into a yonder room without fully waking up.

&gt;Ladders  installed after October 3, 1983 shall be capable of  withstanding 250  pounds (1,112 N) applied as described in paragraph  (d)(1)(i) of this  section. If used by more than one employee  simultaneously, the ladder  as a unit shall be capable of simultaneous  additional loading in 250  pound (1,112 N) increments for each  additional employee, applied to a  corresponding number of rungs.

Good  afternoon everyone, I am a junior ME student and I was reading through  this particular standard (I referenced it for a presentation for my  machine design class) and I was asked why this standard is based off of  ultimate strength and not yield strength. I couldn't answer that  question, and the professor wasn't entirely sure, since you are going  from the elastic region to the plastic region. I assume it is more to do  with the economic reasons (if you went with a SF of 4 based off of  yield strength, you would need a whole lot more material.)

The design of those components are out of scope but I do need to know what forces act on the civil structure. I don't know how to calculate them.  

**The situation:**  
(FYI image below) A large barrel (D diameter, H height) is titled θ w.r.t. the vertical. It has a weight W and is at the bottom connected to a hinge that allows the barrel to rotate around its axis. At the top it's also connected to a hinge that allows rotations, but only horizontal loads are transferred here so that the vertical loads are directly transferred to the foundation.   
The barrel rotates with a angular velocity of ω around its axis.

**The forces:**  
Since the barrel is rotating, I don't know whether the forces acting on the civil structure are different. Do forces that follow from static equilibrium differ much from those from dynamic? If the large barrel is filled with water, does it influence the distribution of forces?

23,Would you negotiate a job offer in this economic climate?,1588141952,"A little backstory: I have been interning for a major defense contractor for over three summers and have worked part-time with them while attending school for the past two years. I accepted my “dream job” from them about 18 months ago. Come a month or so from graduation this May, I was told that business area has become over-staffed and they placed my offer on the current team I work for, but at their Palmdale, CA location instead.

Here’s the salary run-down: 

Per Glassdoor, I’ll be making $2,000 below the median for an entry-level engineer. I felt this salary was low when I initially accepted it, especially for my experience level, but I was naive and willing to take the pay cut for my dream job.

I’ve gained substantial company-specific experience since I first accepted the job 18 months ago. It’s an entry-level position, but I feel my skills have been on par with the Level II engineers on my team. 

Here’s my dilemma: 

I don’t have any other offers in hand since I already accepted with them. Is it justified to negotiate a higher pay given they changed my department last-minute and the experience I’ve gained? Do you agree I’m qualified to make the median salary or honestly slight to the right of the bell-curve? Is it worth negotiating in this economic climate?

29,Issue with 0-D Model of flow through valves in IC engines,1588131473,"I am attempting to put together a rudimentary 0-D model of the air flow into an IC engine cylinder due to the piston's movement (assuming valve performance and tracking gas pressure, etc, as the piston oscillates). Before I state the problem that I am having, I'm going to lay out what I've done so far. My current method is to keep track of the total mass of gas in the cylinder over time, by using both the changing volume of the cylinder to determine the changing cylinder pressure and the mass flow rate through the valve due to the pressure differential.

Below is my current strategy (I'll post a screen-cap of my excel sheet at the bottom).  


1. With the piston at TDC at the start of the intake stroke, I'm assuming that air at 1 atm &amp; 70 F already fills the clearance volume.
2. I increment the crank-shaft angle 0.5 deg and use the engine speed (const 2400 RPM) to step forward in time. 
3. I use the crank-angle to calculate the instantaneous gas volume (I can't find the equation online, but I've pulled it from [Fund of IC Engines by Pulkrabek](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Fundamentals-Internal-Combustion-Engine/dp/0131405705/ref=sr_1_4?crid=21DFLCX0OW01X&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=internal+combustion+engine+fundamentals&amp;qid=1588129580&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=internal+combustion+engines%2Cstripbooks%2C157&amp;sr=1-4)) and I've verified that these calcs are correct.
4. For this first step, I've assumed that no additional mass has yet entered the cylinder through the valve, so I use the initial gas mass &amp; new gas volume to calculate a new gas density.
5. I assume that the gas expands adiabatically and calculate the new temperature &amp; pressure accordingly from the density ratio (i.e. (P2/P1) = (dens2/dens1)\^(spec heat ratio) ).
6. From this new pressure, I can use the difference between this pressure &amp; ambient to calculate a mass flow rate (see equation in the link below) - I've currently assumed that the flow is *not* choked. I've assumed a discharge coefficient of 0.65, and I'm currently neglecting compressibility factor.
7. Finally, these exact same steps are repeated but each time I use the previous mass flow rate &amp; the time step to calculate a new gas mass (m2 = m1 + massflow1\*(t2 - t1) )

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I'm having will become evident once you see my excel sheet - after the first calculation, the pressure immediately jumps to *above* ambient (row 3), which is obviously not physical...I've attempted reducing my step-size, but this does not appear to solve the issue - I personally think that the error lies with my methodology rather than my calculations. Am I missing something important here, or is it most likely that I'm performing a calculation wrong? I've checked the equations multiple times, but I suppose that there could still be a typo somewhere.

Thanks for your help.

Short Story:

*  I spend my life in from of a computer
* I want to make myself a corner standing desk.
*  I want an automatic solution - One button press

I want to try and make my life a bit healthier by DIYing a standing desk. From what I could read and see on the Internet, linear actuators are obviously the most popular fully automatic solution.

As stated, I want a corner desk, which implicate I will need 3 supporting points. I am planning on controlling the actuators with a 4 channels relay board and a raspberry pi. Also to make sure everything goes smooth, I will fix the moving parts of the desk to the legs with rails (as seen on many youtube videos)

My questions / concerns:

* I have concerns about using 3 actuators (1 per support point) - If one or more goes out of sync, that would rip the desk. I was planning on using common actuators found on Amazon.- A [guy on youtube](https://youtu.be/GiV_JJyvJzY?t=412) fixes the actuators on alternative platform which then lift the desk, I was thinking using his technique. So the question: is it common for actuators to not being constant on of the lifting speed ? IF there is more weight on one of them, will it raise at the same speed ?
* Do I really need 3 actuators ? Thats my main question, are you guys aware of something I could use on the middle support point only to stabilize the desk once fully extended without the need to buy 3 actuators ?
* Finally - Do you guys recommand absolutely not doing this project and just go with a 2 legs standing desk ? Like using 3 cheap actuators in sync with no fancy control board will end up blowing up ?

I drew a design of the desk, here's an image [https://ibb.co/h2dmQR1](https://ibb.co/h2dmQR1)

Hey all, I've never posted in this sub before so I'm not exactly sure if this type of question fits here or not, but here goes!  
  
I'm wondering if, during development, any type of carbon fibre or composite was considered for the shell of the SR-71 Blackbird, in place of the titanium they ended up using?  
  
I (relatively) understand that the titanium was used due to heat concerns, with the cockpit window sometimes exceeding temperatures of above six hundred degrees, and other flat surfaces sitting around four hundred degrees (at mach 3.2). Now, I was reading earlier that composites made from carbon fibre are [forty times less heat conductive than aluminum and ten times less than steel](http://www.dexcraft.com/articles/carbon-fiber-composites/aluminium-vs-carbon-fiber-comparison-of-materials/#heat_conduction), and I was wondering how this compared to titanium.

**Product Owner**

1.) Led three teams of over 20 employees in the development of software applications for online payment and order service

2.) Reduced software bugs by 90% by incorporating Kaizen into the application deployment process providing continuous improvement and development support

3.) Reduced shipping cost annually by $2.5 million by applying Design For Six Sigma principles to develop new shipping and return processes

4.) Delivered payment processing application critical to 140 million customers 1 week ahead of schedule

&amp;#x200B;

**Product Owner Job Role/Achievements:**

As a product owner I was oversaw three different development teams. I managed 12+ different development projects. They fell into two categories – one categories was enhancements and development project associated directly with P2. The second category are micro services (Lego pieces) that work with P2. Think of P2 application as a Lego platform which contains everything data wise for the company (devices, phone plans, promotions, qualification rules etc.). I was responsible for working with PMC (Vendor Company), my development team, and business partners (on both sides of the companies) to work with the dev team and develop this software and make sure it was ready for a big merger date – this was important in order to ensure business operations were smooth the first day as a merged company.  These enhancements were everything from creating user roles to leading the development teams create functionality in the software such as: creating plans, creating family plans, be able to create promotions, creating logic to define qualification rules that pull customer data and check to see if they are qualified for a certain plan, device, promotion to list a few. This application would be used by roughly (80,500 employees) in the Mobil store, by customer service, IT – everything. We were able to develop enhancements and deliver this developments/enhancement – I’d say a week before European merger. (These applications are critical for the 140M customers that would move into this system).

The second development effort – was outside of that core application but were still associated with it. Think of the P2 as the platform, and these other development efforts were Lego pieces that attach to the core. These 12 projects ranged from validating data in Patalom2 to other data bases – to make sure that the data was the same to prevent errors (data integrity validation). I worked with development to create applications to compare environments and identify difference – this was important to track again changes in the environment in order to make sure environments were the same (the data were all the same). We created oracle our database with oracle database architects to create allow business partners to run queries locally.

One of the developments efforts I oversaw was around shipping and returns processes. Our current process was VERY Inefficiency and outdated. We wasted millions of dollars a year one packaging material because of poor logic and the application was just not user friendly. Poor logic because we would ship same size box for everything regardless of how big or small the item is. I worked with business partners in both companies (prior our merge) to discuss and gather requirements. I took these requirements to PMC and worked with them closely to ensure that we developing a software according to the requirements. Ultimately our system was smarter (we were able to create shipping boxes for e.g that adapted to the device dimensions). This plus, a ton of other issues (like device conditions – before we didn’t have proper way to log damaged devices that were given to us – money out our own pocket. Fixing all of these – our new system saves us around \~2 million dollars.

In order to be able to manage these different development projects I had introduced Kaizen to give a customer focused mindset, with the idea of continuous improvement. Setting this mindset was important to bring everyone together with the same goal of being customer-oriented and helping the customers with any issues with the software in the future. These continuous efforts cut down on defects/bugs by 90%. I also introduced DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) into the software development cycle to make the process for efficient. Generally, SDC you bound around the different steps. With DMAIC and SDC – we had a straight path we followed and there no fallback. We were able to reach all out-project timeline milestone ahead of schedule for all our dev projects.

&amp;#x200B;

**Business &amp; Technology Analyst**

1.) Lead program manager for three pharmaceuticals software development projects, completing developments ahead of schedule by 2 weeks

2.) Accelerated project completion by leading sprint reviews and daily scrums to encourage team cohesion, overcoming impediments and hurdles to productivity

3.) Analyzed client’s business requirements and processes through document analyses, interviews, workshops and workflow analysis

4.) Collaborated with European pharmaceutical business partners to determine business and functional requirements for software development

&amp;#x200B;

**Business &amp; Technology Analyst Role/Achievements**

At this consulting company I was responsible for development of laboratory software commonly used in major pharmaceutical companies. Majority of pharma companies all use some version of this software. I was certified expert on this application and was working on two projects on the development of this application for two major European pharmaceutical companies. On a day to day basis I worked closely with business partners to gather requirements – this was important to ensure that the application met and satisfied the customer and process needs. I did document analyses, interviews, workshops and workflow analysis to make sure I get a full view of the requirements, again to make sure the application has everything request to make sure respective business operations are smooth. Each day had daily scrums to encourage team cohesion, identify any roadblocks and provide ways to overcome them. This is important because better team mental and motivation allows us to complete work with a better quality and ahead of schedule. We were able to deliver both of these projects roughly \~2 weeks before the date that they had provided. Introducing the DMAIC applied here as well – and allowed us to save time and money. We saved time because with this process introduced we increased our development rate (the number of requirements we put into the system daily) by roughly 18%. Without this process we were bad, behind on requirement development and lack of order. As a result of this 18% - we were able to complete the project 2 weeks ahead of schedule. These 2 weeks not only benefited the pharma companies but also make the company I was working for look really good (the image of the company was even better.)  Completing this project ahead also impacted by saving money (\~50,000) – because they vendor devs who were working on this as well. They were EXPENSIVE. Completing the project sooner saved the pharma companies \~50K.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Quality Assurance/Quality Control**

1.) Prevented downtime and expensive disruptions through inventory management using DEACOM ERP software

2.) Reduced production time by 6 hours through identification, and removal of non-critical tests for a KY product based on thousands of process data

3.) Identified and resolved malfunctioning equipment based on thousands of SQC data points increasing packaging efficiency by 30%

4.) Validated quality control procedures with foreign stakeholders to ensure product conformity

5.) Conducted root cause analysis (RCA) to resolve equipment, product and safety related issues

&amp;#x200B;

**Quality Assurance/Quality Control Roles/Achievements**

I was basically heading the QA/QC for the product. I was overseeing everything from laboratory testing, manufacturing process, and packaging process of the product. In addition, to overseeing the quality process I was also working with a team using DEACOM ERP software for inventory management. This was important because using this software, in addition to understanding the process for making the various products allowed us to prevent downtime, and expensive disruptions. We worked with different teams to identity supply and demand. Certain time of the year – certain products are higher in demand etc. Using this information plus DEACOM ERP software we ensure smooth, uninterrupted production. Of course, machinery is never perfect and human mistakes happen. Example, there was time one of our product significantly failed certain lab tests. A team and I performed RCA (root cause analysis) to identify the issue and why it happened, and how to prevent in the future. Through the process we had eventually identified that a kettle’s temperature was out of calibration. As a result of this temperature variation it deviated from the process rules and resulted in bad product. Other time RCA was used to identify why there was metal in our product. Through a similar examination – we identified the source was rust in a pump. Maintenance engineers were able to repair it and operations resumed. Again, that product was roughly \~150K$ value, we saved that much money, and ensure that we didn’t throw that away. We also had clients come from Egypt, and Japan who would to look at the plan and the product. I would work with them to guide them through the cooking process and quality checks – to show them how good we are making their product. As a result, they increased the number of that product by 20% - the batch amount from then were 20% more volume. There was another time where we were having issues packaging a product. When we package a product, it goes through more or less the same number of tests as when your manufacturing it. The idea is the results should be identical. We were trouble packaging once, used RCA to identify the equipment (associated with that test). We looked into 100s of data points from SQC data and noticed that the machine was deviation from the SQC results/expectations. I also worked with teams with a research organization to refine our current process. Working with them, analyzing thousands of batches of data we removed tests which were not critical and had no impact – this saved us 6 hours roughly of production time for the product.",AskEngineers,False,g0ldenmachop,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g9xcd4/please_help_me_draftrefine_bullets/

70,Did a wind turbine experiment. Why are my RPMs decreasing as wind speed increases?,1588100876,"For a project group, we are developing a small vertical axis wind turbine. We did an experiment where we found that, with increasing wind speeds of 30 to 45 KM/HR, the turbine's RPMs lowered from 1180 to 920 RPM. I made a best fit line that had R\^2 value of 0.96 which is surprisingly linear even tho the data trend doesn't make sense to me. Here are screenshots of our experiment and resulting data: [https://imgur.com/a/JRG9KpU](https://imgur.com/a/JRG9KpU)

**How we did the experiment:**

The wind turbine was mounted on a generator. Three people went in one vehicle: 1 person driving, 1 person holding the generator in the passenger seat, and 1 person recording from behind the passenger seat. The driver focused on driving at each speed without acceleration/deceleration while the passenger held the generator (w the turbine mounted) out the window. The third person recorded with their phone from behind. They recorded 10 s at each of the following vehicle speeds: 30, 35, 40, 45 KM/HR. The varying vehicle speeds were supposed to simulate wind speeds. They did this going the same direction on the same road.

To eliminate error from outside wind (really hard to do) they did this on a road on a day with low wind speeds. To eliminate error from variable car speeds I took several 1.5 s readings from each of the 10 s videos and averaged them (they were all consistent w each other).

**My guesses at why we have this trend:**

1. Outside wind speeds - but then why is the trend so linear and shows opposite of what is expected?
2. The generator causes some effect where it regulates power by increasing resistance to keep RPMs below a certain value?

Mistake #2: recently, a week before receving the job offer from the government contractor, I had already accepted a different job with a different company. I had been wanting to work for this government contractor for a very long time, so I notified my current employer that I would be accepting that job offer. My current employer at the time agreed to let me go without the need of a two week notice. He determined it wasnt necessary since I had only been there a single week, and basically still undergoing training.

I regret not taking advantage of my undergraduate time and would appreciate some advice on what the best route I should pursue. 

I'm hesitant to pursue an MS because I don't have any background in mechanical engineering outside the general engineering coursework, plus static, dynamic, and fluid mechanics.   I would also struggle with getting research positions due to this, especially since my undergrad GPA was ~3.15. I feel like I could finish a BS in ~2 years and maybe in the future my employer would be willing to fund an MS if I want to pursue that.

How many here have started a career in engineering, specifically Mech-E, after years of working in an unrelated field? Has it been satisfying professionally and personally? What fields do you work in?

Engineering was always in the back of my mind growing up: I'm mechanically adept and analytical, always looking for solutions in a spatial environment, and find concrete, observable results more satisfying than intangible policy or theory. I was one of those kids tinkering the basement all night instead of playing games or watching TV. 

I have a BA in geography. I like the natural sciences and stuck with that during undergrad, but pure science and research is not nearly as appealing to me for a career. I think I have more potential to apply my interests in a practical field of engineering. I would have to go back to school for a second bachelor's degree to ""catch up"" and accomplish this. The GI Bill will help reduce any cost issues.  

Right now I work in Tomahawk missile systems and training at an operational fleet staff. It's interesting stuff but it's also entirely policy-driven and managerial, which I don't readily like. You can see what my preferred work style might be. The military has helped with leadership and to become a good manager of personnel, not to mention established financial stability at a young age.

I am a safety practitioner and I have come across a manifold system that I need some help understanding.

I have seen 6x 47kg LPG bottles that are connected together using a T-shape manifold connectors and what I believe to be pig tales. They are sequential and appears to be a pressure regulator between the cylinders and the supply into the building. There appears to be shutoff valves on top of each of the LPG bottles but no isolating valve for the whole thing.

93,I need advice on how to design a weighing scale from strain gauges,1588070761,"Hello Everyone!

I am a final year electronic engineering student working on my final year project. The project is to use a cows weight distribution to detect and monitor lameness.

I need to make a scale to weigh the individual legs of the cow so i can get a distribution to categorize the lameness. I have not worked with strain gauges before so i am kind of flustered as there is a lot of information about strain gauges and I'm not sure how to use them correctly.

I wanted to use a load cell as that would be the simplest option but it was too expensive and was not complex enough for the project. I wanted some advice to decide if should make my own load cell, or if i should put the strain  gauges directly to the platform i want. I decided i want to make 4 platforms, 1 for each leg and contained within a rubber mat.The accuracy has to be to within 5% per leg of the cow. Each leg weighs about 300kg. The main focus is that I'm able to get the weight distribution.

Is it possible to put strain gauges on the platform directly and measure the strain? I do not know how many i should use.  Will using one strain gauge on a platform be good enough to determine the weight or should i use 4 per platform? 

I know strain gauges are just resistors that change when stretched or compressed. The values are small and sensitive to temperature which is why i will need a wheatstone bridge and an instrumentation amplifier. Putting a strain gauge in the middle of the platform will measure the strain when the weight is applied by the material bending. However, if the leg of the cow is not directly on the sensor im not sure it will give accurate readings, but will it give accurate enough readings which i can use?

I am not too concerned with the wheatstone bridge and amplifying. I just need some direction to how to design the scale and how to use the strain gauge.

97,[Interpersonal skils] How do you point out major design flaws gently?,1588067257,"I left my old uni society for a year to work in industry, and in that time the team that succeeded me have designed and built most of the aircraft I was working on. Had it not have been for the pandemic, they'd be attempting to fly it - with a human inside - in a few weeks.

Worryingly, 70% of the redesign was done by a single first-year, and none of the upper-years in the team have checked his work.

I took a quick glance at some critical aspects of the design, and immediately found a fatal flaw in that the aircraft was incredibly unstable; a -15% static margin (which, for reference, is what the F-22 flies with.)

I tried to raise this concern (I was probably a little too confrontational about it) with the designer, and he started trying to downplay the issue, becoming extremely defensive and trying to distract the issue with ""well, at least we built something"". He wasn't willing to share any analysis he'd done with the team, and I strongly suspect he hasn't done any.

I still have serious concerns about the safety/basic airworthiness of the aircraft, and plan to check some other aspects of the design to make sure things are okay. If I find more problems, I want to raise them so they can get fixed.

TL;DR:

Have to convince a first-year at peak Dunning-Kruger that his design has serious flaws and needs redesign. Additionally, want to get other people on board with checking his work, and want to get him to start sharing his design justifications with the team.

I have a multimeter so possibly I could do this experiment myself but maybe someone already knows the result, so I don't have to.  Also perhaps resistance is not the right measure, perhaps there is another quality such as impedance (which I guess applies to AC circuits) that would give me this number.

Also I'm curious how precise it would be.

I think this would not really be applicable, just curious if springs have this quality.

I have an odd question I recently attached a makeshift roof to the top of my race car using 3M Panel bond adhesive. Attaching the fasteners to the underside of the roof with the adhesive I have bolted everything down securely, but wanted a professional opinion if the adhesive I used will be able to sustain wind loads while racing.

The 3M adhesive is rated at 3,273PSI if cured at 73 degrees for 24 hours. But because I had to cure the adhesive(epoxy) outside with an inconsistent temperature I guess it would be around 2,900- 3,000PSI.

My biggest fear is that the adhesive would fail at speeds of 100pmh (typical max for the car on straits...not a fast car lol) and cause the roof to fly off. But I have no earthly idea how much wind load is applied to the underside of the roof when the windows are rolled down at 100mph. Or what the typical PSI for a calm wind would be on a vehicle travel at highway speeds.

Any info you can provide would be amazing, not sure if I am super safe or risk running into adhesive failure.

48,Question about BMW's CCV/Oil Separation System,1587999852,"TLDR: BMW PCV/oil separators have a drain to return oil to the pan as it is separated from the crankcase gasses, does this drain have a one way valve in it so only oil flows to drain, or is it also designed for crankcase gases also vent through it to return to the intake?

The reason for this post is I am looking for a reasonably priced oil separation system for my crankcase vent on an engine build. I have plans to design one in an aluminum box mounted to the top of my valve cover, but for the amount of R&amp;D I's put into that, I have also found some (I think) suitable off the shelf options. The engine this is going on is a VW TDI from a 1996 Passat with about double its factory power output (90hp diesel to around 180 by way of lots more fuel and 22psi boost coming from a larger turbo).

BMWs from the factory seem to have a quite sophisticated cyclonic oil separation system built in with their PCV valves. This feature is not limited to just them, as newer VWs and other brands have similar systems to keep crankcase gasses returned to the intake free of oil, but many of them are integrated into plastic valve covers, so could not be adapted to other applications. BMW seems to have been doing this for a long time, so there are a wide range of shapes and sizes and most of their systems are external to the engine connected with plastic or rubber hoses, making them perfect to be used for other applications.

Now, to my question. The drain (always the bottom of the cone shaped part) is generally teed into the dipstick tube in some way. In my application I wanted to connect this to my turbo oil drain. Of course this is to drain excess oil as needed, but is there a one way valve there to only let oil flow one way, or does this drain tube also serve to vent crankcase gasses back through the separator and intake? The reason I ask, is some engines only have crankcase vent via the valve cover, and others have a secondary port in the block to allow more flow. This is dependent on the design of the block and head oil galleys, and I do not know enough about BMWs to say one way or another so I am asking here. Any ideas guys? Recommendations?

\#1 in the diagram is the part I am wondering about. They come in a bunch of shapes and sizes, but generally there is one port to the valve cover, one to the intake (for vacuum) and one on the bottom of the cyclone chamber for oil drain (and maybe crankcase vent???).

He asked me if I had any clue how to design one in a way that would be cheaper than buying one (the cheap side is $150 (but reviews are bad for those), and the expensive side is $500), and I'm struggling to figure this out...

At first, I thought this would be simple...

\--Find a base (bucket with cement...easy enough)

\--The pole (maybe a pipe)

\--the spinning arm...THIS IS WHAT'S DRIVING ME NUTS.

Because the spinning arm can't be on the top (otherwise I'd just tell him to use the spinning plates in bar stools), I've been racking my brain with what I could feasibly buy at home depot or amazon that would work...

I did a little research on wind art and even pole dancing (apparently the poles actually spin, not the women, which I learned tonight)...both use thrust bearings with flanges (still not totally sure I understand how that works, but it's not too complicated)...but apparently if he did use that setup, he'd need to get two of them...but I'm not sure what would prevent them from sliding down the pole or how he would mount the arm to them.

I thought possibly some type of t-shaped pipe clamp might help for the arm part...if he mounted a pipe clamp on something that spun around the pole, that seems like the solution...but again...not sure how to get that thing to spin.

Does anyone have any idea what products that can be purchased at home depot can be used to make this?  My brain hurts and I'm tired haha.

My ideal job would be a research scientist researching the climate and how it’s changing. I’ve learned recently that the general name for this is geophysical fluids.

In my recent time of looking at grad schools it appears most schools require you to pick a focus area to study. I was curious if with my interests and career goals what the best type of focus area would be. I know fluid dynamics is an easy option but would like earth science type of an area be better?

68,Flying solar balloon helicopter,1587964837," I want to build a flying solar balloon helicopter. It will be able to parachute down safely with no power. I’m interested in the possibility of a compressed air energy storage system. I want to deal with tubes and turbines designed for larger volume and lower pressure.
1.) Which type of air motor would be optimal for spinning a large geometric fabric sail helicopter shape? Converting the stored air pressure to high torque low rpm rotation.
2.) On the other hand I’m considering using the stored air through a turbine generator to maintain an ac power system powering an induction motor for rotating the sails.
3.) Another option is lithium ion batteries and brushless dc motors. The weight, expense, and life span are some of my concerns. 

Solar panel fabrics using weaved in solar cells can supply power directly to fill the tank; along with me on the hamster wheel/ bicycle/hand pump. The home station would constantly be charging with wind and solar for refuel. There may also be a fabric vertical axis wind turbine on the helicopter balloon itself.
The terminal velocity of the whole ordeal will be a safe landing speed. Also at terminal velocity it should gather energy from the rotor sails spinning backwards.

I’ve read about a possible air compression system that would use a pulsing arc to heat and expand air in a non conductive chamber with two check valves, one exhausting heated air into the main tank and the other pulling in cool air from the atmosphere.
Is this viable?

Swing beam question

Hello, I’ve been assembling this play set and I decided to upgrade the swing beam from a 10 foot 4x4 that the instructions recommend, to a 12 foot 4x6 just so that it was heavier duty and the swings could be a little further apart (the reviews mentioned that they were too close together when using a 10 ft beam).  But now I’m worried that the 4x4 the beam is resting on won’t be strong enough to support all the extra weight. I was considering adding extra 4x4 posts underneath the horizontal 4x4 to support it. Should I just use a 4x4 for the beam and call it a day?

The beam and posts are made of ground contact pressure treated SYP. There are a total of 3 swings, spaced 18 inches apart. The cantilever is 48 inches. Thank you for any advice.

Apologies in advance if this is the wrong forum for asking these types of questions.

My apartment complex unfortunately doesn't allow drilling into the door frames, so I've been looking at pull-up bars that doesn't require any drilling.  My apartment is also pretty small so a stand-alone pull-up thing might be out of the question.

As I look through this and other subreddits I see a continuing theme of people being dissatisfied with their careers in defense and in general a lot of people taking down on working in defense. 

I was drawn to defense originally because I wanted to do something where I was making an impact in a pretty big way without the risk involved in more entrepreneurial style engineering (like creating my own product or working for a start-up), I wanted to be working on projects that were amazing and cutting edge (the first thing that really got me inspired was an article in popular mechanics about the air force looking into getting planes with cloaking devices). I thought working in defense would be challenging, innovative, and, exciting. But I keep seeing people leaving defense or complaining about bureaucracy discouraging them.  

I like Disney imagineering for the fact that it is unique and multidisciplinary creative and I would assume fun. I think i would still have an impact on a lot of people's lives (or at least have something that I worked on have a hand in making their day amazing). 

so to get to my questions, 

is defense a good industry to work in?

if you work in defense to you enjoy it, do you think what you are doing is worth some of the negatives?

a lot of the defense corporations that people think of immediately are more involved in aeronautics, would working for a company that makes boats and subs be a little better than working on fighter jets? (and if so what are the names of some of those companies)?

the theme park industry is already niche enough, and I am picky and probably really only want to work for Disney or maybe universal, am I shooting myself in the foot by even being intrusted in pursuing a career in such a small market?

if you or anyone you know has worked for Disney or universal on theme parks, have they enjoyed it, and how did you get your job there?

Is it possible to get an internship with Disney Imagineering, companies like theirs don't really come to college career fairs, how can you get your foot in the door with them? 

is there anything I can do in terms of course work or a minor to help me one way or another in succeeding in one of these industries?

3,Advice for applying to grad schools?,1587932142,"Hey guys,

I never really expected (or wanted) to go to grad school, but the job market has not been favorable, mostly because I'm about to graduate with a degree in petroleum engineering. Now with COVID making pretty much everything more competitive, I figure grad school is probably my best option.  I'm probably looking to apply to ECE programs, maybe mechanical.  Definitely not petroleum (or chemical for that matter).

I feel like I'm not really a competitive applicant for grad school though, so I wanted to ask if any of you have suggestions for what I should work on if I want to get into any competitive schools.  My GPA (3.3) isn't great, I don't have any research publications (I did one semester of grunt work in a lab as a freshman), and I haven't even taken the GRE.  The only thing I have going for me is that I have some good experience.  I interned at a civil eng. consulting firm, then an F500 oil company, then an F100 oil company (I got to do some really neat stuff at the last one working with HPC and large data sets) but I don't know if grad schools will care about that and honestly I don't really know how to turn what I've done into a competitive application, especially when I'm trying to switch fields.

I don't  plan on doing the installation myself as it's all currently a little  over my head but I do want to make sure I have the components down right.

100ah Lithium battery (sourced locally, $550, 2 year warranty)

Kisae DMT1250, this should be superior to the Renogy 50 Amp DC-DC Charger at  the same price point ($270).  The Renogy can only do 25 Amps to both  alternator and solar charging while the DMT1250 can switch at full 50  Amp capacity to either.

BESTEK  1000W PSW Invertert ($150), I checked Renogy's offering saw poor reviews  all across the board and excellent reviews for this one with some minor flaws.

I'm  mostly asking for clarification that this collection of parts should be good and compatible with my car?  I have had concerns over simple  isolator/relay methods that some people have posted and that cautionary video from Victron over alternator burn.

Pretty much from what I've seen either an expensive alternator/voltage regular or DC-DC Charger was the way to go.

It's  been a drain honestly looking through so many forums but this is what I've managed to definitely nail down and it leaves me with the option of  solar in the future (planning on a soft-folding panel for stealth deploy/takedown/sun-aiming).

11,Hot tub thermodynamics: how best to cut costs?,1587921737,"To give ourselves a bit of cheer in these weird times, we've bought a cheap and cheerful inflatable hot tub. A Lay-Z-Spa Vegas. We've had it a couple of weeks and love using it, especially that it encourages us to get up at 5:30am some days to see the sunrise in!

But I find myself wondering what the best ways to cut costs are.

Firstly, insulation.  The tub has thick (20cm+) inflated sidewalls, with a canvas cover. I'm inclined to think that the large air pockets work as pretty effective insulators, akin to double glazing? There is the potential to put some of that silver bubble wrap material between the inflatable and its outer skin. Worth doing?

The base of the tub is thin, and currently it sits on ~8mm foam mats, just to protect it from puncturing on the ground. I plan to fit a 60mm disc of KingSpan-type insulation under it. Worth doing?

I think the biggest gain to be had is the lid. At the moment it's a cover that clips around the edge with an inflatable disc inside it, which kinda sits inside the walls of the tub. The disc is only 10cm thick and not a great fit.  I'm planning on removing the disc and replacing with a 60mm disc of KingSpan-type insulation. Possibly doubling up; one large disc that sits ontop of the walls, and a smaller disc that sits within the walls, closer to the water's surface? Or maybe the first disc and then the existing inflatable disc below it? What do you think?

Lastly; heating.  A lot of people claim that it's better to leave it on all the time. I'd like that to be true as it's easy and means one can be more spontaneous in use. But surely the rate of heat loss is proportional to the delta between tub temp and ambient temp, so actually it'd be cheaper to turn it off as soon as you get out of it and not turn it on until just in time to heat it up for the next use? 

So much conflicting advice. Almost NONE of it from anyone whose opinion I'd trust. Enter AskEngineers 😎

19,"The ""tech"" industry - are engineering and software different things?",1587916954,"This post is probably going to sound pedantic and like gatekeeping, but it's something I really want to ask. I always took historical view of the phrase ""technology"". When we learned about ""technology"" in elementary school, it was simple machines like levers. When we took ""tech lab"" in middle and high school, that could either mean a machine shop or a computer lab. 

I loved it all, and through my career, I've gotten a variety of related jobs, as an environmental, mechanical, electrical engineer, and as an app developer for a startup. But I've been puzzled that the startup is the only one where people accepted that I worked in ""tech"" or ""technology"". Apparently, with my other jobs, it was more correct to say I worked in ""municipal water"" or ""manufacturing"" or ""defense"" or ""radar kind of stuff"". There seemed to be an existing gatekeeping around the word.

But for some reason, people who worked at the acceptable types of companies could proudly say they work in ""tech"", no matter what they actually do! The marketing guy of a ridesharing company (whose main technological innovation is that they use a Google Maps API and massive data handling in a clever way) proudly beams that they are in ""tech"". A guy that reviews Roombas and Bluetooth earphones proudly beams that they are a ""techie"".

I've always kind of weirdly felt left out of the ""tech"" group my whole life, even though nearly everything I've done fits into the ""technology"" bucket as far as it was taught to me. Am I right that the economic explosion of software and need for software engineers has caused their contribution to technology to dwarf all others in popular culture? I mean I've even seen scenes play out in real life where a kid will be building like a cool bridge with Legos or Knex, and an aunt or someone passing by will say ""Ooh, look at what little Timmy did! He's smart, he should make an app and make kajillions!"". Not what I would think is the logical conclusion - ""He should look into civil engineering and building bridges"".

23,[UK] MEng Civil Engineering vs. MSc Structural Engineering,1587914795,"Hello,  


I am currently studying for an MEng in Civil Engineering at Northumbria University.  


However, I am seriously considering applying to do an MSc in Structural Engineering at Newcastle University, but I am not sure whether this is the right decision to make and I would appreciate some advice.  


The reason I want to do an MSc is:  


1) Study at a better university  
2) Specialise in structures which is where I want to work  
3) Separate, post-graduate masters degree independent of my BEng  
4) Better job opportunities when I graduate  


The reasons I want to stick with my MEng is:  


1) Maintenance loan from student finance  
2) No 6 percent post-graduate loan  
3) Confident I can get a good 1st in my degree  
4) Course recently accredited by JBM for satisfying CEng  


Basically, I just want some advice on what I should do. I always felt like I let myself down at A-level and wish I went to a Russell Group, but then again does it matter?  


Also, I do want to work in structures and my industry and summer placements have both been in structures, but again does just having an MEng Civil Eng degree over a MSc Strcutural Eng degree make much difference when applying for grad jobs?

I have a strong background in Physics and Mathematics, which I started learning as they provide a base in understanding everything.   

Some Context of my goals: I want to be able to look at a problem from many angles: computer science angle, material science, mechatronics, etc. I want to be able to use knowledge in many areas to create inventions or solutions to problems. Now I know that the problem itself will make me learn specific things and therefore I was looking to learn the Principles of Engineering (there might not be such a thing). For example, if I learn basic computer science right now, in the future I will be able to build on that knowledge to more specific subsets of computer science. 

I am interested in the following areas: If you are able to provide like a common denominator it would be GREAT!

1) Neuroengineering

2) Energy Engineering?? (nuclear science applied to energy solutions)

3) Space Travel (I sound like a kid I know)

4) AR Glasses

5) Pretty much anything to do with the future of humanity :)

I still work on NPD (scope out QC work, lead DFMEAs, material selection) but the majority of my role is defining reliability metrics, test development, and safety engineering for certification. 

If I wanted to switch into product development what would be the best path forward? Has anyone been in a similar position? (Graduated, switched into product design).

72,An Island Nation of Redditors,1587839109," 

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

Also maybe where they advise me to go and what careers/prospects there are associated with. Finally, if people think Berkeley is the option, could you also distinguish between just ICL and UCL?

**Some Context**

A few things before I get into what I think about each uni, financially both London and San Francisco are the same, all of them are in central metropolitan hubs for businesses and startups and based on where I've lived (NZ &amp; Seychelles), the weather isn't a huge factor for me.  
I have no clue what I'm doing or want to do, except that I want to make good capital to start my own streams of passive income. I've always struggled with passion, and that's why I've chosen varied courses for each uni.   
A bit of stats for context, maybe to show what I've been good at so far.  
**A-levels:** (Computer Science, Physics, FurtherMaths, Maths)  
(predicted this august A\*AA\*)(Received A\* for maths last year)  
**SAT:** 1450 (800 math, 650 English) 790 Maths II, 760 Physics  
**Oxford PAT** (admission test): 44/50 Math, 9/50 Physics (why I got rejected haha)  


**Imperial (ICL) \~ Materials Science and Engineering**

* *\[Pros\]*  
\-Ranking/prospects/recognised as engineering school/industry ties/opportunities/prestige  
\-Futuristic stuff/facilities and huge diversity for jobs.. i.e nanotech, biotech, aerospace, manufacture..etc
* *\[cons\]*  
\-considered a soft subject/not much math (which I've focused on in highschool) compared to other engineering courses/I don't have much background in other non-math subjects   
\-will involve chem and bio, and lab work (which didn't enjoy too much but uni might be different)  
\-Gambling that I will enjoy the course.  
\-A conditional offer of A\*A\*A   
\-To make decent success requires a high level of innovation, so perhaps career pressure

**UCL \~ Engineering &amp; Architectural Design**

* *\[pros\]*  
\-course done at bartlett school of architecture ranks no.1\~2 for architecture  
\-applies math to design, which is me  
\-seems less stressed for academic students, more balanced  
\-A conditional offer of AAA
* *\[cons\]*  
\-overall ranking is lowest out of the three, also dropping a lot. 2 years ago was 6th, now 15th. student satisfaction is one of the lowest. not as known for engineering compared to ICL and Berkeley.  
\-might lose out on opportunities/ industry ties/ and no work placement in the final year.  
\-Most students have design/art backgrounds with less regard for math

**Berkeley \~ Engineering Mathematics and statistics**

* *\[pros\]*  
\- rank and improving/top engineering school/right in silicone valley  
\- job diversity could even go into finance, America allows double major or minors, so flexible.  
\- engineers make more money in the US for some reason  
\- unconditional offer, (i can go if I choose, does not depend on grades)
* *\[cons\]*  
\- Lots of filler subjects such as English/social science. feels like a waste of time  
\- takes a lot longer for masters (recognised by the country), so more expensive in the long term.  
\- much larger classes &amp; population, I prefer smaller.  
\- will have to break up with 9 month gf who plans on going to London.

98,Computational Engineering or Machine Learning for thesis topic?,1587803197,"I am a Mechanical Engineer currently on crossroads for my Masters Thesis. I have basically two options available one of which is purely related to what I studied in my masters and the other related to machine learning. To give you a background, I am studying Computer Aided Mechanical Engineering which involves subjects like Continuum Mechanics, Finite Element Methods and Numerical Maths. Additionally, I also have been working as a student assistant in this field. For my work, I worked on Abaqus for Material Modelling (UMAT). However, I am not an expert in it, not even close. I could hardly understand it and it took me a while to complete the tasks my supervisor would give me. But I have been learning continuously and feel that I could eventually become acquainted to material modelling. Now, my first thesis topic that is available to me is related to this. Its optimization modelling of an existing material. 

For the second topic, I basically have to make sense of a lot of data gathered from sensors placed on a particular machine with the help of unsupervised machine learning methods. However, I have almost no background in machine learning apart from taking one course on an online learning site (which I am currently pursuing). My supervisor has assured me that this is fine and that I can learn on the job, which I agree with. That is how I learned Material Modelling during my student assistant job. To give you more idea, the ad for the topic mentioned that they needed someone with just basic knowledge in python (I would say I have more than basic knowledge in Python, I used it a lot in my last student assistant job). 

I feel that taking this thesis topic would open a lot of doors for me as the knowledge gained here could be translated to other fields. On the other hand, I also feel that Machine Learning could be a fad and that its applications, at least in the mechanical engineering field, are overstated. In addition to that, I feel like I am cheating on my field, its stupid I know but I can't help it.

7,How to increase Freeze Dryer Capacity?,1587790836,"I tried chicken dumplings last week from Mountain House and was amazed how well they tasted. Was super interested to know it can last 25 years. Then I saw home use freeze dryers from harvest right. I loved the idea of freeze drying my own food but was disappointed when I figured out how little food can be freeze in one long batch. Don't get me wrong it is still an amazing machine and useful for many people. I just think it would be so much more useful if it had more capacity,  Considering each batch takes approx. 24+ hours and electricity to run, I  wonder what would it take to have more. 

If someone working in his field or uses freeze dryer at some labs, can you please elaborate. I would very much like your input and get me to right direction. 

Following parameters come to my mind, let me know if I missed something or thinking correctly:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Drying Chamber Size - What are the effects of using bigger container? Can I have more food trays with same setup? Or it needs bigger/more powerful pump?
2. Vacuum Pump Capacity - So one is CFM rating which is speed at which it sucks air out. And then there is ultimate vacuum level (in units of pressure) it can achieve. Is it also rated for how big of container it can create that vacuum? Or it can do same job but just needs more time?
3. Time: Are there any methods by which we can reduce this required time? Which may need another equipment, might be worth it.
4. Amount of food: As suggested by the company, food needs to be on the trays under a certain thickness and there is also a weight limitation. So what happens if I have more food or thicker layer of food. Even going further - Can we have a platform where instead of food staying stationary on a flat surface, it is instead mixed or moved by some contraption so all the food gets to surface turn by turn and gets freeze dried.

The aircraft would be egg shaped, saucer shaped or even donut shaped. It would be wound with insulated wire (maybe superconducting??) across the whole surface. If a sufficiently high voltage is applied, it could create an ionized boundary layer of air on the skin of the aircraft. The boundary layer thickness would be a function of applied voltage. Now, this boundary layer would be very sticky and can theoretically reduce drag friction by preventing boundary layer seperation of air, when moving at high speeds. Also, if we could have a high boundary layer thickness at the front of the craft and low boundary layer thickness at the back of the ship, it could create a small forward thrust. Even a small thrust with minimal drag friction can cause the aircraft to reach high speeds with minimum extra force. But there needs to continuous energy expenditure in the form of electric power for maintaining the ionized boundary layer.

Is such a system physically possible? If money was not a barrier, could such a system be developed with existing technology?",AskEngineers,False,raghucc24,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g7ifm9/is_it_possible_to_create_an_aircraft_propelled_by/
28,My Parents Don’t Want Me to Study Engineering At University,1587768458,"So when I get back to school this September, hopefully if things go back to normal by then, I will be choosing what to study at university. I have narrowed my choices down to mechanical or electrical engineering. When I told my parents my preferred choices they gave me a disappointed look. I was not happy so I challenged their response to which they spent a whole hour telling me why engineering is not a great career choice. They say it’s fine to have it as a hobby i.e. making some cool gadgets at home but as career it’s really not for everyone.

My parents both studied engineering at university. My dad studied EE and Mum Chemeng. Both worked as engineers for a few years, this is how they met. Mum left engineering 2 years after becoming chartered and now work as a data analyst for a utilities company. Dad spend about 12 years as an engineering, his now an area manager i.e. sales rep for a chemical company. These are the reasons they gave.

· Low pay compared to the skill and sacrifice you make. Dad said after a few years he realised other profession at the companies he worked for similar salaries had a nicer job. They also go home on time. He said when covering for colleague he was surprised how quickly he got the hang of their job and how little technical know-how was really required for some roles, just common sense and good practice is required. Dad also said a friend who works as an estate agent earns the same income as the lead engineers at work. One requires detailed technical knowledge that takes years to gain and the other shows people around a house.

· Some companies have moved design work and studies to India. “You can move a call center so why not FEED and detailed design!” 

· No real shortage of graduate engineers. Apparently there is only really a shortage of senior engineers as many people leave engineering early on their career. This makes it very difficult to get into the top engineering companies as there are so many graduate engineers. Where my dad works they had over 400 applicants for a graduate engineering job only paying £23,000 in Essex, UK.

· Since 2005 most engineering graduate jobs pay the same. A huge surplus of engineering graduates are leaving university and number of places have not risen to cope with this.

· No career progression. Although you’re job title will change from graduate to engineer then to senior engineer you will find it difficult to progress in a company unless you go into management.

· The cool engineering jobs do exist but are very difficult to get. You will most likely get a dull job where you will have to design a gold plated products that solves all problems while meeting environmental and safety standards on a shoes string budget.

· University education for engineers is very poor. Most lectures and professors are detached from industry and are just researchers. They might have specific projects form industry but doing a study on modelling a 3 phase separator to improve efficiency and a designing and sizing the 3 phase separator is very different. Mum and dad said they were shocked how little they know when they started working as engineers on projects.

· This whole notion of teaching applicable and transferable skills is university marketing garbage. This idea that you can only learn skill x at university is not true, you apparently learn more form industry than university. Most exceptional colleagues they have worked with don’t even have a degree.

· It is difficult to transfer to other industries or careers unless you learn the appropriate skills. Both parents said most the friends they know that went to finance or other industries had to go back to university or start at the bottom.

· No one appreciates the sanctifies you make. Although this is true for many, for example in the news you hear about hero doctors and nurses fighting coronavirus but the researcher who spends time developing the lifesaving drugs is forgotten. The shop workers will be in a high risk category but they too will be ignored.

· Document control and communication are the biggest part in engineering. Apparently on some projects you can have thousands of drawings and hundred documents to write and review. Design, maths and problem solving is only a small part of being an engineer. For example if you do design a new product you need to capture a lot of data and write up everything you do from technical notes to operation and maintenance manuals.

· Management will get you to make difficult decision. Mum said in first year of work the production manager would make her make decisions on stopping production at site that was turning over millions. This was unfair but happens a lot.

Are these true? I feel they have been very negative. They might have just had a few bad experiences. Both my parents say the friends and colleagues they know who stated work as engineers have all left apart from two. This is the part that makes me most nervous.

So far they have recommended I take some time form studies and actually get a job or start an apprenticeship.  They said I really should only consider university if I want to go into medicine or dentistry. I should also be cautions of any careers that say there is shortage of, I really need to ask the reasons why there is a shortage.",AskEngineers,False,James00100,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g7iegh/my_parents_dont_want_me_to_study_engineering_at/
29,Switching from engineering position to a technician?,1587765575,"I have been working in a mechanical engineering position for the last three years and it is starting to absolutely wear me down now. The job itself is with a tech company and the work is mostly design with a lot of testing and reporting related to the implementation of these designs. The work culture is incredibly competitive and ridiculously fast paced, I was able keep up in the beginning but just don't have the stamina anymore. 

I have started looking for other work recently and have started talks with a local automation company about a technician position. The job seems really interesting but certainly a step down from what I am doing now in terms of responsibility and impact of work. I think the reduction of responsibility is something that I would enjoy for a short period of time as a break but I am concerned it would limit my potential for future career opportunities. I think I would like to get back into design work eventually, just with a different company.

Has anyone ever had similar experience of stepping down in there career for a bit and to not have it limit there future growth?

This is not the first time this thing happens to ,it happens to me all the time and i just dont know what to do about it .And with an engineering major , i am pretty sure by now that studying for more time doesn't mean you will do well in the exam because every problem is different than the other.Sometimes i say that i am not smart enough ,and as time go on i am getting pretty sure of that ,but its to late for me to swich majors and TBH i dont have a major in mind i want to swich to ..
I am just really sick of all of this ,i am sick of putting so much effort and getting nothing in return .

55,Early-career legal involvement and professional implications,1587724181,"TL;DR OP wonders if he is setting himself up for problems down the road professionally, from a legal perspective, and how to best disentangle himself from an odd situation.

Background: I am a mechanical engineer, early in my career (3 years in). I work for a very small company that imports and distributes power tools and other equipment in the United States. Those power tools include miter saws. A while back, a user purchased a saw we sold and subsequently hurt himself, alleging a blade guard defect. That turned into a legal case that is now moving towards trial.  

It is important to note that (1) this miter saw was certified by the CSA group, (2) to the best of my knowledge, my company had no input as to the actual mechanical design of this saw.

My company, of course, has insurance for this sort of thing. The insurance company hired a legal firm to represent themselves in court. Those lawyers been contacting me throughout the process. Two years ago, I met with said lawyers to go over the allegedly defective saw with them, as well as a nationally-recognized engineering expert on this sort of thing. My role in this was limited to explaining to the lawyers how miter saws worked, the various labeling and other design elements on the saw designed to mitigate or prevent injuries, etc., whereas the expert was the one responsible for determining a state of defect or tampering.  

My impression of these lawyers is that they are first and foremost lawyers, and do not have an engineering or design background whatsoever. Again, they are representing the insurance company, not necessarily my company (which is insured by said insurance company).

The reason this was done two years ago (and I, as a kid barely a year out of college, was sent to do this) was that I was one of two engineers at the company at the time, the other of whom is based overseas and does not speak English.

Two years later (i.e. now), the case is proceeding towards trial. Currently, my company sells a line of miter saws that no longer includes the saw model in question, as below.  

&amp;#x200B;

* Model 1 ---- 	manufacturer A ---- discontinued
* Model 2 ---- 	manufacturer A ---- discontinued, allegedly defective model
* Model 3 ---- 	manufacturer B ---- discontinued, but replaced Model 1
* Model 4 ---- 	manufacturer C ---- active
* Model 5 ---- 	manufacturer D ---- active
* Model 6 ---- 	manufacturer E ---- active  
 

All models are sold under the same brand. All are certified by regulatory authorities (UL, CSA, or ETL), but excepting models 1 and 2, all were/are designed and made by different manufacturers.

My understanding is that currently, the lawyers are basically wanting me to sign an affidavit stating that “as an engineer, I believe that models 1, 2, and 3 are the only ones substantially similar enough to each other so as to limit the scope of discovery to these 3 models”; discovery being each party’s obtainment of documentation or other evidence from the other party, to my understanding.  

Here’s the kicker, if you’ve taken the time to read this far (thank you!): many miter saws, in particular, are so similar in design to one another, regarding the blade guard mechanism, that it seems that to sign such an affidavit would be misleading. Of course, there are many other design differences, feature differences, etc. (not to mention the fact that these were made by completely different manufacturers) with models 4, 5, and 6, but not necessarily in the blade guard mechanism, which is (to my understanding) very similar across most manufacturers and brands across the world.

Obviously I’ll do whatever is ethically and morally right, but overall, I wonder if this has potential implications for my future career as an engineer.  Some more salient points:  

&amp;#x200B;

* I want to disentangle myself from this situation, and being so early in my 	career, do not feel qualified to be making those kinds of judgment 	calls, and (admittedly selfishly, perhaps) have no desire to see this create headaches for me down the road.  	
* I have no direct engineering superiors at this company (like I said, it’s 	very small), and so am not sure who to turn to regarding my situation. My direct boss is on the business side of things and has 	been trying to not get involved in this case as much as possible. Our COO, who is very experienced (60’s), has been handling things primarily.  	  
 

Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? If so, what did you do?

I want to build a long, L-shaped desk for my office [(see diagram)](https://imgur.com/a/C8wnzGK). I am considering the following design: First bolting angle iron to the wall studs (16” apart) around the 4 wall edges to make a little shelf and then building two tube steel rectangles (with crossbeams) to set on top of the angle iron. Bolt the two rectangles together. Lastly, I plan to top it off with plywood (or similar).

On one part of the desk I want to set up my computer workstation, as well as have books along the wall, and above it build a set of pipe shelves (also for books) that have legs that attach to the wooden desktop for support. 

I want to be sure the weight of my books, computer stuff, etc. is well under what that portion of the desk can handle. 
The second part of the desk is just for drawing and lightweight art projects, so no real weight issues should occur, just the sag issues need to be addressed. Or so I think. Tell me how I'm wrong...

1.	Use metal for part/most of the structural portion of the build
2.	Not use legs at all
3.	Avoid brackets if possible
4.	Avoid desktop sag

I would complete the requirements for the CE degree at the end of my fourth year and for the physics degree at the end of my fifth.

85,Robotics industry in Europe,1587683890,"Reposting post I made in r/mechanicalengineering that I was told to post in here

Hello all,

I am currently a 24 year old ME working for a military contractor in the US. I graduated from university last year. I would like to at some point switch to the robotics industry before I get pigeonholed into an industry and it becomes harder to switch. I worked as intern at a robotics company while I was looking for a full time job and enjoyed it and some of my technical electives were focused in robotics. The problem I have is that a lot of robotics companies in the US are startups and as such they tend to have less than ideal work life balances and a lot of people end up working way more than 40 hours (this was indeed the case at the robotics company I interned at). I have been wondering if it may be a better idea to try to move to Europe and get a robotics job there as they have a much better work life balance than the US on average.

If any of you are from European countries, what are current job prospects for people searching for jobs in the robotics industry? Would someone coming from the US need to do a masters in Europe before having a decent chance at getting a job in a European country? The school I went to has a top 25 ranked ME program and I received good grades when I was there along with doing undergraduate research so I don't think getting into the universities would be super challenging. I also am lucky enough to have a decent sized college fund with still enough left over to cover a couple years of grad school so I don't really need to worry about finances either. The specific countries I have been looking at are The Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and maybe Spain (as Spanish is the only other language I know). If this post is better suited for r/iwantout or r/engineering I could just cross post it there.

Lastly I feel I should mention that I have spent some time on r/iwantout and other expat forums and know the difficulties of moving to another country and am aware of how complicated and hard the process can be.

A Google search would yield many results about each CEO's behaviors and stories about how they would rage on their direct reports whenever something went wrong. But what I've read is that despite the churn of people under them, they eventually were able to settle on a core team of lieutenants who were able to dedicate themselves the the mission of the company as well as tolerate the abuse.

87,A question on evaluating simulations before physical implementation: a Kalman Filter problem,1587680421,"Hope this question is appropriate for this subreddit.

I'm designing a kalman filter for a radar lacalization problem, and I have my kalman library working with the accelerated math libraries for my target MCU.

I'm thinking about generating a trajectory of the ordinance in Python, and using that trajectory I'll add noise to each measurement. Then with python I'll generate a C syntax array for each measurement over the total time.

Final goal: after enough iterations through the filter, the trajectory is kindve smoothed out, then I'll project it through time so that I can actuate a camera servo system to take a picture at the point in time where I think my cameras angle intersects the object traveling in space.

So, before we have the physical hardware put together for testing, I'd like to make simulations and figure out the best initialized matrices to use (Process noise cov, state cov, and **measurement covariance**).

Honestly I have no good idea how to model the measurement covariance before I have the system built.

All things considered, I'd like to get good simulations before then. So, what would be a way of ranking a simulation as good or bad? The final estimations distance to the real trajectory? Or maybe a sort of average distance off my estimation is over the time spanned by the trajectory measured - real trajectory (the residual).

i've mostly been following the guide [here (scroll down to the unequal level calculations)](http://www.electricalunits.com/sag-calculation-overhead-line/). 

For convenience, here's the [figure](https://imgur.com/xWTypU9) from the site and the [equations](https://imgur.com/dar4TXr)

For my situation here are the parameters:

* Horizontal Span Length of Wire: 40'
* Height of Service Drop: 35'
* Height of Service Drop Attachment Point: 18' (however this is the variable I tweak to get a desired clearance)
* Desired Clearance from grade: 16'
* Tension: 450 lbs (Heavy Loading Tension) provided by our internal tables for 1/0 triplex cable with a span of 40'
* Weight per unit length of the conductor: this is where I guess a bit. The service drop is 1/0 aluminum triplex cable. After searching I just input from [here](https://www.wireandcableyourway.com/1-0-1-0-1-0-nerlina-acsr-aluminum-triplex-overhead-service-drop-cable.html), and use 0.42 lb/ft, however that seems quite light.
* Sag of 1/0 triplex alum cable span of 40' on 90 degree F day: 10"" (I'm designing for this scenario).

Going back to the guide, we need to find the lowest point along the x-axis:

* x1 = L/2 - Th/wL
* L = 40'
* T = 450 lbs
* h =35'-18' = 17'
* w = 0.42 lb/ft

Inputting my values: 40/2 - (450*17/0.42/40) = -435.4

And that's as far as I get. What on earth can I do with this number?? It should be positive and represent a number less than 20'. 

I can only assume my tension value or the cable weight value is off. No clue how to mitigate this.

Once I get the x value, I will then input it into the S1 equation from the guide linked, calculate S1, then subtract the sag value of 10"" from S1 to get my final sag value.

7,Biomechanical engineer looking to change fields,1587664527,"I have an MS ME with a Biomechanics specialization that I earned in 2012. I've been working in a motion capture/gait lab at a major University since then as a researcher running data collections, post-processing the data with niche 3D modeling biomechanics software no one's ever heard of, and analyzing the data with MATLAB/Excel.

For some quick background, I loved studying MechE during the first few years, but quickly grew to loathe the career options available in my location after a few internships (mainly HVAC/construction and power). I just have no interest in these fields and am much more interested in things like mechatronics/programming. In hindsight I probably should have majored in EE/CS, but at the time, the thought of changing majors was too daunting. I discovered the biomechanics subdiscipline in my senior year of undergrad and got involved in research. I really enjoyed it and decided to continue through to get my MS, thinking it was a way to ""escape"" having to work in the traditional ME field that I had grown to dislike.

It was, but now I'm stuck in an extremely niche position with limited opportunity for career progression without becoming a professor, which I'm not particularly interested in doing, or moving across the country chasing the small handful of positions available in this field. When I started this position, I was very happy with it. The starting pay was (extremely) low since it is an academic position and not technically an engineering job, but I've had some raises over the years. Despite that, I'm still making barely what an entry level engineer would make, and I just simply need to make more money.

I'm also very reluctant to move, which I know is very limiting to my career, but it's something I'm simply not willing to do as my entire family lives where I am, I am about to get engaged, and I'm in a large enough major metro area that jobs should be plentiful enough for me to find work if I just weren't so hyper-specialized. With the added uncertainty of COVID now, I'm also more concerned than ever about not having a wide enough skillset to find employment elsewhere should I ever be laid off.

So all that being said, I am pretty set on making a change. I'm mainly interested in picking a new area of career focus that uses as much of my current experience as possible while also addressing the issues of having more widespread positions available and offering better pay rather than a complete departure into a totally unrelated field. To me, the best choices seem like Data Science or something more along the lines of Robotics/Automation. Data science seems like it would be a good synergy of a lot of my various skillsets - I've already been doing data analysis at a more amateur level for my current position for several years in an academic setting and am pretty proficient with MATLAB, so transitioning to some of the DS software doesn't seem like it would be too hard (I've already been taking some online courses for Python and SQL and am enjoying them). There's also a very large, very well known healthcare IT company in my area that has been posting lots of Data Science positions lately.

On the other hand, something in the realm of Robotics/Automation would still definitely be within the ME realm, which could give me an advantage, since so many people seem interested in DS right now, and I'm sure I'd be at somewhat of a disadvantage to CS majors. There aren't a lot of Robotics/Automation jobs in my area but the field is very interesting to me. I really excelled at dynamics/mechanics and it'd be a shame to give that up entirely if I moved into a pure analytics position. However I don't want to end up in yet another niche field.

11,Why are fire extinguishers always an elongated cylinder ideal for use as a weapon?,1587660559,"I was thinking about the fact that fire extinguishers make good weapons today and I suddenly noticed it's weird. For some reason I had this instinct that it's not normal or natural for fire extinguishers to be such good weapons, like even though it seems coincidental this instinct told me it's too weird of a coincidence. So I decided to analyze the design factors that make it such a good weapon:

* The **basic strength** is necessary for pressure containment. 
* The **weight** is necessary for pressure containment. 
* The **blunted end** is necessary to make the fire extinguisher wieldy in its intended use, easy to set down and pick up, and serves this purpose in weaponized use as well as providing a better bludgeon. 
* The **handle*"" is also necessary to make the fire extinguisher wieldy in its intended use and also serves its original purpose in weaponized use.

All these factors are obvious, and I wondered why I was even bothering to put so much thought into it. Once I had these design factors laid out, I was like, ""ok, so far we have the same thing as a propane tank or helium tank or basically just the standard design in general for a portable pressurized tank, yet none of those are known for being very usable weapons and all of those are usually shaped in a less bludgeony way - the design factor that sets the fire extinguisher apart on this is the **elongated cylinder** which for some reason absolutely every fire extinguisher I've seen has while most similar pressurized containers have more even proportions.

The possibilities I can think of:

* Maybe it's to avoid spraying itself since those other pressurized containers like propane or helium aren't used to spray things out of them. However, a fire extinguisher spraying itself a little bit wouldn't really matter apart from wastage, and accuracy to avoid wastage is usually brought by a little hose, which is usually long enough to clear a wide cylinder anyway. Seems unlikely for this to be the reason behind that design factor.
* Maybe it's just part of being wieldy, easier to carry this way and a bit higher to pick up off the floor, but the difference is relatively insignificant. Seems unlikely that this design factor would be so universal to virtually all fire extinguishers if the reason was so barely existent.
* Maybe it's actually meant to be a good bludgeon for some reason I'm not seeing, like maybe there's some dangerous first responder use of fire extinguishers that I'm not familiar with. Still seems unlikely. 
* Maybe it is meant to be a good bludgeon, not for some difficult-to-imagine fight situation against people, but for use against inanimate objects such as a door you need to get through or a burning piece of furniture you need to break off the main structure before it spreads. This also seems unlikely as all the safety warnings on fire extinguishers make it seem like they're not designed to be put through any stress, much less used as a battering ram to get you through a door, but on the other hand they are built stronger than it seems like they should need to be and I would have to bet they *can* handle the stress better than other objects you might have around you, so, still a solid maybe.

That last option is the best conclusion I can reach, but it's still pretty weak. So, does anyone here have the actual sure answer? Has anyone worked on fire extinguishers? Am I right that the reason they're a better bludgeon than other standard pressurized tanks is because they're meant to be a bludgeon for fire uses like door-opening?",AskEngineers,False,bojogocoro,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g6q5m5/why_are_fire_extinguishers_always_an_elongated/

18,How to remove a heavy chunk of concrete? (Preferably with no bulldozers),1587656884,"Before my post is like to say that I'm very sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this and I'd appreciate if someone would direct me to the right one. If this is the right sub and some kind fella would enlighten me with a way that would work id be very grateful since I'm racking my brain on it for some month and I'm starting to think I hit a dead end.

Pictures:

So about 20m from our house there is an old cistern, about 5m in depth (I don't know exactly how big it is from the inside because the rock is blocking my sight but it is pretty big). Its entrance is from above (kind of a hole), but it is covered with a big heavy  concrete chunk that I estimate weighs about 1.5 tons. In order to enter the cistern and make it a comfortable chill-out place, I have  to remove the concrete-rock that is keeping people from falling down there, and to replace it with an openable grid.

 I think replacing the 'cap' with a metal grid is the easy part but I'm having trouble figuring how to remove the concrete chunk from the top.  Till now I had couple of ideas but they all have their flaws.

The first is bringing a big bulldozer that would lift it up but it's a bit complected to get there and quite expensive. A bobcat tried to remove it a couple of years ago, but with no success. The second idea is tying the rock to a powerful jeep that would try to drag/slide it a few meters but I doubt it would do the job. The third and the one  I'm tempted to go with, is trying to break it with a jackhammer. Only problems are the pieces will drop into the cave and It's not very safe. There is another option which I highly doubt will work, maybe sticking a wood beam under it and then using counter weight to lift it a couple of centimeters from the ground.

My question is how will it be best to remove the rock safely, while keep it inexpensive (I do have access to some heavy tools for free)?

19,"Would I be better off with an integrated Masters, or a Bachelors + more specific Masters?",1587656137,"I'm a 2nd year Aerospace undergraduate in the UK, and needed some guidance on my best course of action for a Masters. For some context, I weighed up doing Aerospace/Materials before University. I ended up choosing Aerospace with the end-goal of going into Aerospace Materials, or something along those lines (Material related).

&amp;#x200B;

Due to this, I have selected the Aeromechanics module stream, which specialises in Materials modules, fracture mechanics, processing etc. My only issue now is that although I may still want to go into the Aerospace industry, many other industries such as Automotive and Transport also appeal.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my issue arises; If I continue with my current degree (an MEng in Aerospace), I will graduate with that as a degree title (no mention of Materials etc). In light of this, I've now considered switching to a BEng in Aerospace, and then completing a 1-year MSc/MEng in Materials, in an attempt to broaden my opportunities (if it even would). Both methods would share 4th year Modules (the part which is the 'Masters') but there are some differences.

&amp;#x200B;

My overall question then would be that given my situation, which is likely to be more desirable from an industry perspective? Would a prospective employer be more likely to look past my application to a materials role in favour of someone with a degree in strictly Materials, or would both be equally suitable? Part of me feels (maybe wrongly so, let me know!) that if I applied to say an Automotive company for a materials role and they were to see Aerospace, it may not be as beneficial as Materials. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware that it would be different for all employers and so I am not asking for a definite answer, but wanted to know others opinions on which would be best based on experience.

After about 6 months, we had the plant manager quit and I took the position in the interim and eventually took the position permanently. I’ve been in this position for almost 2 years. I make base about 85k, but only a small profit sharing bonus, so 90k total compensation and 3 weeks annual vacation and 5 personal days.

I’m ASQ CSSBB and CSWE. I have experience with solidworks. I have extensive VBA experience. I can program PLC’s, I have project management skills.

I'm working on a theoretical low compression ratio piston engine and I've gotten to the point in my modeling/calculations where I need to develop a Pressure diagram. The usual method to find the peak pressure during isentropic constant volume or pressure combustion isn't enough, the diagram should be similar to the real deal like this [graph](https://postimg.cc/K4w1mvLH)

Maybe you could suggest some ways to revers engineer the combustion process?

For clarity: I'ts an spark ignition engine, the motored pressure and change in volume in the cylinder is known. So basically now i need to put some fuel in to the cylinder and see what happens. So far I've come up with the idea, that I should determine the moment of combustion start and finish Then somehow distribute the released heat from the combustion during this period so that the pressure gradually rises and falls back down again. But how to do it is still a mystery to me.

The graph should give a theoretical indication on how combustion occurs. This will help find the generated work the engine produces and the forces in the mechanism etc.

51,Double box fan air filter- would the fans help or hurt eachother's efforts?,1587603826,"https://imgur.com/a/2BdzQdr Here's a cute little diagram, in case I describe it poorly. 
TL:DR do the two fans combine efforts, or interfere with eachother; is having one vs. two 'intake' walls a solution in itself?

I am going to build a simple air cleaner (filter) for my woodshop. my proposed design uses two box fans, coarse and fine air filters, and a wooden housing; the fans would blow outwards in opposite directions of eachother, with the intake being the adjacent perpendicular side of the box (one or both of the sides, or maybe the bottom- if this is crucial then lets say one single side). Would the fans, facing opposite eachother, combine their efforts into more negative pressure, AKA super-suck, drawing in more air and therefore dust? Or would the two fans interfere with eachother and lower the net effect?

as noted above, I suppose I lean towards one single 'intake' side, but I wonder if opening two sides would relieve any interference the two fans have (if they are interfering at all.) I'm open to suggestions, as I can picture the form factor working in a variety of configurations.

52,"I bought an adjustable boom arm but the end doesn't move as freely in 3 degrees of motion (x,y,z) as I want. Is there a better version/configuration for my purposes that moves more smoothly and freely?",1587600389,"So the goal is to track movement in x,y,z and I had the idea of measuring the angles in a [boom arm](https://www.google.com/search?q=boom+arm) and working it out from there. 

I asked this subreddit if this would be possible and got a lot of great feedback.  Definitely possible.

So far, I haven't bought the rotary encoders/potentiometers and so forth but I did go out and buy this style of adjustable boom:

https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Suspension-Adjustable-Constructed-Professional/dp/B07TG9RWST

(not exactly that model)

I tried it.  The thing is, although it ""works"" in that I can put the end where I want, it's not always a straightforward gentle push to where I want it - sometimes due to the degrees of freedom involved, you kind of have to pretty actively push it to where you want it to go. (Even when in other parts of its motion it moves smoothly.  In certain parts it also kind of pushes you along a certain path.)

I would like to ask now if there is an alternative, different configuration of arm segments or even multiple arms, that would allow the end to be moved very easily in the x, y, z directions, without feeling any special ""resistance"" as that is done, or feeling like the arm is pushing you toward a certain path.  If so what is that configuration?  Basically I want the user not to even have to think of the fact that the arm is there, because they can just move the end without thinking about or feeling the movement of the segments.  Is this possible?

To be fair it does seem like this arm I got can already eventually get to anywhere I want to push it.  But it is sometimes just not as smooth as I want so for this reason I want to consider alternative arrangements.

What configuration works best? (smoothest ability to push in any x,y,z direction.)

66,[X-POST] Refrigerator has multiple dents in the sides. Dealer claims its due to manufacturing and every black fridge has them. Is this true?,1587589607,"Cross posting here out of pure curiosity on your opinions of this physically.

TL; DR: Fridge has dents on both sides. Dealer claims it's due to how they manufacture them. Finding that hard to believe.

Photos: [https://imgur.com/a/Hg6v55M](https://imgur.com/a/Hg6v55M)

So we bought some appliances as we renovate a house and just had them delivered and set near the kitchen. Now that we are done with flooring we moved them closer to their places. Upon doing so we noticed multiple dents in the dishwasher tub. We also noticed dings in the side of the fridge. These are Whirlpool fyi.

We bought them from a local dealer and called. They ordered a new tub and got it replaced. Great.

But with the fridge they said the sides cannot be repaired. Ok I understand so we would like some sort of partial refund, because if we wanted scratch and dent, thats what we would have bought.

They stopped responding so I followed up, and a rep called me and said that it is ""waves caused during the manufacturing process when they inject the expanding foam insulation, you'll find them on all black Whirpool fridges"". I told them they look like specific local dents, and the tech that was out said so as well. Dealer response: ""Nope they are waves caused during manufacturing, we can show you the ones on the showroom floor as well"".

I have a background in engineering to an extent, so I wanted to think through how that could happen. I have no knowledge of fridge manufacturing so I don't want to go back and argue this further yet. Based on videos I watched, I believe the fridge sides are assembled and then foam insulation is injected. Maybe uneven distribution would cause the thin steel sides to ""pop and wave""? I get that physically, but also think a company like Whirlpool would sort that out in their manufacturing process if it was a thing.

I contacted general Whirlpool customer service and the rep hadn't heard of it before. But unless they work directly in manufacturing I don't want to go back and put words in their mouth.

At the end of the day, I am guessing the dealer will insist this is the case and since we didn't inspect sooner we are SOL, but more-so out of curiosity what do you think? ~~Are we being too picky here?~~ It's more-so about good customer service at this point than the actual partial refund, but also I am intrigued by understanding things I don't know rather than taking them for face value. Would have been good to know if that's a common issue with these fridges before we bought it.

72,Engine engineering better fuel economy,1587585751,"Why do manufacturers not change how the engine delivers power to nudge the driver to staying at lower rpms? 

Correct me if I'm wrong but an engine is just an air pump. 

If an engine produces 300 ft. lbs torque it doesn't matter how many cylinders it has as to produce said torque it is the same amount of air/fuel being used. But can change when the power comes based on the camshaft profile. 

But manufacturers are all going to smaller engines with boost (from supercharger, turbo chargers or both in the case of Volvo); is this just to save the weight of the larger engine? 

Example: 

My last car did not have full torque delivery until 2400 rpm (spec sheet) which meant I spent most of my time when accelerating between 2400-4200 rpm. My current vehicle has full torque delivery at 1300 rpm (spec sheet) and I spend most of my accelerating between 1300-2800 rpm. 

Old vehicle had 172 ft lbs torque new vehicle has 274 ft lbs torque. 

New vehicle = 60% more power

Our approach is to find out which heating output the battery provides while fast charging (worst case). So, we can estimate how much heating power is required to get as close as possible to the real behaviour. Therefore, we must lay out a suitable heating system, which provides the required power. Also, we were told to stay under 60 V because of safety reasons.

At first, we thought of implementing heating elements or plates as they are installed in 3D-printers. But we are really concerned (no EE students) that 60 V will be enough for our model. So probably there is a way smarter way than running heating plates. Maybe even heating up water is an option...

There are two points I want to clarify:

* U.S Citizen 
* B.S in Chemical Engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to describe my industry/role and a quick one liner about my role:

After graduating I immediately joined a large oil and gas company and was my role was QA:

* I was responsible for ensuring that the product we made fit client's needs and met quality standards  

   * This  means ensuring the equipment running the process (kettles, pumps,  compressors) were operating correctly - if not I worked with a team of  engineers to perform RCA
* In  general I already had a lot of knowledge about Oil, Gas, Chemical  Industries - but working here has further developed my understanding of  those industries.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, I joined a large consulting company - where I was a Business Analyst.

* I  worked with several large pharmaceutical companies as a technology  consultant - so I worked with with developers (from the largest  scientific application companies) to ensure that software that being  built for these pharma companies met their requirements, standards,  processes.
* I  worked with industry experts in Quantum Computing from IBM to help and  assist with drug discovery process - my job was to ensure that  application being built had the requirements/specifications from the IBM  experts as well as the pharmaceutical experts - to ensure that the  software would successfully models potential drugs for the drug  discovery process.  (The software that ended up building reduced drug  discovery process by almost 5 years and saved the company millions of  dollars for future process.
* Working here has really grown/strengthened my understanding of the pharmaceutical industry

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, I joined a large telecommunication company as a BA as well:

* This  is where I work now, I work with developers, industry leadership on  developing new applications to improve current processes
* Almost PM work - I manage several development teams and dozen+ development projects in my short time here so far
* I  didn't have any knowledge of the telecommunication industry , but in  only several months have picked up a pretty solid understanding and  depth of this industry

&amp;#x200B;

But  honestly, I have always had that desire for the defense industry  (aerospace / space) as much as I loved all the industries that I worked  in - I realize that my true passion and desire to the  space/aerospace/defense industry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I  don't have prior defense experience as you can see. I want to know  where I stand in transitioning the to the defense industry (Boeing,  Honeywell, Northrop Grumman etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again  I didn't have any prior knowledge or understanding  of the  pharmaceutical or telecommunication industry  - but I picked them quiet  well and have a very solid understanding. I hope that shows that it's  the exact same for the defense industry - I can pick up new things  quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

My sckil:

* PMP  - don't have the certification but job roles and studying for the exam  have given me knowledge and allowed me to succeed in the environment.
* Scrum
* Agile
* Green Belt

More information: My 7 years experience has been dealing with pumps, compressors, piping, pressure vessels, and storage tanks. I've worked on both the owner and engineering firm side of the business and have my Mech P.E. Current Salary $130K.

Some questions:  
\- What can I be doing now to improve my skills? I have some AutoCAD experience and just downloaded Revit 2020 to practice on projects at home.  
\- If you were to hire someone like me, what salary expectations should I have? Glassdoor shows a new graduate in my city might get paid $60-65K.

91,Electric trains and trams - how is the circuit completed from catenary/3rd rail to motor? Through a running rail?,1587573105,"Hi

One thing I've actually only puzzled over during the last few years is how the circuit for an electric train or tram is completed. Most overhead catenary lines are a single contact cable which I assume is the positive part of the circuit, as are the 3rd power rail on third rail systems. One thing that I wondered about is where the circuit completes or grounds itself - is it one or both of the running rails that the train or tram is running its wheels on?

If so, **One thing I am wondering about is trams in the cities**. If a person were to walk around barefoot and step on a tramway's rail while crossing in front of or behind a tram, would they come into contact with a complete circuit and electrocute themselves? Here in the UK, trams run at 750V DC as well as trains using the third rail system. Overhead lines run mostly at 25KV AC here.

The tram thing is what I'm most interested in. 

Also, after looking at the Siemens eHighway system, I see they have a pair of catenaries - I assume one is positive and the other is neutral, since you can't realistically build rails into a busy road and easily have electric lorries line up accurately when connecting to the system. This made me question the safety of the rails in tramways more as it is so easy to step over them.

It seems like a good opportunity- my reasoning is that they will pay for additional IT certifications, it pays well for my area (23/hr + 4/hr fringe), and it seems like there's a good chance for promotion if I perform well. I'm waiting on my clearance and partly accepted this role because they seemed like they really wanted to hire me. I looked at their ""engineering"" roles in my area and they all call for a bachelors degree and at least 2 years of relevant experience. Some of these roles are engineering for AD architecture and some of them are for systems engineering which really interests me.

Company B : I interviewed with before the pandemic. It's an electrical contractor that does ""design/build"" work for food processing facilities, hospitals, casinos, you name it. I had an internship with this company for 2 summers. In this role my primary responsibilities would start out with electrical design. The interview went really well and I think it's very likely that they will extend an offer to me, but at this point I am more interested in staying with company A. I think this company will offer money than company A, but it just doesn't really interest me. I hate Autocad and working on food processing plants is super boring. The only thing I liked about this place is the people I worked with.

My thought process is to stick with company A and work my ass off. Maybe I can move up the ladder and learn some skills along the way. In the meantime I can apply for other jobs that come along if I am more interested. However I might also be able to negotiate my starting salary with company B.

Since then, I've held a variety of positions, but all of them lack an engineer title and engineering work.  In some, I contributed to projects or owned a system, but I never worked under a PE for the required amount of years, of have a project completed that I own.

This blooms well into the concern that I have about career path.  My friend in chemical warned me that I should've only taken jobs with ""engineer"" in the title, because once you take anything else, it's hard to get back into engineering.  I guess she received solid advice from her parents (engineers in academia and government)

The other possibility would be to do a internal shift.  I currently hold an administrative role, but I am involved in engineers' projects.  It'd be a hard sell to assume an engineer title and get a 25% raise though.

33,Large defense contractor or smaller flight sim manufacturer,1587516254,"

Hi everyone. I’m about to graduate with a bachelors in aerospace engineering and I have a couple offers to decide between. I have an offer from a large defense contractor where I previously interned with, where I would be working with the systems engineering department. I don’t particularly want to do systems, as I’m more interested in flight dynamics. The other offer is from a small (about 2000 total employees in multiple states) that designs and manufactures flight simulators for mostly commercial aircraft. This is more in line with what I would like to do. My ideal end goal is to be doing flight dynamics and analysis for military fighter and bomber aircraft. 

Would stating my career at a smaller company hinder me eventually joining a defense contractor later in my career? I’ve heard (possibly incorrectly) that it’s easier to start at a large company and eventually join a smaller company later in your career than vice versa. Can people who’ve experienced both sides weigh in?

Edit: I didn’t really like my internship at the defense contractor. Even as an intern I felt bogged down by all the red tape and felt how slow everything moved. That’s one reason I’m leaning toward the smaller company, but I’m worried about upward mobility.

34,How do you overcome long term impostor syndrome?,1587514909," 

A little background, I graduated mechanical engineering undergrad with a 3.7 GPA, and while I felt competent in school, I always felt like I was much better at test taking than I was at actual engineering. I’ve been a mechanical engineer now for almost 7 years at the same company doing electronics packaging and have had a love/hate relationship with my job since the onset. There has never been strong mentorship or training at our company so I’ve always felt like I was using previous designs as a crutch to figure out how to do things. I’ve generally performed my best when I’ve had a good example to work from and have felt most insecure when I need to venture off into uncharted territory. I’ve gotten really good feedback from my peers for the entire time I’ve been at the job, so I know I must be doing something right. However, in the back of my mind, I’ve always felt like I have been leaning on the engineering abilities of others, and I was just fairly good at  executing the last 25% of the design. All that’s to say, I’m now faced with the biggest project I’ve ever encountered which is more of an aerospace system integration than an electronics packaging job, and I feel like I am so under-qualified and actually a worse engineer than when I started back in the day that I am frozen in my tracks and can’t seem to gather the energy or the courage to execute on this new design. I am literally so overwhelmed that I haven’t been doing anything for the past couple of weeks, and with the onset of this whole COVID crisis, it’s really seemed to have gone unnoticed. Not to mention, the program manager and my direct supervisor don’t seem to have a clue what I do, and they have blind faith in me that I am going to knock this project out of the park. I’ve tried to ask for help, but the only way it is usually presented to me is as resources for me to delegate work to, which doesn’t seem helpful when I don’t really know what I am supposed to be doing in the first place. At any rate, these past couple of weeks have sent me spiraling into an anxiety and depression hole where I keep ruminating and telling myself that I am an awful engineer and that I am completely and utterly screwed for this project and I am destined to get fired from all the lack of work I have been producing. The anxiety has led to an inability to focus which only decreases motivation to work and makes accomplishing tasks astronomically harder. Now I feel like I am so deep in this rut that I will be stuck in it until I get fired. I know that’s not true, and I can work through this, but it does feel like that at times. Not sure what I am asking for here, I suppose I just wanted to vent and see if anyone out there can relate. I am seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist to help with the anxiety and depression, which I have had to battle with  in the past, but I can’t seem to pull my head out of my ass this time around.

TLDR: New project has me overly anxious and critical of myself. The resulting anxiety has sent me into a depression hole that makes it impossible to do remedial tasks, and makes it feel like I’m doomed to get fired.

I'm a 30 yr old power systems engineer (with P.Eng) with 5 1/2 yrs of experience in the industry. I mostly did substation design for rural power substations and wind farms. I have quite alot of experience with ETAP and AutoCAD but nothing much else. I studied C programming and have worked with software like Matlab. But I have forgotten all that since this was almost 6 years ago. 

I'm hating my current job and I don't see much promise in my current career choice (boring and too many procedures). I did research during job hunting and found very few postings and the salary was not that good. Heck I only got my current job thanks to contacts.

Recently one of them got a job in San Francisco with ease while I got a job at a power plant that required me to ditch the city and move to middle-o'-nowheres-ville. I live in Canada so the winters are harsh and the Springs and Falls are depressing. So I'm looking into jumping to software development and computer science. 

My plan is to completely quit my job and register for a program at a college or university. I just want to know if this is a good idea or if there are better way to go about. Now I have read elsewhere the best thing to do is to stick with the current job and do online courses part-time.

59,copper pipe (L) tension strength?,1587489315,"I'm researching the strength of copper pipe (L spec), but running into some barriers. For one, copper pipe is seldom used for anything other than plumbing or light-load DIY objects. For another, I don't have the background to understand the structural information that is available. I'm not even sure if tension strength is the right aspect to ask about!

Here is my project: A **photo set/prop.** A 10-foot/3m, 3/4 inch/19mm diameter copper pipe will be suspended, *vertically* from a ceiling joist. (I don't need help with the joist attachment, just the copper pipe, please.)

I plan to drill a 1/4 inch/6mm hole in the pipe, perpendicular,  to insert a **steel bolt to hang the pipe**. (Steel bow shackle) The hole will be about at least 1 inch (25mm) from the end. If needed, I can put 1 or 2 additional shackles in the top 10 inches/25 cm of pipe.

A model will pose with this pipe. My assumption is she can put some pressure on it (pull it a few degrees to the side) and it will support a minority of her weight. I won't have her climb it or support her entirely (110 lbs/50kg). This is for temporary use, with a professional model, in a controlled environment. 

**My questions are:**

1. how much downward force might this pipe hold? Could she take one foot off the floor and let the pipe support around 50 lbs/23 kg?
2. Will the point of failure likely be the hole where the shackle attaches?
3. In general, how could the location/quantity of shackles improve the design

I have done similar things with steel pipe but I want the look of copper.

Thank you for indulging me with posting this question and I hope someone has helpful insights or something I haven't thought of. I can do this whole thing for about $35 US. I'm probably not interested in expensive solutions like anodized aluminum instead of copper.

60,How to decouple a rotational motor - mass system?,1587489100,"The natural frequency of a potato rotating about an axis that's offset from the CoG has a natural frequency of sqrt(m\*g\*d/J).

So I want to build this. I want to give it a low frequency and see that it follows that frequency. I want to give it its natural frequency and see it go crazy. Then I want to give it higher and higher frequencies till it's barely moving at all.

How do I do this? If I attach a motor to it directly, it'll always move with the same amplitude of the motor. If I put a torsional spring between the motor and the potato, then I suddenly have a new system, with a new natural frequency! (I think. Or do I now have two frequencies where the response amplifies - one from the spring and one from the pendulum?? My familiarity with bode plots is lacking here.)

Is there a way to build this without the building components influencing the system behaviour?

61,Should I take my 4th job 3 years from graduation?,1587487543,"Background: 

I (25M) graduated with BSAE in May 2017. From there I took the only job offer I got as a Electrical/Controls Engineer. I loved the work and the people, but got burnt out after 14 months bc of the 80+ hr weeks and never seeing friends/family/gf. 

Dying to get out of there, I took the first offer from
a medium size company in a big time defense contractor city in Aug 2018. I had the exact opposite problem here. I had 4-10 hrs of work a week (and begging for more), it was doing nothing for my career. There weren’t any internal moves I wanted to or could make, so after 5 months I left.

In Feb 2019 I interviewed and was hired to work on a cool and exciting IR&amp;D project for a small company. On my first day, out of the blue, they had me interview for a contract position. After the interview I explicitly told my manager “That isn’t what I want to do, I’d rather stay on the IR&amp;D project”, but I got the position and they moved me anyway with a promise to get back to the IR&amp;D project. 

Fast forward to now. I’ve been at that contract position for 13 months with 3 empty promises to get to projects that I actually want to be on. And I’ve realized now my company doesn’t do any of the type of work I want to do (didn’t do my research before switching). I feel like I‘m wasting my time and being forgotten. I broke down and talked to a couple older engineers at my current position (same contract, different company) and they told me they would move if they were me. So I started interviewing around and just got an offer from a very reputable company working on a super super cool project, in a position that I’m not in love with but I like and can transition into something I do love later.

So now I’m torn. I hate the idea of moving to my 4th company in 3 years, but I also really hate the idea of staying at a company that doesn’t care about me at a position that I don’t want to continue doing. I think Im okay, but it feels like it’s career suicide to move again and I somewhat dread it

74,Stay at university or cut short for technical leadership role,1587468865,"So I was wondering if I could even just get an insight into what those who have been through the ringer think. I am in my 3.5/5th year of a double degree with compsci, math and economics. I took an internship at a startup in my first year, and ever since I was sort of involved in some way or another. At one point I even took a little time of university to work for them full time after the CTO left. So i got forced to learn A LOT very quickly, and do pretty much all of the technical side the CTO managed whilst another person helped manage the business side of CTO responsibilities

This was certainly a great learning experience, but the responsibility was pretty intense for a young person and I felt I was a little locked in. This was pretty much all I had time for every day and spent all day doing it. AKA WL balance was not great, but thats generally the way startups go. On the other hand we made great progress and the team really liked me personally and my work. But it was too much at the time, so after about 9 months I quit and returned to university.

The company has offered me essentially a technology lead role (pretty much CTO without the title) if I come work full time from next semester. This would of course mean graduating early with one degree and one major, and singing up to 60-80 hour work weeks for the next two-three years. The company is well funded (raised last year) and growing quite aggressively so I could make a massive impact. It will also probably raise again, and even if it is mildly successful it will probably sell for a substantial amount.

The downsides are that I have no mentor, and even though I am pretty capable at just figuring stuff out I feel it is a little risky. The tech is also not in great shape. The CEO never prioritised it and due to a pivot there is a lot of not so good stuff going on. And even though they are enticing me with a leadership role, I see it as quite likely that if they raise again they will hire someone else with more experience and I will have quit university for no reason.

I guess what I am asking is:

1. This is the only company i have worked/interned for. How seriously should I consider other options knowing id take a 20-30% pay cut even at FAANG, and software engineers do the same work everywhere generally.
2. Is it worth having diversity in degrees and experiences? I can have 2 degrees and 3 majors with unknown (and probably terrible) job prospects when I graduate end 2021, or 1 degree and 1 major but a potentially lucrative opportunity to establish myself and also give up my a little bit of sanity and diversity. University is not overly expensive where I live, so thats not a major concern.
3. I want to do an MBA. Having good leadership experience at a fast growing company (could) look good.
4. Of course you'd need more info, but if you were in my situation, what would you be leaning towards.

75,dilemma about CAD design for injection molding,1587465093,"Hi all,

First time trying to get an injection molded part for my product and I have two dilemmas.

1) On one hand I don't want to waste money on CAD design for injection molding if the specific design mold will cost too much to justify using injection molding. On the other hand I can't estimate what the injection mold will cost without providing the firms a CAD design first. I tried providing photos instead of similar molded parts but the reps reasonably explained it was not enough to provide an estimate. What to do?

2) The molded parts are for a bluetooth speaker. I can get the inner part CAD designed since I already know where each electronical part goes and how it is attached to the case, but for the design of the outside part of the case there's also a dilemma. I want it to look good and provide our existing product sketches to the CAD designer, however if a specific design is good from a marketing point of view but x1.2x - x2+ more expensive from an injection molding standpoint then it's not a good idea, but I see no way to determine that without having the CAD designer design it and then send it to the injection molding firms to get a quote which risks us losing money on unusable CAD design and possibly several times.

I am looking to recommendation or at least confirmation of the books sound like a must-read for a complete RF engineer. While I know I will never need DSP, IC design and antenna design at the same time, I'd like to have somewhat of good knowledge on the many subfields of wireless communication.

I am doing my PhD and I want to use this as my moment to learn everything I can. I have used Razavi's books (RF microelectronics and Fundamentals of microelectronics).

I'd like to both read textbooks but have some practice (I can use AWR Microwave Office for some simulations).

As I am more close to RFIC design and now working on antennas I would like to tackle wireless systems, circuits, antennas and signal-processing.

2) RF microelectronics - Razavi
3) Antenna theory and design - Stutzman
4) Fundamentals of microelectronics - Razavi

As you can see here you have a more whole-system book from Pozar, a RFIC book from Razavi, an antenna book from Stutzman, an IC/electronics book from Razavi (to force me to keep the really basic stuff up). If you have any other suggestions on the given topics I'd be glad to hear.

92,What is the right way to measure and document physical resistance as a button is pushed,1587427441,"Hey Folks,

I'm getting into building home arcade machines, and am trying to narrow down what I think makes a good button. Wether I'm kicking in Mortal Combat, or firing a million times in galaga I want a great button. 

I hate some buttons, they are easy to push with no moment at which you receive tactile feedback indicating the button push has registered. Others have clear feedback, you know you've pushed it. 

I'm hoping to document the differences in a measured way, rather than using wishy-washy feeling words. I'm imagining being able to show a graph with the distanced traveled on the X axis, and resistance the button presented on the Y. I could then add a vertical line showing where the button push was registered.

# Question(s):

* Is there better language I should be using when describing the information I want to gather? (part of my problem could be that I don't know the right terminology to describe the data I want)
* What sort of equipment supports gathering this sort of information?

12,Anyone able to guide me in a personal project? Trying to put up a mirror over my bed to look around while on bed rest.,1587410271,"Warning: I don’t know what I’m doing


Hi, Engineers. I (22F) have been thinking of a project to make my life a little less boring and easier. I  need tolay in bed with my head flat (no pillow) because of a neck injury. I cant angle of tilt my head and Im not supposed to hold my arms up high/pick up my elbows. So, the issue is Im stuck looking up at the ceiling all the time. I can’t even see to text without a lot of strain (this is my second day typing this haha) I want to make it so I can see to text, watch a movie, or see what’s on my bedside table to my left. 

With all this time on my hands, it occurred to me that if I mounted a small adjustable-angle mirror facing  downward at me, then I might be able to look directly up into the mirror and see the notebook or laptop in my lap. I could even imagine some kind of pulls that I could use to manually adjust the angle of the mirror to allow me to see my bedside table. The closest thing I could find to this is mirrors that used to go above the head opening it on an iron lung. 

Below is a link to the crudest diagram you ever saw (sorry) and a legend in the imgur description that will hopefully make some sense. Also below is how my first test went and what I learned from it, my goals for the project, and at the very bottom are some relevant measurements. 

GOALS FOR THE PROJECT: I’m hoping for this project to be simple to put together, cost effective, and that it will allow me to see what I’m doing. It would also be really great if I could angle the mirror so that I could see what’s on my bedside table. Ideally, I’d like to be able to control the angle from ropes or pulls or something on either side of the mirror that won’t smack me in the face and Will be long enough to reach. 

RESOURCES: I can’t really get up but my mom can. But she doesn’t know how to use a hammer or drill... My dad (who’s very competent with building) isn’t very interested in the project but I’m thinking I can convince him to help if I could make it quick and simple enough to put together. Like 10 minutes or less for him?? I have $30 for this, at most. I already have a rectangular hand mirror that’s about 22x30cm or 3/4’x 1’

TEST: I tested it out (I showed this try with the red x and grey lines in the diagram) by tying a hand mirror in a downward position to on of the gaps betterment slats on my headboard, which is 25.5 inches or 64 centimeters over my mattress level. 

RESULT: 
It turned out that the mirror tied hanging over my headboard was actually not in my field of view. It was behind, which was aggravating to my neck. I also found that I may have to learn to write backwards, which I have plenty time to do. Finally, I couldn’t reach the mirror to adjust it, nor was it helping me see my nightstand at all. 

MOVING FORWARD: So now I know that I have to move the mirror maybe 3 feet or so (I don’t know how to do the math) off the wall If I want to see it easily. Im thinking telescoping pvc pipe and some kind of bracket? But, I worry about putting a bunch of stuff over my bed (unless its set up so that there’s nothing in my way when I get up. I thought a solution could be a scissor mechanism that folds back, but I looked online in the US and I found very few premade, and none in my price range. Im not able to build one either. Maybe telescoping pvc pipe? I know that the further away the mirror is, the bigger it will have to be and that’s a concern, too. Other than that, I found this wall mount scissor arm mirror on amazon:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000X2W6LQ/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1
It’s 30 inches from the wall. Anybody know if that’s far enough from the wall or is there a way to make this work? I also worry it would be flimsy hanging on it’s side and I don’t know how I could make it adjustable without reaching my arms too much. 

MEASUREMENTS :

My height (standing) 167cm or 5’6

My height (seated): 94 cm or 37 inches off the mattress

My headboard height: 64cm or 25.5inches off the mattress

Angle that’s most comfortable to look: about 65 degrees (not straight up!)

My night stand: 2ft wide x 1.5ft deep

The height the mirror on the first attempt: same as the headboard

The height I can lift my arms: I’m fine as long as my elbows stay on the mattress. 


I like building little things but I don’t have energy to make a pile of failed models like I usually do. If anybody is willing to help me streamline this project, I think we could actually finish it!

When you power the chip up the next time, how does it remember it’s last state, ie. in my example that it will consistently output Q=1 instead of being arbitrary?

During this newfound free time due to the Corona virus situation, I've been wanting to do a few projects that I've always put off due to a lack of time.  So, I'm wanting to make an air vacuum.  Years ago, a coworker showed me one that he had built in his free time and made a few videos with.  I thought it was a cool toy and wanted to make my own, but just never got around to it.  And unfortunately, I have no way of getting in touch with him to get some help with making my own.  That's where I'm hoping this group comes in handy.

I also was into people like Nav Bhatia that did a car dealer business to compliment his mechanical engineering, however again it's not his field. I do not like programming. I know that electrical is harder in difficulty, but if it leads to my goals I will try my best. I have struggled through second year because of my study habits. I will improve them in the summer and in the future if necessary. 

Ryerson industrial engineering is the second-best in Canada behind UofT as per other Reddit posts, which may be a plus point. There maybe a possibility of losing 2 years however if my spring courses to balance workload are not offered because capstone is a whole year. 1 year seems doable however as long as things play smoothly (fast tracking 1 or so courses).

I just wanted to know that if I were to complete my bachelors in electrical if I will be able to get a job as an analyst, bank analyst, consultant, process engineering or a technical management related job. Maybe I can pair my electrical degree with post-grad project management or hopefully MBA. Again, I will need a great above 3.0 average in my final 2 years to secure that. I am your average engineering student, subpar 70 GPA. My aspirations are just for a job with a nice salary and secure benefits, I am not passionate about anything per se, but I love people-oriented tasks. Group projects and socializing with teammates is my favourite thing to do. Please let me know because I have had this dilemma for a while now. Please leave helpful and positive comments because I need some real advice.",AskEngineers,False,Mclaren-Racer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g4ffkd/advice_on_electrical_vs_industrial_engineering_in/
80,HVAC Engineer with Programming Interest,1587329650,"I’m a PE 5 years out of school in the HVAC industry. I struggle to find opportunities for very technical problem solving opportunities and I spend too much of my career looking over submittals, engaging in specs and other things that don’t require calculations. I love math and I have always considered programming a hobby. I’ve been able to squeeze out a few programming automation tasks to help my company out if that’s worth anything.

I’ve looked into mechatronics/robotics/automation engineer jobs and am open to other careers that I may not have discovered but fit my interests. 

This seems like a difficult path to take as a mechanical gras in my position. Does anyone have any routes I should explore? I do coding tutorials and classes all the time in case it will ever be useful for me but it’s becoming difficult to keep spending large amounts of my life doing so if I can’t ever apply it.

The further my (electrical Engineering) studies are going, and the closer I come to the Final, I am keep asking my self how I can avoid becoming an ""professional idiot"". I keep studying more and more stuff but I don't know how to bring it to proper use. I know a lot of people in my field are building circuits and stuff. But I am more interested in electrical field and nanotechnology. Both which you cant really do without a proper lab. Any suggestion on doing more on hands task? More problem solving ?

The Problem solving is another big part. When I look at a video from people like the GreatScoot, I understand what the parts are doing, but what I dont get, is how to get to the point of creating it? Where do I start? How do I solve the problem ?

84,How do I represent two-force members in ANSYS Workbench?,1587323574,"I have this component that I am analyzing in Static Structural that has a fixed pin, a cantilever load, and a pin part way in between that has a pneumatic cylinder attached, for rotating the load about the fixed pin.

How do I represent this constraint? I have attempted to create an angled coordinate system and constrain movement in the axes that shouldn't have motion (due to it being two force) but that didn't yield reactions at the pin that I am expecting. I ended up modeling up a fake cylinder to fix the angle, and that worked, but I would rather not use too much auxiliary solid, as my max node count is a bit low.",AskEngineers,False,jimbojones648,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g4dgjl/how_do_i_represent_twoforce_members_in_ansys/
85,How much should I charge as a freelance engineer given the situation?,1587323060,"&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking a second to read this,

I'm going to try to put as much info into this in as little words as possible. I am about to graduate from undergrad with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Luckily I have been working in the field throughout most of my 5 years in school and have gained a significant amount of relevant experience. 

For almost the last year I have been working part time as a ""Senior"" Engineer at a small local company. During my time there I started a large solo project when I had free time. This project is a custom software that interfaces with their current modelling program and will automate a large amount of the time they spend in the CAD department. Current estimates show an 80% time decrease in the processing of technical drawings. This company has been doing CAD the same way for 25 years so I have been helping them update everything.

More recently I ended up taking a full time offer from another company, it fit better what I want to do with my career. However just before this I had pitched my solo project to the current company, and they loved it.

We have come to an agreement that I will remain with the current company limited hours on this project only, as a freelancer. I will still be taking my other full time position. What I cannot decide is how much an engineer should charge for freelancing, especially since I am creating software in a sense but I am not formally educated in coding. I do have a long history of design experience which is how I got here.

87,Seeking Advice for Career Change to Project Manager in Municipal Water,1587322497,"I am contemplating switching from working as an engineer (reliability/maintenance/projects) at an oil refinery to working as a project manager at a municipal water company.

* **Is there a good work-life balance at municipal water companies?**  I've gotten burnt out in my last few positions working in oil refining.  This is a combination of long hours from planned &amp; unplanned process unit outages, high sense of urgency (hair-on-fire) decision making, priorities changing, occasional ethical dilemmas, and being short staffed. I don't believe changes can be made in my current job to fix some of the issues I am dealing with and I'm fairly pigeonholed.  I regularly feel that my current role is not mentally sustainable in the long term.
* **Is municipal water stressful?**  I am cautiously optimistic that the municipal position will be lower stress.  From what I've been able to gather, it seems lower stress relative to my current position but can be difficult working through the bureaucracy of public works. Office politics is a given anywhere and is all part of the problem solving game (in my opinion).
* **Is municipal water fulfilling?**  Sometimes I struggle with the mission of refining petrochemicals which then erodes my fulfillment.  What I'm not sure of is if my current lack of fulfillment is just hedonistic adaptation and will carry over into the next job.  I'm optimistic that the mission behind providing water resources has a steadier moral standing which would lead to more fulfilling work (at least in my case). 
* **Any book recommendations?**  I already purchased an old version of ""Wastewater Engineering"" by Metcalf &amp; Eddy and I have some fluids and engineered equipment books from my current work.
* The only argument I really have for staying at my current position with the oil refinery is that it pays quite a bit better. The job switch would certainly push out my retirement date but this would be acceptable for me if I could find fulfillment. I do feel like this change is more about lifestyle than money and my current job is more likely than a municipal job to get axed with the current economic downturn.  
* I like my coworkers but I know most of them would understand the reason for switching jobs and if I left, it would decrease the likelihood of them getting laid off in the case of future layoffs. I'm sure some of them will want to follow me to work at the municipal water company though! :)
