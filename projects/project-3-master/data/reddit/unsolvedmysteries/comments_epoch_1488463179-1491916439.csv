1,Project Lab ideas?,1491874273,"Hey folks, I'm going to be taking my second EE Project Lab over the summer, and the professor is allowing us to pick a project.

The only stipulation is that it must involve the MSP430 microprocessor in some fashion.

My professional background has been in audio engineering, so I've been considering making a synthesizer; I'm not sure how involved that can be.

My education thus far has been through DC and AC Circuits, Electronics I (Diodes/MOSFETs/BJTs), Modern Communications (AM/FM signals and signal manipulations), Microprocessors, and Feedback Control Systems.  Anyone have any suggestions for a cool project for the 16-week course?",AskEngineers,SuchACommonBird,/r/AskEngineers/comments/64nv0f/project_lab_ideas/
2,How to accurately dose Liquid Nitrogen for beverage cans (DIY)?,1491867796,"This question is for sure going to raise various concerns, but I'm hopeful there is a solution. 


I own a beverage company. We're looking to get into nitrogen infused beverages (in cans). The way you do that: dose a small amount of liquid nitrogen into the can before you seam the lid. 


The problem: the equipment to do this is expensive ($20K) and we're a two person startup trying to bootstrap it. So, to set the parameters of this problem, lets hypothetically say we have no access to such a machine and no money (which really isn't that hypothetical). Is there a easy/cheap way to dose small amounts of liquid nitrogen? We can't afford to invest thousands into a product until we have fully validated it. On top of that, it's very beneficial for us to stay local for manufacturing so we're eligible to get into stores with local supplier programs like Wholefoods (hence why going with an out-of-state small contract packager with the LN2 Dosing equipment is not really an option right now). 


This is currently our *last* barrier to entry preventing us launching our new drinks. I firmly believe there's always another way, one that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. We don't need speed (we'll be manually filling/seaming the cans at the early stage), just a fairly accurate result at an accessible price. Really hoping the Reddit community can collectively kick this problem in the teeth in an unconventional way! 


All insight will be appreciated :) ",AskEngineers,CarterJarrett,/r/AskEngineers/comments/64n9yx/how_to_accurately_dose_liquid_nitrogen_for/
3,Big Decision,1491862233,"Hello, high school student here who needs to decide what kind of engineering to major in... I've been on the fence for a while on this decision, primarily because I have no crystal clear way to decide which pathway &amp; making matters worse the pathway I choose will determine which science I take. As of now I am enrolled in HNR Chemistry for next year but I was told that I should have an AP science for that year if I want to impress colleges, the problem being that I don't know what science because the engineering field varies. I seem to enjoy biomedical engineering, coding, but I also am interested in physics somewhat. I can go into more if needed but the question is... How can I decide what engineering pathway is right for me?

 need your help! Can you guys please ask me questions also suggest possible questions that I might be asked during my thesis defence?

Defending my master's thesis ""Motions of [Asymmetrical](http://imgur.com/a/UpYAZ) catamarans"". The thesis deals with the investigation of *Heave &amp; Pitch coupled motions*, in an irregular seaway. 

I approached my advisor to seek advice on what questions I might expect from other committee members. He said that he has no clue as it's something new every time. Also mentioned my work was mediocre and a lot could have been done. I got a *you're in big big trouble boy* kinda vibe.

I started with a CFD package, but the program failed to validate with published results. So this semester I started from scratch but used 2D potentially flow theory to calculate to calculate coupled Heave &amp; Pitch and Added resistance (drag) due to these motions. 

So the conclusion was, these new hulls did not perform any better compared to conventional ones, But they do have better-Added resistance compared to the conventional catamarans.

16,Applying for California PE with another state's EIT. Help appreciated!,1491785058,"Hello all,

I'm licensed in another state and I have 5 years of engineering experience with my FE passed in 2012. I've been browsing the NCEES website and the California Board for PEs website and I have a few questions...

1) It seems like California wants us to first apply and pass the PE, and then apply for the license. Should I go ahead and start filling out all my applications and get my references ready or should I wait until I've passed to do so? I plan on taking the test in May 2018. 

2) The FAQ regarding EITs and other states is ambiguous. My state's EIT ""License"" number isn't on the NCEES website, it simply says I've passed the FE exam. My school's education is also unverified - does this matter? Do I need to apply for an EIT with California to take the exam/get the Cali PE or am I good to simply apply for the next exam available?

3) All the information for me is unverified. Is this needed for now or only if I were to become licensed in multiple states? The NCEES website has been totally revamped. 

4) What's the best study material for the PE exam? Has it changed out in the past few years like the FE exam has? I'll probably take a course since I've always found it helps. I didn't study for the FE since I was just coming out of school but I've heard the PE is a different animal.

I am going to order two 48in half-spheres, but I would like to know what thickness I should buy. It is my understanding that the acrylic thins when a sheet is turned into a half-sphere.

So, I am looking to understand (1) How thick does acrylic need to be to support that weight?, (2) Which thickness would you purchase if you were me?

Many thanks!",AskEngineers,SphericalWeight,/r/AskEngineers/comments/64akno/thickness_of_acrylic_sphere_to_hold_man/
37,"I am making a thermal paste, but I am concerned it will be a pyrotechnical hazard",1491698972,"I am designing a kerosene fuel heat-exchanger. The object to be cooled is a cylinder of hot stainless steel, and fuel lines are to be wrapped around the cylinder helically. The temperature of the steel will be in the 650-750 C range. I have not yet chosen a fuel line material, though I am thinking copper for thermal conductivity. This is all very theoretical, and much, like the temperature, will be determined experimentally, so I apologize if the specifics are vague.

The problem lies in the thermal expansion, something that can be complicated to correct. Instead, I figured I would try to keep it simple. I will keep a small gap between the fuel lines and the chamber (by wrapping the lines around a cylinder of a greater diameter, appx 1mm larger), and inject a thick thermal paste between the two to ensure good conductivity. This should allow for the objects to expand and contract without causing undue stress, cracking the fuel lines, and spraying kerosene onto hot metal.

My idea for the paste is simple- take metal chips from my boss' machine shop, grind 'em up, and mix well into petroleum jelly.

However, I am concerned I may just wind up creating thermite, as the powdered metal could be an unknown witches' brew of iron, aluminum, copper, and brass. And with this paste in a very hot environment, it could get violent fast.

Should I be concerned about the fire hazard?

For my internship the Big boss asked me to determine the accuracy of the ""Concentrated Source Method"".
This  ""Method II.2"" described in the HMRI manual (comparable to ISO-Norms) which is used to determine the immission relevant source power in a certain direction from (a) sound source(s) during a well defined business situation.

They distinguish two situations I don't fully understand.
- Measurepoint on a whole sphere
High round sources positioned on an imaginary plane of measurement in the form of a whole sphere where its center alignes with the source center.
1,5 d &lt; R , 0,5 h_b
where h_b = hight of the source above the ground.

- Measurepoint on a halve sphere
If a concentrated source is located near a horizontal surface, the plane of measurement is chosen as a half sphere around the source. The center of the half sphere alignes with the projectile of the source center on the horizontal surface. examples are. paved and grassy grounds and rooftops etc. 
R &gt; 1,5d

The difference is still a bit vague to me, it was once explained but i kind of forgot. I do know that it kind of felt counter intuitive at the time.

Anyhow.
The purpose is to calculate the sourcepower L_wr
from the measurements we can get a average soundpressurelevel L_Aeq,T

condition. R &lt; 20m:
Whole sphere: L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log (4pi R^2)
Half sphere: L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log ( 4pi R^2 - 2)

condition R &gt; 20m
L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log (4pi R^2 + a_air R)
L_wr = L_Aeq,T - L_fiction.
a_air = airabsorptioncoeff.

Can somebody help me figure out how to determine the margin of error of the sourcepower.

78,"Need help with internship choice: NASA or ""competitive"" private company?",1491545070,"I'm a junior engineer at a great but not excellent engineering school. I got an offer from a nearby company that designs and manufactures sensors. It is reasonably interesting work and is considered to be a great company to work for (despite not being a ""big name company."") I also just got an offer to work at NASA. Definitely much more interesting work, and I imagine better experience/skill building/high-tech engineering.

Normally this would be an easy decision (go for NASA), but I have worked at gov't labs in the past and I dislike the slow pace of work and the fact that the work is very often fundamental research. In fact, I do not think I want to work for the government or do research during my career ever. Additionally, I like that this nearby company is business-focused and I am thinking of business school in the future. I have never had an internship in private industry. Will another government internship negatively affect business school applications if I apply next year as a senior?

Also, will an internship at NASA get me virtually any job in that field after graduation? A great deal of this decision is based on the idea that a single internship at NASA will greatly improve my career prospects. (I haven't had an engineering internship yet.)

Am I crazy for turning down NASA?

I appreciate any feedback! Thank you!

79,Udacity Robotics Nanodegree Worth it? (X-Post r/robotics),1491538362,"So Udacity put up a nanodegree for robotics and I was checking out their syllabus. It looks pretty comprehensive - goes into ROS, kinematics, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. The biggest advantage of this course is the practical guided projects that can be used in your ""portfolio of work"". I'm on the fence about it since there are so many resources out for each of those topics but the guided projects (along with corporate collaboration with BOSCH, iRobot, MegaBots, KUKA, and more) are fairly enticing. Do you think this is worth the $2400 (2 terms for $1200) pricetag or could we make an equal type of ""course"" using free online resources that is just as comprehensive?

80,"I graduated from a ""prestigious"" university. Am I making a mistake by taking a job offer at a small company?",1491537750,"I graduated from the University of Michigan in December with a bachelor's in electrical engineering. My friends who are still finishing up undergrad periodically check up on me, and when I tell them the companies that I've been interviewing at, their response usually has a general tone of ""Why?"" I guess it's just an expectation that I have the means to work at a large prestigious company because I went to UMich, and since I haven't been interviewing at huge companies, they assume I must have fucked up pretty badly in school. My peers/former classmates have been getting offers from companies like Tesla, Northrop Grumman, Ford, Texas Instruments, etc. Really flashy, cool shit. 

While it's true that I didn't do great in school and my credentials aren't all that attractive, a few well-established midsize companies have reached out to me. I've interviewed at a couple of automotive suppliers and a company in downtown Chicago that does infrastructure development. This week, I talked to a small consulting firm that deals primarily with wastewater treatment/clean water distribution. This has been the most attractive company to me so far. It was located in this shitty run-down building, the office was small and very quiet, the manager seemed very humble. The atmosphere was lowkey and laidback, a good fit for my personality. It sounds like a place where I can learn in peace without feeling like people are breathing down my neck. I interned at a pretty large automotive supplier last summer, and I just remember having a lot of social anxiety which I think inhibited my learning while I was there. I was on edge all the time. 

This is not a glamorous job. Also, I'm a girl, so it's REALLY not a glamorous job. Working with sewage systems and whatnot. The past four years, people have been hammering into my brain that prestige, status, wealth are what's important. That those are the goals to strive for, as a engineering student at UMich. There's a small part of me that still believes it, which is why I'm having doubts. My parents aren't opposed to me taking this job, but are encouraging me to continue my search. 

Am I selling myself short by opting for what's within my comfort zone? As a fresh college grad, should I be challenging myself/facing my fears instead?

I work with valves and have been around a lot of field work where sites either want them replaced whenever the valve is worked on but a lot of times sites want to continue reusing the original studs. A lot of the valves I work on are for HP or main steam so they experience pretty high temps and are holding back a decent amount of pressure on valve bonnets. Studs are usually the grade 7 with B16 nuts so they are heavy duty inconel but when they ocassionally gall during removal it's a huge ordeal to correct. Trying to do a weld repair and retap a galled out valve body threads can be a long and very expensive ordeal.
I feel like they should be replaced every time we are working on the valve as these valves cycle wide ranges of temps and a failure of a stud/nut could easily mean death.

Personally the only illegal I have done in my life is smoke pot in high school for a short time, but other than that I have done nothing illegal and have less that $3,000 is school debt upon graduating. 

My worry is however with my current living situation. I currently live with my brother because my father has had serious debt problems and it was too stressful an environment for me to complete school with. My brother smokes and sells pot on a daily basis. Now with this job I will have the financial independence to move out on my own, and I can even move out sooner than my start date on my own with some family friends of my mother's if that helps the situation. I just dont know where I stand with my chances of getting through the clearance with this problem in mind, and granted I dont know when this clearance will begin as I still dont start the job officially until a month and a half from now at best.

96,Mechanical international graduate student career advice,1491502526,"I'm a master's student doing mechanical engineering at an ivy school since Fall 2017 with a focus in robotics. I am an international student and am here in the US on an F1 visa. This is a throwaway.

I've been looking for summer internships for the last four months with absolutely no luck. My GPA is at a 3.92 and I've done a bunch of relevant coursework and projects , so that probably isn't the problem. I haven't even gotten calls for interviews. I'm looking for internships specific to robotics, and that might be one of the things that is hurting me. Mostly I think it's the F1 visa and the fact that I will eventually need an H1B. Most of the students in my mech batch seem to be going through a similar drought. My original 'backup' plan for the summer was to continue working at the research lab I am doing my thesis in. The work is going well and my mentor was quite happy when I recently gave a presentation about the results so far. So I decided to use the opportunity to I ask about getting paid in the summer right after my presentation, and he said, ""Let me see if we can find some way to fund that, and I'll get back to you if it's possible."" I was under the impression that there is a lot of funding in the lab right now and so this is extremely discouraging. My mentor has a history of not really being able to just say no to students outright. Instead, funding is suddenly not available for students my mentor thinks doesn't like as much usually because they aren't being too productive or can be replaced easily. I'm also planning on doing a phd, but lately I've come to realize I shouldn't expect to get into my current university just because I'm doing my master's  here . This happened with another international student in my lab. He only applied here for his phd and expected to get in for the Fall. He continued working, after graduating in December, with no pay for the lab till two weeks ago when he got waitlisted and our mentor probably said there was nothing he could *read wanted to* do. In any case, I would not take up a phd program if it weren't funded. 

So now I have two options for the summer. I can either just accept the whole situation and stay on at the lab and work on my thesis, without pay. Or, I could take up the two courses I have to do in my last term during the summer and be done at the end of August. 

The main reason I would want to finish my program by August is to save a bunch of money in the Fall by not having to pay rent and other university fees. I could also look for a Fall OPT, because I think companies might be more receptive of me if I'm going to be around for that long. Alternatively, I could look for a lab to work at as an RA (does anyone know a robotics lab that's looking?). Generally, the Fall is a better time to look for jobs too.

On the other hand, if I were to not take up courses in the summer and stay for the Fall, I could potentially (hopefully) work on campus and have that take care of rent(or part of it). That way, I give myself more time to figure out what I need to do to find a job or an internship.  At this point I'm skeptical that anything will change. I want to apply for my phd for next fall (2018) and I would be applying this October,  November. 

I don't know if one would be more beneficial to me than the other. My cost of living is really high and it's hard for me to justify staying here during the summer while not enrolled in coursework, and not getting paid either. Is it worth sticking around for the Fall? Is there anyone else who has had to face something similar? What did you do? Is there something else I should be doing to look for internships or jobs? Right now my parents are funding me, and I need to find a way to not need that anymore.

Of course, I could take the easy way out and just give up on engineering, go home and learn to bake. (No offense to bakers. It's not easy. Don't hate me. I like cake.)

Maybe this is a dumb question, but we are trying to figure out how to use a motor and a ratcheting mechanism to pull back and then shoot a catapult or spring-loaded cannon. It must be done without touching the robot, as you can only operate it with a gamepad during competition.

1. We can use the motor to wind up the mechanism, but when released, is it bad to be pulling the motor back in the opposite direction so quickly? (Would it even work?) How would we fix that?

2. We considered using some kind of structure holding both the main motor and the pawl so that we could disengage both simultaneously, but that seems overly complicated, as it would introduce more motors/servos to do so, and probably lose some reliability. Surely there's some other way to do it?

(Regards general construction and design of FDM/FFF additive 3D printers)

&gt; I've seen a few of the arguments about which is best between round shafts and square slides and grooved rails but few if any of those seem to contain any detailed comparisons and none I've seen compared the inherent noise levels. Since I'm trying to plan my own design and currently live in an apartment, I figured that I should take these aspects into account. I'm leary of the slides and rails since everywhere I've seen them in other contexts they've been loud and shrill but I've no experience with linear rods anywhere and am willing to defer to those more experienced.

&gt; Generally speaking:

&gt; - how does each style of linear guide compare to the others in volume and pitch of noise?

&gt; - what are the basic pros and cons of each style of guide?

&gt; - at what length or height does warping become a consideration for each style of guide along a given axis? How can this be ameliorated without impeding motion?

&gt; - do all styles benefit from parallelism? Can I mount two or four slides or rails in a row to support one carriage? Can I mount four shafts in a box to support one carriage? Is it better to use one larger guide or multiple smaller ones?

&gt; - how much does distance matter? Does it make sense to add secondary support guides at either end of a frame's axis, or only the primar(y/ies) close to the carriage?

&gt; - how well does each style handle intersecting axes? Do lateral forces become a strong concern in a carriage with guides on intersecting axes?

26,Pneumatic Wrench doesn't provide expected torque.,1491424543,"Hi r/AskEngineers,

At my facility, I'm designing a tool that allows the operator to pull a rubber rivet (think 'long rubber shaft with a plug on the back') through a block of wood. 

&amp;nbsp;

The tool utilizes a shaft with a hole about halfway down its length that captures the rivet and spins it around the shaft, all the while pulling the rivet through the wood. The shaft spins on a set of bushings, and is powered by a drill/impact wrench/air ratchet/etc. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

The tool works as I anticipated using an electric drill (max advertised torque ~500 in-lbs), but when I switch to a [brand new] pneumatic ratchet (Ingersoll Rand 107XPA) with an advertised torque of ~650 in-lbs it doesn't have enough power to spin the shaft even once around. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

Our facility's compressor produces 120 psi and even with friction loss, leaks, etc should still put at least 90 psi into the tool- more than enough air according to the manual.

37,GE Pro E-Cell RO with Electrodeionization - Low Rectifier Output Voltage,1491374860,"I am running a GE two pass reverse osmosis water treatment unit with three EDI (electrodeionization) stacks on the RO effluent. The process is the removal of ions from the water yielding ultra high purity water (0.055 µS/cm) for use in a heat recovery steam generator in a combined cycle power plant.
The EDI is supplied from a 600VAC bus that is rectified to DC. (http://imgur.com/4KNnjOp) (http://imgur.com/swO0mvQ) 
The problem is when the rectifier starts up, only half of the normal operating voltage is seen but with zero current flow. After approximately 10 seconds the RO HMI trips the unit with a rectifier fuse blown alarm. If the EDI rectifier fuse was blown, there wouldn’t be any voltage at all to the rectifier, from my basic understanding. When the unit was starting up (start up flush and water purity verification) it was showing about half of the normal voltage before it tripped off. 

Plot twist: Early Sunday morning there was a ground fault on the 230kV line connected to the plant on an underground cable termination that caused the B phase to collapse and the peak value of the currents in all three phases to reach approximately 1000 amps for 3.5 cycles before the fault was isolated and the system returned to normal without causing any breaker trips in the plant (http://imgur.com/1dJE61X). Within the plant there was a momentary dip in voltages, the emergency DC drives for pumps started and the lights flickered, as well as a large unidentified sound was heard, but no breakers in the plant tripped. At the time of the ground fault on the 230kV line, the RO/EDI unit was not in service. 

The question is: what could be the cause of the rectifier voltage output only being half of its normal value, and the amperage being zero? I am speculating Sunday’s ground fault on the high voltage system may have something to do with it, but I don’t know enough to be able to tell. The O&amp;M manual has not been helpful in attempting to troubleshoot this issue.

50,Working as a independent structural engineer [UK],1491341301,"Hello, I've been thinking of working as an independent structural engineer. I've got 8 years experience and there's a lack of structural engineers in my area for very small scale works (house extensions, lintels etc), so it could be a useful boost to my income (usual provisos of not stepping outside my competence, etc. etc.).

My question is.... where do I start?? Ideally I'd ask a family friend or similar but the only other engineers I know have a similar career route of large companies. 

So far I figure:
- build client base
-  professional indemnity insurance
- competition in area
- best practise for jobs I'd take on

I'm not yet chartered (close to it), but as far as I can figure it isn't a requirement. I will wait until I have that sorted, though. Also, my first 'commission' would be an extension on my own home, so not putting anyone else's lives at risk just yet, but any advice or resources would be much appreciated.

I know Java and C pretty well, and have some experience with LabView, Simulink, the and the ANSYS suite. I feel like control is such a big subject that I'll always have new concepts to learn and ideas to experiment with; it's an extremely active field in both academia and in industry.

I've been teaching myself a little bit about robust control as part of my senior design project, and I'd like to find a job where I can work on robust, adaptive, or intelligent control. I'm specifically interested in the applications of machine learning and computer vision as they relate to control theory, as well as the security issues of modern control systems/IOT etc.

I've been looking for jobs, but I'm having a really hard time finding entry-level positions in control systems. I'm entertaining the idea of looking for software development jobs so I can get more experience with the programming side of control, but I'm not sure if I have enough experience or if I'd even like the work.

Secondly, where are some places where you can find a good source of plasma? Obviously a plasma cutter, and maybe lights, but is there anywhere else?


Finally, since I don't really understand how plasma works, I have to ask this ELI5 question... is plasma conductive, or is metal conductive to plasma? I'm not even sure what I'm asking here because I understand so little about it. Basically, I know that the way a plasma ball works is that there is gas trapped within the glass that allows the plasma to travel… Is it gas, or is it metal that allows plasma to travel.

Before blasting, the workers swear they did not see this, and I do believe them, as there were about 4 sets of eyes on it.
There are 2 possibilities that I believe are only possible: someone deliberately accomplished this (somehow created these 3 basically identical defects somehow, I don't know how) OR there was a defect in the material already and during the heating up to 500F it melted away.

Honestly, the result looks like someone took a hot piece of metal and stuck it into a piece of plastic at an angle and the plastic melted out around the hot metal.

I've provided pictures of the laser, connectors, and power supply. Can anyone tell me what I need for a battery? I realize it's only using .21 amps or so at 12v.

70,Automotive Suspension,1491284435,"Hi, 

I have a pretty basic question based on a four wheel vehicle or even a three wheel one. Given an option does it help to have your suspension towards the end of the car, specially in the back. For e.g. a mini cooper has the back wheels really close the rear and so the suspension is way back while a compact sedan has the wheels right behind the back door and has some over hang of the boot. Purely Engineering wise which would be a better design. I'm just curious to know. 

I believe that if the suspension is really close to the passengers, it would reduce the wheel travel and therefore provide a smoother ride. This is assuming that the stiffness of the springs and everything else is the same.

First a little something about myself, I'm a Filipino BSEE 2009 graduate, I passed my Licensure Exam the same year. I worked from 2010 to 2013 as a Project Engineer in a small Electrical contractor in the country. I quit my job for many reasons but the main one is I don't feel accomplished, the work is mainly Project Management, I feel like I didn't apply most of my studies, the job is really stressful and I feel like I'm being underpaid. My former classmate works as an Electrician in the Shipping Industry and told me that the pay is really great. I quit my job and take training and certifications related to the field, After a year of training and another year applying to various manning agencies, I found out that its very hard to penetrate the industry, mainly because I don't have previous experience on the job, no referral from ship officers which is very important, and my age. Because of my accumulated debts from taking trainings and being jobless, I choose to go to work in KSA with the help of my cousin. I apply as an Electrical Maintenance Technician in a contractor that services water treatment companies. When I arrived, the Project Manager decided to put me in as an Operator in a RO treatment plant, I argue with him that I can do better as a Maintenance due to my Electrical background, but, he reasons that the new project needs more operators and assign me as one. Now I'm working from Oct 2015 as an Operator that usually only sits around for 10hrs in a 12hr job. My contract will be finished this coming Oct and I plan on exiting.

I'm already 29 and looking back at my poor life choices depression suddenly hits me, I feel shit, I can't sleep well and have lost apetite, I know myself that I am depressed, but I can't get myself from it. Most of my time here in KSA is me doing useless stuffs that will get me nowhere, I plan to use these remaining 6 months to come back to my roots of Electrical Engineering, and also try to use that to get away from this feeling that is eating me inside.

I want to lean how to build it myself. 

I work with wood primarily, so that side of things is sorted. The issue I am having is with designing the part that actually moves the cabinet with the monitor in it. Based on some googling I was thinking having 2 linear rails, one on each side that guides the motion up and down, with a motorized screw in the middle that actually lifts the cabinet. I can program, so i was hoping to find motors that were arduino friendly, so that i can use that platform's ecosystem of sensors and inputs to control the up/down motion. I just need some help getting started and moving in the right direction. I would hate to order parts for this and have them all be too small/overkill/wrong. 

**Assumptions:**

 The cabinet will be around 80 pounds between monitor, stored things like headphones and keyboard, and the wood itself.  

I will use some sensor determine when to stop moving. 
  
**The big things im worried about**: 

 How do i prevent the load from making the screw spin backwards and slowly sink down, but then still be able to reverse the motor and have it go back down when i need it to? could i solve this with a worm drive gear box?

Is having the central screw as the primary load bearing support dangerous? 

Where would I source gears, a threaded rod, motors and all the hard ware from?

what kind of motor do I need for this? How would i calculate the the strength of is a stepper motor overkill?

Does anyone have any experience with increasing the footprint of a footing? Currently the plan is to chip away the existing footing, dowel in the required bars and pour the extension. Is it just a matter of designing the dowels for shear and embedment? i'm not sure if the existing footing has any reinforcement, they were 3'x3', they will need to be 7'x7'. Do I need to be concerned with flexure? Any other considerations with this type of retrofit I may be overlooking?

99,Heat vs Current vs Work Load in CPU's?,1491221688,"Looking for an engineering explanation on how computer processing (CPU) units work. 

I am currently in the middle of a PC build for myself and decided to use the new i7-7700k as my CPU.  

I decided to do some research on the processor and see what I could dig up on the unit's known faults and issues.

From what I have read, the processor has some issues with temperature control and random high temperature spiking.  The first causation is probably due to the thermal interface material used between the chip and the heat plate.  Apparently Intel thought it was a good idea to save some $$ and go with a cheaper TIM, causing a higher general operating temperature, but that does not explain the high temperature spikes seen when computing simple tasks.  I know this because I have read forums where people have replaced the factory TIM with a higher grade material and still see larger spikes than usual.

I am curious to see if anyone on this subreddit may be able to explain to me how a processor works and what could be the cause of this phenomenon.  My initial reaction to hearing was this was pretty alarming, but after thinking about it more I realized that most processing units in the computer world show this type of action, but not so much at the alarming rate of the 7700k.

When thinking about it (as an ME), my first presumption is that when a task is being completed, the process sends a signal to the CPU that it needs help to get a job done.  Almost in the same theory as the accelarator to a vehicle.  When you push the peddle down, you get more power.  I think this theory could have the same fundamentals as the processor, correct?  

So in the 7700k's case, I think the CPU might be exaggerating the power required to get the small job done.  Think of it like a Prius vs Corvette.  When you open a program, it only requires Prius power, nothing that requires a large amount of help, BUT the CPU is designed to assume the process needs Corvette power, so it ramps up more than required, using more voltage than required to get the simple task completed, in turn causing a temperature spike in the CPU.

I would appreciate it if you could ELI5 terms as I do not know much about electrical/computational components.

TLDR:  How does a CPU work/designed?  Does more voltage get supplied to CPU when a job tasks is called upon?  I am so unaware of how this works that I don't even know how to properly word my questions lol...",AskEngineers,bnich11,/r/AskEngineers/comments/636dgt/heat_vs_current_vs_work_load_in_cpus/

3,What could be wrong with this solenoid?,1491186324,"I have an espresso machine which develops a problem after cleaning cycles where the solenoid controlling the water flow is repeatedly activated more often than it normally would be. [This video shows the aberrant buzzing noise it makes, at secs 1-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxKS9ree2cI). The actual solenoid is an Olab 9200H.

I'm trying to understand what the actual problem within the solenoid could be. I have taken it apart and checked it out, and nothing seems off. From reading around I've seen suggestions that it might be that the insulation on the wires in the coil has worn off at points and the magnetic field is not strong enough to pull the plunger up far enough anymore. When it got really bad, I opened it up and clipped the spring that holds the plunger down and closes off the valve, a little bit so it doesn't hold it down as firmly. That seemed to make it work again, but now after another cleaning cycle (using vinegar/water solution for descaling), the buzzing has come back.

Is it likely that the problem actually is the coil? Or is it more likely that it is something mechanical within the valve assembly? Any insight would be great, thanks.

Edit: to add a bit, once this solenoid starts buzzing like this excessively, the machine will no longer create pressure, so I'm guessing that means that the valve is not opening like it should. Also, I can get it to buzz without fail if I run it back to back. If I run it once and let the machine sit for 15 minutes, it will work again for that cycle.

Edit2: One thing that doesn't add up is that there are two different valves in this machine which have the same coil. I swapped the coils, but that did not seem to make a difference, which makes me think it is a mechanical problem in the valve.",AskEngineers,filip83,/r/AskEngineers/comments/63401w/what_could_be_wrong_with_this_solenoid/

naturally it heats faster than it cools, and I must comment on that phenomenon. I cant find any concrete evidence to use as a source online so I'm asking you guys. my assumption purely based on experiences and gut feeling is heat transfer from temperature A to B (heating) by CONDUCTION will be faster than heat transfer from temperature B to A (cooling) by RADIATION.

I have a screen that I want to use as the display for it, an FSTN LCD screen. However, I'm struggling to find a way to connect the screen to the Pi-- I'm not sure how to get it hooked up, or how to make it communicate with the Pi. One of the problems, in regard to actual physical connection, is that its wire is an unusual 36-pin ribbon wire, which doesn't fit into the display port the Pi has for ribbon cables. But more than that, I don't know how to go about actually communicating with it once it's connected. It says it can accept SPI, 8-bit/16-bit parallel or IIC display data, but I don't know what that means in regard to how much I can just give to it and how much actually has to be done on the Pi before sending it over. Whatever I do to connect it, it'll probably use an adapter or two, as this clearly isn't directly compatible. The good thing is that there's a lot of options-- I can use any one of four USB ports on the Pi, the HDMI port, the 3.5 mm audio-video jack, the display port, and some of the GPIO pins (if the controls bonnet I'm using doesn't use them all.)

15,An I totally out to lunch when it comes to salaries?,1491140953,"Hello Engineers, 

Location is Ottawa, Canada. Years of graduation: Bachelor's in ME, 2011 (3.9 GPA), MaSC: 2014 (4.0, nominated for a medal but didn't win). About 56 months experience recognized by PEO (38 post graduation). Eligible for P.Eng license but haven't done it yet because of cost. Currently working the same job I've had since finishing my masters. It's a small private company that does mechanical engineering services for different industries (O&amp;G, marine, HVAC, other random stuff). 

I've always been really ambitious when it comes to money. My parents used to insist when I was first getting into school that this degree was a golden ticket to crazy high salaries. Since then I've had a nice cold dose of reality, but I think I might need another one. 

I've always been a little disappointed with my pay at the current company. I got an unexpectedly low offer when I came in, which I was able to negotiate 2k higher. Since then I've had a two raises, both of which I've been able to negotiate slightly higher (&lt;&lt; 2k). I was brought in at a junior level which I wasn't too happy about, but I proved very quickly that I was above that level and got reassigned to intermediate after my first 3 months. 

Currently I am a very high performing employee. I work overtime every week, around 50-55 hours, and lead several junior engineers. I'm currently making low 60s. We have a few different technical groups here, and I am on good terms with the leader of one of the groups. He did his master's at the same school as me, and has been with the company for the last 14 years (he's around age 37-38). I really wanted more information on what to expect salarywise for the future, so I decided to ask him about it without getting too personal. I invited him for a beer and told him that I was thinking about the future and wanted to know a little more about our pay scale. I asked him, if he wouldn't mind sharing, how long it took him to reach 100k. He informed me that he hasn't reached that level yet, and that generally the people making 100k have been there for over 20 years. People who have been there 30 years are capped out around 120k.

I think this info hit me pretty hard. Maybe I'm actually spoiled and entitled. You can tell me if I am, I'll quietly laugh at myself if so. I personally feel like I should hit 100k after 10-12 years, especially with a master's degree. I have goals of home ownership which just aren't possible right now and it hurts to think that I may have to delay those goald for so long. I understand that 100k would generally be seen as a huge salary, but Ottawa is more expensive than average in Canada (though far from the most expensive) and so 100k doesn't go quite as far.

20,How do I deal with a stubborn group that's behind?,1491106236,"I've been working in a group now for 4 years.  I'm the only one who has actually done any work to improve my skillsets and remain relevant in the field, and as a result I'm getting all the new work in the group, and solving problems that customers actually want.  

The others guys haven't, and instead I see they put the most effort into keeping themselves as an entrenched old boy's club - going to lunches together, playing sports after work together.  I've also noticed that they don't do any actual work unless they all agree unanimously.  I still get treated like an outsider, and some are even spiteful that I was given work that they failed at.  

I've noticed that they are even proud of their entrenchment, and seem to think they can do any new work with increasingly obsolete toolchains.  I've found that work that takes 2-3 of them 4 months to do, I was able to do the same on my own in 1-2 months due to my skillset, with fewer mistakes.  In other words, in the same 4 months I can do two iterations.

Other than the work I do, the group is now 10 years behind other departments as far as technology goes.  My manager is pleased with the work that I do, but he wants me to delegate some to the rest of the group - which I can't because they don't have the skills.  Most don't want the work from me, and the times I have delegated simpler tasks, the work was done half-assed and took weeks instead of days.  

Unfortunately, I'm not being promoted, and I've been told that a factor in my promotion is to make sure the rest of the group is as capable as I am.  After 4 years of dealing with this stubbornness, that just isn't going to happen.

The latest trend is that they are being put as middle-men on larger projects, where they delegate all of their work to me.

I do like the work that I do - but I'm outnumbered.  Even if I do get promoted, I don't see myself as being able to delegate work to this group.  Is my only option just to move to another job?

21,Aerospace Engineering: major in AE or ME?,1491101265,"Hey everyone, for starters I would like to firstly apologize if you get questions like this a lot, I have nowhere else to ask. Secondly, I would also like to apologize if this is the wrong sub for this question and ask that if it is, you please direct me to a more appropriate one.

A little bit of background, I'm a HS senior who has pretty much always (even without really knowing) always had a passion for aerospace stuff and the like. I am currently committed to a college for Physics - Engineering, which, after doing research, is wrong for many reasons. Two of the main ones being that A) it isn't a specified enough curriculum (it's meant as an introduction and sets you up for grad school rather than the industry) and B) it isn't an ABET accredited program. I've been looking around at schools, and so far have found two I'm interested in. However, I feel like it would help my search a little more to ask if AE or ME is the better major. I've read that you can get an AE job with an ME degree, but part of me feels like I'd end up losing the specialization by gaining the versatility that ME has to offer.

I found this Gif on Imgur (http://imgur.com/gallery/k8m1HmQ) which includes a link to the youtube video in there.  So I watched the video, I don't see anything that screams fake to me.  I also found RC Jet engines, (http://www.chiefaircraft.com/jc-p200-rx.html)  that look similar to the ones that he is using.

The vice president of operations asked me to help the company design a new plastic return bag for customers.

we have 4 boxes that we ship out productions out in, they are .2, .3, and .4 cubic feet respectively

the vp wants me to make return bags are the same (or less) cubic feet as the boxes we send to the customers

Here's the questions I have....even though the plastic bags have depth, isn't it impossible to calculate the cubic feet given that the bag is technically not square and is more of a sphere (or cyclinder?)

Is it going to be extremely difficult to fit clothes that are folded tightly into boxes and return them in plastic bags with the same or less volume? customers typically just bunch clothes up and show them inside the bag

Given that a bag is typically tapered at the corners, wouldn't it be wiser to pick a bag with more width and length as opposed to depth?

61,Question about water flow through pipes / jets / enclosed spaces,1490964307,"Long story short, the president of the company I work at has a 75' olympic lap pool on the roof of his condo, and wants to replace part of the filter system. It's roughly 10' wide and 6' deep, and currently has two pvc pipes running the 75' length, one in each of the two bottom corners, with about 8 nozzles along the way. Two pumps push water through these pipes.

He bought one of those self-cleaning pool vacuums that relies on adhering to the wall to scoot around and clean, but it gets caught up on the pipes. What he would like to do is replace these two pipes with steel plate that runs the 75' length in each corner at a 45' angle and drill 8 holes the entire length. [Crappy whiteboard drawing here](http://i.imgur.com/3JTzpY7.jpg).

His question to me was, how large could the plate be and still maintain good flow through all the jets? His starting point was 3"" wide, but there's concern his little pool cleaner wouldn't move up from the bottom to the side of the pool over this 3"". Would increasing to 5"" cause issues with water flow?

It's been a long, long time since I've dealt with any fluid mechanics, so it's pretty fuzzy to me. My initial thought was that no matter the cross section of the water flow, the pump's flow and size of the holes will determine how much water comes out. His secondary question was, would the hole at the far opposite end of the 75' long pool push less water through than the one closest to the jet, and is it enough of a difference to matter. Again I figured that since water is mostly incompressible, the pressure through the 75' long channel should be roughly the same, and each hole / jet should push the same amount of water through.

4th Year Mechanical Engineering student here. I'm currently the design lead for the roll cage of a club built vehicle that we intend on racing. I won't go into specifics, but basically what I'm trying to do is find literature about converting a dynamic load (i.e. a crash) into an equivalent static force or applying some sort of load factor to compensate. I know its possible for simple geometries using strain energy, but for something complex like a frame chassis I have no chance. To be honest, I've spent hours trying to find literature, and starting to get a little disheartened. Any thoughts?

71,"Which would be a more promising career path in Electrical Engineering, Communication or Power?",1490906685,"Hello folks, 
I'm currently choosing electives to gain more knowledge in a concentration of my choosing, and I narrowed it down to Communication and Power (Not really power systems). I am actually very unsure on what the better choice would be. Most people have told me to choose what I like, but I like both and that's where the issue comes. I'm currently debating on taking courses from both concentrations to make a sort of hybrid Communication and Power engineering concentration but want to hear from you on what you think. If you are either focusing on Communications or Power, why did you choose that concentration and what are you doing with it at the moment? Is the economy going in a direction where I can contribute while having a steady job in either concentration?

I am having trouble selecting an appropriate actuator to apply the force required by the controller. I know that if I use an electric motor to try and pin an object I will either burn out the motor as the object is prevented from moving, or use a lot on unnecessary energy heating the coils in the motor. Obviously neither of these are good but I cant think of a better way of doing it, bearing in mind that it has to be lightweight (being a prosthesis) so I feel pneumatic and hydraulics are out of the picture.

At the same time, I am $6,000 in already (4 classes, 1 which I already dropped).

Dropping degree: I would have the benefit of focusing on work (which is in my field and I enjoy so it wouldn't be bad) but I would have to pay my debt asap.

I'm an undergrad in Mechanical/Materials engineering and will be graduating at the end of this semester (July due to weird Australian semesters). At the moment, I am applying to many different grad programs with varying amounts of success but they all start in Feb 2018.

My question is essentially how important is it that your first job is within the field that you want to do? I want to utilize the materials part of my degree in some form of design capacity. My preference is for something within the semiconductor/MEMS/Renewable Energy fields. However, as I am looking through my options, most of the 'materials' types of jobs seem to preference electronic engineers for the entry level roles. I am feeling more and more like I screwed myself when I chose my major as the people doing materials-stuff are electrical engineers instead of mechanical engineers (our uni has the combined major of Mech and Materials).

This is causing me some anxiety and stress. If I don't get a job in the field I want and take another unrelated job for the money (making PVC pipe for example), will I be able to swap into the industry I want later? Are you stuck once you get a little specialized? Furthermore, I am currently completing my Honours within my schools 'electronic materials' department studying graphene.

Its way easier to scan a resume to get the highlights and anyone with the skills I want is going to get at least a phone interview anyway.

Both Berkeley and Michigan are my dream schools :/ a) Do employers view a MEng differently? Is the one-year duration a handicap for a student fresh out of undergrad, in that is it harder to secure a job? b) Is the Berkeley tag, alumni base and industry exposure superior to that of Michigan? c) Are there enough jobs in Manufacturing in the US?

15,Check my work on table stability,1490766838,"Hey everybody. I am building a table using an old slab of kitchen granite as the table top, and I bought a set of table legs on Amazon that I'm going to place it on. Now that I have the legs though I'm a bit nervous about how stable this thing is going to be, especially if I place it slightly off-center, which I was planning to do. I've done the calculations as best I can on how much force it will take to knock this thing over by either hanging on the long side or pushing on the short side, and I was hoping the generous people of this forum could check my work. I think I have this right, but it's been almost 20 years since I took high school physics and my kids will likely be playing near this thing at some point and if it tips on them it could easily be fatal, so I'm a little paranoid. I did the calcs in excel and included a diagram (which was for my own guidance as I did it, but has labels so should make sense). But a) did I do these calculations right? and b) what stabilizing force should I really be targeting here for just general around-the-house safety? The table is for essentially office use, though possibly for some soldering and minor shop use, which is why the granite seemed useful. But 70 lbs at a height of 28'' seems like it would be difficult to apply by accident, but maybe I'm underestimating what kids or careless adults are capable of.

Calcs are [here](http://imgur.com/8ptnMZf) and [here](http://imgur.com/9Q59eC5) for a centered and one off-centered placement.

16,Laser Cutting Pipes,1490766654,"Hi,

I made a very basic chassis in Solidworks using round tubes. I used the weldment's command to create said chassis, inserted each structural member into a new part and then saved it as an .IGES file to be sent for laser cutting. However the vendor keeps stating that the origin doesn't show up in his software and hence he cannot cut the pipes. I have made a new co-ordinate system at the axis of the pipes hoping that would help without any luck.

If anyone uses SW weldments to do laser cutting of pipes or tubes, what is the usual procedure/settings you use?

18,How do you go from working in small groups to working in larger ones?,1490754757,"I've been developing products in small groups for the past few years.  It's usually been me, one or two other guys, and a few floaters whenever we need special skills.  It's been effective.  Normally together we would work on the top-level design.  If I see an issue, I walk over to the next cube, talk about it for an hour, figure out a solution, implement, repeat.  If something needs to change drastically because of a previously unforeseen problem, there's a small discussion, some waiting, then a solution a few days later.  

Now I'm working in a larger product group, that's been divided into 4 subgroups, spread across 2 divisions in 3 different buildings, in two cities.  We've had 4 meetings, it's been two months, and nobody knows what they're doing, or wants to start anything.  In order to work on my sub-part (which thankfully I have enough info to sort-of do), already I've noticed several glaring design issues in another mating sub-part that were kicked down the road in previous meetings.  To solve it, our team is going to have a meeting, to create a briefing, to deliver at a later meeting, to create another briefing, which afterwards we'll have another meeting to discuss the results.  

At the top-level, people with key skills are missing.  The sub-part managers are, well, managers, with only some technical skills.  

This is all driving me crazy, and it's really not for me.  How should I deal?

20,How bad is it to leave full time position after 6 months?,1490750422,"At the end of October, I started as a quality engineer at a medical device company. The compensation is good, with good benefits and vacation. The brand and parent company have a good reputation. My coworkers are friendly. The area is suburban approaching very rural, which I didn't like, but I would try to make the best of.. At first, it seemed like a promising opportunity. My manager, who was in charge of hiring me, was my biggest supporter and protector (work-wise) and very progressive in an otherwise old school work environment. The position was new so I had an opportunity to mold it and they wanted me to be very proactive in improving the site. I was learning a lot, but not more than I could handle and I had semi-interesting responsibilities. I even got my friend a job there.


 
Fast forward to now. Compensation hasn't changed, but a lot has. I no longer report to my original manager, the person who hired me. I have a new direct manager, who is a nice person, but ultimately is not as supportive, protective or good for my career. And shortly, I will have a new direct manager. Also, my original manager's boss now controls what I do and she has little to no regard for how we feel about it. In the last two weeks, my friend and I (who have the exact some position and responsibilities) have been getting more responsibility than we were led to believe we would get. This is causing us to have to put off our proactive projects in favor of the reactive projects. Much of what we're currently doing is not in the job description or talked about previously and we feel we would be used better elsewhere. The area has turned out to be almost completely uninteresting and my coworkers, while friendly, are significantly older and we don't really get past small talk. I don't really have trouble making friends in new places, but I just don't connect with my coworkers. I would like to transfer to stay within the parent company, but I have to wait a year to apply internally and chances are, for corporate business reasons, that opportunity will be unavailable by the time I get a chance. In the end, I feel that quality engineering is not for me and it's not looking like I will get a chance to move to another department, like R&amp;D, within this site. 

Is it too early to start actively looking for a new job? What are the risks that come from job searching so soon after starting this job? What is the best way to go about finding a new position if I choose to do that? What options might be available to me to make this situation better?

Is it worth my time to retrain for 3 years to get to a technician level position? It would be in Engineering Support and Mechatronics, below degree level of course, starting where maybe a 17yr old might!


I would be on a low salary for that time, but the 3 years involves the first year in school, the next two in placement and I would be hired by the government sector, so good chance of employability, but probably a clause saying I have to work x (3yrs?) amount of years there due to them funding my study.

30,Almost 3 years out of school and I don't feel like I've learned anything. Is this a common feeling?,1490716800,"I've been through 3 major shifts in my career since graduating. First job was a glorified technician that I took because I needed money and had no other options. I was there for like 7 months before I started as a contractor doing heavy equipment ""design"". I use quotes because while my title was design engineer, I did not do any real design work. I was part of the sustaining team and basically cleaned up other people's messes. I did a tiny bit of sheet metal design but it was very simple stuff. No one in my group there did any real design work. It was mostly stuff like swapping out bolts or making holes larger. I was misled about the nature of the work prior to starting. I stayed on with that customer, as a contractor, for almost 2 years before they canceled our contract and I was put elsewhere. 

That's where I am now. I just found the contract for this new project and there literally isn't a single dollar allocated to engineering work. It's all drafting and drawing checking. I had high hopes for this project but those are dwindling quickly now. 

I don't really know what I'm doing wrong. In every job I've had so far, I've expressed to my bosses my desire for more technical work. But it's never there or I'd have to change teams completely and that isn't feasible. 

I've gotten a good amount of CAD and drawing experience now but that's about it. Almost zero technical experience 3 years out of school. It's embarrassing honestly. I'm a design engineer who's never really designed anything despite 2 years of experience. 

I'm clearly doing something wrong here but I don't know what. Should I be more aggressive about chasing technical work? Should I change jobs?

35,"What points on Earth, if any, are defined to have a non-changing location for GPS?",1490708375,"My assumptions/understanding:

The surface of the Earth changes over long periods of time due to earthquakes, continental drift, etc, and the rotation rate of Earth speeds up and slows down due to gravitational interactions.  Navigational satellites are used to measure movement of surface features, and distant stars passing directly overhead specific points on the Earth are used to measure the rotation rate.  Using navigational satellites, the location of any point on the Earth is determined using information about the current time and orbit of the satellites broadcast by the satellites combined with the time it takes the signal to reach the receiver, and the details of the orbits are kept up to date by master control stations on the ground based on observation of the actual orbits.  It is an iterative system of measurements of the current state, uncontrollable (but somewhat predictable) physical changes, observation of those changes, and updates to the specifics of how to perform measurements, which affects future measurements.
 


 
My question:

When the updates to the orbital information of the satellites are performed, are there any points on the surface that are used as a reference, defined to not move and always have specific coordinates, and will always have those coordinates reported by a receiver at that location?  Phrased another way, with studies reporting that X landmass has shifted Y meters over Z years, what points that will never shift are used as reference for these measurements?

41,Interest vs. Career Prospects when choosing a major,1490678723,"**Disclaimer:** I realize that the stickied announcement on this subreddit states that ""choosing my major"" posts are not allowed, but I was interested in receiving some different perspectives on my questions that I don't think can be answered by just reading the wiki. If this still breaks the rules, to the trash this post goes I guess. 



I will likely be studying engineering at MIT for the next four years, and decided to take a look at the [starting salary by major](https://gecd.mit.edu/resources/survey-data) statistics. Glancing at the most [recent survey](https://gecd.mit.edu/sites/default/files/about/files/2015-gss-survey.pdf) (see page 28), I was surprised by how much more EECS majors seemed to earn than every other engineering major at the university. The median salary is about 30K+ more than almost every other major, and some of the highest starting salaries earned are EECS majors. 


Taking a few classes in CS, EE, and ME in high school, I've found that I am a lot more interested in mechanical engineering/aerospace engineering than I am in EECS. But disregarding my own interest, the career prospects that an EECS major provides seems to trump any preference I have for ME or AE. 


So I'm wondering, what reason would I have to choose a career in ME/AE over a career in EECS? I imagine there are ton of nuances to working in these fields that can't be represented by a simple data table. Are the extremely high incomes in the CS field skewed by the amount of jobs offered in high COL areas (e.g silicon valley)? Would a career in other fields of engineering offer better job security, or increased mid-career prospects? Are careers in CS often more stressful than other engineering careers? 


I still have quite a while to make a decision about my major, but I would appreciate your guys's thoughts.

Ideally I would want to be able to move out of the aerospace industry/government contractor industry in a few years at best. I think I would enjoy computer engineering the most followed by computer science and mechanical engineering. I believe I would also enjoy systems engineering. My worry is that I have zero computer engineering experience and would have to start from scratch. I am constrained in that I am not willing to leave Texas. I am currently in Houston.

The most logical item for this seems to be an electric winch due to the low cost, lowest I found was a $70 winch at a local hardware store, and the ability to lift and lower a lot of weight. The thing is that they all seem to be extremely noisy which is something I'd rather not have, hydraulic winches are much quieter but also much more expensive. Obviously I don't need 2,000 lbs of carrying capacity which seems to be the lowest these offer and I'm wondering if there's perhaps a better, and hopefully cheaper, option to simply raise and lower myself, preferably with a wireless remote and much quieter operation?

Each week, the procedure was stating to re-add the same amount of nitric acid and HF acid to the bath again. This seems excessive. Does the nitric and HF acid really need that much addition each week?

My current plan is to go into mech and get as much exposure to electrical engineering courses as possible by taking a minor in mechatronics/robotics as well as possibly taking some other courses but I would like to know your own opinions on what I should do.

I also have some general Qs on engineering if anyone would be kind enough to provide insight on. Namely, how important is my GPA to my employability? Of course it is good to have a high GPA but I want to know if it truly is worth while to sacrifice part of my marks in order to accumulate real experience through design clubs. Also as a full time engineer, will I be working late nights and weekends or will I be able to go home at around 5  most days?

95,Best bed isolator for bed with ButtKicker's?,1490488674,"Hello all, 

I currently have a ButtKicker LFE unit under one the legs of my bed. It's actually a king size sleigh bed.  The problem I'm having is the ButtKicker lfe unit bottoms out or rattles with (probably) 30Hz and lower movie content (Mad Max Fury Road is particularly bass heavy with the ATMOS track). 

I spoke with Guithammer support and they said that I need to isolate the bed frame from the floor.  That makes sense because the lfe is trying to shake the bed and the floor. 

So, I've decided to purchase a 16"" Zinus metal bed platform and ditch the box spring altogether.  That will allow me to keep the shaking isolated to the Zinus frame/mattress which will means I won't have to put isolators under the four posts of my bed.  I don't want to raise the sleigh bed itself for mechanical simplicity sake and aesthetic reasons. 

The Zinus frame/platform has 12 legs, so I figure the max load per leg should be 33-44 lbs depending upon occupants. I've been looking at using Sorbothane circular disc pads 0.5"" Thick 1.5"" Dia. 50 Durometer. According to Sorbothane's design guide, that should load each disc appropriately.  

I forgot to mention that none of the isolators that ButtKicker sells will fit my application needs. That's why I'm looking for 3rd party solutions.  Any suggestions will be be most appreciated.",AskEngineers,H0kieJoe,/r/AskEngineers/comments/61ix24/best_bed_isolator_for_bed_with_buttkickers/

97,"If I wanted to do something truly idiotic, how long would it take me?",1490480594,"My degree is in fine art, I took the minimum amount of math to graduate high school. I'd been trying to become a sci-fi writer for a few years now, and I realized that this design idea I had for a plane might actually be feasible and could maybe work as a surface to space shuttle for mining asteroids. I'm 32, I'm way too fucking old to go back to school, especially for a field that I'd need to just go start from scratch, especially when I'd probably need to do 2 years of community college and then 4 years of undergrad and another 2 years in a masters program, but the idea won't shut up so I figured I'd look into it.

If I wanted to be an aerospace/astronautical engineer, how many years of schooling would that take?

Edit Explanation of Idea: The idea is to make a plane using mold injected/3D printed parts from an airloy (alloy based aerogel) where the carbon dioxide is replaced with hydrogen and medium is made from the least dense material possible (likely bismuth/titanium based alloy). The plane would be built in the shape of a manta ray, and fully able to bend and move like one as well, and would be piloted using a neural implant (the ones they make that look like a net that lays across the surface of the brain) which would allow the pilot to move the plane like their own body and also be designed with neural feedback so they'd be essentially swimming through the air. The plane would largely use lighter than air buoyancy, flying a bit light a sub in water, using water vapor from clouds too adjust buoyancy as well as using that with sunlight as a fuel source (hydrogen) when flying in earth's atmosphere. I was originally picturing this as a plane that could make intercontinental supersonic flights running off just sunlight and water vapor, so I was seeing it as having like 20+ cage prop fans for maneuverability and a few external jets, I guess for space flight they would all need to be rockets, I don't know maybe they don't need the fans. 

Anyway, my thought was that creating this would make it possible to begin mining asteroids, after I had a dream where I was explaining my plane on Bill Maher and one of the guests said to me, ""Hey it's cool you're making a fortune selling roundtrip tickets to japan from LAX at $20 a pop, but you realize you could use this for mining asteroids right?""  (I realize the idea of selling roundtrip tickets from Japan to LAX sounds ridiculous but in my dream I'd figured out a way to make it profitable, mainly by shipping lots of cargo in the hold below.) 

Second Edit: In the dream, in Bill Maher's new rules segment he made a joke about the guy checking out the plane looking up the tail pipe and asking the pilot to turn his head and cough.

7,beach umbrella calculations,1490399376,"Want to calculate whether or not a beach umbrella will be ""uprooted"" from the ground in 25mph gusts if it is secured in the ground with concrete base.

More details: each umbrella has about a 7 ft diameter. The shaft of the umbrella will be mounted and secured in a sleeve that is fixed in concrete in a hole 12 inches into the ground, about 12 inches wide and will be mounted straight up (90 deg angle with the surface of the ground). The shaft will be secured with a retaining pin. The top of the cubic concrete base will be covered and secured with pavers (tiles). 

The current configuration is your typical beach umbrella with a circular base that weighs 75lbs and is about 24in in diameter. These never get blown over but the umbrella shaft gets lifted out of the base since it is not secured by a retaining pin. 

I can make assumptions for the force applied on the umbrella due to drag, but how would i be able to determine if the base will be heavy enough and secured enough to not be uprooted through the surface of the pool tiles.

The material is conductive, a primarily graphite composite with somewhat variable homogeneity and significantly variable non-symmetric thickness (because of the production line limitations) that is cast onto the production line and hardened into a thin sheet. The measurement process is put right before it's rolled onto a ""bale"".

* electromagnetc (it's conductive but non-homogeneous material may prove exceedingly difficult to work with)
* ultrasound (same issue as above)
* using indirect methods like light

I've been looking around trying to find the right formulas for my problem with no luck as of yet. My old Strength of Materials textbook is in storage a 4-hour drive from me, so using that isn't really an option. Here's my situation:

- I want to attach a steel I-beam to the underside of the ceiling joists in my garage, and have a chain hoist on a trolley up there. 

- Span is 200"", 2x10 SPF Structural grade lumber, spaced 16"" on centre.
- Chain hoist is 1 ton capacity (unlikely to lift more than 600# or so)
- I beam would span four or five joists, across the centre of each. 
- There is no load above the joists. My garage was framed for a 2nd storey which was never built. The roof trusses are supported by the walls and ridge beam, there is absolutely no load on the topside of the ceiling joists. 

Questions:

- Is this safe?
- How should I attach the I-beam to the joists?
- What size beam should I be using?

40,Trouble Keeping Talent in Government. Should I Stay?,1490286918,"I work within the federal government in R&amp;D, and we recently lost our intern (BS Mech, pursuing MS Mech) after 2 years to the private sector.

Our offices manage different projects within DoD. It can be very hands-on -- we work closely with different companies who develop the technologies we request, and a lot of the products are really cool.

But, we're also project managers, and there's a mountain of paperwork that always needs done. Very often, more time is spent on paperwork than real engineering activities. And given the seniority of other engineers on our team who dislike paperwork, our intern found himself constantly dealing with documentation since they were more than happy to delegate.

I think this is one of the primary reasons we lost him. He's just starting his career, and he needs to be developing his skill sets. As a mechanical engineer, he wants to do more design work and other hands-on tasks. I wish we could have provided that opportunity, but the day-to-day emails, forms, and bureaucracy kept getting in the way of true engineering.

I completely understand his situation, because I used to be the intern before I was promoted. But, after spending time training him how to do the engineering and the paperwork, only to see him jump ship, I'm wondering whether I should jump ship too.

*****

I'm also just starting my career (BS and MS Industrial Eng, under age 30). But with the serious lack of young people in the government, somehow I skipped the work that junior engineers typically do and catapulted into project management, research, and publishing in scientific journals. There's a big need for it, and the government has trouble recruiting and keeping talent.

I'm afraid I did this too quickly though, and I'm afraid if I try to make the leap back into the private sector, my skill set won't match what those companies are looking for for someone my age. I think our intern felt the same way.

On the other hand though, a significant portion of the federal workforce is retiring in the next 5-10 years, including half of my team, which means there might be significant upward mobility.

I'm not sure what I should do. I'd really appreciate any advice!

TLDR:

41,Generating Energy from a Playground?,1490280189,"Dear Engineers,

Long post ahead! Sorry in advance, but props to you if you read it all.

So, for a Master’s degree project, my group and I are planning a socially &amp; technologically innovative outdoor playground and workout station for a Project Management course. However, we don’t know anything about Engineering at all, and we’re hoping to get some advice from you Actual Engineers. We appreciate any and all input. Even though our initial project is initially wholly theoretical, the possibility exists to submit it to the relevant committee afterwards, so we are taking this very seriously. 

In the area that we’re studying in, a large factory is being renovated and extended to be a social and cultural centre (including the public library and a museum). Our theoretical project wants to add to this by providing a more practical and physical way of interacting with the space: by building an outdoor playground and workout station next to the old factory.

However, we’re really set on integrating this outdoor space with the cultural heritage and history of the factory in terms of the actual playground structures, and especially design. Meaning, we’re not interested in generic playground structures, but we want structures that relate to the history of the area and the factory. Think, for example, of quite industrial-looking playground and workout stations. In the end, everything will be custom-designed and spread out over a grass area – not enclosed and fenced off.

We’re envisioning approximately 5 different types of exercise equipment and 5 different types of playground structures, and we would commission 2 of each. So we would commission 20 structures in total, all with energy-generating technology. For further info: they won't be huge castles with slides, but the small type of structures that one or maybe two people can use at a time.

Now comes the extra tricky bit. In the name of sustainability and innovation, we came up with the idea that the structures (both playground and workout) could generate energy when they are being used. Of course, if this is even possible in the first place, this would require some serious electrical engineering and underground wiring to a central energy collection point, from which the gathered energy could be used for, say, powering the nearby streetlights.

First of all, do you think that this idea is even remotely possible? If so, how long would it take to design the circuits?

Secondly, considering the technology involved (and despite the lack of information on the exact materials), how long do you think it would take to produce all the necessary parts?

Lastly, once all the parts have been made and transported, how long do you think it would take to install it on-site?

Thank you all so much for any input you may have. Of course this is a lot to think about, and I presume that different types of engineering are involved as well, but anything you have to say will help greatly.

TL;DR: How long would it take to develop an outdoor energy-generating playground and exercise area, from circuitry design to production to putting it all together?

I tried looking up different terms and i found tensile strength and flexural etc. but it doesn't directly explain what I need to search to find this type of flexible but strong plastic.  
  
So the harder or tougher the plastic is to break (versus a weaker one at the same length and thickness), the harder it will ""Rebound"" to its original shape when it's bent. But what type of property measures or explains how bendy a plastic material can get versus just snapping in half?  
  
I am looking for the pole to have a fishing rod feel to it. I have tried fiberglass which worked great, it was real stiff, but if you really bend it back it arches like you would not believe. And it reverts right back. Only problem is it cut up my hands after a while. I want to use plastic.  
  
if I can find a rigid plastic at those dimensions that can also bend like a bow without breaking and revert back to hold its form, that's be the best.

49,Applying controllable uniform radial pressure on a cylinder,1490246682,"I'm trying to build a fixture where I can study the internal construction of a sealed cylindrical assembly under external radial pressure.   

The area of the cylinder where I would like to apply pressure is metric, 20mm in diameter, and around 100mm in length.  

I'd like to have a fixture that applies a uniform radial pressure, tuneable between 1 MPa and 12 MPa.  

A design criteria is that the entire fixture should be constructed of nothing more dense than aluminum (including fasteners, probably), because I will need to X-ray the assembly while it is under pressure to see the effects on the internal construction.  I work with X-ray inspection often and I definitely want to avoid steel or anything ferrous.  

Right now the best solution I have come up with is machining a plastic bushing, or using a rubber sheet, to fit snugly around the cylinder, and then attaching multiple aluminum shaft collars around the bushing, and tightening the collars down to a certain % compression.  Then obtain the stress-strain curve for my bushing material (I have access to an Instron) and assume that certain % compression (compressive strain) corresponds to a certain stress.  

Anyone can think of a better way of doing this?  My main concern is that it will be difficult to measure the compressive strain *in situ*.  

It would be really beneficial if I can know the pressure applied on the cylinder as accurately as possible.  


I thought at first of using a hydraulic fluid of some sort but such a solution seems rather bulky, difficult to X-ray, and I'm not sure how to make a good 12MPa seal given the small area to work with on the cylinder.

52,Career advice for an entry-level electrical engineer,1490237503,"Hi guys,

I'm a bit frustrated to say the least. I interviewed for a position at my company in the Portland area for new college graduates, which I was able to apply to since I've been with the company for a year and a half since I graduated... as a technical writer. It required an electrical engineering degree due to the nature of the company (semiconductor software), but it is still obviously not an engineering job. There were several openings for the type of engineering position I applied to, but I was initially told I couldn't apply since I already worked for the company. I found out this wasn't true, so I applied to the last opening for this year.  

Anyway, I didn't get the job. I had LTspice, Verilog, object-oriented programming, and of course EE experience. Not as directly tied to the job, I also have materials science experience, optics experience and have some graduate work done towards a masters. I even knew a guy on the team. The team works on the other side of my hallway, so the hiring manager's office is the first office I see everyday I walk in. The interview went fantastic and they spoke as if I had gotten the job. When they notified me that I wasn't hired, they said it was close but that they went with a candidate with ""deeper experience"". This position did accept master's candidates, so I'm thinking that's what happened. However, it's still really disheartening that I couldn't even get an entry level position which I was highly qualified for within my own company that I've been with for 1.5 years.

I spent 5 years in college getting an electrical engineering degree with minors in both chemistry and math. I worked 14-20 hours a week my last two years of college at an internship doing field work for the power company to support myself while in school taking 18 credit loads a term. I took additional mechanical engineering coursework, and have received a grant to work on research. I have experience working in a machine shop as well. 

I've already been told by several different engineering managers that I'm qualified and a great fit for the engineering role I've been trying to get into. The role I got turned down for was for both a technical and customer interfacing role. I prefer a role that lets me interact with people. I had two different engineering managers approach me about this 4 months into my career (although they didn't have openings). 

I'm applying to a lot of different types of electrical engineering and customer interfacing engineering roles in the semiconductor industry, but I'm afraid that being a female that's taken a technical writing position has greatly hurt my chances of being taken seriously as a candidate. 

I was looking at other people's resume's online and noticed back in 1996 you could get a computer science associates degree from a community college and get a job as a software engineer. Within a year, that guy got a job at Intel that now takes a masters/phd and 15+ years experience (I know this because I saw the same job posting today). Back then you could buy a house on that salary and not have any student loan debt. It makes me frustrated how much easier it seemed back then.

So, what advice do you have? I feel like a completely inadequate failure and I don't know what to do besides spam out more jobs and hope I get a bite. I keep my linkedin profile active and try to reach out to people that I can. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

I graduated in spring 2016 with a BSc in ME and was almost immediately offered a product development job in a very unique field. 

I absolutely LOVE my job. We're a small team of engineers -- 4 including myself -- so I've been given a large amount of responsibility in a very short amount of time. I'm talking lead my own project and fly accross the world to pitch it to clients type responsibility. I love crunching the numbers to do the design work, and I'm really good with clients face-to-face. But I feel as though I'm in way over my head, and I don't know what I'm doing most of the time. Pile that onto the fact that my team is completely overloaded with projects, so I work ~50hrs a week (I'm the slacker of the team btw) in a very fast-paced high-stress environment.

Like I said, I love my job. I'm making decent pay for a new grad, I have amazing benefits, I love the team I work with, the work is interesting and I'm being challenged intellectually... but I just cannot keep up with the workload. Not only that but because I'm working at 100% capacity all day every day, I'm exhausted by the time I come home and want nothing more than to turn my brain off with Netflix which leads to a very unhealthy and anti-social lifestyle.

Ideally I'd like to stay at this company for a few years. It's phenominal experience and I enjoy it, but I don't know if I can keep up the lifestyle. Is it normal for engineers to be this overworked? Am I simply taking too long to adjust to the lifestyle change of full-time employment? Is it unprofessional of me to meet with my boss and tell him I feel overwhelmed with the workload? I'm afraid of the repercussions I would face with my team -- if my workload gets cut, it has to go somewhere and we're all already overloaded. What makes it worse is that my team doesn't seem to mind working 50hr weeks, so who am I to tell them I only want to work 40?

I know that leaving and finding another job is an option, but I'm afraid I'll regret it if I do.. Who would employ a recent engineering grad who left their job after only 1 year because they were 'overworked'?

So much math! After what most of you smartypants would probably consider a laughable amount of time i have finished designing the majority of it....except one part! This part is is about half the length of a #2 pencil with a similar circumference. Attached to it is a block the size of a bar of soap. I need the non-bar of soap side to snap into the base of my product which is approximately the size of a vending machine soda cap (the twist top kind). I would LIKE it to have that satisfying click sound you get from a pen but i really just need it to stay in place when you click it in and come out of place when you click it again. I first looked at designing it like my pen, with an end that ""falls"" into a groove when pressure is applied and removed when the pressure takes it out. This looks like a NIGHTMARE to manufacture with my CNC machine. Anyways, i would be forever grateful if anyone has any suggestions or a repository they could point me to for sparking some ideas. I have looked at a few patents but my feeble brain couldn't put two and two together like when i look at a physical object like my pen. Thanks in advance for your time!

62,Alternatives to injection or compression molding?,1490213024,"Hi guys. 

I'm a couple of steps away from having the tooling produced for some compression molding for a food grade silicone baking/cake tray. 

Before I go any further i'm just trying to rule out any alternatives to these methods that may not be as common or obvious. 

Compression and injection molding have the obvious pros like low cost per unit, quick production time, consistency etc...

They also come with the heafty tooling price, for someone whose never done this, it is worrysome to drop £3-5000 on something that i've only ever seen in CAD. 

I've got some prototyping mock ups using 3D printing in the pipeline to make sure it will achieve the desired results and highlight any problems I might encounter. 

An issue i'm facing is part of the mold that gives it its character would involves an undercut in the tooling. This immediately ups the tool price because of the added complexity. 

At the moment we are making the molds for our chocolates with silicone resin that we pour over our 3D printed positives. If this was cost effective I would do this indefinitely but even with the most economical pouring, you still waste a lot of resin.

So far the alternatives that have been ruled off are;

* Vac Forming - Have tested with various plastics - didn't work.
* Silicone Resin - Too expensive and inefficient for mass production.
* 3D Printed Molds - Too expensive, not flexible, not food safe. 

These are the most obvious mold production methods I can think of. If anyone can think another angle i'd love to hear any ideas you have. 

I am not an engineer so forgive my ignorance in anything I've asked. I've tried to be as clear as I can but I may of missed something so feel free to ask me to clarify any points.

Thanks in advance, if you can suggest another more appropriate sub, that would be great too!

Although I've also got some other tactile switches I want to use for stuff like On/Off or volume buttons, but I'm not sure if that would really part of the gamepad. The thing is, I don't know where to start. How do I put this gamepad together? How do I make it into something that is recognized by the computer as a game controller? I'm using RetroPie, so if it uses the GPIO pins it either has to have a way to be recognized by the system as a gamepad, or put a lot of modification and customization into the system. I'm not really worried about casing at this point, as the gamepad will eventually be integrated into the handheld. I'd also like to be able to play PICO-8 games with it in addition to the RetroPie.

85,I am building a volumetric display and I need your help with a high fps projector,1490167402,"As the title states I am building a volumetric display.

The method of choice is a revolving helical screen, ideally with ~24 rps, and a single high fps projector (lets say 120 fps) giving 120/24 = 5 depth pixels.

In order to sync the screen's revolution to the projected frame I want to use a vga signal and lock the screen's motor onto the Vsync pulse.

Common projectors support 60 fps. My idea was to double the frequency of the Vsync and Hsync signals and thus doubling the fps of the projected video.
I have extremely low requirements on the output resolution or color depth so a slow changing r/g/b signal compared to the sync pulse doubling is not an issue.

My question is a follows:
Is there a low budget projector I could buy that would accept a higher than 60Hz frequency in its VGA input? Bonus points if it reaches 120Hz.

Currently our system has a xxx-xxx-xx part number format, the first three numbers being the project or part group, the next 3 being the part id number and the last 2 digits are the revision. I want to replace the middle 3 digits and delete the last 2 digits(since fasteners do not require revisions) with a code of some sort that tells me exactly what the fastener is. Im wondering what kind of systems have you seen that you could recommend and how do they work?

Thank You

8,"Is extensive (40+ hours) non-technical, non-safety training normal for you at work?",1490112550,"I'm a somewhat recently graduated electrical engineer at a large company (so far, my only company as an engineer).  In the last couple of weeks, the engineering staff in my company's division (about 6 engineers in my group, probably about 50 or so total including mechanical, design, process...) were assigned 40-50 hours of online training to complete by July.  The training is on topics like how to vet vendors (something none of my team do), very high level design (higher than either I or my manager could conceivably do), and statistical process analysis (this one was pretty cool but totally irrelevant to what I do).  The rest of the staff brought up that it is too in-depth and time-consuming with our manager but he said it ""came from on high"" and there was nothing he could do about it.

Is it normal to have that much non-technical, non-safety training?  Or is it something relatively unique to my company?  40-50 hours per person (about 300 man-hours) seems like a lot to me and honestly I'm not learning anything because it's in-depth but I'm not practicing it.

9,Food Industry vs Pipeline Integrity vs Mechanical Building Systems,1490112066,"Hello, just wondering if there are any people in here that work in any of these industries. I am fortunate enough to have the opportunity to move into any one of these after leaving my current job. Some background on the positions:

**Food Industry** - Pretty cool position. Probably the most interesting but unfortunately the pay is terrible and in a terrible location. A foreign company needs a local person to help them build a multimillion dollar food processing plant. Would be the only local person on their team. If it paid more I would pick this position but it would pay 20k less than what I currently make. Has anybody in here had a similar position and would they recommend taking this position for the learning possibilities and future opportunities gained from obtaining this experience?

**Pipeline Integrity** - Similar to what I do now, seems like an awesome group of people, the work would be alright but the location is poor.

**Mechanical Building Systems** - I have no experience here and there is a healthy mix of people saying that they either hate it or love it. HVAC, plumbing, and fire protection systems. Can anybody provide some insight to this industry, what are some pros and cons? Really want to hear good things about this because it is in one of the best locations in the country but it seems like so many people say it is boring. Might be fun programming some DDC stuff but I think there is a lot of REVIT involved in this position.
If anybody can give me an example of their experience in any position similar to these - it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",AskEngineers,Tempeaccnt,/r/AskEngineers/comments/60of4s/food_industry_vs_pipeline_integrity_vs_mechanical/

11,GFCI tripping when equipment switched off,1490094483,"I have a quite complex machine with servo controllers, multiple inverters yada yada. It trips the GFCI whenever it shuts down.


We have tried different GFCI circuits and it always trips. I have found no wiring faults, the machine powers on with no issues and there is no leakage current when running. I can't measure if there is any leakage during switch off because my meter is too slow.


I suspected the GFCI is already seeing quite a bit of leakage as many other equipments are on the circuit, so we pulled a line from the neighbour's factory. Much greater amp capacity and no other loads, but... same thing. GFCI trips when power is shut off to machine.


There was also a weird instance where the isolator was off and I was disconnecting the machine 3 phase wires and when I pulled out all the wires (3ph and earth) the gfci tripped. I was never able to replicate it though.


More info, local power is 3ph 415v Neutral and earth. Machine accepts only 3ph and earth, 415V. No input choke.


Help me, I'm stumped...


[edit] by gfci I mean RCCB, I have a bad habit of lumping MCB RCCB ELCB all under GFCI, is this even correct? who knows, I dont.


By the way, I am thinking of placing the equipment on a circuit without a RCCB. This is commonplace here but I am unsure about the regulations since I'm not a sparky, but the sparky in charge of this factory says ""Don't do it, anything happens it's on you"". He did not cite regulation nor reason, I'm wondering if he is just avoiding trouble when he knows just as little as I do. This is frustrating.


Anyway the current RCCB has a trip limit of 100mA, machine shell is all earthed. Am i wrong to think that not using a RCCB would not make it any less safe?

I excel in my classes, maintaining a 3.7 GPA, do well in labs, design projects, etc, am trying to build up my modeling skills (solidworks) although I am not the best, and have beginner/intermediate coding skills using C++ and matlab. The problem is, I feel like I don't know SHIT compared to other students in terms of real world machinery/applications. Until machine design, I couldn't tell you what a bearing was, in fact, when people talk about specific machinery parts I feel extremely ignorant because I do not know what half of them are;  I don't have experience with robotics (or where to even begin); I can't even tell you a definitive area of engineering I want to get into. 

For example, I joined FSAE and quickly realized how far behind I was compared to other students. I ended up just doing a bunch of FEA in solidworks for various parts in the vehicle system because just trying to learn all the different car components in and of itself seemed impossible. I just feel like I have encountered numerous scenarios where I am the guy lacking insight into certain problems because I simply don't have ""common"" engineering knowledge about electrical components, machine parts, etc.

Ive worked extremely hard to get to where I am at academically and will be damned if I fail professionally after all my hard work.

Also, because of my current work experience I qualified for ""advanced standing"" with my co-op requirements so I was able to bypass all three rotations, so I don't have any experience with that either. I did interview before my advanced standing was approved and had 5-6 official offers but turned them down once it was approved. My employer currently pays for my education and would terminate my employment if I attempted to take an educational leave for a co-op. I also couldn't co-op with my employer because I am currently part of a major union and the dynamics of going from hourly to salary and back was too complicated according to HR.

I enjoy conceptual mechanical design: Dynamic/kinematic relations, motion analysis etc.

I prefer design more than analysis, but I use analysis only to get the design to function properly.

I have high mechanical intuition/ spatial intelligence or visualization skills.

I can do some simulations.

I am good with microcontrollers/robotics/ mechatronics etc. 

I do enjoy product design/Rendering..3ds Max, Photoshop.

I am trying to fix a cummins C55 D5 power generator. I don't have a lot of experience with it but I got its manual and reviewed the error codes. There are multiple warnings, and I think they are related.

Firstly, the oil pressure shown in the operation panel = 0 Kpa despite the oil tank is filled and there is no leakage.

After its power is On, an error of code 1435 is shown which indicates that the coolant temperature is low. After that, an error code of 359 that it can't start appears.

I believe that the 359 error is natural because of either the 0 oil pressure or the 1435 coolant low temperature or both of them.

**My question about the 0 oil pressure:**

Can it be just oil sensor problem? As I said the oil tank is filled.
Can it be the oil pump?

**My question about the 1435 low coolant temperature:**

Can the coolant heater be the problem? or the coolant itself needs to be refilled? (I was informed that their owners put only water for the cooling system)

2,Compressible flow behavior through pipe system,1489779735,"I have a question related to compressible flow through a pipe system. Lets say I am trying to flow a pressurized gas through a pipe system at a desired mass flow. Can the flow become choked through the system once density drops low enough for the velocity to hit sonic velocity for a given mass flow (Meaning can straight pipe and not necessarily a converging section choke the flow)? I understand one of the conditions for choked flow is that the downstream pressure must be roughly 0.528 times the upstream pressure. Would this mean then that the mass flow rate would be determined such that the pressure loss through the entire system would never drop the density (and thus the velocity) low enough to reach M=1 for that mass flow? Also, by extension, would that mean that flow becomes choked at the system exit if it is dumping to atmosphere?

Specifically I am trying to analyze a poorly designed feed system that has a pipe inner diameter that is far too small for the desired mass flow and trying to analytically predict what was seen in testing. There were multiple contractions and expansions in the line so would it also be possible that one of those are the limiting factor? In a static problem with an initial pressure and an atmospheric outlet, the downstream pressure after the contractions should never reach the critical pressure ratio by friction loss alone, however then could the initial transience as gas tries to flow (where the downstream pressure after the contraction would be atmosphere) cause a choked flow situation?",AskEngineers,jabier1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5zzsyp/compressible_flow_behavior_through_pipe_system/

8,Static when using cigarette-lighter powered FM transmitter.,1489768669,"Hi all,

I have a small but annoying issue: when I plug something that draws any fair amount of power into my cigarette lighter, I get static. For example, using a cigarette lighter to USB adapter to charge my phone, when I plug my phone in, I instantly lose a fair number of stations to steady static.

I recently purchased a bluetooth FM transmitter so that I wouldn't have to plug my phone into the tape player AUX port I have (too many cables going on in my car). It works nice, but because of the power draw, I get a slight whistle/whine, which occaisionally changes pitch with the engine of the car. In addition, I also lost a number of radio stations, which I can get back by unplugging the transmitter from the cigarette lighter. It happens on both the keyed lighter port and the battery-powered port. 

Normally I'm pretty good with cars, but this is beyond me. How can I ground it out (not sure if that's the issue or what) to stop the loss of radio stations? There aren't any AUX cords to play with, it's as simple as a bluetooth FM transmitter in the cigarette lighter that my phone is paired to. When I listen to 88.3FM (the channel that the transmitter is broadcasting on), I get a whine that's constant and disappears (to static as there is no channel on 88.3FM in range) when I unplug the transmitter.

How do I stop this? It's driving me nuts!

9,Struggling with Codes and what they actually mean,1489767559,"Hi guys, 

I've been struggling somewhat with work recently. Structural Engineer, all fresh faced and still heavily in the phase of ""do the checks to help you understand it so when you use the design tools you have an idea of how it works and you're not just shoving numbers into a black box.""

The problem I've been having is working through these examples does not really help any understanding at all. The codes often feel pretty obfusticated and so it's almost going full circle and going back to plugging numbers in and going from there.

Does anyone have any advice on remedying this? Is the best idea to just get some textbooks and look over things I haven't covered before to try and get an intuitive understanding of the systems involved?

14,Moisture content of Foundry Sand measurement problems,1489763569,"I am working on a job where my boss told the customer​ we could measure the moisture content of Foundry Sand but we have never ran a system that had that capability before (at least not since anyone at the company has been working here). My boss selected the probe and it's my job to make it work. It has been over a month of testing and it has been wildly inaccurate.

The goal was to measure within 0.1% the moisture content of Foundry Sand that can have between ~1% and 3% water content. We have a probe facedown on a conveyor that feeds an elevator and then the elevator feeds the hopper. Experimentally the probe has been about +/-1% which is useless for our purposes.

We have used conductivity readings in the past by using 2 wires in a hopper and a transmitter that measures resistance and outputs analog signal. No one at the company was around back when we used such a system and i could not get this to work either. This method is extremely unreliable because the grain size and compacibility and bonding content varies wildly since this is a new system and the sand has not been tempered.

Does anyone have an idea that can be used on a continuous system of this sort? I am all out of ideas at this point and I don't want to stay here away from home for the rest of my career. The only reliable method I have is to heat the sand and measure the difference in weight of the sand before and after.

15,Confusion about analog signals,1489761076,"So i am learning about analog and digital signals and there is one thing that really confuses me. I have looked into a lot of articles, but i still feel confused and would like to ask somebody with actual knowledge, which is why i came here, hope that's fine.

I get how analog signals are continous and and for any point in time you will have a unique voltage value, which is why to digitize them you have to sample them at a certain frequency and then quantize the actual values to have a digital representation of them, which per definition loose some amount of data. So far so good.

What is confusing to me now is the waveform, so if i get this right every sound is repesented by a waveform of a certain amplitude and frequency because sound moves in waves through the air particles. But in examples i only see one continous tone, how about music, would it be a collection of thousands of these waveforms on top of each other and really high freqencies ? Then why does something like this not look like a Waveform: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~fricke/projects/waveform/screenshot.png ? Is that just the sum of all the underlying waveforms at any point in time and the more there are, the higher and the more irregular the amplitudes get ?

And finally, how does it work for video signals, i understand that certain voltages represent certain colors, and for TV transmission certain protocols are used so that sender and receiver can distinguish when a linie starts and ends and what voltage a certain color has, but is the underlying form here also a waveform ? Light is transmitted in waves as well, so i guess it should be, it's just that i can't seem to find a really clear answer/example to this.

I only have servo speed, stall torque, and voltage. Which is quite little. 

I know that the entire load that i need to be concerned about will be the load created by weight of the parts and, the load created by acceleration. The load of acceleration is the unclear part to me. 

1. First, i need to know do servos accelerate to max speed in a set time or do they accelerate based on their load (unloaded servo would spin up considerably faster than max loaded one) ?

2. Second would be the calculation of the acceleration load, it would clearly be quite different based on which way servos sped up.

3. Third question is, if servos speed up on a set time, what f the acceleration load is higher than what servo can handle, how will it behave ? 

4. and lastly do you have any tips on how to calculate all the relevant parameters.

26,Help with step rate pump tests,1489711494,"Throwaway as regular account ties to my workplace and I don't want to show my incompetence.

Well the senior hydrogeologist just quit from our small in house drilling company. I am a junior hydrogeologist who just started a couple of weeks ago. We have two projects going: I am finalising a report on an injection borehole into a limestone aquifer, analysing injection tests, PHREEQC etc. I'm meant to be learning the ins and out of pump testing from the senior hydrogeologist

The owner has just called me into a meeting and essentially told me I have to design a step rate pump test, constant rate test that the senior hydrogeologist was working on. This is the start of the second project that I was going to move onto after I finish the report. Call it imposter syndrome but I'm freaking the hell out. They told me they are looking for another hydrogeologist but the project cannot be halted.

The geologist is sandstone medium grained partly unconsolidated. The inner diameter of the borehole is 50 mm made out of PVC-U class 12 and goes down approximately 35 - 40 m with a 15 m screen. The surface water level is 5 m bgl. The borehole is going to be used for construction for a new highway. They will be utilising 100,000 m^3 of water over the course of the year or approximately 250 m3 per day (3 L per second).

I do not know what pump I'm using? Do they interchange pumps during pump tests and production? 

The step rate test is four - 1 hour tests. Given the size of the borehole, we can't pump too hard. However I don't want the step rate test to be too soft nor do I want to dry out the borehole (which I doubt given how the depth of the aquifer). 

I'm thinking the test should be 2L, 4L, 6L, 8L per second. 

For the constant, I'm thinking the pump test should be constant at 6L per second. 

Again, I am just suffering from imposter syndrome. Thanks for listening and any advice would be appreciated. I got heaps of books describing the process of pump tests but they all say experience will tell you the rate you should pump. 

I just hope they get someone very soon.

* -It will be exposed to UV
* -Should stick to metal but not glass as glass must be removed periodically for maintenance.
* -Interior of collector shares air with living space so off-gassing must be avoided/safe to breath
* -The more longevity the better. changing out the gaskets for maintenance will require scaffolding.

I'm dividing my time between ""career-related"" things such as sending out job apps, revising my resume, working on my LinkedIn, etc, and doing ""resume-boosting"" things, namely reviewing old material in hopes of passing the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam and obtaining my EIT certification. I feel like I didn't really gain a solid grasp on my courses the first time around, so I wanted to take this time to review all of the core EE material - circuits, signal processing, semiconductors, etc. I feel like it would have a positive psychological effect on me by giving me more confidence (which would reflect well in interviews, I think) and of course the EIT certification would look good on my resume. However, I was doing some reflecting, and perhaps taking the FE wouldn't be the most effective route to take. Instead of that, I could be doing more hands-on stuff, like learning LabView, practicing building complicated circuits with a breadboard, reviewing all of the programming languages I've learned, or even doing my own project with a Raspberry Pi or Arduino.

Basically if I want to regulate a hair drier's temperature, I can simply install a snap action or bimetal reed switch to open/close the power to the heater (drawing about 3A at 120vac).  The one I used is rated at 55c (and 5A) and so ends up maintaining a temp of 119-125F which is pretty much ideal.

The problem is that I pulled the data sheet and this component is only rated for 6000 cycles- this makes for a very short lifespan in the field.  Granted we're only switching at 3A, still going to be a long term problem.   So I wonder if I could use this switch to instead activate a SSR that would do the actual toggle of the resistive load and in that case, the bimetal component would be switching a load of mA instead of amps.  Am I cheating to try to do it this way, and could my bimetal then be expected to last indefinitely?  Are the ratings relative to only the internal switch arcing or is there bimetal fatigue involved?

Normally i would simply thread the pipe and inlet connector, however the pipe cannot be modified. 

Ive looked into cable glands and was wondering if there was any kind of gland that could he tightened significantly to grip the pipe.

Alternatively, are there any temporary types of fixing that can squeeze or grip a pipe/cable/tube to prevent axial motion? 

EDIT: looking into it i realise what im looking for is some kind of push-fit that is able to be significantly tightened. ",AskEngineers,LIFTSHIT,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5zidbs/temporarily_fixing_a_pipe_in_a_test_rig/

I'm having one of those days where I think im overthinking things!

I have a power transmission shaft (50 HP max)  used to deliver power from an engine to a wheel. I also need to run a small pump from the shaft but am concerned that the pump will significantly impact the torque delivered to the wheel due to it having to pump oil. 

Im looking at two solutions to the problem currently, the first of which is a torque limiter, which will limit the amount of torque delivered to the pump therefore limiting the affect it can have on the output of the shaft. I feel this may be somewhat overkill however. 

Edit: Talking about friction plate torque limiters in this case.  (I'm concerned about the wear of running something like this continuously slipping. )

My other thought was to simply use a belt to connect the pump to the shaft (gearing down) and therefore reduce the affect of the pump on the shaft. 

Which of these is the better solution, and why? Many thanks for any help you can give! ",AskEngineers,EdCChamberlain,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5zenkr/how_to_limit_torque_decoupled_from_a_shaft/

Obviously this method isn't really possible.


An idea that I had was to install pressure and flow monitoring equipment at nodes in the air system - at pipe junctions, valves, machinery, drains, receivers etc. - so that pressure drops could be pinpointed to be between certain piping equipment, however this does not help in quantitatively identifying the losses. This would of course be useful in determining the location of the leaks, but at this stage I am more interested in the cost/benefit.

So I am part of this program at my university that allows us to travel to Thailand and create a sustainable engineering project with a community in the developing region. An important aspect is that we plan on implementing a solution that aligns with the community needs and is most beneficial for them. Our goal is to provide clean drinking water to a community of 400-500 people. The chiefs within the community are interested in this project and want it to succeed. 
In order to provide clean drinking water, we intend to take water from an existing water well and put it through some treatment process, where the final drinking water will be collected in a large tank. The community members can refill their water bottles at this tank. 

We have contacted one vendor that has provided a bid full of items such as pumps, filters, a reverse osmosis system, etc. When we ask for him to provide technical specifications on the document, he replied, saying that cultural norms dictate that there are no very specific spec sheets. He will write down a maintenance plan of some sort and the system is guaranteed under warranty for up to a year. He will also perform maintenance on the system if need be up for a year. Now, I think it is somewhat foolish for students in engineer undergrads to design a system for drinking water, much less one with such little info. However, a possible solution was to allow this vendor to have full control and design a system to what he thinks is adequate, and let him hold responsibility and liability of the system. 

An issue is that this vendor is not the most technically sound individual, which comes into play when designing something like drinking water. However, he has had experience installing these treatment systems for many years for communities around the region. In fact, he has installed a system for a nearby neighbor, one close to the project site. 
We cannot fully guarantee the water quality of this system, as we will allow this vendor to do all of that. We feel he may be less stringent on standards of drinking water. We do not want our project to be associated with bad quality drinking water. Essentially, we allow the vendor full reign to design some system that we hope works out well and gives good drinking water. Is it ethical to allow this vendor, who has been doing this work for years, to design a drinking water treatment system for over hundreds of people when it seems like he may not be a water engineer? One recurring theme seems to be doing something in the US vs. that in rural Thailand. Maybe the vendor’s method is just the way of doing things there in Thailand, and who are we as Americans to insist our methods and ways into the community? 

Some members on the team feel if the community members get used to the water then the system breaks and cannot be fixed, then they might get sick again from returning to their previous source of water. Their previous source of water was taking city piped water, which was not put through any treatment process, and letting it sit overnight so that the sediment can settle down. Then the day after, they would use that for drinking. 

Also as a side note, we got the well water tested, and the test did not encapsulate everything, but it did include things such as hardness, heavy metals, manganese, fluoride, etc. The results showed that the well water, itself, met all of the Thai drinking water standards, and just missed out on the manganese limit for the US EPA.  

There are still some details that I might have missed out on, so please feel free to ask! Thanks and I can’t wait to read your responses!

34,Electrical Engineer -&gt; Software Engineer,1489435368,"I'm an EE that's been out of school for almost 6 years. Most of my work experience is in transmission power (at a big utility). I managed to get myself stuck in a p&amp;c policies and procedures 3 years ago and have hated it greatly. I wasn't in love with my field support role I had before but it was fine.

My location isn't a major one as far as my company goes. Not a lot of opportunities here. I love the company but I'm just not located well. My wife loves her job and career. I am not prepared to move and cause her to uproot.

So, I went into EE thinking I would work on the silicon industry. A lack of appetite for grad school, geographic limitations, and work-life balance lead me to abandon that dream. It was a tough call between computer science and electrical engineering. I did take the object oriented (java) CS classes while I was in school. Also, I've worked some in Matlab, VBA, JAVA, C, assembly, HTML, Python. I've played with VMware hypervisor, Docker, Linux, networking, etc. But I have little to no professional experience with any of it. It would be a stretch to call myself proficient in any of it. 

I'm open to any guidance. However, my best idea so far has been to go into software. I enjoy programming. But really I just love computers and technology. I can't seem to get an entry level software development job. I'm trying but it's hard to get your foot in the door when you can't say, ""yes I'm proficient in the technologies you work with"". Work takes up so much time and mental energy that it's hard to dedicate time on my own to learn more and gain experience. I'm also a part time MBA student so that isn't helping. I can't pick something and learn it. There's so many things to learn and that I find interesting and very little time. 

What steps should I take to get into the computer industry? Is there a field other than software engineering that would be more easily relatable to EE? I need something structured and defined to take action on. Preferably not getting a new BS or MS.

TLDR: I hate my boring EE job. I need to be working in computing and technology. Help! I feel stuck and unsure of what to do in order to get there.

I need a little help with bearing groove design, and got a little lost in my machinist's handbook.  Basically what I am looking to do is use ball bearings to replace a machined part to reduce cost and increase reliability in one of our systems (see link for graphic).  The bearings must serve a few purposes:

1. Allow the gold body to rotate freely around the grey body.
2. Allow for no linear translation between the two bodies.
3. Prevent the two bodies from binding if cocked due to an offset load.  The clearances between the ID of the gold body and the OD of the of the grey body must be very small (less than 0.007"" per side).  

I have no experience in bearing groove design, and am not sure what tolerances would be needed to achieve the above requirements.

As a side note, I plan to use bearings with a diameter of 0.125 +/- 0.0005"" and a sphericity of +/-0.0001"".

46,HELP: How to have an interview for an internship I know I will not take.,1489409957,"(TL:DR; at bottom)

I know the title sounds like a bad decision but its my current situation. My university uses a website called handshake that we use for internships and interviews. I applied to a whole bunch of full time internships over this coming summer. I recently landed a fellowship that will turn into an internship using Computer Aided Machining on airplane related material for Boeing (biggest bone I've ever been thrown but that's a story for another time). 

After I received the assurance of this fellowship I realized I would have to take a few summer courses (won't interfere with the fellowship) that would interfere with any fulltime internships that I applied to on handshake as they are 8-5 Monday through Friday. I recently received notifications that I am a primary candidate for two internships through handshake and I have interviews set up this Wednesday and Friday (3/15 and 3/17). Now I plan on taking the fellowship because it is much better for what I plan to do and they will pay for my masters degree later down the road and could even get my foot in the door with Boeing (my dream job). But the problem is handshake has a severe no show policy for the interviews that I have to take for the two internships I will not take (I couldn't even if I wanted to because of the summer courses).

All that being said, I have never had an interview for anything besides a server job for a restaurant and have no idea how to prepare myself in such little time, let alone for my first interview. I have no idea how to treat this, I know I will not take the internship but I must take the interview...I would love to use these as practice for later interviews in my life/career and I need some guidance. 

TL:DR;

I am forced to have an interview (first ever interview) in two days time for an internship I will not take. I need tips for interviews with an engineering company, as well as guidance on how to treat this interview as I know I will not take it.

So I am working with a food processing plant trying to come up with a way to help improve the process in making chocolate peanut candy. As I am nearing the end of the project, my group and I are at a crossroads where we have come up with ideas, but are having difficulty bringing those ideas to life because either they are not worth implementing or because we do not have concrete evidence and data to support our claims. What we have found is that in the process of making the chocolate peanut candy, the most waste occurs in the spray tubes where peanuts come in and are sprayed with chocolate. One area of concern are what are called ""cannon balls"" which are basically large clumps of chocolate which get coated together. These can cause problems as they can get large in size (basketball sized) and as the tubes are rotating, these cannon balls crush candy that is already being sprayed with chocolate. This in turn leads to waste in product that cannot be re-worked because a crushed peanut is one that cannot be used. One idea we have come up with that we believe may work is changing the size of the spray tips that spray chocolate onto the incoming peanuts and coat them. We believe if the area that is being sprayed can be increased slightly then that may reduce the amount of cannon balls created due to chocolate being collected in one specific area. The problem with this idea is that we are not sure how to support our claim about changing the size of the spray tips. Feedback would be much appreciated.

I've performed well, judging by my productivity, feedback from superiors, customers and other  company departments. I'm also on the ASME committee that writes the ASME code book for our industry. However, due to poor planning before graduation and needing to get a job, this was not my ideal industry to work for long term. My plan was to start looking at other industry once I've done 5 years. However, due to recent changes in the company, I'm prompted to start looking now.

People always talk about switching jobs 3-5 years lead to higher salary comparing to staying at same position for long term. But does that apply to only same or similar industry? If I were to look for position at a completely unrelated industry, should I expect similar or higher salary (I realize different industries have different pay standard, but let's say as a general average)? Or would I reset at entry level salary?

81,Using magnetic and pneumatic levitation together?,1489190553,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev

These are the fastest trains. Considering the normal applications of high-speed travel, it is natural to assume that the fastest train is most suitable for traveling the longest distance. However... maglev, while it has existed for decades, has never been implemented in a setting with a track longer than about 30 kilometers. The longest maglev in the world is 30 km, in one of the largest metro areas in the world, and [it has been a giant financial disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Maglev_Train). But nobody has even considered trying to use a longer track to achieve better ridership, even though, really, the difference between 200 kph and 300 kph is pretty small if you're only going 30 kilometers. Acceleration is a thing after all.

The reason it's only applied over short distances is that maglev tracks *must be full of electromagnets*. A 1000-mile maglev track requires 1000 miles of electromagnets; constructing a maglev from New York to LA would cost trillions of dollars, and starry-eyed fantasies like a space elevator might actually be *cheaper*. There is a version with [permanent magnets instead of electromagnets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductrack). This would ""only"" cost about ten billion dollars per mile, or so.

But a linear induction motor [can generate lift even in a totally dumb piece of metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_induction_motor#Levitation). The limitation of this scheme is that the lift/drag ratio is essentially zero until you hit about 100 kph (as the graph shows, lift only gets big after thrust starts going down).

On the other hand, pneumatic levitation has an excellent lift/drag ratio at low speeds, which nonlinearly gets worse at high speeds. Pneumatic levitation is unviable for high-speed transport because [the vehicle must continually collect air from the atmosphere which is not moving and accelerate it up to speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hovertrain#Momentum_drag), a phenomenon called ""momentum drag"". At low speeds, momentum drag is not a (significant) problem.

It seems that if you implemented *both* forms of levitation in a single train, you could switch from pneumatic to magnetic levitation once you reach a speed at which magnetic levitation will be effective. This speed could even be as high as 100 kph. A great deal of research has been invested into reducing Inductrack's minimum operating speed from about 30 kph down to 3 kph, but Earnshaw's theorem implies that it will always need a fail-safe at rest. I can't help but think the track would be much simpler -- and therefore cheaper -- if you allowed a higher operating speed for maglev and shift most of the design complexity to the trains by implementing pneumatics. Building a multi-layered track full of coils between LA and NY is probably never going to happen. But if the maglev track were simply, say, two rods of aluminium each 10cm in diameter, then you really could lay a thousand miles or even ten thousand miles of track at a reasonable cost. At 10000 km that's about $150M worth of aluminium, which doesn't seem prohibitive.

83,"Need suggestion to improve my ""robotic arm""",1489185548,"So my school recently ended their robotics program because they couldn't afford it anymore, and they couldn't sell the VEX parts due to it being almost 5 years old and worn out. They threw out their old parts, which i just salvaged from the trash. There are still several motors that work, and cortexs. I took these home not knowing what to do with them. I was recently watching a shot about tech and saw something that caught my eye- a exoskeleton!
So i use a 13 inch*7 inch steel plate as the arm ""base"" itself. I then made a enclosure that will fit my arm basically bending some metal. I then added a small chamber with 14 (yes fourteen) motors and made it so there are seven on each side. I put this compartment where my biceps are, and made a small hinge mechanism connecting the upper arm to the forearm, and a small gearbox under my biceps, above the elbow. Now the motors and gears were set up, so i made a way to control it- i made a small chamber thing with my thumb in a different enclosure, there were 2 buttons above and below my thumb which controlled the arm movement.The arm was able to lift up to ~30 KG but had trouble holding it at a 90 degree angle. I have a gear ratio of 10 (5 tooth driver, 50 tooth driven), but i did make the gears ""hot swappable"", the driveshaft just conneceted into a motor with a small screw and did make something with a gear ratio of 0.10 (5 tooth driven, 50 tooth driver), which made the arm basically go flying everywhere.  Now you may think it is good, but this is just a prototype. The insane 14 motors heated up the metal to the point of almost second degree burns. The battery barely lasts 10 minutes, and the gears (i have tried metal gears, plastic gears, and nylon gears) keep stripping.

86,"If you wanted to build a well insulated shed (R30) from common big box store materials, with 2 windows and a door, how would you do it?",1489180454,"TL/DR: I want to build a well insulated shed for with good thermal and acoustic insulation, but I also want 2 windows and door.

I'm considering building a shed in my yard that will be just under 120 square feet. This happens to be the square footage limit under which a person can build in my city without a permit. The dimension is the dimension of the roof. So I'm thinking of building something with an interior dimension of 8 x 10, with walls that are very thick -- 6"" of insulation then interior and exterior sheathing &amp; cladding. I'll probably use plywood as the interior cladding, to help give the walls some strength so that I can prioritize insulation on the all interiors. I might drywall over that just to help with some of the acoustic insulation. 

I'd like to use my shed as a work area, much like a writers or artists studio, though mine will be more of a musician's studio -- I'll have some speakers and synth, etc. I might even sleep in once in a while if I work very late and don't want to sneak back into the house a 2am. (or if my wife as invited the inlaws over for an extended visit...)

I'd like it to be very well insulated, about R30. But I'd also like it to have very good acoustic insulation properties. The acoustic properties are to keep me from disturbing others, but also to keep others from disturbing me. The main sources of noise around me are loud trucks traveling by (UPS, FedEx, Garbage) or the neighbor kid's car that has one of those super loud mufflers and he idles it for a good 10 minutes every morning to warm up his car, and again in the afternoon when he gets home from school, and a couple of other random times each day. 

Anyway... my idea is built walls with 6"" of foam board insulation -- it comes in 2"" thicknesses, and they have an R-value of 5 per inch. I'm thinking of building ""studs"" up from cedar 2x3 laid flat, with foam glued in between them (or maybe balsa). Sort of an amateur effort to minimize the thermal bridging of studs. I'll probably use cement board for the exterior cladding, over OSB sheeting. Everything would be caulked well. The ""studs"" would be about 24"" on center. 

My bigger question is about the windows and door. I like natural light, so I don't want to skimp on windows, but I'd also like to have the best R-value possible, for the coldest periods and at night. My thinking is to have 2 sets of double pain windows -- awning style -- one that opens out, and one in, with a 2"" or 4"" space between -- so 2 window openings -- each with 2 sets of awning style windows. I could even put something inside the inner space if I wanted to at night, thought not sure if that would help beyond just the air gap.

As to the door, I think I could make my own. I've done this once before for another shed, but this time I'd make it super thick, and put foamboard insulation in between the door skins. I suppose the door frame will still create some thermal bridging, and possibly acoustic bridging.

Since the shed code doesn't limit height, I could have a very thick ceiling roof structure. I could pack that full of insulation, and make it very strong, possibly even have a green living roof up there with soil.

Not really sure what the best way might be to minimize heat/sound transfer through a foundation. What would engineers here do, if you wanted to build a shed from basic materials, that had good thermal and acoustic insulation through a foundation? I could pour a slab, or do pier style. Both are allowed. I could make the floor super thick, just like the ceiling. Thoughts?

I've recently left that customer and started working from my employer's home office in town. I've never worked here before so I'm essentially starting a new job even though I've been with the company for 2 years.

When I  (and some others) came to this office from the customer location, my boss wasn't quite sure what to do with us. He's juggling probably a dozen different sized projects for various customers. We're kinda being treated like wildcards that he can stick on any project he wants. Which isn't bad necessarily as I could get to see a decent variety of work. 

The problem is that I'm pretty sure he straight up lies to our customers about me, and others, have experience with and what skills we have. Yesterday he told me I'm going to LA to do electrical enclosure design with Autodesk Inventor. My boss straight up told me that he told this customer that I've used Inventor before, which is not true. He did this for other people too. I'm pretty sure he told them that I did enclosure design at the last customer I worked for. I've never done enclosure design before.

While I'm excited at the prospect of going to LA on the company's dime, I'm worried about potentially embarrassing myself, and my company, if it becomes obvious that I have no experience with what I'm supposed to be doing.

2,Friction loss through LDPE pipe,1489123101,"Hopefully this is in the right spot.

We're building a new home and have come to the point where we need to run the water line from our meter to the house.  Our contractor wants to know what size of LDPE pipe to run, he normally runs 1.25"" for most of his houses.  However, we're not standard.  We have a run of about 435' from the meter to the inlet on our house, and we're planning on running an irrigation system.

I've been trying to figure this out via some online calculators, however I keep getting negative number for friction loss, so I'm doing something wrong.  Our water meter size is a 3/4"" x 5/8"", and we're rated at 90+ PSI at the meter.  The length of run from the meter to the house is 435 feet with maybe a 2-5' elevation drop.

First what I like: our signage is second to none.  Easy to know where you're going at all times.  Second, our shoulders allow people to get over if necessary.  Great feature.  

Now the questions:
Why are interchange exits so long?  In most other countries they don't need to be so long and people get along just fine.  Seems like a very large waste of real estate.

Why do we have so many stop signs and four way stops?  Wouldn't roundabouts and yield signs accomplish the same thing using less fuel in cars because there isn't needless stopping?

Does our road design actually make pedestrians less safe? In more crowded areas you must be alert at all times. In America it seems our road system makes you never consider pedestrians.

Finally, in most countries they build closer to the road and it saves real estate. It seems in America we require huge setbacks for buildings for no reason.

- Why does the car stall when it's stationary and I release the clutch and the gas?

- Why do I need to depress the clutch and find the biting point of the car to move off?

- What exactly is the biting point? Why does it make the revs decrease and the front of the car ""fall"" slightly?

- How does the handbrake work as a mechanism? What kind of mechanical action does it take in order to prevent the car from moving?

- Why does the car crawl along on it's own when it's in gear and has gained enough speed?

- What exactly *is* a stall?

Sure I can memorise the instructions given to me about clutch control, but when I panic or forgetting my list of instructions i freeze up and tend to over rev or stall the car.

As part of my postgraduate study I've been given lab data in the form of local pressure readings from 40 points on a symmetric aerofoil (NACA0015). From this data I have been tasked with calculating the total lift and drag forces but I am completely stuck!

I have realised I need to divide the aerofoil surface into small linear pieces between every tapping and then find the vertical component of lift (or drag) for each tapping. I am presuming the total lift is calculated by integrating the vertical component over both upper and lower surfaces (possibly using the trapezoidal rule??).

I think the integral for lift may be as follows: 

L=-∫ (ps-p∞)cosθ.ds

44,Where can I find some performance values for materials typically used in aerospace panelling?,1488986666,"Hi there,

Some background - I'm trying to perform a material selection exercise using CES EduPack software. I'm creating a graph using a couple of difference material performance indices, and then applying some limits in order to narrow down the the number of materials. My hope is to have, within this smaller group of materials, an actual material which is currently used in aerospace panels.

If you aren't aware of the specific software I'm using, not to worry. What I am looking for are some limits. What I mean by limits are some material properties, along with values, which I could use to narrow down my selection. So in the case of aerospace panels, some manufacturer could specify at the design stage that they require a material with a fracture toughness value of 'xxx', a flexural modulus of 'yyy' and it also must be resistant to water, for example.

I haven't been able to find any specific numbers in my research so far. I'm not that surprised as I'd imagine that these performance limits may be a manufacturer secret, so perhaps there are some more generic numbers on the internet for say, an Aluminium panel.

I'd really appreciate any sources that I could use...

We occasionally run into stud failures, currently our check for the integrity of the stud weld is wacking them from the side with a hammer.  The studs never see a shear force in their application, so while this works as some sort of quality check, I looking for something with a bit more control.

I'm ideally I'm thinking that we would check the quality of the stud weld by torquing a nut to the stud slightly under its proof load.

49,Sizing a sump pump surge tank,1488985615,"At my company, I have been asked to look into whether a surge tank is required for a sump pump system. Specifically, there is a concern that upon sudden pump cut-out, the weight of the water column will act against the check valve, thus reducing its life. Furthermore, 'slamming' or 'water hammering' sounds have been observed in other installations upon pump cut-out without surge tank.

I have the basic spreadsheet to calculate the surge tank size, which requires input of pipe internal diameter, pipe length, pressure, flowrate, water density, etc. However, I am confused with the following, and hope fellow mechanical engineers can help:

For line pressure and flowrate, shall the respective sump pump duty point pressure and flowrate be referenced? Or shall I assume the static head pressure and flowrate under gravity of the water in the pipe? The latter makes more sense, since it assumes pump cut-out and pressure and flowrate (by gravity) causing the resulting 'water hammering' against the check valve.

60,How would you keep a clear dome warm?,1488958565,"Hi Engineers. I'm trying to think through a few problems with a theoretical home. I'm not an engineer, so please be kind. But if there's anything that jumps out at you, I could use the reality check. 

I've daydreaming of building a nearly transparent geodesic dome to live in. Similar to the 21 meter diameter [Dome of Visions](https://youtu.be/1Bn2o-xyS6M), the exterior may be covered in polycarbonate sheeting; but not the multi-walled ""insulated"" variety targeted for greenhouses (looks terrible). Being something of a greenhouse nonetheless, gaining heat on a sunny day doesn't seem to be a problem.

What has me puzzled now is handling cold winter nights in the Midwest (US: MN, WI, ND, SD). The R-value of polycarbonate is negligible, but the surface of a dome is small compared to the air it contains. A concrete foundation could be a thermal mass and have hydronic heating and insulation for itself, but I doubt it'd make up for the loss.

My untrained perception of *insulation* is that two zones (inside and outside) are kept apart by a low-conductive layer; often times trapped air.  The [Ski Dubai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_Dubai) complex manages an extreme interior temperature difference in part by a 5 meter buffer of air between ceilings. With that in mind, and assuming the cost of a covered dome frame is manageable, I wonder if a second dome on top of the first would do the trick. Let's say that between the domes is 1 meter of trapped air (perhaps divided into cells for debugging). Using the same low R-value sheets, would that make a thermal brake or would we still freeze? 

Somehow [this family](https://youtu.be/lc_clnBY-2I) seems to be getting along above the Arctic Circle, but something tells me that they're colder than they'll admit. That, or their loss isn't particularly bad, credited to the dome shape perhaps.

Forgive the broad question, but how would *you* heat a clear dome on a cold night?

67,Is it current or voltage that kills?,1488931381,"Ohms law says that I = V/R. Ive tried asking this other places online and people keep saying that voltage can be high but it's only dangerous if current is high. 

It seems like that's an impossible situation, assuming the following:

1. Human is in series with high voltage, creating a closed circuit with the source ground

2. The ""high voltage"" describes the steady state voltage across the human in series with the source, NOT the source voltage (so we're ignoring internal resistance effects)

3. D.C. voltage to make this easier to talk about

4. ""high voltage low current"" meaning current through that is much lower than ohm's law would predict for the given resistance/impedance. 

Examples where people seem to say ""high voltage but low current"":

- tasers
- electric fences

I was under the impression that these discharge a capacitor VERY quickly, applying a lethal current but only for an incredibly short amount of time. 

Current limited circuits are also brought up, but I was under the impression that circuits like that modify voltage or modulate the signal to keep average current below the threshold, which would also prove the point that you never have a situation where you have high voltage and low current AT THE SAME TIME.

Am I completely wrong here?

Fellow engineers, suppose you were a process engineer at a generic petrochemical refinery, and were tasked with monitoring the health of heat exchangers on your process unit.

I have a question about hydrogen fuel cell technology, and the recent emergence of vehicles using it more and more, like Toyota Mirai, Nikola One etc. I have even seen a large amount of announcements by large OEMs promising a hydrogen fuel cell passenger car on the market by 2018-2020 (Audi, Daimler, BMW, Hyundai...). Even Shell is pumping money to build hydrogen pump stations all of the sudden.

So my question is what happened in hydrogen fuell cell technology development in the last 10 years? What were the breakthroughs in the last 10 years to make such a big impact now (big as in large companies developing and delivering products all of the sudden)? 

That is the point of my question, because I do not understand what changed suddenly that everyone wants to be part of the hydrogen fuel cell cake.

87,Can I get a hand comparing these common hose clamping variants? Existing solutions vary by price WILDLY and it seems hacking opportunities are afoot.,1488858499,"Short intro, there are many kinds of hose varying in what they're meant to carry and at what pressure. The common thread among them is that they often meet a metal coupling and are bound to it with an outer metal ferrule. The ferrule is crimped on, within the crimping lies the devil.

There are crimping solutions ranging from those that [exist](https://www.spaldings.co.uk/vehicle-and-trailer/website/buildings-equipment/hosecomatic%C2%AE-hydraulic-hose-repair-kit) in the UK but have been discontinued in the US. There are [solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Mastercool-71550-Black-Manual-Crimper/dp/B000WBQ4U2) that seem plausible but are only advertised for certain applications. Lastly, there are a [variety](http://www.discounthydraulichose.com/Hydraulic_Hose_Crimpers_s/45.htm) of options that range from ($ x 10) to $^10 .

The first example is pretty much a pipe cutter with a dulled bit applying gradual and even pressure to the ferrule via rotory. The second example uses a six sided button lock, and the only version currently advertised for sale in the US seems to demand a six to eight sided bit ($150 at least) and a driver ($300) coupled to a hydraulic press (have found [diy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHkh_ybAsfA&amp;spfreload=5) solutions in the $400 range that require a further $400 for drivers and bits at LEAST). Couple this with the fact that you need a different set of bits for every hose size you want to crimp and a bottom end setup for a DIYer is a bit north of a grand.

Normally this wouldn't bother me, but apparently in the rest of the world (and the US back before 2001) have access to this modified pipe cutter solution which can be made for almost nothing.

What say you engineers? If using the second (automotive HVAC) option is definitely better than the first, the price is totally worth it. If it's the same, I'd rather make myself a copy of the first option. What I'm looking for is someone in industry to come by and say ""dude, the other options aren't available in the US because of our strict anti-hole-in-head laws. If you're comfortable with a near 100% chance of hole-headedness, then go crazy. If, however, you've already reached the LD50 for holes in head (which rests steadily near zero), be wary.

Enquiring whether my methodology is correct, it’s been a while since I did anything like this and I might be barking up the wrong tree completely. See picture for example calculation: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/e3q48st.png)

Imagine a large vehicle, (Train Carriage) has a large weight and it Centre of Gravity (CoG). Values shown at [1]
Now imagine an alteration/upgrade is being done to the vehicle, you have the weight and CoG of the parts considered by the alteration only. [2] .    

I was trying to understand the net result weight &amp; CoG – the alteration doesn’t seem reasonable as I don’t expect it to affect the vehicle anywhere near what it seems to be.


So if I wondered if I had to take into account the much smaller weight of the alteration. 
Seeing as all the CoG’s are measured from the same axis location, I thought I could take moments around that point.

I translated the CoGs into moments, using F=W*g for the force, and then multiplying that by the distance (Moment = F*d).
I then added the values, and the force, and translated them back into a new CoG.

Is this the right way to go – or am I going about this all wrong?

I'm not too keen on the idea of just modelling things for myself because there is no end goal that motivates me - I like doing things for other people.

It could be buying spares/repairs and repairing them (probably electrical as I'm office bound - which I want to learn anyway!) any inspiration? Guessing custom PC's will be suggested but every man and his dog does that these days.

It could even be non-engineering related, I have recently had quite an interest in finance. Stocks and shares, buying and selling, etc. I am aware of people who buy cheap on online markets like Craig's List or eBay and resell for a profit. Any inspiration for this? Ideally combining this with the repairing side of things and I could be onto something!

30,Does Passing The Pe Exam Help In A Master's Application?,1488697994,"Hi all.

I am a foreigner (legally eligible for work in the US without sponsorship) who has graduated with an engineering degree in 2014 (Electrical and Computer Engineering).

I attended the best school in my country and the department was batshit insane when it came to grading on many of the subjects taken, which consequently had an effect on my GPA (2.84).

As an example, I had multiple C's on multiple subjects while being from the top 10% in the class. Failing rates in these classes were upwards of 70%.

In any case, due to the lack of experience, I haven't even been able to land an interview (Houston, TX). Since then, I had my degree accredited, passed the FE exam, and obtained my EIT certificate. I started applying again, but still nothing. 

Time passed, and then the board decided to allow EITs to take the PE exam. I bought the reference, studied for 3 months, and passed the **PE Mechanical Systems and Materials** test. I did some applications for the hell of it. Nothing.

So, I thought the only way out of this joke that is the job market is to get a masters degree (that I don't need). I passed the TOEFL a month ago with a high score and now I am preparing for the GRE (not easy for a foreigner, but I am planning to kick ass).

Now, with my **GPA being 2.84**, a decent score on the GRE, and me having passed the **PE Test**,

I need a little direction on a problem that was posed at work, and I'm a little rusty on my heat transfer, and my notes/Google have yielded no helpful hints. The question is the following:

&gt; Given a known geometry of a part in a kiln, in this case let's say a sufficiently long cylinder, how would you find a controlled rate of cooling of the kiln such that the rate of cooling is ""slow enough"" that the part sees very small (or negligible) internal thermal gradients (let's call this ""isothermal cooling"").

The kiln will be filled with argon, however let's assume most cooling will occur from conduction and radiation. Let's also assume that the Argon is relatively stagnant.

I would imagine this should be considered a transient thermal system, despite the fact that at any given time a snapshot of the part would appear as if it were nearly ""steady state""?

The second researcher also works with some of the largest north american automotive manufacturers and does research in dynamics and applications of controls to dynamic systems in vehicles. I'll be able to stylize my research to my interests in multi-body dynamics, controls and system simulation and have the opportunity to take courses like multi-body dynamics, non-linear vibrations, advanced controls, autonomous vehicles and AI.

Being in MechE, the first option seems like a comfortable route but many industries right now seem to be moving toward controls of dynamics systems and it's an area that seems very fascinating to me and I can see myself working in advanced tech businesses in automotive, electric vehicle companies and the tech industry in general.

70,Is it possible to make a X-Ray Plate Adapter that is one-size-fits-all?,1488555912,"I am seeking solutions for creation of a universal adapter for transporting X-ray imaging plates through a scanner.

Most manufacturers make digital X-ray scanners that use specially designed imaging plates that have a ferromagnetic backing. These plates are carried through the scanner by magnetic rollers that attach to the backing. While this improves the image quality significantly (since the transport mechanism doesn’t touch the imaging surface), it also means that in order to use the scanner the user needs to buy the special plates.  The goal is to create a system that allows imaging plates of any size or brand, including non-metallic plates, to be used in the scanner.

77,Need advice on Stirling Engine materials and Specific Heat,1488518458,"I'm making a stirling engine this weekend. The design is a basic stirling engine with a power piston and a larger heating/cooling displacement piston. The materials I have are 28 gauge steel and ~26 gauge Aluminum. I figured that since the bottom of the displacement piston will be near the flame, it should be steel. And that the higher specific heat of Aluminum would be beneficial for the top portion of the piston where the cooling cycle will take place. 


I guess that specifically, my question is if I'm understanding ""Specific Heat"" correctly. Since the aluminum requires more heat to rise in temperature it would be at a lower temperature while running than the same mass in steel, and since it's also less mass it would more quickly put that heat energy into whatever heat-sinks or heat-exchanger that I place on top of it? That sounds right to me, but I'm worried that I'm understanding it backwards and less mass in the aluminum means it will heat up faster than even the thinner steel (though I could double or even triple-up the aluminum sheets with a thermal-paste sandwich...maybe even space them to act as a heat-sink themselves). 

Is there some simple math I can do, below maybe Calc 2, involving the actual masses, densities, specific heats and possibly the surface areas of any CPU heat-sinks I put on top? Or is any of that actually necessary and I could just trust that one or the other material is the better choice from Specific Heat alone?

85,tightening two plates together when something is in between.,1488505316,"I am making a fixture for holding glass slides, but for the time being the glass slides are varying in thickness as we experiment with different thicknesses of slides, coverslips, and adhesives that make the slide thickness vary from just about 1 mm to just about 2.5 mm.
The fixture is essentially two plates, one plate has a bunch of instrumentation associated with it, the other plate only has the function of registering the slide and holding it against the other plate. 
Essentially it is a sandwich. In the future, when we’ve locked down the thickness of the slide, we’ll just have the plates designed so that when they are flush against each other they perfectly sandwich the slide.
Can someone suggest a method for attaching these two plates together so that I don’t put uneven pressure on the plates. I’ve seen screws/bolts that have springs on them, that seems like the right idea, but someone pointing me in the right direction would be nice.
