3,Are the hours/expectations like this everywhere?,1562724476,"Hey guys!

I'm hoping you all can help me out. I've been in this job since I graduated about 6 years ago. It pays pretty well, I'm right around $80K in the Midwest area, which I don't think sucks too bad.

To attempt to make a long story short, I'm experiencing some SERIOUS burn out in my job.

It's damn near my dream job. I'm working in my field (material science/engineering), and I used to love it. It's manufacturing. 

Recently, I've had more and more added to my plate. It's gotten to the point where basically, I feel like I'm failing at everything. I used to succeed in a big way. I really found my stride and I felt like I was good at my job. I got a promotion, but, nobody was hired to replace my old job, so I've kept those responsibilities. Now, like I said, I no longer feel successful. I feel like I have so many #1 priority things to do that I don't have the time to do any of them well, so, I do all of them poorly.

Originally I blamed myself and poor work habits. I bought a planner, tried my hardest to get more organized, knock out more little things that I seemed to keep forgetting etc.

But that didn't work for long. For a short while I felt like I was making progress. Eventually I was overwhelmed again.

I've found I'm consistently working ~50 hour weeks. I go home feeling absolutely drained. Even after a long weekend or some time out of work, I'll come in feeling refreshed and within hours it's all wiped away.

I even got talked to once for not checking my emails on the weekends. When I said any email could wait until Monday (granted, it was publicly and in not the best tone), I was told I came off as not committed. When I asked how work got done before emails could be checked at home, I was told ""We had more people then."" Which honestly just made me feel like they don't want to hire what's needed so they want me to work extra hours for no more pay.

I talked to HR and my supervisor about it, saying I will be quitting if things don't change soon. They've *said* they hear me and will be getting me more resources or something but...I don't know. I'm not seeing change very fast.

But, before I seriously play the card of ""I'm outta here"" with my dream job that I used to *love*, I figured I'd ask around.

Is this what I should expect? Particularly in manufacturing? I'd hate to leave a job in a field I enjoy only to find it's like this everywhere and I need to completely change my career plan.

I'm really hoping to make it work. But, I need to start exploring what happens if it doesn't.",AskEngineers,False,Argurotoxus,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cbahi2/are_the_hoursexpectations_like_this_everywhere/

7,Better way to turn semi-circle rotation into linear motion? (pics),1562714632,"Greetings,

Not really sure how to explain this ... but I need to use two motors (servos), that have a range of 180 degrees, and have them drive like a linear actuator. In and out; both directions. So given they move in a semi-circle fashion, it is not easy to get something like a straight action....

The only requirement is there is only one signal for both motors. Each will turn about the same time and at the same rate.

9,MechE/PetroE - US - Engineer/PM Rates on Projects Domestic/Overseas,1562707263,"I'm curious as to what the typical all in day a rate (inc. overtime, hazard pay, per diem) is for a MechE or Petroleum engineer working abroad or on projects away from home.  It's easy to find base rates online, but not the real take home rates for those who work on projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reason: I'm currently in the industry as a contractor working in project controls. Working in the US, on-site, on projects, my all-in day rate nears $1k a day (take home pre taxes, based on 10hr day w/ PD). I've been wanting to get into more interesting work as well as have a greater flexibility over whether to work domestically or internationally.  Additionally, I'd like to increase my income potential during times I work regular hours (not the usual 6 days a week 10hrs + for months on end). To do this I plan on returning to school to get my mechanical engineering degree and maybe work my way into petroleum engineering. The backup plan to that is making my way to project manager at an Energy or EPC company, I have most of the qualifications minus the engineering degree (seems to be my hangup). I already have an MBA and the PMP certification plus 10 yrs of field experience. What I don't know, is if I will go through all of this effort to end up making the same income I do now, or whether there's a bigger upside on the engineering side. Based on my knowledge rates/cost, I'd assume I can nearly double (or at least 1.5x) my income potential through engineering in the oil and gas industry, but I have nothing concrete. At a minimum, the number of options I would have open up significantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, hopefully some of you experienced engineers can help by sharing below.

&amp;#x200B;

MechE: Typical Day Rate working overseas on-site on a construction or well project (inc. OT, PD, Hazard pay)

MechE: Typical Day Rate working domestically on-site on a construction or well project (inc. OT, PD, Hazard pay)

Petroleum Engineer: Typical Day Rate working overseas on-site on a construction or well project (inc. OT, PD, Hazard pay)

Petroleum Engineer: Typical Day Rate working domestically on-site on a construction or well project (inc. OT, PD, Hazard pay)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, do you find these jobs to have a high demand for engineers (short on engineers who want to travel) or is it competitive to get these types of jobs. I can tell you on the project controls side, it's very hard to get international jobs without an engineering degree.

10,Does it make sense to freeze a 32oz. bottle of water and transfer it to the fridge once its completely frozen?,1562706820,"The reason I ask this is because I just moved into an RV and I'm trying to find ways to be more efficient and ways to conserve energy.  I remember reading in a book a while ago about building a solar greenhouse and they suggested stacking bottles of water to absorb radiant energy from the sun during the day.  At night the bottles of water would slowly release that energy as heat and help to keep the greenhouse warm at night, especially in cold climates and during the winter.  This thought popped back into by head as I was thinking about the fridge and freezer in this RV and I occured to me that the opposite might work also, allowing the unit to use less energy and possibly extending its lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

A little information:

The fridge/freezer in this unit will run on propane or electricity.

It's currently being powered by electricity, 120v grid tie.

I'm here by myself, so there's not a lot of stuff in the fridge or freezer, ie, thats a lot of empty space in both.

What additional information would be required to answer this question?  Also, I'm using two bottles of water and rotating them back and forth.  As the one in the fridge becomes liquid again, I move it back to the freezer and move the forzen one into the fridge.

Trying to figure out the best mixing scheme for a container which might be best to think of as 2 dimensional. Imagine this bag is rectangular with the long side vertically oriented. Also imagine the container is being held in place by a pinching mechanism which blocks approximately 1/2 the diameter through the middle of the container. Imagine 1 fluid is flowing into this container through the bottom, and a pressure is being exerted on the bottom of the container, which deforms to push the fluid upward in a pulsating motion.

What are some good 2D mixing schemes to build into this container in order to mix the incoming liquid?

Here's an idea of mine for an example: pinch the 2 sides around the pinching block in order to induce turbulent flow around both sides of the block. Use concave-down parabolic ridges in the container to funnel these turbulent streams into each other.

21,Engineering to data analyst/scientist/machine learning engineer. Has anyone done it?,1562697103,"Hey all, I'll go ahead and apologize for the length, but I really appreciate anyone that takes the time to read and respond!

So I've been out of school for 2.5 years, and working for 1.5 years. I studied mechanical engineering, but towards the end I gained a fascination with programming, data science, etc. I kind of self taught myself the basics of python during my time looking for a job, where I finally got hired into a role that was primarily of civil design. I did not care for it, and it bored me to death. I did have one project though, that was mechanical in nature (natural gas flowrate verification), and involved programming in VBA, and I absolutely loved it. This project lasted about 9 months, and then I was solely on the civil design projects again, and I was beginning to dread going to work. So I started looking for data science/analyst jobs, in addition to mechanical engineering jobs. 

While at my original firm, I began talking through LinkedIn with a senior data scientist at a local internet startup that has absolutely blown up over the last 10 years. I had seen they had a machine learning engineer on Indeed. I reached out and explained my situation. He seemed fairly interested in me, gave me some advice, even invited me to lunch with he and his supervisor (my job was 2 hours away from my hometown so this was tough). He also sent their hiring assessment for data scientists. He said no rush and to just have fun with it since they don't currently have any entry level positions, but were interested in me anyways. Felt they could teach me everything skill wise, just can't teach hard work, acceptance of failure, teamwork etc. 

Fast forward a few weeks (January or so of this year), and I had spent a little bit of time working on the assessment, and I got an interview request for a fortune 500 company in a mechanical engineering role. I went and interviewed, got the job, and started in March.

While it is infinitely more interesting than the last job, at least the civil design work, I'm already bored. The work isn't difficult, which might be part of the problem, as I don't feel challenged like during the VBA project. I'm doing some training about PRA, and while it's not super in depth, it just barely scratches the surface on the programming/logic/etc and makes me realize that it is what I want to do. I need to do it. There's no way I can see myself doing what my job currently entails, or anything similar to it, for the rest of my career. 

Has anyone ever switched from any engineering discipline to data science/data analyst/machine learning, etc?

Should I wait and spend more time here at my current company? I spent just barely over a year at my first firm, and have only been here for 4 months. 

Due to the rapid nature of the interview process and kind of being thrown into the fire at the new company, the assessment for the data position had slipped my mind. Would it be weird to just send it in if I were to finish it up as it has been a few days?

We have a quite successful system we've designed and built for underwater research in the ocean. The system streams up  3x camera streams, pressure and temperature data from the sea-floor. The system is used by researchers, however it is used on fishing vessels (they donate their time). That being said, the system is abused tremendously...

Currently, we use a mixed fiber/copper cable, it enters our underwater enclosure through a machined piece which resembles a top hat.
[See Here](https://i.imgur.com/yja5fax.jpg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/6DZskJK.jpg). The inside of the top-hat (second picture) is filled with [epoxy potting compound](https://www.mgchemicals.com/products/potting-compounds/epoxy-potting-compounds/translucent-epoxy-832c).

When the cable is first potted and sealed, we do not get any wicking thru the cable. However, once the outer jacket of the cable is compromised, we get wicking thru the cable into the enclosure. We had initially assumed that we were not getting a great bond of the compound to the wires, so we stripped and tinned the conductors and ran them through a spacer and then applied the potting compound. The idea being that the compound would bond better to the bare tinned conductors. We recently determined that didnt work and are still experiencing the wicking issue.

40,Question on picking the right motor and gear reduction for mid-drive,1562655039,"Hey all!

I am trying to build a mid-drive by myself. I  have worked out some calculations and now have the amount of torque and  RPM I need. I need help choosing a proper motor for the build. I am not  sure about the calculations being right so please do points out  mistakes if any. The power restrictions for my area is 250W and my build  should stay within this limit.

I''m assuming the total weight of the bike including the rider, battery and motor to be 105kgs. My max speed will be 25kmh.

I calculated the Air Resistance using the formula:

    RA = rhoCDAV^2/2 where RA is the Air Resistance, rho is density of air and A is area under contact in m^2 and v is velocity in m/s 
    RA = 1.225*0.88*0.4*6.94*6.94/2 
    RA = 10.38N 

I calculated the Rolling Resistance using the formula:

    RR = GVW*Crr where RR is the Rolling Resistance, GVW is total weight of the bike and Crr is co-eff of rolling friction which is 0.004 for bicycle tire and asphalt roads 
    RR = 1030.05*0.004 
    RR = 4.12N 

I calculated the Grade Resistance using the formula:

    RG = GVW*sin theta where RG is the Grade Resistance, GVW is total weight of the bike and sin theta is 0.196 for a grade of 20% 
    RG = 1030.05*0.196 
    RA = 202.09N

Acceleration force required to achieve 25kmh in 5sec with the GVW of 105kg is **145.74N**

The total torque required including the grade resistance is **83.6Nm**

The torque required on flat roads is **37.15Nm**

The RPM required to achieve 25kmh after considering a fudge factor of 20% is **240**

Now since it is a mid-drive the motor must be small, high torque motors  are bigger. So the best solution is to use a high rpm motor and use gear  reduction to achieve the required torque levels.Am I correct? I need help on choosing the right motor and gear reduction. I'm planning to use a 36V 10A controller so the peak power can be 306W...

41,"I am considering an engineering degree, but there is a lot of things I would like to know",1562654961,"So this is my situation. I just graduated high school. I live in California. I am attending a local community college to save money, and then plan to transfer to a four year university (ideally after two years). Up until this point, I was thinking about getting a degree in the field of environmental science. The main reason for me wanting to enter this field, as childish as it may sound, was because AP environmental science was the course I enjoyed the most in high school. However, after doing a lot of research this summer, I fear that getting an environmental science degree may not be the smartest decision financially. My family has always struggled with money, and as an adult, I want to be in a position of financial stability. I don't foresee that happening if I am making less than $60,000 by the time I am 30 years old. I then started looking at engineering degrees, and have found that they tend to be more employable and higher paying than almost all environmental science degrees. I have always enjoyed creating and problem solving. I have also had little trouble with my math and science classes in high school (I did take honors and AP level classes). Part of me is thinking this may be the direction I want to go in. All of this setup leads me to my questions:

1) Is there an engineering degree that incorporates environmental sustainability? I know about environmental engineering, but am not quite sure what that would entail. Is environmental engineering what I am looking for? I have heard some people on r/engineering call it a fake degree. Is that true? Is it comparable with other engineering degrees as far as employment and salary are concerned? Are there better engineering degree options? Is a Master's degree necessary to do well in this field?

2) What steps should I start taking now, as a student who has yet to begin my college journey, to make sure that I am heading down the right path. What are some things I should already start preparing for (classes, internships, etc...)?

This is my first time really considering this pathway, so I apologize if some of the things I have said are ill-informed or ignorant. Also, if there are some things I have not disclosed that you need to know in order to help me out, I also apologize. If you have questions for me in the comments, I will try my best to answer them.

(I'm asking this here because I now there's a lot of engineers in the UK here, and in the r/AskUK the bots always remove my post, as they think this is about Brexit).

for some time now I'm being contacted by some engineering outsourcing company in the UK starting in ""Al"" and ending in ""en"". It's a global company, the overall reviews in Glassdoor are awful and I've had a negative interview experience with these guys already twice, in 2 different countries. To say that I'm less than impressed is an understatement.

The only reason I'd come to work for these guys is for A LOT of money.

I'm a Mechanical Engineer with 4yrs experience, and I'm currently living and working in Belgium. It's a quite nice country, life quality here is high. I'm a permanent employee of the company, so none of that temp crap these type of companies offer. I speak 3 languages well, 1 OK and I'm learning a 5th one.

I'm passively looking, but my job situation is stable and well paid. I'm paid around 55k€ (gross) in Belgium.

What is the largest amount of money that I can ask these guys that they can borderline offer me?

**I want to pass the message that:**

- Me changing jobs will cost you a premium, I don't really need to change

- Leaving the EU for a country that's undergoing a volatile period will cost you a premium (I can put my things in my car tomorrow and go for any of the EU countries I want)

- Going from a perm employee in am OK company to a temp in a shitty outsourcing company will cost you a premium (throughout my career I've seen a lot of perms get sacked when things get rough)

- The £ has been steadily declining against the €, and that (you've guessed it) will cost you a premium

On the other hand, it would be much easier to get into an applied physics program after college, and I think I would enjoy it equally as much as engineering, although there is much less of a job market for that degree.

75,Need advice on the selection and setup of electrical components for a microfluidic cnc reagent printer,1562602886,"I am working on designing a specialized CNC machine and am currently in the process of determining the electrical system to control my stepper motors. The machine contains 10 stepper motors of varying sizes:

* 6x non-standard size (2 phase, 5V, 0.34A, 8.5mH/phase, 14.7ohm/phase) used for microfluidic control
* 4x NEMA 23 (2 phase, 2.3V, 3A, 3.5mH/phase, 2.4ohm/phase) used for xyz axis movement

&amp;#x200B;

All of the motors meet the torque and speed requirements for my application. None of them have encoders, but I will potentially have limit switches for my xyz motion. Two of the NEMA 23 motors will be moving the same axis, so I plan on wiring them in series off of a single driver. All of the other stepper motors will need independent control.   


I was thinking of using an Arduino Mega as a controller for my 9 stepper drivers. I am unsure if I should use a single power supply or two (one for the 4 NEMA 23 motors and one for the 6 non-standard motors), and I still have yet to determine what specific drivers or power supplies to use, but I plan to use [this site](https://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html) to help with determining my power supply requirements. My goal is to drive all 10 motors from a single computing device.

I’ve considered LVL beams but also cost is an issue. There are 80+ beams that will eventually need to be replaced but I plan on doing them in stages due to my budget. 

Finally, I’ve priced steel c-joists which I believe to be the best choice since they are lighter and have a lot of advantages such as fire, termite and moisture resistance.

90,"Linear actuator has limited speed, so should I stick with servo-motor-disk-shaft mechanism?",1562582754,"Hi,

Here's the **situation of the stop automation control in our church organ**:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7z-MZUr1DkUuvdsoSxyKKX6rRJVQ9e\_/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7z-MZUr1DkUuvdsoSxyKKX6rRJVQ9e_/view?usp=sharing)

* organ stops were originally controlled by pneumatic force
* late 90's an upgrade was done using DC servo motors, to which a metal disk was attached and to that a shaft that would push/pull the stop. Switch sensors at 0 degrees and 180 degrees and some electronics took care of positioning.
* currently, some of the motors are defunct, others have broken gears, still others provide too little force to move the stop

More details on the **requirements**:

* the linear action is 1 inch
* the speed should be fast, if not almost instantaneous (imagine the organ being played, pulling some stops and having to wait seconds for them to become active !)
* the force required for the heaviest stops would be around 200N (rough guess, I didn't measure it)
* special requirement: when *pushing* the stop, it should be pushed *completely*, preferably with some residual force to keep it in position. This is something that could be achieved by adding a spring between the actuator and the stop?
* retrofitting the electronics, using the current wiring (12VDC power lines + 1 control wire that has 0VDC/12VDC, depending on the required position)

I've been looking for linear actuators that fit these specs, but I'm not really convinced they'll provide a good solution, because the speed is generally low; the fastest that I could find, list a speed of 1""/s and that's definitely my limit!

When searching to buy online, Chinese manufacturers have models that *seem to suit* my requirements for around $30, while prices in US/EU start at $100 and up all you want (and I'll need at least 10 and up to 25 of those for the organ!). 

So here's where the more experienced readers can be of **help**:

1. are there other types of actuators that would do the trick? Is a linear actuator a good solution (and do I really have to give in on the speed requirement?). Or is the current servo/disk/shaft setup still the best option?
2. what mechanical component/construction could be used to connect the actuator to the stop, in order to have a ""permanent push force""? Is there some ready-made spring-containing component that can be used for this?
3. how can I connect a typical 2-wire actuator (reversing polarity to control direction) to my 3-wire setup (line 1: 0VDC, line 2: 12VDC, line 3: 0 or 12VDC, controlling direction)",AskEngineers,False,vicmortelmans,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cajhj6/linear_actuator_has_limited_speed_so_should_i/

What I don't get is where horsepower comes in. It's measured in watts so the more horsepower the more energy per second thats clear but I don't get how it reasults in higher speeds? If you google this you're always meet with torque\*RPM = horsepower and it makes sense unit wise but other then that I find this kind of vague. I keep thinking that if the force from the wheels to the gound is determined by torque, then once resistense equal to the force provided by the torque is meet there is no acceleration so torque would then be the limiting factor in speed?

To all of you who underwent a MSEE, how heavy is the math? For my EET program, I took two semesters of calculus, which was really calculus I, II, and III (we went into vector calculus for the last 1/3rd of the second semester). 

I have learned of CU's new MSEE program through Coursera. The program will not require that I have all the math courses of a traditional engineering program. 

My question to you guys: do you think the lacking of math courses will make this too a difficult task? I watched CU's webinar on the new program, the department chair only referenced the importance of calculus courses for the program. 

I am 100% aware that the EET is not as thorough as straight EE, so no need to pile on the ""technology"" degree here. But, for your reference, here are the classes I will have completed for my B.S. in EET from an ABET accredited University:

Programming in Python

Programming in CPP

Digital Electronics

Microprossesor systems engineering

DC circuits

AC circuits

Electronics 1 (diodes through multistage amplifiers)

Electronics 2 (FETS, OP amps, diff amps, oscillators, etc).

Yet asides from some very-beginning tinkering with electronics, I have very little experience to define what “Electrical Engineering” or General “Engineering” really entails.

2. [Expectation] I imagine Engineers to be fairly busy with their own responsibilities and projects to undertake job shadows which may interfere with their work. Should I expect many to not respond or decline a job shadow?

3. [Rejection] If someone is kind enough to communicate their rejection for a shadow, would it be alright for me to suggest a lunch or phone interview or would that be seen as rude and inconsiderate?

4. [General Advice/Tips] Do you have any general advice or tips that would help me in either getting a job shadow or getting more information about Engineering careers/opportunities, getting more experience with Engineering, etc.?

At this point i dont know what i need to search to find an answer and i keep comming back to the same youtube videos and articles that just dont help me.

**My Problem:**  
I have a tire that is standing on a surface and is not moving. I now apply a torque throght the axle on the tire. What is its linear acceleration? What is its angular acceleration? For Simplification i dont want to worry about tire deformation and slip ratios and so on. So the tire is essentially just a flat disc. 

As far as i understand it, the torque will push on the surface at the contact point with force *torque/radius*. Friction will counteract that force at the contact point and create a torque on the tire. That force will create a acceleration at the tire's center of gravity and the tire will move.

But wouldnt i now have a tire that moves but doesnt roll. Assuming infinit friction wouldnt that friction cancel out the torque and produce a net torque of 0, so no angular acceleration?

I'm currently attending an internship sort of related to my programme ( bachelor+master in energy efficiency) were my job is to investigate the performance of different wind power estimation models (grid owner wants to know how much you produce so there is a balance in the electricity grid) for different wind parks were the focus is to identify the surrounding costs. Even though I don't have a strong statistics background I would say I've had a clue on what I should look into until now. I've done some basic regression analysis(basically a trend line in a scatter plot) to relate the costs to NMAE for each park and some other variables related to the costs. 

**Problem**

But now I feel that I'm stuck and not sure how to proceed. I've been thinking I could do some sort of confidence interval to see the likeliness for the NMAE to be in a certain range in the future for each model and then relate that to the different costs or something along the lines. I have also had an idea to do some sort of algorithm in Matlab that combines the different models some way (because they have different strengths) and thus reduces the NMAE for each park and thus the costs. An other thing I've been thinking about is a way to know when the estimation model is 





I really want to deliver some great results as I think this is a pretty nice place to work at as it is a large energy company, I could do my master thesis there and career wise is a great opportunity. 


**TL:DR**

I feel that I'm currently stuck in my work flow at my summer internship and not sure how to proceed due to me not really having a optimization background.",AskEngineers,False,Grumpuff,/r/AskEngineers/comments/c9wki9/not_sure_how_to_proceed_at_summer_internship/

This might be a rather simple question to you guys but I can’t wrap my head around it. 
I am trying to 3D print a bottle rocket currently and I am trying to understand the maths behind everything. 
I know that to calculate Thrust I need the mass flow rate of the water and the nozzle velocity, however when trying to calculate the nozzle velocity using Bernoulli’s Theorem, I did not understand which pressure to use for the fluid inside the pressure vessel. I will use pressurise the air inside the container to around 40 PSI, would this be the the right pressure to use ?

Would anyone please mind talking me through it / tell what formula I could use to find the right pressure ? All online references I have found about this so far are not annotated very well and I do not understand the working behind them.

60,Confused UK student that dreams to work in Aerospace/F1,1562426498,"Hey engineers, I am 21 and I have just finished my access course with a place to study at The University of Edinburgh for Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.  I have watched almost every SpaceX launch Livestream since last summer and the NASA SLS promo video makes me want to shed tears. I love watching Formula 1 too but not as much as the rocket launches. I suppose my dream job would be working for companies such as Arianespace, Thales, ESA, Airbus, Rolls-Royce, McLaren, AMG Petronas, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not exactly sure what I want to do in these companies though, rocket engineering in terms of propulsion and guidance interests me the most I think, especially how SpaceX re-lands their rockets. I am a UK citizen so working for SpaceX or NASA is off the table unless I live in the US for years and become a citizen. This means European launchers are my main options for that field. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is what is the best way for me to get to where I want to go? Competition is extremely high. My best ideas besides obviously getting good grades and internships would be taking part in Formula Student, UKSEDs, a semester abroad at places like Caltech. Would not having an Aerospace Engineering degree hold me back?

&amp;#x200B;

I am also considering going to King's College London instead for General Engineering which would give me a strong shot at going to Imperial College London for a masters in Aeronautical Engineering as I heard Imperial grads are first picks for these kinds of jobs, especially F1. Although King's doesn't have a Formula Student team and their course is brand new. Cranfield University is another university with space engineering courses and links to the MoD.

63,"In 2015 Andreas Lubitz, copilot of Germanwings 9525, deliberately killed his passengers. Is it possible to develop a system to remotely pilot an airliner?",1562417758,"For those of you not familiar with the case, Andreas Lubitz was a copilot who suffered from mental problems. On March 24 2015 the pilot went to use the bathroom. Andreas locked the pilot out of the cockpit, increased speed to maximum, and deliberately crashed the plane in the Alps. All 150 people on board were killed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Air traffic control knew there was a problem with the flight, as it began rapidly losing altitude.

&amp;#x200B;

In such an instance would it be possible to engineer a remote cockpit where pilots on the ground could take over the plane and fly it to safety? Maybe each manufacturer would need a remote cockpit at their facilities with the ability to log in to an aircraft in flight. The flight crew would need to be locked out of the avionics system to prevent them from tampering with the remote pilots controls.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 8, 2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 also went rogue and nobody really knows what happened to it. It seems to me that if Boeing had the technology to remotely fly that plane the 239 people on board would still be alive.

&amp;#x200B;

On October 25, 1995, 6 people, including pro golfer Payne Stewart, lost their lives when the Learjet 35 they were on suffered sudden pressure loss. If Lear had the technology they could have executed an emergency descent and landing, possibly saving the lives of all on board.

&amp;#x200B;

On September 3, 2010, UPS flight 6 suffered a fire. The plane was flyable, however the 747 cockpit was so filled with smoke the pilots were unable to see their instruments or look outside the windscreen. Unable to line up with the runway at Dubai the plane crashed and both pilots were killed. Despite the severe damage to flight systems the plane was flyable. If Boeing had a remote cockpit it is possible the plane could have been landed and the pilots saved.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is September 11, 2001. Passengers called from those planes on cell phones and reported the hijackings. If the planes had been able to be remotely piloted many lives could have been saved.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this type of technology feasible? What are some of the limitations to developing this type of technology? How do you imagine such technology could be integrated into new and existing aircraft?

&amp;#x200B;

I’m imagining something like a flight simulator with a high speed satellite connection. At the first sign of an emergency it could be manned by an emergency flight crew. They would log in to the distressed aircraft. The simulator would get all the planes telemetry. Cameras throughout the plane could provide visual information. The controls in the stricken aircraft would be locked out. The emergency pilots could land the plane at the nearest airport remotely. The chassis on the simulator could provide realistic movement in aiding the flying of the stricken plane.

&amp;#x200B;

Would such a system be possible and feasible? It would need to be designed in such a way that it can’t be disabled aboard the aircraft. If somebody with bad intentions could simply pull a circuit breaker, such a system would be useless. Is this possible? 

&amp;#x200B;

How would such a system be hardened against unauthorized use? It would be really bad to leave commercial aviation vulnerable to a system that could be compromised to allow planes to be taken over in flight by unauthorized personnel.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a second engineering question. Cirrus Aircraft equips it’s general aviation aircraft with a whole plane parachute system. If there is an in flight emergency the pilot pulls a lever. A rocket deploys a parachute and the entire plane floats to the ground with an impact of about 4g. Could such a system be scaled up to save a Boeing or Airbus aircraft? 

&amp;#x200B;

Boeing and Airbus aircraft are very heavy. Would it be possible to fit the wings, vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer with explosive bolts? This way a large amount of weight could be shed from the aircraft and the parachutes would only need to lower the fuselage. Could an airbag be fitted to the bottom of the fuselage to cushion the landing? Something that inflates like the emergency evacuation slides? Fire kills a lot of airplane passengers. A lot of fuel is stored in the wings. If the wings are jettisoned this would solve that problem. Some aircraft have internal fuel tanks. Is there a chemical that can be injected in the internal tanks to render the fuel non-flammable? Would it be better to jettison the fuel?

&amp;#x200B;

I’m kind of an intern at a smallish manufacturing company. That’s really not the right word for it but anyways, a very low ranking not-quite-finished-engineer. I’m working in the quality inspection department and I have a pretty good grasp of the routine operations I’m supposed to work on.

My tasks include measuring samples and compiling documentation for customers. My foreman, a very nice dude by the way, asked me to look into improving the reports we provide customers regarding the products’ cylindricity. Now, the reports we have been making are pretty much produced by the default settings our measuring apparatus, a Rondcom 73a, spits out.

So I took a couple of hours to look at the report format and changed it to include relevant data. Easy peacy. But then I started to look at the finer settings and realized I didn’t really have a clue as to how cylindricity is really supposed to be measured. The old farts and my foreman seemed just as clueless.

Regarding the algorithm used, the default setting was LSC which I switched to MZC after reading [this short article]( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875389212003604)

&gt;Among the four methods, only the MZC complies with ISO standards and has the minimum roundness error value.

And then there is the question of setting the resolution, we have always used a default 50 UPR low pass filter which does not seem out of place when looking at the results, but are there any guiding principles on how to pick the resolution?

I do not believe anyone really gives a crap, our customers are, so far and have been for years, fine with reports that basically have a value for cylindricity and not much more. But god damn it if I'm going to do it I'd like to get it done right.

92,How to become mechanical engineer on a nuclear plant?,1562341959,"Hello fellow engineers, 

Currently I am a junior mechanical engineering student at well respected school. I am an international student as well..
Let me start by telling you how school is going. 
Well, it’s hard. Keeping up with assignments and 19-20 credits in a trimester school is hard for me. I work about 25 hours/week night shifts as well, which is sometimes hard.. 
so while I’m not a very good student, I am very passionate about what I’m doing. I have a lot of hands on experience with different trades such as electronics repair, several kinds of welding, wood work, house construction.
Some time ago, I decided what I want to do in my life, and it is - work in a nuclear related field, probably power plant, as mechanical engineer. I feel like there is a great future in nuclear 
So my questions are: 
- How hard is it to become ME in nuclear field? 
- Do I have to have an outstanding record, being an international student? 
- Currently I am interning at relatively big HVAC company - will it be of any help? 
- Any advices you can give me?

So I have been thinking a lot about where I want to live and work after graduation. I am very interested in outdoorsy stuff (hiking, fishing, interested in trying hunting) so my ideal location will have great access to all of those. I am also not really a big city person so I would prefer to stay as rural as possible (I know that's kinda hard with an EE degree). 

Ive lived in the Northern half of the East coast of the US for my whole life so I'm looking for a change from that. I think anything west of Texas would be really cool and maybe the mountainous areas of Tennessee and North Carolina. I like the western states a lot because of how much public land there is. I just don't really know what the job prospects look like in those areas. I'm not opposed to leaving the country but I'd prefer to stay domestic. 

I'm currently interning as a controls engineer in a manufacturing plant and so far I really like this type of work. I worked for a defense contractor last Summer but I found it be very slow. I like what I'm doing now so I think I want to stick with the manufacturing side of things. However, to me, the place I end up living is far more important than the job I have so I'd be willing to do about anything in the realm of EE. I think I have good qualifications and I don't think I will have too much trouble getting a job as long as there are some available.

My question is, is a masters in mechanical engineering worth it? Is there any significant difference in pay or promotion time?

6,24V DC Motor Pulling Too Many Amps,1562332673,"Dear engineers,

&amp;#x200B;

my pool has a 24V DC electrical roll to manage the floating cover. The roll is completely submerged.

After years of quiet operation, the roll's 7.5A fuse (inside a control box) broke a couple of times in 1 day, so I checked the current: whenever I move the roll, the Amps start at around 3 or 4 but then quickly climb up to over 10 (and I switch off manually). 

Aside from this, the motor seems to be performing its job fine (ie it pulls and release the cover just fine). I checked the roll and there is nothing preventing it from rolling freely.

The pool technician told me I need to replace the motor, quoting me a scary price. The guy also inserted an expensive transformer in the quotation, which sounds a bit suspicious to me: why do we need to replace it if the problem is the motor and we know for a fact that it gets power?

So my question is: can the motor suddenly begin to pull in more Amps, while still working? Or can it be the transformer? Or is there any other possibility?

I've been working at my company for about nine months and my team leader is leaving for personal (happy) reasons. A few months ago I was asked how I would feel about replacing her. I said I don't think I have the required experience with the company's technology, but that I wouldn't decline such an opportunity despite the challenges. When the actual offer came along I accepted. Possible mistake number 1.

Since she started handing over the role to me, I have been flooded by a torrent of information, interfaces, responsibilities and meetings. The sheer volume of ""top of your head"" knowledge required for the position is mindboggling to me. I keep getting asked if I understand things, and I answer that it's still new to me and I need to get used to it. To which she would reply that it's important that I familiarize myself with this stuff. I answered OK. Possible mistake number 2.

Mistake number 3 came soon enough, I still have my responsibilities as a team member, and because of some unexpected stress from my personal life I dropped the ball on it. I promised to give a presentation on some data that I hadn't even analyzed and only realized last minute that I would never make it. I told my team leader and my boss two days prior to the date, and they managed to move it, but the disappointment was apparent. They also told me that things MUST be done on time for the new date. Since then I've been staying at work late, coming in sick,and working from home to meet the new deadline.

My main concern is that I'm just not cut out for this type of work and that I'm too far into the handover process to pull out. My life has been miserable the past few weeks, I dream about work at night and wake up at random hours from the stress.

I came to this job with an M.Sc and 3 years of experience, but my experience has been working at a university, where management and deadlines are more abstract concepts than actual deliveries.

I feel like I broke the trust my bosses had in me, and that I'm doomed to be stressed out constantly or suffer the humiliation of pulling out of a role before I even started actually performing.

I am currently working at a small investment bank where my job is basically an over glorified salesman and all I do is clerical work. I hate my job and realized that I hate banking and the only reason I pushed so hard to break into it is because I was chasing money thinking I'd become a millionaire in no time (incredible folly on my part). Recently however, I've just been pursuing a somewhat newly developed passion of mine which is engineering, specifically electrical engineering. The reason this all happened is because one day I was sitting at work with nothing to do and looked at my computer and asked myself a very simple question. How does this computer work? And for the life of me I could not answer it! I could not come up with a simple explanation as to how this machine that I have grown up with my whole life works! So one thing led to another and I started reading up on computer hardware and software, how it gets its data, how wifi works, how radio technology works and I was just so fascinated because I was learning about how the world really works and how we as human beings mapped it out! I've since started reading some electrical engineering books trying to teach myself the fundamentals and basics. I'm tired of being an investment banker and feel like I'm not adding any value to society, and I'm tired of being surrounded by people who are so money driven and not curious about how things or the natural world works. I'm also tired of chasing money, especially when it doesn't bring me any happiness if I have to work in a field that involves long hours creating pitchbooks that go nowhere! I've made the slow transition on my way down the engineering road looking at certain schools and their cost of tuition, along with whether I should go for a masters or second bachelors. I believe that engineering might be a good fit for me since it's a field filled with people who love to build and create things and are always curious wondering how the f\*\*\* the darnest of things work. For reference the highest level of Math that I took is Calculus 2 which covered integration the whole class (took it because post graduation I was gunning for a MS in Financial Engineering, but dropped due to having a bad Calc 2 professor and work overtook my time, but funny how I was still pushing for a form of engineering even back in summer of 18 post graduation now that I think about it). 

My questions are:

1. Is there a difference between a Bachelor of Technology vs Bachelor of Science for EE? From what I gathered so far a BTech is much more common in India, and in the US a BTech only holds weight if it's ABET accredited. I also have gathered that it's much more practical degree than a BS where you learn much more theoretical engineering than hands on engineering.
2. Does the school you attend matter that much? I'm asking because in banking your school plays a huge role because banking is a very soft skilled industry where we again don't provide any physical value add. It's all about the network you have and who you can get meetings with, and the Ivy Leage Graduates = you can get meetings with people who have money. My understanding of STEM is that they don't care where you got your degree so long as you know your shit and can actually build and do the job. I'm looking to enroll into city tech (CUNY) because it's incredibly affordable and they offer a BTech in Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications. For reference I graduated from Baruch college another CUNY and broke in because of luck (the CEO who pushed for me just liked my personality a lot) and persistence (had a good amount of internships)
3. Have any of you made a career transition into engineering from a different industry? Do you know of anyone? How has it been for you/them? 
4. Is there anything I can do/read that you would recommend? I'm currently reading Electrical Engineering 101 3rd Edition by Darren Ashby but feel like some of the concepts are going over my head and that I'm missing some parts of knowledge to the equation.

33,Possible design for descendant based AC unit?,1562277398,"[https://imgur.com/a/GDSeOyg](https://imgur.com/a/GDSeOyg)

&amp;#x200B;

I just watched this video on an alternative to typical phase change closed loop AC units and did some more googling into typical swamp cooler designs, and figured I would like to build a slightly larger scale unit with a cooling capacity of a small window unit if possible. The image is what my current idea is.

&amp;#x200B;

**The idea:**

The white boxes are ""evaporators"" all of similar design. For proof of concept I would probably just buy some box fans and have the [moist pads](https://www.google.com/search?q=swamp+cooler+pads&amp;tbm=isch) on the intake side and output side with a source of fluid entering on the top and a tub underneath to catch runoff. The ""dehumidifier"" is mostly identical except instead of water, it would use an aqueous solution of CaCl2. The now more aqueous runoff tub would fed into a solar heater, brought up to near boiling, then continue to an outdoor ""evaporator"" stage, which importantly increases the concentration of the CaCl2 desiccant material whist also removing the heat to return it to outdoor outside ambient temps. The fresh, cooled solution returns to the dehumidifier to absorb the moisture from the room. The air exiting this dehumidifier stage apparently picks up heat in the process so this hot, dry air goes through a number of air ducts outside to dissipate the heat and return it to outside ambient temperature, then finally fed to the intake of the evaporative cooler which cools the dry air as it picks up moisture. The video used an additional evaporative cooling stage for this instead which I'm sure would improve performance, although it also adds complexity and introduces more maintenance concerns along with more water usage.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions:**

I don't really understand thermodynamics, I was wondering if my fantasy would work. I do plan to build it up later on but I have concerns about the performance and maintenance an open system would present. Fungal/bacterial growths are an obvious issue so perhaps some bleach should be added to the water for the evaporator and closed system for the CaCl2. UVC germicidal lamps may also be a welcome addition although it would adversely impact COF. What are the equations and physics I need to be familiar with do determine if this would work? Especially regarding heat exchange and temperature differentials of this form of cooling? What temperature difference can be expected from a swamp cooler alone? How does it change based on humidity of incoming air? what humidity differences can be expected? I guess the dehumidifier stage will need to be overall larger to prevent saturating the air with humidity indoors. To measure the performance of a system I would need to be able to monitor water usage since that isn't necessarily free.",AskEngineers,False,Power-Max,/r/AskEngineers/comments/c988b9/possible_design_for_descendant_based_ac_unit/
34,Looking to get an EE/CS education as an adult to help with a career change,1562276490,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello,

My friend recently took a non traditional academic route, and recommended I ask about this stuff on reddit, and after seeing the type of community, here I'm stoked.  I think some of ya'll might be able to give me some good advice.  Thank you in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE:THIS POST BECAME LONGER THAN I PLANNED BECAUSE I GAVE SO MUCH PERSONAL BACKGROUND AND BITCHED SO MUCH, YOU CAN SKIP TO THE NEXT BOLD LINE FOR THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS**

&amp;#x200B;

I got a BS in Recording Arts (audio engineering), part of a notable music school at a big state university.  It was a 4 year program, learned a lot about some things, plus I learned a little about a lot of things. i received very relevant hands on experience.  I'd say it was more of a trade school type program, with ""applied science"" type electronics and physics classes (some of which were actually in the physics dept, but the classes were geared towards non-majors).  Several music classes as well, but that's irrelevant to this discussion. I feel like it was a overall good program and adequately prepared me for life after school in that field.

&amp;#x200B;

I also took a CS minor which was a subset of CS and math classes for undergrad CS majors, and did pretty well in the classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally academically successful and enjoy school, or at least I find it satisfying to be challenged and learn new stuff, even if it wasn't always fun.

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked for a few years, mostly in live event corporate A/V production (but also some other type stuff..music, etc) and I think I'm ready for a change. I'm learning less and less each year and I'm getting less interested in the types of new things I am learning as I go on. The types of challenges I am facing are more in regards to people/management/logistics. I'd rather be faced with solving technical problems and challenges and creating new products/designs than winning and keeping clients, and pretending I am not bothered by unrealistic and constantly changing expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm realizing how client-focused my industry is.  More important are appearances, making the client feel good, and getting through doomed production situations (trying to do too much with too little) rather than organizing and executing a complex tech heavy event, where everyone knows what to expect and competently does their job and has the information they need, and things go as planned. Even the high level productions (not that I've worked on many of those) are still crazy stressful and long days, and everyone's on edge. The days are either a clusterfuck, or they're really boring. And at the end of the gig, the only thing I have to show for it, is a paycheck and maybe a few new connections - generally no new knowledge of something I'm interested in, no satisfaction of having created something that didn't exist before. A good day is just one where I got paid decently and didn't work very hard, and for me, that sucks from a work-ethic standpoint. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus a lot of people I'm working around, don't seem to have the same interests as me.  I feel like I'm only reaching about 30% of my critical thinking capacity, but about 110% of my patience/socialness/dealing with people of different work backgrounds capacity. I can hang, I'm pretty easy to work with, I can diffuse high pressure situations, but goddamn do I find all that unpleasant and exhausting.  Some people don't mind it or even enjoy it, but I go home feeling so exhausted. I  don't hate what I'm doing now, and 20 year old me would probably think it's pretty cool , but I am almost 30, and I don't want to feel this way when I'm 40. I need an exit strategy, I feel like I have the capacity to learn and grow more in other fields. I'm learning hella people-skills currently, and a decent amount about business/directing money between and through various parties including myself, but I am not learning the technical/high level problem solving skills I want to be thinking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself most interested in fixing things, figuring out how things work, bringing my multi meter out to my car and fixing random electrical problems, opening stuff up on my electrical bench and seeing how it works, networking gear together, trying to break stuff, etc.  I'm much more interested in the nuts and bolts of technology, mostly electronics, but also software and mechanical stuff, than I am being an technician or some sort of middleman for live event productions.

  

In my CS classes we did Arduino and similar micro-controller based projects and I found it highly enjoyable.  I've had a hobby fixing vintage electronics/audio gear (hi fi systems/turntables, etc) I am a Linux enthusiast. I did a big theatrical automation project.  I really enjoy detailed planning, and frankly...somewhat solitary highly detailed work. I also really like learning new things.

&amp;#x200B;

**BELOW ARE THE QUESTIONS / THE MEAT OF THIS POST:**

&amp;#x200B;

I think what I would be most interested in going forward would be working on the design and development of audiovisual gear, especially implementing audio and video over IP technologies (Dante, AVB, etc), or working on D/A audio conversion chips (or integrating such chips into other circuitry).  Perhaps signal processing for audio and perhaps video, and that sort of thing. I am looking for the most efficient way to get this type of work - designing and implementing cutting edge technology into specialty equipment

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about getting either another BS in EE or CS, or a MS in one of these.  I think I'm leaning towards EE more specifically.  Most jobs postings which have seemed interesting seem to be looking for a BS or MS in CS or EE.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been researching some schools and I have found at least one (U of Chicago) which allows applicants from non science background to apply to their MS in CS program and finish in a year or two, and offer preresuiquite classes to help applicants from different backgrounds.  I am sure there are more graduate programs for non-engineers, but I am suspicious of how those programs can actually provide qualified graduates so quickly, with such seemingly low presiquite requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Other schools I've looked at (UCLA and USC) pretty clearly state all their graduate engineering programs are for students with a BS in a hard science. 

&amp;#x200B;

USC offers a 2nd BS degree option, but it looks like most of my classes (even gen Ed type classes) won't transfer and it would be another 3-4 years and a lot of money for another BS degree in EE.  However this MS program, looks right up my alley: [http://catalogue.usc.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=8&amp;poid=7781&amp;returnto=2401](http://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=8&amp;poid=7781&amp;returnto=2401)

&amp;#x200B;

I have no problem learning things in a traditional setting which will help me career wise and in later educational endeavors, however I don't want to spend time and money taking 100 level genEd's alongside 18 years olds just out of high school.  (I am almost 30). I am aware that I likely need catch up on math, I haven't even taken Calculus I other than a Coursera class I've been slowly working through between other things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for some advice on how I can efficiently become qualified for field I want to get into, mostly in a traditional academic setting, without wasting time or money doing things unrelated to my academic or career goals.

&amp;#x200B;

I generally can be a self-motivated learner, but I think it would take way longer to self-tech myself this stuff, and generally no one, especially recruiters, etc, would give a shit if I said ""hey I taught myself a lot from the internet and made these pet projects.""

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm just looking grad school info school by school, but it's taking a long time to look through the graduation requirements and prerequisite.  What I'm trying to do seems not super-common and I'm spending so much time digging through information.  Plus the schools I've asked questions to have not emailed me back.

&amp;#x200B;

35,Canadian Engineers; anyone tried going for the PEng without a chemical engineering undergrad?,1562271368,"Canadian student here. I did my undergraduate in Chemistry (useless), then did my Masters in Chemical Engineering and am currently doing my PhD in chemical engineering. I know it’s possible to get a PEng and iron ring if you take equivalency courses and tests, just wondering about anyone else’s experiences with this?

I personally see myself going into academia/research after I finish my PhD (roughly 3 more years), but I know I would need a PEng to teach chemical engineering at a majority of universities (Canadian or outside). I wouldn’t hate going into industry (honestly I’ll go where the money goes) but I definitely know if I go that route I’ll have to work towards a PEng to compete with chemical engineers, even with a PhD. 

I’m not too frightened by the equivalency exams. I’ve always been decently math oriented, and have gotten nothing but As and A+s in graduate school. I’m also pretty sure if I take extra courses while doing my PhD, I won’t have to take the equivalency exam (for example if I take a fluid dynamics course I won’t have to write the fluid dynamics equivalency exam etc.), so I’m thinking about taking a few extra undergraduate courses in my PhD (even though I have already finished my PhD course requirements) to reduce the amount of equivalency exams I’ll inevitably have to take. 

TLDR; Anyone care to share their experience on the Canadian PEng process without a chemical engineering undergrad background? I know it’s possible, just a lot of work.

42,Guidance on which Masters course to choose,1562259116,"**Background**

I'm from the UK (North East) and have recently finished my degree in Mechanical Engineering, getting First Class Honours (approx a 3.7 - 4.0 GPA). Before the degree, I served my apprenticeship and spent 4 years working in a company which was primarily oil and gas (\~85%) but also featured defence and aerospace.

I'm hoping to keep the ball rolling and continue onto Masters, but I'm not sure which course would be the best to pursue.   
 

My original plan was to go back to oil and gas, obviously pays the best, and in the North East there isn't a lot of other options. I also wouldn't mind working offshore, on the rigs in the North Sea. The problem, since 2014 oil and gas has slowed and it seems like a dying trade, so I'm worried about doing a Masters in this area only for it to become redundant.

Aside from that, I would like to get into renewables, it certainly seems like the world is trending that way, but the UK market has slowed down due to a lack of government interest, and I there's a lack of opportunities for renewables in my area.

&amp;#x200B;

**Master Courses**

[Mechanical Engineering MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/mechanical-engineering-msc/#profile)

This is the safe bet, just more of the same, but I've got slight trepidation because I'm not specialising in any way. A bonus of the course is it covers vehicle drive, which could be particularly useful as there is a Nissan plant in the area, which is a huge employer locally.

&amp;#x200B;

[Offshore Engineering MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/offshore-engineering-msc/#profile)

This course obviously has a focus on oil and gas offshore platforms, but it also includes courses on marine systems to produce renewable energy. I'm strongly considering this course because of the included renewable modules; I feel that it might provide the best of both worlds, and leave me less at risk

&amp;#x200B;

[Pipeline Engineering Msc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/pipeline-engineering-msc-pgdip-pgcert/#profile)

This is a risky bet, purely pipline engineering for oil and gas industry. With oil and gas slowing down I would guess there's very little need for pipeline engineering, let alone a graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

[Subsea Engineering and Management MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/subsea-engineering-management-msc/#profile)

Again this seems a risky bet, as it is subsea in oil and gas. Again same risks as pipeline. Also the teaching of this course seems to be different from what I'm used to.

&amp;#x200B;

*Note: All courses are accredited by the Engineering Council and achieve the required educational requirements for Chartership*

&amp;#x200B;

**My Thoughts**

Currently, my head is a toss-up between Mechanical Engineering and Offshore Engineering. Mech is the safe bet and can't go wrong with the qualification. Offshore could potentially open doors to a lucrative industry without leaving me entirely at risk of being overly specialised in a (possibly) dying trade.

I included Pipeline and Subsea as they were the careers I planned on going into before the collapse, but since the market still hasn't recovered I think it's too risky. There's been a lot of layoffs in the north sea already, so even if new opportunities did open up I'd be bottom of the list with my lack of experience.

 

Any thoughts or advice is much appreciated. I'm trying to gauge what wiser heads think is the best path to take.

45,How can I make this dewatering bag reusable?,1562255886,"Background: I’m trying to find a device that I can pump water/sand into &amp; that will separate the water from the sand. The sand is being pumped out from a 40 ft, 8” pipe with a bunch of water (medium to high pressure).

I need a way so that I can pick up the bag with a forklift and empty the sand out quickly (once the water is out). But this bag just has one opening, for the hose that pumps in the water/sand.

I was thinking of cutting open the bottom of the dewatering bag but not sure how to seal it for when I’m pumping in the sand/water. And I’m on a tight budget (I’m an intern &amp; this is my project). There are welders at my workplace that can make anything for free, out of metal. Does anyone have any ideas on how to transform this dewatering bag into a reusable one? One that will close at the bottom when sand/water is being pumped in but that will open once I pick it up with the forklift to dump all the sand out.

About 11ft^3 of sand will come out of pipe, so about 1000 pounds?

Oh and for the reusable bag, they use two rods to seal the bottom opening but according to the only Amazon review, that’ll only work for the first few times.

48,Seeking creative ideas for repairing failed dam,1562250736,"I am on an engineering / technical committee working to repair a failed dam for a small lake.  The goal is to raise the water level 12' back up to normal lake levels.  In a perfect world, there would be a temporary solution ( possibly a coffer dam via sheet piling and or beam and plate) that would raise the water level while a permanent solution was being formulated (hydraulic crest gates, labyrinth weirs, etc).  The temporary solution would likely be needed to aide in control of flow for the permanent solution.  

I am looking for creative and out of the box ideas which would: raise the water level in the interim while possibly not increasing the risk of flood due to the inability to manipulate the height of the dam.  The original dam had gates that went down during a flood event. A zoomable model showing the dam with the missing middle gate is [here](https://app.sketchup.com/viewer/3dw?WarehouseModelId=7105a1c3-4910-4e7a-8b47-52a0c394a555). The curved section is a simple visual of a possible sheet piling solution.  This would raise the water level, but it would eliminate the flood mitigation ability of the middle section, thus increasing the flood risk. It would also allow for water control during the permanent solution.

 I have great soft-skills, including interpersonal ones. I have two job others where one I'm in the final round of interviews and one awaiting an offer.


#1 - Power Design Engineer 

This is at a large (1000+) people company that's growing incredibly quick and are the top 3 at what they do worldwide. My job description is basically analog circuits and op amps, DC-DC converters, and lots of lab work. The pay is double the average salary in this country and is what hardware engineers here usually make the first year out. The company also has digital design departments.


#2- Application Engineer

Huge semiconductor company (~21 000 worldwide), doesn't manufacturer but has its hands in all the steps of fabrication. I'd be working alongside the algorithm and physics team and clients which are the fabs.  This job is extremely dynamic and doesn't involve me sitting in a lab all day, the pay would be more than the first job, but requires 30% travel time, but takes me away from hardware.


My dilemma:
My GPA - I'm scared I won't ever have opportunities like this again.  Both jobs are amazing and I feel confident about getting the offers. My problem is:

1.) Taking the HW design job and being stuck in power. While it seems interesting, digital and IC are where my heart is. 

2.) Taking the AE job and leaving hardware - I'm afraid it'll be super difficult to get back into the field of hardware if I decide to leave after a year or two.

So about a year ago i graduated with a Bachelor's in ECET (Electronic and Computer Engineering Technology). My fiance was still going to University and refused (still does) to move far away from here, Central Arkansas. I was somewhat leaning towards PLC jobs as mostly there are manufacturing jobs here. I applied to a place as an electrical maintenance worker to just get some post-graduation experience and money. They offered me a supervisor position. Great! I thought, the position was suppose to be around 40-45 hours on average, 3 weeks of vacations, lots of holidays off.

It pays good around here, 55k, and they set me up with a mentor for about 6 months and the last 6 months I have been over the smallest of the four plant's electrical team(which only consists of me and one ""electrician"") here. I just recently got a company cell phone, but was told i need to buy my own case. Also it has been months and I still do not have a multimeter (the electrician has his own, but he can't be here 24/7) despite being told they would get me one. I was also told today that I was expected to work about 50 hours per week, which breaking that down i would make less than my electrician per hour. 

There is hardly any programming to do here and most of it is just maintenance. I like the job when everything is running smooth because it is pretty chill and there is not much to do, but when something big breaks down the electrician, having less experience than I do, and I usually end up spending a while fixing it (stayed here 13+ hours a few times). I was told that i can come in late the next day if i have to stay late. Most projects seemed to be dropped in my lap and I am suppose to have a plan by the end of the day and it be completed before the end of the month (only day to install/test is on Sundays as the plant does not run and only maintenance is here). Also the mechanical supervisor or myself has to be here during the day. He works Sun-Thurs, so that left me with those days to pick my two off days. I have Sundays off (unless my electrician can't handle a project) to be with my SO as well as Monday. I was just told I need to work Monday as that is when the plant starts back up. I don't know which is worse, having split days or having two week days off.

So my questions are:
Am I in the wrong that I refuse to buy my own case for a company phone?

Is the time constraint on projects normal?

87,Where's a good place/website to buy engineering tools from in the UK?,1562183424," 

I'm in my 20s working as a electronics repairs engineer got a degree in EEE. I use tools everyday at work but only occasionally at home so have been getting by with my Dads tools but think it's about time I got my own. At work most of the tools I've ended up with are Proskit (they're good tools as far as I can tell but they're my only point of reference really) but don't really know any other brands or where the good places to buy tools from are.

I just had a quick browse and I'm gonna carry on after writing this post. But theres a lot of information for me to take in, so some advise on good brands to look at and cheap websites to buy from would be really helpful :), also if anyone has any indication of the sizes I probably mean that would be good too.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Right now I have a big hammer, a small hammer, a 7mm bendy ratchet, some rusty pliers and a soldering iron with a cigar lighter jack. I'm gonna take the soldering iron to work and change the jack and nab myself a power supply for it and the hammers seem okay but I need just about everything else :)

I don't know what sizes I need but the bare minimum I want is;

* 4 cross screwdrivers, a ""regular"" sized one, a stumpy one, a small one and ones of those really long torque ones.
* 2 minus screwdrivers, a regular sized one, and a small one.
* a ratchet, I use a Bahco one at work and have no problems with it.
* wire strippers - i prefer the short more 'manual' ones
* wire snippers - small again just for electronics stuff most likely
* big pliers for bending stuff, small bent nose pliers for bending small stuff, tweezers are pretty cool too
* stuff to go with my soldering iron - solder, one of them pots to wipe away excess solder, a stand to put the hot soldering iron on, ill probably get by without flux or a solder sucker but they would be nice too.
* glue gun maybe
* probably other stuff too but off the top of my head i can't think of anything else

For the record I'm gonna get myself a PicKit soon too (which is part of the motivation to me sorting out my lack of tools) and I'm also running low on 3D printing filament, so any websites where I have to pay for delivery costs get bonus points if they do either of those things too.

89,Please help me assess my current situation and whether I'm thinking rationally or not. Warning: Wall-of-text.,1562181505,"Alright, I need to provide a lot of background information about myself to help you understand my situation and where I'm coming from. Apologies for the wall-of-text to follow.

I'm an international student studying in the UK. I'm recently graduated from a decent University with a BEng (Hons) (SW) Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Throughout my degree, I've been dead-set on essentially having no life outside of my studies and personal hobbies. Due to a negative past experience that I blew, I needed to make sure I wasn't was wasting a second chance that I will regret deeply in the future. And as such, thanks to my dedication and very strict discipline, I essentially aced all of my 3 years and I'm currently looking to graduate with around a 4.3 GPA (out of 4.5). I am also very fortunate to have been awarded 5 different awards including 2 scholarships from different institutions due to my academic performance. 

In addition, I've had the privilege of carrying out an Industrial Placement within my degree with an Engineering company for 13 months. I worked within the Hardware Electrical team. I was responsible for planning, designing and full assembly of Test Equipment to carry out testings on specific PCBs (mainly function and performance tests) after being supplied from an external manufacturers. I learned a **ginormous** amount of information and skills I never thought I'd ever learn during that period. The sheer amount of knowledge and experience was literally priceless.

Moving on, I started applying for Graduate Jobs in Sept 2018, about 10 months ago, right as soon as I started my final year. I'm pretty sure I had over 100 applications sent in, ranging from direct contact with companies to through recruitment agencies. I was getting rejections left and right all year long. Despite my Placement and Academic Achievements, no employer was willing to take me in. Reason being, I required a sponsorship as I'm an international student with a requirement of a minimum pay of 27.4k - 30k GBP as a entry level Engineer position. No company was willing to pay that much for a fresh graduate, regardless of his accomplishments/achievements/experience. To show how unfortunate this is, I actually had a manager offer me a position as an **Electronics Engineer** right after the interview in person. He got back to me a couple days later saying they can't take me on after consulting with their HR, this happened with a couple more companies. I was very, very disappointed and frustrated because it was all out of my control. I started giving up and decided I'd go for Masters back home, not in UK as I couldn't afford it. Masters was something that I always knew I'd do, wasn't sure when though. And that was it, until recently.

An agency got in touch with me and lets me know a company was interested in my CV and wanted to interview me ASAP. At that point, I've had several interviews and calls and didn't think much of it. Went in and I felt like I did pretty well and I felt like they liked me, they called me back for a second interview, knowing that I would need sponsorship. I do well in the second one and I get the job, **there is a catch though.**

Due to the minimum salary requirements I mentioned earlier for sponsorship, this company wasn't still ready to pay me that much with only a year of experience. But they didn't want to lose me, so they decided to take me on as a Technician (lower pay). Now, the education I went through my whole life, my degree, my achievements and experience was all for the sake of becoming an **Engineer** and not a technician. That's wasn't and will never be what I'm looking for. And I know I'm confident in my abilities to be on a level far beyond a technician. However, with how little to no options I had, I didn't have a choice but to accept the Technician position. Otherwise, I'd travel back home with no absolutely no job opportunities for my type of work, unemployed, going for masters.

With this company, I'm working in the Test Department as a **Test Development Technician**. The company has mentioned that they realize my potential and will be looking to move me up as appropriate. I don't know what to think though. After speaking to my manager today for 2 hours, understanding what is it that I'll be working on and what they're expecting from me. The job role is very much heavily focused on testing. Mainly HST (High Speed Testing) and ATEs (Automatic Test Equipment). He mentioned that they'll be looking to train me to develop ATEs with sophisticated software requirements including Windows communications, User Interface in C#. I have a lot of experience in C, basics in C++. I'm Interested in learning more programming languages, not sure if I want to be in this medium though.

The dilemma that is running through my mind right now:

1) I realize that my potential goes far beyond a Technician. I feel like I'm wasting my time starting off as a Technician where I could have started off as an Electronics Engineer straightaway. 

2) I feel like starting with a Technician role as my 2nd job, it will tank my CV significantly and will take me a few years until I get myself back up to an Engineer level.

3) I don't know if I want to be working in Test. I know I can learn a lot from this job, especially with developing ATEs, but still, that is still Test. I want to be working as a Senior Electronics Design Engineer for companies like Tesla. Designing PCBs, circuits, working with mixed signal circuits etc. If I start in Test *AND* as a Technician, I might never be able to get myself out of this pigeon-hole and climb out to where I want.

4) I didn't have any options beside this offer. My 2nd option would be going back home and going for Masters then seeing how things work from there. (Side note: Finding a job willing to sponsorship me from outside the UK is impossible) so I can pretty much kiss goodbye to my chances of finding work here again.

I'm sorry for rambling, there is just so much going through my mind right now and I'm worried about the future and where I'll end up. I'm hoping someone can tell me if my concerns are legitimate or if it's just my mind playing games with me.

92,An ultimate advice needed for an ultimate cert hunt.,1562176513,"Ok, So I just went through the past posts, not all of them as they were just making me exhausted lol, on this subreddit regarding certifications. After going through them. I have come to a conclusion. And that is. It's a mixed bag. Can be beneficial and well, won't really matter.

I am currently doing petroleum engineering. And yes, I did look up API certs but it seems them for professionals i.e. graduates working in O&amp;G companies. Plus many certs related to O&amp;G seems to be given after employment. However. I do believe that the certs listed down below would still help me out etiher way in job/internship hunt.

The certs that I have been able to found out so far, would be awesome if you can also list them down, are as follows:

**CSWA** \- These solid works certs are so popular. Definitely gonna dig more into them.

**CSWP**

**CSWE**

**CSWP - S**

**CSWA - S**

**CATIA** \- Seems very pricey

**GD&amp;T** \- Is it only related to civil dudes?

**DFSS** \- Is this better than the belts?

**SAE** \- Any help to me?

**ASME** \- Is this better than OSHA?

**OSHA** \- Is this better than ASME? 

**LEED** \- Is it better than 6 sigmas and OSHA and ASME cert? or a bit different than them?

**LabVIEW** \- If good for me. When should I pursue this i.e. during undergraduate years or postgraduate?

**Pro/Engineer Wildfire -** Is this really needed for me?

**CDL -** (This one makes no sense but has such an important if one is doing petroleum engineering).

**ANSYS** \- How useful it is?

**6 SIGMA** \- White belt, Yellow belt, Green belt, Black belt. Which belt if the most useful?

**EXCEL** \- The advance one i.e. doing stress/strain calculations on it and etcetera. Making models

**MATLAB** 

**Programming Language** \- Any online reliable site that is recognized by the organizations. Any specific programming language preferred i.e. Python, R, etcetera

Now ofc, there are other certs like EIT, PE, and PF if I'm not wrong. But I'm not sure if they are worldwide, as I'm doing my undergraduate in Malaysia. 

I do know, many don't bother much, but I actually did some research regarding this matter on engineering students subreddit and certs were highly preferred there. So, now coming to the main point.

Recently my A/C went bad so I thought this would be an awesome time to learn about the HA system in a modern car and learn how to trouble shoot and fix. I have the manual handy. But now I'm stuck, and before spending anymore money, I would like your advice.  

Currently: 

Checked pressure, recovered and recharged, no luck so evacuated. 

I changed the **condenser** with a drier. 

I changed the **expansion valve.** 

New O-rings from Nissan on the lines I opened. 

Side note: *I bought a generic box of O - rings from pep boys and they were way too skinny, so anyone thinking of doing this project, buy oem. Autozone claims to have a set that would work for $10 but I had to special order them. The new O-rings from pepboys caused a leak in the system (vacuum won't hold), so I went to Nissan and bought the six O-rings I had replaced for f\*\*\*\*\* $25. No more leak and vacuum holding nicely for a few hours.* 

Recharged system with recommended pag oil (75ml) when a condenser is replaced. On the a/c gauge, the low side was building pressure and when the compressor clicked on it brought it back low but the high side climbed up very slowly and did not pass 150 psi. Air is blowing room temperature. and last but not least, the low line shakes and is warm/ hot to the touch and my other cars, when the ac is running, that line gets very cold. 

What I didn't do:

Change the compressor, as it clicks on (I see it spinning in the side wall with wheel removed as well.) .

Check fuse or relay.

Check pressure switches.

I also have a new compressor which I was hoping I could return as the system clicks on but is it possible that compressor is weak or not functioning correctly?

15,Too soon to ask for a raise?,1562132992,"Hi everyone,

I started working full time exactly 5 months ago for a local utility, after interning with them for 2 summers. I was very renowned across the business and a lot of people had high expectations for me when I arrived. Sure enough, within the first month I was given 3 major initiatives/projects to oversee, as well as several assignments in between.

Fast forward 5 months later to present time. 3 employees have rotated out of my department and 3 more have left the company. Meanwhile, their projects and tasks have been dumped on me, effectively doubling or tripling my workload. I've had to ask for overtime for the last 3 weeks because I can't give up my personal time to ensure I meet all the deadlines. To top everything off, the work isn't exactly the most glamorous assignments either, a lot is just spreadsheet cleanup and drafting up documents. When I came back full time, I was hoping I would be assigned for more technical assignments.

How should I go about this? Honestly, I don't mind doing the mundane work as long as I get compensated appropriately, but it doesn't look good for my long term technical development either. I've talked to other senior engineers and they think this is just the way the company operates.

I'm currently working on a government R&amp;D team and have been encouraged by both my command and management to take the next step in my higher education. I currently have dual B.S.'s in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from NC State. However, I now live in rural Maryland; thus, I will have to pursue an online M.S.. I applied to two programs: the Master's of Science in Systems and Controls Engineering from Case Western Reserve University, and the Master's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Johns Hopkins University (EP). Both are completely online, with Hopkins having some in-person labs available (though not necessary for degree completion). I was accepted to both. Now I'm looking for any feedback regarding these programs. Here are some pros, cons, and courses for each:

Case Western Reserve University
Pros: Small class size (even online), professors and administration have been extremely helpful and communicative (a professor has already consulted a department to waive a requirement for a dynamics class), wide breadth of courses (i.e. dynamics, vibrations, digital controls, signal processing, power system analysis), technically rigorous (the admissions advisers recommend 15 hours of work outside of class/course), professors work as full-time professors, 6-7K cheaper than 
JHU
Cons: not as well known in Maryland/Eastern seaboard, in Cleveland, completely online, not as highly ranked as JHU, Systems and Control Engineering is an unusual (though not bad?) degree program, no thesis course (though research doesn't seem to be out of the question), few courses available

JHU EP:
Pros: Prestigious title, well-known in Maryland and across the U.S., application-focused, wide selection of courses, course material is something in which I have lots of background (ECE-centric), labs available for use
Cons: courses don't seem very challenging (for the Analog Electronics Design course your big project is characterizing a diode?!?!), professors aren't PhD.s/work as adjunct, my command is saturated with people attending Hopkins for master's degrees, the administration hasn't been very communicative at all in the application process (I've had to call them more than they've called me).

I have to make a decision by tomorrow to submit the funding proposal for the degree program to the command. If it gets accepted, there shouldn't be an issue in funding.

27,Quick Promotion In DoD Company,1562110490,"So I have a new hire that rotated into our analysis group nearly a year back. They were hired as a ME II for a design division, but the hiring manager noticed they have a few years in CFD/FEA analytics. Our group at work has lost a few people to retirement or resignation recently, so we have a few openings with little qualified candidates applying. But, we had this applicant, whom was already hired for another department, fall into our laps. So, we decided to take them on as a rotational trainee for a few months to test the waters, then the better part of a year before offering them a role in the department. 

Now, our analysis group is pretty small and handles a lot of work. The lowest ranking employee is a Sr. ME I. The credentials for getting into the group are generally a Masters + 2-3 yrs exp or Bachelors +4-5 yrs exp, but they usually want a Masters grad. The candidate had a BSME and 3 yrs exp when hired. So the conflict comes when it is offer time. The employee wants a promotion to Sr. ME I to join the group. Since they're a rotational person, they have no real obligation to join despite the training given for the past year. The hiring manager doesn't want to do it because they lack the Masters degree or applicable exp in our job description. 

Now, I trained this person off and on for the year, and I will say they can handle what most of our Sr. ME's can. I think the problem hear comes more down to the company doesn't want to promote someone who has been here slightly less than a year and doesn't have the on-paper credentials. It seems like them taking this role is contingent on the promotion, and they may just end the rotation and fold back into a design group or program, which would be a waste of valuable training and a skillset we currently lack.

If there are those of you in similar situations, what are the clear pros and cons I can portray to management?

50,Final Year of Civil Engineering; Don't Want To Be An Engineer; What Else Can I Become With My Degree?,1562091371,"I am entering my final year of Civil Engineering at Ryerson University (in Toronto, Canada). **TLDR: I am realizing I don't want to pursue being a civil engineer after graduation, what are some careers I can switch over to with my civil engineering degree?**

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of my back story:

I have worked my summers completing co-op terms related to my field; I did 14 months at Hatch Ltd. as a Linear Infrastructure Student. At Hatch, I mainly worked with the utility team where I produced detailed relocation designs of watermains, storm sewers, and sanitary sewers for a proposed subway tunnel, did tons of coordination  between subcontractors and stakeholders, produced and maintained conflict matrices and drawing registries, etc. Essentially, much of the work I did were tasks and jobs that a Civil EIT would do to support the team. I finished my work terms in good standing and was offered a full-time position with them after graduation. Currently, in my final summer before graduating, I decided to complete a work term in something I've never experienced before to get a feel of what I like and don't like; I am working at Turner Construction as a field co-op student. I see how DIFFERENT it is from the consulting side at Hatch; I am managing submittals and shop drawings, assessing the conformance to contract specifications, and resolving any conflicts that do occur. It definitely is more fast paced.

&amp;#x200B;

From these experiences, I am slowly realizing that I don't find joy or passion in these positions. I am grateful truly for these opportunities but I am getting a little bit more scared each day that I may not want to pursue Civil Engineering upon graduation. I am not sure how else my civil engineering degree can be applied to job positions in Canada. I know I don't want to pursue a pathway in medicine or law; as for business, I have never been good with finance or accounting!

&amp;#x200B;

There really is a huge disconnect between what people in university *think* engineering is versus what it *actually* is. I am not sure how common it is to be on my boat. I know as an engineer I will probably live a comfortable middle class income and lifestyle. I know I will have a good financial situation than a lot of people but I wont be ""rich"". I want to be able to take the problem solving skills that I learned and apply them to a different field to become ""wealthy"" or at least upper middle class.

So I want to move into a totally different field and am taking 6 to 7 months off to train myself. so if I don't include my last experiences I would have a 2 year gap. Would going for a masters degree in computer engineering hide this gap or should I include my last 4 month experience (I was not able to get a good reference) and look for jobs in software development after I feel ready for the interviews .

71,"Would an interconnecting railway between Airports work? Check in at one airport, fly from another...",1562064163,"**Speaking on a new episode of The Engineers Collect podcast (links below), Henrik Rothe - a senior lecturer at Cranfield University in London was addressing a new scheme called 'Hyperloop'. Have you heard of Hyperloop?**

&amp;#x200B;

In an [interview with New Civil Engineer](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/hyperloop-network-could-replace-heathrow-third-runway-expert-claims-12-04-2019/) in the UK - the managing director of Hyperloop One claimed connecting the three major airports around London (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) could solve capacity issues.

The theory essentially is that you connect all three airports (in this example) together by rail. A secure rail way, probably underground, would carry passengers from airport to airport - airside. So in theory, you would check in at the airport closest to you, say Heathrow, and go through security, get your baggage sorted etc. Then you'd jump on a high-speed Hyperloop train which would take you to Stansted the other side of the city, and you'd be in a small terminal ready to board your flight. 

Each of the individual 'carriages' on the railway would be secure (i.e it can only stop at the stations it's programmed to stop at, and people cannot get off until that departure is reached). The argument from Hyperloop one is that this makes huge terminal buildings with massive check-in and baggage drops irrelevant.

The MD of Hyperloop even went as far as to say you could have remote check-ins, say in the heart of the city, where you check you and your baggage into the hyperloop train system and it takes you directly airside.

&amp;#x200B;

**I'd be interested to see what engineers think of this - is this too 'futurologist' a view, or does it have legs? Maybe it's an extremity which if dialled back a bit could have valuable input into the future of Airports - or is it just a pipe dream?**

I built a lift for my topper, and want to use a single cable to lift. I have a crank on the wall with cable. The topper is sitting on two pieces of strut I will actually lift. I have two fixed pulleys at each corner on the ceiling, one to send the cable down to the pulley on the strut, and one to send it to the next corner of the topper. The cable runs in order from the crank, to the back right, back left, front right, front left, and back to the crank. 

Here’s the problem- If I fix the far end of the cable , it won’t lift evenly. The close corner lifts faster and out of balance. 
If I clamp the far end of the cable back to the cable running to crank, effectively running a loop through all the pulleys, the left side of the topper lifts faster. (And I run out of room before my cable clamps attach)

Is there a way get it to lift level with a single cable? I know I can just run a line to each corner and attach, but it’s a challenge now and I’m looking for ideas.

Despite good scores in school, and great performance reviews in the workplace, I find the profession intolerably stressful.

The workflow is so varied and unpredictable that I'm often stuck in reactive mode, and unable to ""get ahead"". 

My peers seem unfazed by these stressors and often describe feeling energized by them, which made me question whether engineering is a good fit for me. It made me question whether I enjoyed the idea of engineering more than engineering itself.

84,NASA Engineer vs U.S. Navy Pilot,1562020383,"I was selected for a Pilot slot in the US Navy and I am slated to go to OCS(bootcamp) on August 18th. I haven't taken the oath yet.

However, after I submitted my Navy application, I also interviewed with NASA-JPL for an engineering position(just in case I didn't get the pilot slot). Luckily I survived the interview rounds and NASA wanted to give me an offer back in January but at the time the government shut down happened so they couldn't give me an offer. Fast forward to May, I got a Navy Pilot slot.

So here is the dilemma, I was happily prepping for Navy until NASA-JPL called me up offering me a very good engineering job with very good pay in Los Angeles. Basically a dream job for any engineer.

With NASA you get better work/life balance, live a decent social life and also earn a good salary. You can possibly live a happy family life and still have loads of fun at work.

With Navy Pilot, you get a more rewarding and challenging life. I plan on going to test pilot school and the possibility of even applying to become an astronaut in the future(I know that's some crazy dreams I got). I will lose the family connection and other social aspects compared to NASA. And also there is a chance that for some odd reason, I don't make it through flight training, I will be miserable for a couple of years with a different job at Navy. Let's just say, if I don't get to be a Pilot, there is a good chance I won't like it at the Navy. Also, I am quite old to be joining the Navy as a pilot. I will be 27 at OCS. The good thing is I am not married, at least for now.

In short  
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Nice steady life with great job satisfaction, build stuff and send to Mars  
US Navy Pilot - Risky and challenging life with very rewarding career opportunities, think Astronaut!

So I was hoping to get some thoughts on Navy Pilot vs NASA engineer. What is a more realistic feasible goal? What do current or past NASA engineers think of this and what would they have done. Is astronaut even a realistic goal?

I know in the end I gotta ask myself what I truly want but for some reason, I keep going back and forth. Regardless of where I go, I will be serving this great country.",AskEngineers,False,aceleo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/c81647/nasa_engineer_vs_us_navy_pilot/

87,How bright would a chest x-ray be if we could see it? How bright would a lethal dose of radiation be?,1562018564,"I watched the Chernobyl TV series with my family and my mom and brother seemed to have a hard time understanding how radiation works, and thought the show was overstating its effects.

It can be hard to understand something we can't see, so I thought what if I could demonstrate different levels of radioactivity by bringing those radioactive particles into the visible spectrum.

This is the question I had in mind - ""If you were standing in a room with a 100W light bulb and the photons were replaced with radioactive decay particles, how much radiation would you be exposed to""

You could also compare it by equivalent energy because the energy of the particles is much higher than visible light. So you could either go for the same number of photons, or the same amount of energy.

I would vote for total power though. A 100W incandescent bulb is only ~5% efficient, so that would be 5 Joules per second.

In Chernobyl, [a firefighter picked up a chunk of graphite]( youtube.com/watch?v=qqZpjRxUZwA) (which would be carbon-14 beta decay) that was the equivalent of 4 million chest x-rays, which by the shows math (3.6 Roentgen = 400 xrays) would be 36000 Roentgen *per hour*. Wikipedia says one roentgen deposits 0.0096 Gy (0.96 rad) in soft tissue. A Grey (Gy) is defined as 1 joule of radiation absorbed per Kg, so the graphite chunk in the firefighters hand would be emitting 345.6 Joules of absorbable radiation per hour. So compared to a 5% efficient incandescent bulb, that would be a ~0.1W bulb. But thats just the amount of radiation absorbed, i'm sure it is emitting much more that is not absorbed.

Anyway, thats as far as i've gotten. I would like to make a YouTube video on this and i want to get it right. Im sure there are some inaccuracies, but is this an accurate representation? I also want to compare different radioactive materials. like showing how it would only take a very tiny amount of Plutonium-241 to equal the decay rate of U-235.",AskEngineers,False,MerlinTheWhite,/r/AskEngineers/comments/c80tly/how_bright_would_a_chest_xray_be_if_we_could_see/

89,Best way to stiffen sheet metal using angle iron?,1562015408,"I have a school bus that I'm converting to an RV, and I currently have some large holes that need to be covered. One of them is a hole at the bottom of the rear emergency exit door (there was originally a window here that I removed) that is about 3' x 2' (it's actually most of the bottom of the door). I plan to patch this with a piece of sheet metal (16 ga or maybe thinner) but I don't want it to flex.

My thought was that I could weld (or perhaps rivet) strips of angle iron on the back. But I'm not sure of where to run it so that I achieve the proper stiffening.

5,Industrial Engineer/Electrical Engineer looking for some guidance,1561998706,"Hello everyone!

To understand what i mean by ""looking for some guidance"" I have to give some backstory first:

I have recently finished my Bachelors degree in industrial engineering with some extra classes in control theory and measurement technology (dont know if this is the right term) and started an internship in a large electronics company focused on automation since i really loved electrical engineering classes in university.  Initially I applied for the internship to learn more about control theory and its applications but i was handed different tasks that I had no clue about (e.g. network engineering, programming and so on). At first i was really overwhelmed and didnt know what to do since I have never touched anything like that in university. The first few weeks were really hard and i felt really really dumb ... but after some time i got the hang of it and learned a **LOT** in these few months that i have been working there.

But now comes the part where i need ""some guidance"". Im constantly thinking about the fact that IE might not be the right major for me and if i should switch majors to EE since my internship is really interesting and fun at the moment. However, if i would switch majors i would have to start from scratch and would have to move to another university as well since mine does not offer EE as a major yet (this is one major part that is holding me off since i really love my current university).

I have talked about this with my father a lot as well who has a degree in automation engineering. He told me that a good engineer needs to have some basic knowledge about the economic aspects as well and that i should keep doing my masters in IE (especially if i want to climb the ranks in the later stages of my career). We then agreed that i could do some extra classes that are not mandatory for this major (i already did some of theses in my during my bachelors studies like i have mentioned in the beginning). We have looked for some available courses in my university that i could take during my masters degree which seemed promising like signal theory, nonlinear control theory, radar and laser technology and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

However, im still not sure if this is a great idea or if i made the right decisions and thats why i have these questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Has anyone in this sub ever been in this kind of situation?

\- Are extra courses a good alternative to switching majors?

\- Has there been a case where some knowledge in economics or accounting would have been useful in your work as an engineer?

19,Can a carburetor be impaired by pulling air from the fuel line?,1561973862,"**Background story**: I use a small four-stroke engine for my boat, a few days ago, I jumped a wave and the engine stopped. I tried to start it again (it's a pull start) and after a few pulls, it ran. However, every time I throttled above \~50% it would die again. (This would go on for an hour or two, even let it cool a bit between tries)

**Suspicion:** I noticed the same behaviour once already. Back then, it was caused by condensed water collecting in the fuel tank over a longer period of time, which was sucked into the carburetor bowl. So I suspected water might have gotten somewhere it shouldn't.

**Solution:** Since I had to get back fast and didn't have the tool I needed with me (obviously...), I decided to improvise. Pulled the choke all the way, and gave it a few pulls, then throttled it up to \~60% in neutral, closed the choke and pulled it a few times. After that it ran. Even afterwards, it worked and I didn't have any issues since.


So now my question is: The first time (water issue), it obviously pulled water from the fuel line into the carburetor bowl, which tricked the floater to think there was sufficient fuel when there really wasn't. I emptied the carburetor bowl and it worked fine after that.

However, this time, the only thing that I can imagine happened is the motor sucking air instead of fuel because of the boat jumping but I really don't see how air in the carburetor bowl would cause any issues? It would just be pulled out on the first few pulls and the motor would work normally afterwards, right?

So, can air cause any issue here I don't know of or does anyone have any idea what might have happened?

20,Waste to energy power plant. Temporary access into a fuel pit for clearing?,1561970882,"Hi All, I have a problem I was wondering if you could help with.

I have a solid fuel pit that needs to be cleared annually. The fuel is RDF. The pit is located within a building. This is because the grab that moves the fuel can't reach the lowest 200mm, nor can it reach into the corners or close to the walls. This fuel can rot over time and create odours which the Environmental Agency don't like. 

The pit is 6.4m high from ground level, and 2.3m deep. So a total height of 8.7m inside the pit. 
The walls are 450mm thick reinforced concrete. 

There is an overhead crane that operates a grab during normal operation. There is space to set down to grab and lift a bobcat into the bunker to aid in the clearing. 
The works in the pit can be observed from the crane walkways (while the crane is locked out)

However I am uncertain of a solution of how to get a man into the pit, with a relatively fast and easy way of getting him out again. Because of the height of the walls and the material in the pit it will be confined space, and gas monitoring will be required, potentially even breathing apparatus.

Either temporary or permanent solutions are viable. 

The current ideas I have are below. But any others are welcome:
A. Permanent ladder in an area the crane can't reach. A cage for the ladder won't be possible due to the grab proximity. The operator would likely need to be harnessed
B. Stairs in a area the crane can't reach. An external side handrail wouldn't be practical due to the grab, but one could be mounted along the wall with a line for a harness to connect to.
C.Bring in a temporary crane and man cage.
D. Temporary scaffolding. But installation may be an issue
E. Descent from overhead crane gantry - but no easy egress. Maybe something similar to a window cleaning platform?
F. A specialised boom lift

38,What the value of being a P.Eng is. (Canada),1561917283,"There's been other threads here about what the value is of being a P.Eng and a lot of people say things like I don't need it in my position / company, higher risk of liability, fees, only good for indirect perception, etc. There's some truth to all that and here's another flip side. Agree or disagree and why?

I've had my P.Eng. for over 10 years. Originally it was an important factor in my employment Engineering firms to be a licensed Engineer. Now as in Project Management role where the vast majority of people in my position aren't Engineers you might say I don't need. Heck just cancel the membership. Nothing could be further from the truth. Because perception is reality, I would still say for personal branding alone, and the fact that we're managing Trades, Architects, and licensed Engineers on our project teams on-going, that it's still much better to have.

Ok lets say you're not even working with other P.Eng. on your projects like a typical Software Engineer. People will say I don't need it for my job, it's all about skills, people around me including higher ups don't have it, and there's some truth about that, but really how do they define what you need? If it's about being employed then you don't need anything but relationships including a degree, MBA, LEED AP, PMP, P.Eng., Eng.L. Heck even high school is enough since everything can be learned on the job if you think about it. I would say if you think about it in terms of the long game, any Engineer including Software Engineers should get it because of:

1. Personal branding. Nobody around you has it is actually the reason why you should get it more so then not. Your next internal Senior Software Engineering or Management position you apply for with 20 applicants and you're the only licensed Professional Engineer. I mean come on. This is a big part of why conceptually why I was hired to Project Manage over other equal experienced applicants.
2. Personal and professional milestone met.
3. P.Eng. is a license to legally practice Engineering in your province by the Engineering Act. Being licensed to practiced as a professional does open doors directly or indirectly. Even when I apply for Management positions, I later hear back we liked your application, hiring a experienced P.Eng. is something we like. That even surprised me because all the other Managers in the firm aren't P.Eng. When all things are equal, anything to set you apart helps.
4. Engineering entrepreneur: Lets say down the road you want to use your own skills from Engineering and run your own gig as a say a Sole Practitioner. Then you really need to being a licensed Professional Engineer for yourself and the clients. Sure everything has a work around like you could hire a P.Eng. and manager them and you still can but there's reasons why most Managing Partners in Engineering firms are P.Eng. members for credibility among other reasons.
5. Liability is a big misconception when it comes to the engineering seal. Obviously if you're in a job where you're not using your seal then it's not even a factor but even if you are it goes back to the basics. Yes when you seal / sign to a document, you commit to the  standards of the professions and accept  professional responsibility for the document and its contents, however  does that mean if the seal isn't applied, the member is some how not  responsible for their created work? - If you created it, you are  responsible for it—seal or no seal. In fact the engineering seal guidelines state  that you add no extra liability to yourself when you seal your  documents. The seal is not a mark of warranty. It is not a guarantee of  accuracy. The purpose of the seal is to authenticate documents that have  been prepared and delivered by a licensed member in their professional  capacity as a mark of reliance. That's it. Nothing magic. I would say the only problems you may run into is if you start sealing / signing documents prepared by somebody else not under your direct Supervision. In a rush people have asked me to do that because they're not licensed. I just said no because that wouldn't make sense. Get your license or Supervisor. That's it.
6. Fees: I've worked for a lot of firms (private and public) an they all paid for my Engineering membership fees. Even in roles where I don't need to be. I would think it would speak to the legitimacy of the firm if they wouldn't even do that. 
7. The list goes on and there's other reasons for sure such as networking and mentoring opportunities as a

A phone with a crack (in the glass) across a corner about 1 cm in length. After applying a tempered glass screen protector, the starting point of the crack is still exposed, and the adhesive of the (stick on, tampered glass) screen protector is in contact with the crack. There is adhesive along the perimeter of the tampered glass screen protector.   


The phone, with the tampered glass screen protector is inside a good protective case. However, with the tampered glass screen protector, the phone is a very tight, snug fit.   


My concern is that the case of the crack can cause the application of the tampered glass screen protector to backfire, increasing the pressure to the screen in the case of a drop. I cannot imagine why the force of the drop would travel through the crack to the tempered glass screen protector.  This is the third brand of tampered glass screen protector I have tried, and none cover the entire crack. 

  
The question for the Engineer is: Does the phone function as a system in a drop, separate from the tampered glass screen protector, as such vibration would first be transferred to the tempered glass screen protector before the screen is damaged from the point of weakness on the screen?

53,Carbon fiber foam sandwich for camper van,1561894526,"I am upgrading a cargo van to be a camper van, and need some help designing my bed platform. 

**The system**
In the back of the van, the bed platforms run between supports on the left and right side of the van. Each of the two platforms are 30"" wide and 72"" long (making something close to a queen size bed when both are installed). The supports on each side support about 1"" of the end of the each platform (the whole 30"" width). The supports are able to be moved, so that the two bed platforms can be rearranged into a couch instead of a bed. The bed platforms should be as thin as possible to maintain cargo space below them. They should also be as light as possible so that one person can move them around to transition from bed to couch and back to bed. 

**The current solution**
My first crack at this was to laminate 1"" pink XPS foam in between two 5mm sheets of plywood (0.2""). In the sandwich I also inserted 1/4""x3"" aluminum bar at either end to distribute the 1"" supported over 3"". After the sandwich was laminated with gorilla glue I attached two aluminum 1""x1"" square tubes (with .0625 walls) to the bottom from end to end. I glued them, and also put 1/4-20 bolts through the aluminum tubes and the sandwich. The goal was the prevent the aluminum from any shear motion relative to the sandwich. 

This works pretty well. The whole thing is pretty light (I think lighter than a sheet of 3/4"" plywood, and there is almost no deflection when using the system as a bed. The issue is when in couch mode and you have two adults sitting in the middle of the 70"" span. There is noticeable deflection, and the platform is starting to take a permanent curve (the not-great part of using aluminum). 

**My idea**
I think the general idea is good, I just want to do it better. I have some experience with fiberglass, and have some materials on hand. I am interested in using the same 1"" foam core, and using fiberglass/carbon fiber to make a composite laminate. Since most of the tension will be on the bottom of the platform, I am considering using carbon fiber on the bottom, and use fiberglass on the top. Amazon has some cloth with the following specs:
Weight - 6.2 oz/sqyd 
Weave Style - 2 x 2 twill 
Thickness - .009"" 
Count (W x F) - 13.1 x 13.3 
Fiber - 3K   
To make it stronger, I was thinking I could cut some 1""x1"" pieces of foam and glue them to bottom of platforms, so that when I cover them with carbon fiber I would get a bit of corrugation. 

**Questions I have**
* Does anyone have any gut feelings (or way to calculate) how many layers of carbon fiber I would need on the bottom of the platforms?
* Do people think I should still reinforce the ends of the platform with anything other than fiberglass/carbon fiber (because only a 1"" will be supported"")? 
* Any other ideas on how to make a very strong and very lightweight platform that is 72"" long and can support two adults sitting in the middle of that span (other than buying some crazy honeycomb layup)?

56,Engineer thinking of doing something besides engineering,1561881404,"Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated with a bachelors in EE and will complete a one year masters degree focused on ML, IoT, and AI in Spring 2020, all at a top 10 American Engineering school. I expect to graduate with around a 3.5 GPA for my Master's program. I am going through with the Masters because I only have 5 classes left and I am actually genuinely interested in the stuff I'll be learning. However, I am not sure I will enjoy working as an engineer. This Summer, I am doing embedded software engineering working with satellites (an objectively cool job that I should be super excited about).

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line is I am not happy working as an engineer. All the other interns I sit with wear headphones all day, only taking them off during lunch and meetings. The long days of writing code are draining for me. I enjoy the meetings and talking about what I did and what I am going to do more than I enjoy the work itself. During my first week at this internship, my boss told me that soon enough, I'd have all my software set up and I could ""just get to coding all day."" The fact that I was supposed to like this made me realize that maybe I should consider doing something besides engineering after college. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to work with people and always imagined I'd be an engineer for a year or two and naturally transition to a business role. However, now I'm thinking I might as well start in something where I work with people a lot more. For background, I'm above average at engineering, its just that I've never really loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things I am considering:

1. Management Consulting... something tech related?? -- not sure what prospects are like for someone straight out of a Master's program. I don't think I'd wanna be in the same recruiting class as a bunch of recent bachelor's degree grads. I'm going to have debt from my Master's and I don't want that to be for nothing. What sorts of jobs can an engineer get in consulting right after a Master's degree? 
2. Working at a start up-- I was thinking that maybe working at a small company I could transition into a business role much quicker. I was thinking engineering manager, product manager, or anything that requires technical and soft skills. The only thing that scares me with this is possibly getting stuck in engineering. 
3. Any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, I'm a computer engineering Master's degree grad looking for a more people-focused job. I like technology and think that my Summer project is really interesting. I could probably tough it out and be an engineer for a year or so, but think that I need to work with people all day to be happy in the long term. I plan on getting an MBA and I'm going to start studying for the GMAT this next school year.

So I'm not ""in need"" of getting one asap.

I also live with my parents and have worked enough in the past that I have enough money to pay for my stuff ( car,gas, going out , clothing etc) , so working part time isn't really something I'm looking for.

What I thought of is maybe acquiring some skills that I can learn on my own. I have had programming classes ( C++) but I didnt learn much. I also suck at AutoCad &amp; SolidWorks. I'm looking to learn something during my free time but not sure what. 

I came on here mainly to get some input from engineers ( mainly mechanical?) on skills they would've wished they'd learn before landing their job. Or even from recent mechanical engineering graduates and current students that can give me any advice on what to do/learn. Any advice on  books, youtube channels, websites or tools I should refer to are also very welcomed ! 

If this means anything, my main interests ( even thought I dont know much about these things) are robotics and biomedical engineering.

I made sure I had their approval so I knew they would actually use it.  I brainstormed with them, they gave me ideas and what they wanted to see.  

I fabricated both by myself and started testing them to see if they would work.  I showed the guys on the floor and they gave me feedback on what to add/fix.  I did this several times making sure to get all the little things right, showed all the manufacturing engineers and got their feedback.  The engineers liked the final product, the guys on the floor seemed excited about it.

Fast forward to now and I notice neither are being used, they went back to doing the process the old way.  I asked my supervisor what to do and he said it was a management problem.  My next step was to ask the guys on the floor, but currently I am already doing my other project that needs to get done for this summer so I wouldn't be able to do anything about it anyways.  Both engineers and shop employees said they liked the fixture/stand and helped me get it to the final stage so I am confused why they wouldn't be used.

lets say we do the impossible, to build an interplanetary internet  that has low latency would require servers floating in space or something with caches of all  the data  both planets have generated. (which seems very hard to do the more i think about it )

if this is not doable, then a interplanetary youTube would be not be impossible , but incredibly impractical and slow, because of the how long light takes to make a 1 way journey (~3 mins)

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone, I'm a 22 year old male, currently working full time and recently I have figured out that I want to pursue Coding/Programming as a career. So I am here looking for some advice on where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background of what got me to decide on what I wanted to do as a career... So, I graduated High School in 2015 with not having an idea of what career to pursue. Fast Forward through a few factory jobs, and in 2017, I started working as a Team Lead for a manufacturing assembly line, and at the beginning of that job I was able to have build a close friendship with a few Control Engineers while they worked with setting up a Human Machine Interface (HMI), which at the time the facility had just recently opened so they started basically from scratch. As time passed, I found myself always hanging out with them when I had a chance. I became so fascinated and interested with their work that I slowly started considering it as a career.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present time, I'm still at the same facility, but as a Torque Technician. I am now for sure that I want to  pursue that career, and although I can't afford to go to College right now,  I would like to get some advice as far as what Degree would be best to consider once I am ready.

I expect to work here for the next 3-5 years, but I am a bit worried that when I do decide it’s time to move on from this job, that I will run into the same issues of hiring managers seeing “Bachelors in Nuclear Engineering” on my resume for a MechE application and immediately throwing it out. Currently, part of my training is to learn all of the plant systems (we aren’t a power reactor) which include all of the Electrical and Water systems as well as the regulations and technical specifications of the plant and learning how to operate the reactor. During my first week, my brain felt like it was about to explode from everything I was learning. I’m digesting things much easier now and have gotten used to the influx of information. I’ve learned many things already about pumps and valves and how the reactor coolant systems are designed that I had never learned in school and I expect to continue to keep learning a lot of valuable information about the piping systems. I jokingly tell people it feels like im getting a NukE, MechE, and EE degree all at once.
My question is, when employers see this work experience on my resume in the future, will this knowledge I’m gaining be impressive enough to overcome the “well you’re not a mechE” bias that hiring teams had towards me in the past?  In my personal opinion, having practical and hand on experience with systems and seeing how they actually work, rather than just sitting behind a desk and designing thing without seeing them is invaluable and makes one a very well rounded engineer.

37,Does Your First Job Define What Type of Engineering You Will Do For The Rest of Your Life,1561666197,"I am a 22 year old female electrical engineer about to graduate with GPA 3.4. The place I am co-oping at is full of really great people, an amazing boss, but it's not really the location/type of work I want to do for the rest of my life. This type of work is utilities, with a power company. During my first co-op here they asked me if i wanted a job, but I said I was thinking about doing my masters. They said  that doing your masters doesn't really help you. Is that true? I set off to college with my intent on getting a masters in the very first place but i don't know how true their statement is. I've heard that some people got a job simply because they did have their masters. Since then I felt pressured and ended up accepting the job when I would officially graduate. I'm done with my coursework but my degree requires that i have 3 co-ops, i am currently almost done with 3rd co-op. Also if i accepted this job they said they would pay for my masters classes. I would take about 1 to 2 masters classes a semester which would have me graduating in 2-3 years while working here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't necessarily want to work here as I feel like i'm not learning the type of work I want to do for the rest of my life. I don't see myself staying here for the rest of my life either. I feel like i'm getting left behind by a lot of my friends who are doing more tech-like jobs and learning so much and i'm over here going crazy jealous hearing about the stuff they get to work with. But i'm also very tight for money so making money while taking classes would be great but it would take a lot longer to graduate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple of options that i could take and that is:

1. Find another job that may or may not pay for masters classes.
2. Just take masters classes and go into debt cause I have to afford living expenses too.
3. Continue with this job and masters classes over the course of 2-3 years with a job that I see no future in.

&amp;#x200B;

I am leaning towards options 1 and 2, simply because i feel like the experience i would gain in option 3 would hold me back for getting something like a tech-job when they see I have 3 years experience in a power company and no experience related to the job description. I also feel like i'd go crazy if I stayed here for 2-3 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

42,Building a softball launcher,1561663248,"Hi, I'd like to build a machine that can throw softballs to myself to practice hitting/fielding.

&amp;#x200B;

A 12-inch softball weighs between 6.25 and 7 ounces. For batting, I want it to toss the ball 50 feet (slow-pitch). For fly balls, I want it to throw up to 250 feet.  By my calculations that means 27mph for 50 feet and 60mph for fly balls.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of building a sled system with one spring on each side, then a ball holder in the middle. How much force will be on those springs for each speed?

&amp;#x200B;

Does someone have a diagram to show a mechanism that would pull back the sled, then release it? Phase 2 would be to have a sensor detect when a ball was in place to launch it, then add a remote start/stop controller.

&amp;#x200B;

My first design was going to use a piston mechanism to convert a rotating motor to linear force, but my calculations showed this was going to take a 1000rpm motor and a 15-inch diameter wheel.

&amp;#x200B;

My house is affected by the recent Mississippi River flooding. It is an interesting construction, being built into the side of a hill. The lowest level is the garage, which sits in front of the the basement. The basement floor is 1 foot higher than the garage floor. During the ""Great Flood of '93,"" we built a steel door to place over the doorway between the garage and the basement, which share a common concrete wall (all of the basement and garage walls are concrete). The door was meant to be watertight, but it leaked and we had to build a sandbag well in the garage outside the door to pump out water so that it wouldn't enter the basement. Now, we've had the ""No-So-Great Flood of '19"" which was a few feet lower than '93. We put the door in place and tried to seal it using pool noodles as a gasket, but it still leaked. The water crest at 1' high in the garage and was just hitting the lip of the floor in the basement (whoo!). I want to make the door truly watertight so that I don't have to worry about a sump pump with it. The door is incredibly heavy and currently has to be pushed into place by 2 strong adults. I'm thinking of adding hinges to it so that it can swing into place or wheels to the bottom so at least it can be rolled into place by 1 person. The door is pulled tight against the concrete wall by nuts on threaded rods that pass through the steel and attach to steel beams inside the basement, thus sandwiching the concrete wall between the beams and the door. What can I use to create a watertight seal.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are pictures of the door in place:  [https://imgur.com/a/5MbvHVS](https://imgur.com/a/5MbvHVS) You can see the green pool noodles being squeeze out the sides. They are squeezed internally the same amount.

You will immediately grasp what I'm about to propose. Namely, setting aside such trivial considerations of how to arrange the supply of compressed fluid what would be the result if an aircraft or submarine were covered either wholly or in part in a similar very fine spaced network of tiny holes out of which fluid flowed at a pressure coefficient sufficient enough to create a ""trailing bed of air"" (perhaps originating at a leading edge and flowing around said craft) surrounding or enveloping parts of the fuselage, wing or aelerons either partially or in total with operator or computer control of variables such as flow and pressure or if the system even produced any output at all (or even reversed flow so that air was sucked into the system instead of blown outward. I imagine such a system on a high speed jet or commercial aircraft would have to operate at a different order of magnitude than at a lower speed single propeller aircraft but I'm curious if there are any similar understandings of matrixed injection dyamics into fast moving fluids  ... (maybe in pipeline construction?) ... or maybe you can see some kind of related dynamics on the [grid fins of space x's rockets](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UdpKo.jpg). I can see so many possible scenarios where such a design (of airhockey wings) would catastrophically interfere with the aerodynamic lift of the wings (by reducing control to dangerous levels) or maybe cause unpredictable interactions with surrounding complex air flows .... but it also seems like why would it not be possible to imagine a scenario which also produces beneficial harmonics or geometries of flow and super low friction zones. So where are the chemical engineers, mechanical, and aerospace engineers that have a thorough enough understanding of fluid dynamics and can visualize this concept through multiple iterations of how such a technology might be applied and tell me why in every single imaginable case it would be a terrible, catastrophic failure (let's assume 97% of configurations offer no benefit or create harmful conditions to overall craft control)  ...

59,BSEE Considering MBA - Advice Appreciated,1561642296,"I know this topic has been covered in other posts, but I feel each individual facing this decision has unique situations and career goals that affect the pursuit of an MBA.

&amp;#x200B;

I am two years removed from obtaining my BSEE (power focus). It was not easy for me by any means, and I graduated with a low GPA. Since graduating, I have worked as an electrical design engineer in the power industry (substation design).  I enjoy it and value the experience I'm getting, but I've always known that I did not want to be in a technical role my entire career; a c-suite position with an engineering-focused company has always been the ultimate goal.  I want to be more focused on the business side rather than tinkering with schematics and electrical diagrams. However, I don't want to be in the finance industry or something like that.  I want to remain in the engineering realm but making business decisions. Because of that, I feel that an MBA would be a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

My company will pay for a fair portion of my MBA.  I would go part time for about 2.5 years, and it would cost me a total of $10k out of pocket (good ROI in my opinion).  At that point, I'd have about 5 years of experience and an MBA (potentially also my P.E.; I will probably pursue it within the next 2 years but am unsure if it is a waste of time if I the goal is to get into the business side).

&amp;#x200B;

Due to my low GPA, my MBA options are limited, and I am currently considering SNHU (yes, the university that does all the cheesy commercials).  I was skeptical at first, but they are fully accredited and have good reviews from past students.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd greatly appreciate some feedback from other engineers who have insight into this.

&amp;#x200B;

First, does the name of the school matter in a situation like this? Would an MBA from SNHU to be used in the engineering field be scoffed at?

&amp;#x200B;

Second, what concentration would you recommend? Finance? Business Intelligence? Engineering management? Marketing? I'm very torn on this.  I know engineering management sounds perfect, but I'd be concerned that it would lock me into being a technical engineering manager, but maybe I'm being pessimistic.  SNHU describes that program as the following:

&amp;#x200B;

""The Engineering Management concentration will focus on integrating systems thinking concepts and systems engineering practices to develop effective engineering management strategies. Students will gain the knowledge to make informed and successful business decisions that foster improved efficiency, performance, and effectiveness in highly technical engineering environments.""

&amp;#x200B;

Third, would obtaining my P.E. be overkill? All technical managers in my company are required to have it, as signing off on electrical documents is something that is required. That being said, I understand that not all engineering careers would require this. I don't expect passing the P.E. exam would be easy for me considering obtaining my BSEE was no cake-walk. If it'd add no value to me climbing the corporate ladder, I'd consider not pursuing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, is there a recommended career path? Design Engineer&gt;&gt;Project Management&gt;&gt;Manager of PMs&gt;&gt;Potential C-Suite? Design Engineer&gt;&gt;Engineering Supervisor (PE required)&gt;&gt;Engineering Management&gt;&gt;Potential C-Suite? Should sales engineering be thrown in there somewhere?

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I'm asking a great deal in the preceding, but I have so many questions going through my head and really no one to turn to for guidance on this exact matter, as an MBA is not popular in my company (but I feel it could open many more doors for me).

67,"What ""simple"" questions do interviewees routinely fail to answer?",1561617079,"Hi all. I had this thought today (for the 100th time) and wondered what those of you who interview potential hires might have to say.

There are certain fundamentals questions that I ask most candidates. Some of these I considered removing because it seems almost insulting to ask a 10-15 year engineer to answer such ""basic"" questions. Except that they routinely get them wrong, even with a decent amount of handholding. So I keep them in.

I don't like to ask questions that require memorization of formulas that most engineers wouldn't be able to remember anyway. I do like to ask questions that test whether you have a basic ""intuition"" or understanding of engineering principles.

What kind of questions? Things like...you have 2 identical dams holding back water. Water level is the same, the dams are the same in all respects, except one dam is situated 1 meter away from a solid wall with water in between. The other dam has an infinite ocean of water behind it. Which experiences more force? Of course, the force depends on pressure and area. Area is the same, so you're left with water: density, gravity, and height. They are also the same. Maybe 10% of candidates get this right on the first try. It should be a 15 second question, but it often takes 5 minutes to talk them through the process of figuring it out. 

There is another that involves knowing that - due to it's moment of inertia - a cylinder rolling down a slope will take longer to reach the bottom than a frictionless block of the same mass sliding down the same slope. And again...very few candidates realize that on their own without prodding from me.

69,I need to build a water tower and am not this smart.,1561609341,"Hello everyone, I hope this is an acceptable question. I've been googling for about 2 hours and am not this good at math.

Little backstory: My family has a small island and cottage in northern Ontario. It's remote enough that we can't reasonably count on any fire department help, and the soil is dry/sandy enough that fire can travel very easily underground. We are very careful with any open flames, but still use a fireplace for heat, and bbq to cook, and burning down the entire island is not something we want to do. Our current water supply is just an on demand pump straight out of the lake. It's fine for showers and washing dishes but not enough pressure that I want to try and put out a fire with it.

I've been looking at getting a second hand IBC container to use as an emergency water tower, but I'm not sure it would be worth it. The cottage itself is about 50ft below the highest point on the island, and I wasn't really planning to build any actual tower, just put the container up there, and keep it full. I found some decommissioned 3"" fire hose for about $1/ft that I'd hook up to the 1000L IBC.

My rough math tells me I'd get a little over 20psi, but I can't figure out how that actually translates to water flow out of a 3"" hose.

72,"6 weeks into first engineering job after college, company forgoes merit pay-increases",1561604659," 

Hey all sorry for length, but I'm looking for some advice/feedback on my situation . Throwaway because, well, yeah.

First engineering job outside college. Fortune 500 company. 1:3 debt-income ratio. Company announced there will be no merit based pay increases for this year, for anyone. No word on how long this freeze will last. Early retirement incentive packages being rolled out. I got in just before the hiring freeze. 

Chatting with the other new college-hires I on-boarded with, we found out our offer letters were very different, despite salary+vacation are basically the same. For example, mine explicitly says how many hours my salary is adjusted for, no one else's does. We're mostly in the same business units. I am liable for my sign-on for 2 years if I leave early, everyone else is on the hook for only 1 year. None of us negotiated on that stuff.

Furthermore, I just found out the role I'm in has traditionally been filled with an engineer with 3-5 years experience and I was a just a ""right-fit right-time"" hire, despite being paid entry-level. Most engineers in roles at that level make 12% more than I am being paid. I could probably make an extra $5k more elsewhere in the city I live, but i don't think I'm underpaid for entry. My role does take on alot more responsibility than the other new-hired engineers though, which is odd. To top it off one of the new hires was a very last minute hire, his manager confessed that they had to ""really squeeze the books to get him hired because of the rest of the new hires"".

At first glance, what do you guys and gals think of this situation? I'm not really upset about my salary, I'm very grateful to have the debt-to-income ratio I have fresh out of college. I also realize I probably wouldn't have received a merit-based pay raise in my first year anyway. But it is slightly worrying me, this changing culture, for me to start my career in. What's more perplexing is the narrative I was sold on were the facts: large market share, growing business units, great margins. But then it seems very lean, so much so that wages are affected? Doesn't add up for me, but then again, what do I know.

My plan is to become financially independent, maybe retire early, freelance, maybe pursue a PhD. On paper, I thought I hit the goldmine here. Now with all this, I'm doubting staying, thinking of sticking around for 2-3 years just to get experience (if all goes well). Logistically, the transition has been very difficult for me, there are nights where I think of just giving up and going somewhere else...

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. What are your thoughts? Is this typical corporate culture? I'm curious how this sounds to someone with experience.

80,"What would be a base ISO acceptable for consuer, prosumer, and profesional MILC cameras Organic CMOS sensor? Is it possible to safely omit the mechanical shutter entirely?",1561593295,"I am brainstorming and looking for ideas on how to improve established digital camera systems that are for still and motion picture photographers. I learned that lowering downstream electrical noise will improve low light performance and dynamic range more than anything else. From a technical perspective, a camera with a high base ISO is superior. The problem is not everyone wants to use optical ND filters (on sensor or on lens) to fix the issue of too much light. Many photographers, especially still ones, think larger recording areas always mean less noise because the fluctuations are not magnified as much. For film, that's true. For digital, larger sensors alone don't affect noise. It's mostly about electrical design.

&amp;#x200B;

With current cameras, you must make a choice between a focal plane shutter, a leaf shutter, or a rolling electronic shutter. These all create problems when trying to use a wide aperture, a flash, and a broad daylight environment. Leaf shutters enable faster flash sync and expose the whole frame. The problems with leaf shutter lenses include higher weight, complexity, price, and less freedom for optical corrections. With focal plane shutters, the shutter does not expose the whole frame at once. With HSS flash sync, it lowers the flash power and raises the burden on the batteries. This is because shorter low power bursts are used to mimic continuous light. Rolling electronic shutters have similar problems.

&amp;#x200B;

With the Organic CMOS sensor idea from Panasonic, I read that the gain can be adjusted to produce step free ND filter characteristics without the optical ND filters. Ideally, I would want the sensor to have a high base ISO (like 800 or higher) and have ND filter like characteristics to enable more light to hit it when you want a low ISO like 100. This way, the sensor can have an ISO of 100 or 800 or anything in between all while having equal image quality when exposed properly (for example: get 16 stops of dynamic range at ISO 100 or 800). Is this technically feasible? I know with Panasonic cinema cameras, exposing for 100 will cause clipping in many circumstances while many cameras start at ISO 100 and won't clip as fast.

&amp;#x200B;

To enable fast flash sync speed without HSS or leaf shutters, my idea to have the whole sensor start and stop the photon collection process at the exact same time. This is to enable only one burst for flash at a shutter speed of 1/8000.

&amp;#x200B;

Other ideas include a hardware based hot pixel detector. If the sensor detects no electrical response at a pixel while everywhere else has electrical response, the response for that pixel stops and is flagged for removal when exposure is over. Unlike the dark frame reference, this happens during the exposure meant to capture and record the image and eliminates the need for dark frame reference.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to have analog gamma compression and possibly the option for analog logarithmic compression too. Both will improve dynamic range. Gamma compression rewards over exposure if you don't clip the highlights; it's great when brighter regions are the subject. Logarithmic will be available for when you want to compress highlights and improve mid tones and shadows.

81,Career Advive - taking the leap to contracting?,1561591468,"Hi everyone! 

I'm looking for some advice from engineers/professionals who may have been at this crossroads before. 

I'm currently employed on a staff contract with an engineering firm and have been since graduation from a BEng in Mech Eng (2017). In that time I've completed their graduate training program and a part time MEng (chemical). I'm disappointed with my salary and the increments I've received and have begun looking elsewhere. 

An opportunity has come up through a rival engineering firm as a Process Engineering contractor for a 9 month gig at a pharma plant (located closer to home than my current job). Taking the jump to contracting at this early stage of my career would mean I'd lose the security of a permanent staff role, sick pay entitlements, and paid time off. I'd be setting up a Ltd. Company and invoicing the client for my services. However, it would mean a drastic increase in my income (almost 3X my current salary) - which would allow me to clear student debt and get a start on some significant savings. Obviously, there is no guarantee that after the 9 month contract is up I will immediately be able to find work - but the market is quite good right now. 

I'm leaning towards taking the plunge and seeing what contracting has to offer, but wanted to reach out and ask people's experiences with this approach. Are there any other downsides to contracting I may have missed? Is it a bit too risky?

Hi Everyone!

Some background on me: I graduated in 2014 with a BSEE from a reputable 4 year university. I then worked for about 1.5 years as a technical sales supporter for a sensor manufacturer helping the sales team with technical questions and coordinating things between engineering and production. Following that I thought about going to medical school so started working in the medical field for \~2.5 years while taking all the Bio and Chem related classes. After deciding that I was mental for thinking about medical school, I returned to engineering.

I am currently working as a project leader for a manufacturing plant. I've been here about a month, but dread coming into work every day as the position is more of a maintenance position. I do not design anything just more of issue purchase orders, call vendors, and put work orders in. That is if there is anything to do at all, otherwise I spend my time staring at the wall.

I am going to stick with the position for a little while as I need to have the experience back in the field and am grateful to even have found someone who would hire me after the break from engineering.

My Question:

I want to move towards a more design oriented role, but have no prior work experience in such a role. I really enjoyed creating, designing and just generally doing more engineering related work while in school. All the job postings I see in the area have the typically 3-5 years experiences.

What are somethings that I could be doing to help better position myself to change industries to something more design related? or any general advise as to how to move roles as it feels rather hopeless. I do not want to pigeon hole myself more then I have with my jumping around in careers.

I am however planning on doing a Masters part time with a focus in signals, embedded systems, and circuits in the near future.

Here's what i know

1) the power of the explosion is based on a lot of things, but mostly the mass of the charge. 2) different combustibles combust at different speeds - the charge in a pistol cartridge explodes 'faster' than that of a rifle cartridge. 3) longer barrels are more efficient because the explosion has more time to push the bullet before escaping out the end, but, 4) logically there has to be a point where this benefit is cancelled out by drag. 5) the chamber has to survive the detonation over and over; more energy means a thicker chamber, which brings a lot of negative qualities to the firearm.

I have been having no luck finding a resource to compare the per-mass energy of various combustibles or their combustion speeds, so I have been unable to compare dynamite to smokeless powder in these respects.

NOTE: the diameter of the bullet is that of the dynamite. Big slug! So! 1) would it work? Could this be a thing someone could carry around and use? 2) obviously, if the benefits of this weapon outweighed the benefits of a conventional rifle we'd be using it, so this in no way is supposed to be a 'better' gun, but what advantages WOULD it have? 3) would it be better to have the rifling in the barrel or on the slug? 4) assuming that the required weight and length of thr item are acceptable, how 'powerful' could this thing be?

The dynamite gun is fictional and exists in its fiction only for thematic reasons.",AskEngineers,False,Sparkmane,/r/AskEngineers/comments/c5rruz/could_not_should_dynamitetnt_be_used_as_the/

1- Brittleness or toughness of the tip screwdriver

2- Tightness of the connection between the shank and the handle screwdriver

3- The limit of bending steel will stand without being plastically deformed screwdriver

I'm tempted to say YES, because for a given surface geometry, ""h"" is mostly dependent on the velocity and properties of the surrounding fluid (same air around both fins).

However, the properties of the fluid are dependent on its temperature...which will be impacted by the local temperature of the surface....which will depend on the conductivity of the material.

This [PDF link](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~david/courses/cs552/S12/handouts/ecc-phelps.pdf) gives a good overview of details for a 4 bit actual data word + 4 bits of parity/checkbit generation for a total of 8 bits.

I understand the overall concept of Hamming codes and generating the parity/checkbits.  The syndrome calculation should tell you which *exact bit* out of the entire 8 bits of data+parity is bad for a single error. 

What I can't follow though is the syndrome calculation for telling which bit is bad and the one you want to ""flip"" to correct.  On page 6, he has a matrix and the following lines for example:

    flip[3] = ~synd[4] &amp; ~synd[3] &amp;  synd[2] &amp;  synd[1] &amp;  synd[0]
    flip[3] =  synd[4] &amp; ~synd[3] &amp; ~synd[2] &amp;  synd[1] &amp;  synd[0]
    flip[3] =  synd[4] &amp; ~synd[3] &amp;  synd[2] &amp; ~synd[1] &amp;  synd[0]
    flip[3] =  synd[4] &amp; ~synd[3] &amp;  synd[2] &amp;  synd[1] &amp; ~synd[0]

I don't get it.  How can you assign multiple calcs like this to the same bit flip[3]?  How is this math here derived?  Similar for the other flip bits.


EDIT: actually, I think the author may have typos. The flip[*] bits should be going down the matrix as flip[0], flip[1], flip[2],..., flip[7]??

I've been with my current employer for the past 5 years, and up until around a year and a half ago I loved it. But over the course of the past year and a bit our department has gone through some significant changes, and as such I have began to really hate having to turn up to work. I've only ever worked with my current employer so don't really have a significant insight into usual industry attitude and practices...

I no longer have the opportunity to learn when working on projects, everything is rushed and I am missing significant details because I do not have the time to review properly and ensure I understand them. This means I'm taking continual knocks to my confidence, to the point where I'm worried about doing anything without someone else checking it...Which seems to be a significant struggle in itself. I know that I am capable when it comes to my job, but it's becoming ever more difficult to show it. I'm also expected to carry out tasks which are far above my remit, which I don't mind doing, but I receive no support from management while doing so.

72,Having trouble deciding on a job offer!,1561471412,"  

Made a throwaway for this post. I’m completely on the fence regarding a recent job offer I recently received from a large defense contractor for a Systems Engineer position. I currently work as a NASA contractor as a flight controller for ISS. I’m 25 y/o and I’m currently in my first job out of undergrad. I have a Bachelors of aerospace engineering and I’m currently pursuing a Masters in Unmanned Aerospace Systems. 

Ideally, I would like to soon obtain a job with NASA either as an aerospace engineer or robotics engineer or operator. My dream is to one day become an astronaut. I’m making arrangements to gain my private pilot’s license (PPL) and after that, I am thinking to pursue Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve to gain significant flight hours. 

I’ve gone back and forth a million times trying to decide. My current job is as a console operator, and the offer is for an engineering position, which is what I’ve studied for. Each selection has its perks; the pros for each job are listed below. However, one of my main questions is whether it would be more valuable to diversify my career and gain actual engineering experience or stay with NASA (as a contractor), which is ultimately where I want to be, in a civil servant position (I think?), though my current job is not technically engineering. Salary, and some benefit info will be included below. I must note that my contractor raised my salary a couple months ago after I received other job offers; I accepted my current company’s counter. The current offer under consideration is significantly better than anything I received earlier. I’m also curious whether it would look bad to go back to my current company and inform them of this offer to see if they could up my current salary or tuition assistance. Any input/advice is much appreciated. 

**Current Job:** 

· I really like the work; my passion is space exploration. Future space missions, such as the Artemis program, are things I very much want to be involved in. 

· I know the culture and I know it is a good place to work, whereas I do not really know the culture of the potential job I’ve been offered. 

· I have a lot of flexibility – time off, telework, etc., but this comes with the cost of having to work all 3 shifts at times. However, this flexibility could allow me to pursue other interests, such as PPL, with relative ease. 

· I’m good at what I do. I’ve moved up the ranks relatively quickly and I could see myself continuing to move up into higher level lead positions, including (potentially) civil servant positions within the next few years. 

**Potential Job:** 

· The job sounds very interesting. The leads for this particular team sound very intelligent and willing to pass along knowledge. 

· Actual engineering experience, though it is systems engineering. 

· \~15% base salary increase over my current salary.

· \~4x tuition assistance offered compared to my current company’s tuition assistance policy. 

· \~double the company 401k contributions compared to my current company.

38,"Is anyone an engineer that doesn't love to build things, tinker, etc?",1561334412,"I'm currently a rising junior at a state school majoring in Finance and Accounting. Recently though, I've been re-thinking what led me down this path in University. In high school, I was always one of the very smart kids (National Merit finalist, full ride to college, etc). I'm not saying this to brag at all but provide some context. I never had any real idea of what I wanted to do in college, but most of my friends who ran in the same academic circles as me are currently doing engineering/CS at college. I had internalized at that point in HS that in order to be an engineer, one must love to think spatially, build things, all the bullet points you'll see on career quiz inventories. These were and are not strong points or real interests of mine (further proving this, I found Cal 1/2 fairly easy in HS but struggled more in Cal 3). Given this, I decided to major in finance and accounting as they seemed at least like solid choices in terms of employment outlook. Now though, there are several factors making me re-think this decision. 
(Fair wanting that this may seem like /r/iamverysmart material)
At college, I've found most of my business school peers to be very different than myself and the group of friends I had always kept growing up. I really have not been challenged very much by the curriculum (my only B thus far came when I attempted to take an upper level foreign language course after not taking a class in it for 3 years). For example, many of my friends in the business school have talked about how hard Intermediate Accounting was this last semester. I finished with a 96 with fairly minimal studying.
 This is all well and good, but I can't help missing being one of the ""smart kids"". I often see many engineering students who can't make it in engineering switch to business, and worry that I'm seen as a lower-tier student.
In addition to this, as I look at potential careers or internships, many jobs will say they are looking for ""finance or other quantitative majors"", usually including engineering. I understand why many companies specify this, as they would prefer to hire a ""smarter"" person irregardless of background. Given my status at a non-target university, ""high finance"" jobs""l (Investment Banking, private equity, etc) are all out of reach or could also be attained by an engineering grad with similar networking, etc. The jobs left seem to me to be carrying a high likelihood of being automated in near years. 
I've been mulling over a switch to majoring in engineering, even though it would mean adding at least a year to my degree and essentially throwing out everything I've done to this point. 
Did anyone major in/pursue a career in engineering not because they were particularly drawn to it, but because it was the ""smart thing to do?"" If so, would you recommend a path like that?

Hello, I hope this is the right sub to post this in. Anyways, a little back story:

I got my BSME back in Spring 2017, didn't have any internships. Got my first engineering job a year after college. I was told the position would be a blend of mechanical and operations engineering, but it actually involved almost no engineering. Didn't get to use CAD or any math, had only minor involvement with the operations of the company, only really dealt with OSHA and DOT paperwork. I was let go after being there for almost 9 months when the company relocated my job to a different state and decided not to move me.

I've had multiple phone interviews and a few in-person interviews since then, got turned down for all of them. Several of them were at companies that various college friends currently work for and they were nice enough to recommend me for the positions. I'm pretty sure I was turned down due to my lack of relevant work experience.

I feel trapped. The only way to get more work experience is to get a job, but I need more work experience to get a job. I'm currently trying to get some certifications through self study (Inventor Certified User, GD&amp;T, FEA) but other than that I don't really see anything I can do to show that I am trying to gain relevant experience.

Are there any other career options I may not have looked at that I could use as a foot-in-the-door that would lead to an ME position later on?

Hi reddit, I have been working in a company that develops offshore wind projects for the last year and a half or so. Until now, my role has been of a junior engineer (first full-time job since graduating from university with an Aerospace Engineering degree). The scope of this position has been very vague and I have ended becoming an assistant to whatever department needed more manpower, may it be procurement, finance, programme, business development... For a while I have been looking for something more specific to actually get the chance to really get some structure in my day-to-day.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago, I was approached by somebody in the Wind Yield (WY) department (they optimise wind turbine layouts, estimate production of projects, site data gathering and data analysis campaigns,etc.) offering me a position in their team. At first I was very keen for this position and I got in contact with HR for the transfer. When I let my current manager know of this he told me that he thought this position would be a wasted opportunity for me. He offered me an alternative to wait until september when numerous other less technical ""contract management"" positions are opening up and then basically get my pick of the department I was most interested to join (wind turbines, offshore structures, cables,etc.) as a project engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I shouldn't take his advice as gospel as he obviously doesn't want to lose somebody in his headcount, but he did raise some valid points. He told me that the WY team just churns out the numbers requested by the rest of the project team, don't have the ability to question many design choices, and that career progression would be more limited. It is also a very niche department and chances of transferring out of that department within the company are limited. These arguments may seem overly pessimistic but I do agree with them to some extent from my experience so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very torn between the two options because I think I would do really well and enjoy the day-to-day in the WY position as I am a numbers guy and really enjoy complex calculations in MATLAB and Excel, and I would love to become an expert in something. However, I also really enjoy the contract negotiations and management side of things as I am good at public speaking, I like to be involved in the daily struggles of a project, and like to have a view on a wide range of topics and not feel isolated simply doing calculations.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been given 2 weeks to make a decision and until the deadline I plan on speaking to as many different people in my company for advice. I know that ultimately this has to be my decision but I would like if anyone here on reddit has had similar experiences and can share any insight to help me make the best choice.

I'm currently a year 12 student in Australia and am having a difficult time with deciding on what I want to study at university next year.

I really love the environment, I love being outside and not always being stuck behind a computer sitting at a desk. In my career I would really love to be out in the field a lot doing work. With that being said though, I'm also one of your classic 'maths nerds' and was one of the top maths students in the state last year.

My interest in being out doing a lot of work in the field has drawn me to the Bachelor of Science (majoring in ecology), but my strength in maths has drawn me to doing a Bachelor of Environmental Engineering. The other option is that I do a double degree, doing both.

I'm worried that if I do engineering, its going to be too much just sitting at a desk doing 'maths stuff' throughout my degree and future career. However, I'm also worried if I do the science degree (going by some of the research I've done), the pay/opportunities is far less than if you did engineering.

Or would you say there is another perspective on this and that I should just push through this very uncomfortable feeling?

Cattle release a lot of methane into the environment, most of it comes out of their mouths. There are already solutions for the solid waste called biodigesters, but not for what comes out of the mouth. I came up with some designs for enclosed shelters that are meant to capture the methane in order to generate electricity. Below is a link to a youtube video to give you something of a visual of what I was originally thinking:

https://youtu.be/5x3PUb4fgls

There are already natural gas generators, so really the main aspect for this to work is to figure out how to prepare the methane for use in the generator, especially since the methane is not isolated but mixed in with the surrounding air. Doing some online research I came up with some potential ways of going about this, they are as follows:

Capture the methane and oxygen, compress, and possibly be able to use this for combustion being mixed. According to wikipedia: As a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations (5.4–17%) in air at standard pressure.

According to wikipedia methane is soluble in a number of liquids, one of which is ethanol. Run the air/methane through ethanol, once fully dissolved, then either extract it, or possibly use it in this liquid form in a generator.

Cooled on location to turn into LNG.

Pumping methane and air into a separate above chamber, perhaps a pyramid shaped structure. Allowing the methane to concentrate in one area, then intermittently sucking it out into another chamber. So while it will not be pure methane, it will be concentrated enough to be used in a natural gas generator.

Once I found this type of switch, I had to find one that would work within my parameters. 12VDC and 24VDC applications rated to &gt;50 amps. The plan was to run these switches in line with my positive lead on my motors and when the motor overheats, the switch opens and kills the motor power supply.

Could not find an easy solution at those amp requirements.

So instead I am tying these thermal protectors to the relay switch which controls the motor. The relay system draws about 1 amp, and there are plenty of 30VDC max, 5 Amp max thermal protectors

Input is a 90 turning into the bottom right, the output is vertical out of the top left of the array, with a manual water drain out of the bottom left.

Once it exits the system I will run the air through a standard filter/water trap just before dropping it into the tank.

My thought process is by jumping up to a larger diameter with multiple paths I get to take advantage of the cooling effects of expansion as well as the heat dissipation into the copper tubing.

54,How do inverters on motors affect output torque?,1561122285,"  

Hi Reddit

**Background:**

On our site we have a motor that is used to rotate a shaft. This shaft has wire cables wrapped around it that lift a platform that we load up. We have run into an issue where we need to increase the load rating for the platform. This requires larger diameter cables, and larger shaft diameter for those cables. We also want to keep the speed at which the load is raised the same, meaning we need to reduce the rpm of the shaft. The motor has an inverter on it that we can use to reduce the speed. The motor also has a gearbox that I have had to try and calculate the gear ratio for based on motor rpm/rpm of our shaft.

The question I am struggling with is if we reduce the inverter will we have enough torque to lift the load?

**Data:**

|**Rated   Motor details**| **Value** | **Equations** |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Power (W) | 11000 ||
| Motor output Shaft OD (m) | 0.042 ||
| rpm | 1400 ||
| Motor torque (Nm) | 75.0 | T = P\*60/rpm\*2\*PI |
| Motor frequency (Hz) | 50 ||

  

| **Item** | **Value** | **Equation** |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Existing shaft OD (m) | 0.09 ||
| Current inverter frequency (Hz) | 31 ||
| Current RPM | 8.3 | Measured |
| Target max load (kg) | 4000 ||
| OD of new shaft (m) | 0.22 ||
| Required torque (Nm) | 4316.4 | T = mass\*g\*Drum radius |
| 2x Safety factor (Nm) | 8632.8 | to account for friction losses etc. |

&amp;#x200B;

**Calculations:**

| **Current setup with inverter at 31Hz** | **Value** | **Equations** |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Rated frequency (Hz) | 50 ||
| Reduced frequency (Hz) | 31 ||
| Ratio | 0.62 ||
| Motor (rpm) | 868 | New rpm = base rpm\*ratio |
| New motor torque (Nm) | 121.0 | T= P\*60/rpm\*2\*PI |
| Current output shaft rpm | 8.3 | Measured |
| Gear box ratio | 104.8 | Ratio = Motor rpm/Output rpm |
| Output torque (Nm) | 12686.3 | Output Torque = gearbox ratio \* motor torque |

&amp;#x200B;

| **With inverter at 12.8Hz** | **Value** | **Equations** |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Rated frequency (Hz) | 50 ||
| Reduce frequency (Hz) | 12.8 ||
| Ratio | 0.256 ||
| Motor (rpm) | 358.4 | New rpm = base rpm\*ratio |
| New motor torque (Nm) | 293.1 | T= P\*60/rpm\*2\*PI |
| New output shaft rpm | 3.4 | Required to keep platform speed the same |
| Gear box ratio | 104.8 | Measured from experimental data |
| Output torque (Nm) | 30724.5 | Output Torque = gearbox ratio \* motor torque |

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions:**

\- Reducing the frequency proportionally reduces the motor speed/rpm

\- The way I have calculated the gearbox ratio is accurate (debatable)

These calcs would imply that our torque will increase as we reduce the rpm with the inverter. However, this seems odd and I think there is something fundamental I am missing about how the inverter affects the motor outputs. Would is also reduce the effective power output as well as the rpm? If so with what relationship? Is there something else I am missing here?",AskEngineers,False,dansonage,/r/AskEngineers/comments/c3abdn/how_do_inverters_on_motors_affect_output_torque/

3. Can anyone provide more insight on the HVAC work that goes on in air return walls? The purpose is to recirculate the filtered air back to the cieling plenum, but how does the ducting specifically interact with the plenum? Is the air just returned to the open plenum, connected to the air return for the air handler, or ducted directly to fan filters?

81,Advice for new grad regarding job hunt on a specific situation (contract vs full time),1561065924,"Hi and this is my first post on here, so sorry if I miss anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently graduated with my BSME a couple of months ago after completing my degree in 5 years and have since been applying for jobs in the automotive industry. I have had two internships so far and plenty of other work/project experience relevant more or less to my career interests.

&amp;#x200B;

I mainly wanted to come on here to get some advice regarding my situation. Although I have been searching and applying for full-time jobs since graduation, I have also been contacted by a staffing firm for a Big-3 OEM company about some contract-to-hire engineering roles within product development/design release.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I really want to go foreward with them, my main dillemma is A) I feel like I, as a new grad, am worth more than a contract, B) I could get stuck or released from the contract early for any reason despite working hard, and C) although I might get a slightly-above-average salary, I would be paid hourly (although this isn't necissaryly a dealbreaker). I have also heard of people getting their hire dates perpetually pushed back which scares me.

&amp;#x200B;

However I am strongly considering taking going for it, since it feels like it would be a good way to get a foot in the door with the company and network. Ideally I would take the position, kick ass and work hard, get to know people/network, and either apply for a direct position within the first 3-6 months or get into one of their rotational development programs for engineering (to get assistance with pursuing a master's degree). I would also keep searching for other jobs while being in the contract as well to make sure I have a fallback if I get let out early, that job could be at another company/tier 1 etc.

&amp;#x200B;

At the very least, it would still look great on the resume and I wouldn't be unemployed. I have also asked the staffing agency the contacted me initially many questions about benefits and some of the stuff I mentioned and they said that I could leave the contract if I get a direct position early, etc. but I mainly wanted to come on here and see if any of you had any input.

85,Corridor Pressurization for Mutlifamily Buildings,1561060207,"I have two scenarios and I haven't been able to find a reliable source that quantifies how much air to use.  I'd appreciate any insight.

Scenario 1: The apartment units are utilizing natural ventilation.  The corridors are served by split systems on each floor.  The split systems receive outside air.  If I'm trying to keep the corridor positively pressurized, how do I account for exhaust fans, range hoods, and dryers?  Let's say I have a 50 cfm bathroom fan, a 300 cfm range hood, and a 100 cfm dryer.  All of these things operate intermittently.  Should I add 450 cfm to the corridor for each apartment?  That's adds up to a lot!  Is there a diversity I can apply to it?  Should I just add 450 cfm of OA total to the corridor with the thought that only one apartment door will be open at a time.  That would leave the apartments very negatively pressurized when someone is using the kitchen fan (which will invite a lot of infiltration from outside).

Scenario 2:  The apartment units are bringing in OA to a split system.  With everything else being equal, I imagine I could take the amount of OA from Scenario 1 and subtract the OA being introduced to the units.  If that's true, would it be cumulative for all the apartments?

&amp;#x200B;

In either case, there would need to be some kind of relief, right?  Like a gravity relief damper on each floor?

&amp;#x200B;

Utilizing 100% OA rooftop units for the corridors is preferable, however we don't always get that luxury.  And it still begs the question as to how much air to use.  At least with 100% OA RTUs we can lower the total supply air since it's all ventilation air.

To which of the intakes should I connect the second hose? This will be the hose that draws in air from outside so the machine doesn't use the cold air in the room.

17,Negotiating before salary bump is confirmed?,1561012938,"Hello all,

I had my performance review today with my department manager and my team manager. I have been working there for just about a year now right out of college.

I got glowing reviews across the board for my primary job responsibilities and also for the additional responsibilities I took on. In addition, I will be taking up more responsibilities immediately and working on special projects and taking more management roles. I was told that my manager put in a request for a 5-10% increase in salary to upper management (relatively small company, without tiered job titles), and said he was really pushing for 10% for me. 

Now, I am really grateful that my manager is pushing for a higher raise for me instead of trying to give me the bare minimum. However, even with the 10% increase, I believe I am underpaid for my job title in my area according to Glassdoor, Salary.com, and Indeed. I firmly believe that a 12-15% raise is a fairer recognition of my value to the company.

I'm finishing BS in mechanical engineering, however specializing in thermal (might be different system in other countries). HVAC is something I fell in love with as soon as I started studying it. My first project was calculating heat load of friend's building and for my diploma I'm making quite sweet excel worksheet for determining effect of unheated apartment(s) on apartment building and adjacent apartments. 

I'm trying to learn and follow as many standards as possible. And here it gets kind of silly.

Recently I've been invited to work on a project. I did my calculations, followed needed standards to the point, but calculation was mainly done using ISO 12831. Exception were thermal bridges which I determined approximately based on other standard and ventilation based on common sense, while still following standard od course.

So after I handed in my calculations, I got feedback my numbers are 15% off - too low - comparing to that guy's calculations and experience. He's following way older standard which many people seems to use and it's most similar to fast calculation method ISO 12831 offers, which is from my experience (project and diploma) quite off - can be up to 30% it seems. 

So naturally I started doubting in my calculations, even if I checked several times for any error. Argument why it was wrong was that I took improper U-value for windows, even if I know which windows are installed, by logic that gas leaks out and you should calculate worst scenario, which is in my opinion bullshit. Other argument was that heat load through the floor isn't high enough because water might flow less than 1m below the house - more than 10°C below freezing point?

Only thing I could think of is improper determination of thermal bridges, but standard provides good enough approximations that should, as I believe, be freely used in calculations and not give wrong numbers, if any give too high heat load result. 

Ia there a possibility that my calculations are correct, but in practice old school people ""overdimension"" things in fear it might not work well enough? Because they are used to it?

It makes me kind of scared if I'll work on a project alone that I'd screw things up and people would say ""hey, I'm cold in my house!"".

40,What did really happen during the cernobyl accident?,1560976277,"Hello Guys. I know this is a really borad question, but the specifics of the question was hard to put into the title.

I wrote a paper on the Chernobyl accident for an assignment in my major (Security &amp; Safety Engineering) a few months back and found something that I can't wrap my head around:

On 26th of April 1986, beginning at 01:23:04 there was a rundown test of turbogenerator No. 8 to check if it can provide enough energy to the main circulation pumps. In the course of that test the reactor went super critical and exploded. The thing that I don't understand is this:

In all documentaries, some books, the TV show and all youtube videos I could find on the topic it is stated that the reactor experienced a power excursion beginning at approx 01:23:30. The explanation is that after the rundown of the turbine, the main circulation pumps connected to it started to run down too, reducing the flow through the core. This lead to an increase in steam quality and hence the void fraction in the lower part of the core. This in turn lead to an increase in power because more voids mean more reactivity. The operators noticed this and initiated the emergency shutdown (AZ-5). And now the design of the control rods lead to an addition of positive reactivity in the lower core, cementing the disaster.
This is what I knew before I stareted the assignment and what is reiterated everywhere. The main sources with a legit scientific background I could find that support this version of events is the US NRC Report from 1987[1] and a paper from 1988[2].

But when I read the Shteynberg Commission Report from 1991[4] and the Report by Abagyan from 1991[5] which both are published and translated in INSAG-7 by the IAEA there where two details that seem to contradict this version of events:

1. It is stated that the Shteynberg Commission could not establish why AZ-5 was pressed. This is really out of the ordinary if there was a power excursion happening before 01:23:40. Under the circumstances of a power excursion there is a obvious reason to push this button.

2. The Shteynberg Commission stated that until 01:23:40 the reactor ran stable and that void creation was minimal. If the Turbine is isolated from the main coolant loop (MFC) the pressure increases slightly because there is not enough removal of heat in contrast of normal operation.

3. The Shteynberg Commission stated that all 8 main circulation pumps where running on almost full power, with 4 involved in the test. So the other 4 where still connected to the grid and could pick up the load required to compensate for the rundown of the other 4 pumps. They state that the overall loss of volumetric coolant flow from start of the test to the explosion only decreased 15 %. This seems to be supported by the 'one overcompensation upward' signal (what it exactly means would be my first question - my guess is it warns of too much coolant being ciculated).

4. The Shteynberg Commission stated that until AZ-5 was pushed no intervention by the crew was neccessary.

5. Abagyan has [this](https://i.imgur.com/tUB7kzZ.png) graphic in the report that shows the neutron flux at the time where AZ-5 is pushed and during the subsequent seconds. This graphic is also circulated in a few youtube videos stating the first version from above. But for me it looks like at 0s the lower core is nearly at a shutdown condition. This can't be if it already started to run away. Am I misinterpreting this graphic?

Now I found a simulation study in nuclear engineering and design that substantiates the findings of the above mentioned reports [6]. It stated that the void creation was supressed by the increase in pressure during the test and the loss of volumetric coolant flow was not sufficient to trigger void creation. It showed that the power excursion began because of the design flaw of the control rods alone and the voiding of fuel channels only started as a result of that:

- [Reactivity effects during the accident from 01:23:30 onwards](https://i.imgur.com/TQzjPaf.png)
- [Power Level of the Reactor from 01:23:30 onwards - with no pertubations until 280s, which corresponds to 01:23:40 when the EPS-5 Button was pressed](https://i.imgur.com/SsHuhgE.png)
- [Steam Qulity in the Core. 280s corresponds to 01:23:40 when the EPS-5 Button was pressed](https://i.imgur.com/FbYTR1H.png)
- [Steam Quality to Void Fraction relationship at 70 MPa](https://i.imgur.com/tpjSMQE.png)
- [Accuracy of the Simulation by Mochizuki](https://i.imgur.com/PFD9lHa.png)

Am I missing something here? Is it just that the first version is so rooted in memory that the new version never found its way into public conciousness? I'm at a loss - I'm neither a chemical engineer that understands enough about the Ranike Cycle at this level or Nuclear Engineer to be certain which sources to trust or what to believe anymore.

If you have the knowledge to bring light to this issue I'd be really glad. I'm getting headaces over this for a few weeks now.

I'd like to build my own, but I'm stuck. First the bucket has to be Food Grade, no big deal. But at the bottom of the bucket, I want to create a hole, and through that hole insert a vertical rod. The rotation of this rod will be used to spin the frames. My problem is how to pierce the bottom of the pail and keep the motor on the outside the the honey on the inside.  I've been doing some reading and I need some kind of mechanical seal to solve this problem. I'm just not sure how to do that. Or where to find said mechanical seal.

52,Electricity monitoring for events - Three phase line splitters for current clamps?,1560965965,"Hello,

I'm looking into monitoring realtime electricity usage of events/festivals using current clamp sensors.

I already have an internet-connected monitoring device that connect to three individual current clamp sensors.

As your probably know I can't just put a clamp over the entire cable because the currents in the individual cables (Line &amp; neutral) would cancel out. An AC [line/phase splitter](https://www.reinhardweiss.de/german/splitter-mls01.htm) solves this problem; it allows current clamp acces to the individual lines.

Now my question: do these line splitters also exist for three phase cables? Larger events use 400V three phase power over here.

Are there any other approaches to monitoring the electricity usage realtime? End goal is to have a dashboard that shows realtime electricity consumption. The dashboard is meant to give visitors insight in the energy consumption of the festival. With the objective of promoting rational energy usage &amp; showcasing the sustainability efforts of the organizer.

83,"About 3 years experience, how can I move on from Test Engineering?",1560913321,"Context:
BSEE, currently pursuing a masters in Systems Engineering.

I am nearing 3 years of experience working in the defense industry as a Test Engineer. This experience has been split between 2 separate companies with wildly different tasks but relatively same title and level.

In my first job, I did testing and sustainment of a large radar system. This also involved validation of lower level assemblies and gave me an introduction to working with RF. Most of knowledge I gained here was really specific to that system, the company and their process. I was also introduced to some automated testing and developed good testing instinct that really translated well into my next job.

In my current job, I do automated test software development and test equipment design for their particular products. I've worked with NI TestStand, LabWindows, have had some hardware design opportunities (nothing crazy), and I might be a bit too familiar with Keysight equipment. I do a crap load of other stuff too that involving processes, paperwork, working with outside vendors, and so on but I think that reflects more so on my soft skills.

**I don't want to pigeon hole myself into testing related positions right now.** 

However, my fundamentals in both electrical engineering and programming are definitely inconsistent and I'm not sure I'll pass for entry level design roles or software roles that would give me more opportunities to program, firmware included. I am also worried about moving laterally again. The four areas I'm most interested in is RF, Digital Design, firmware, and software work. I do really enjoy defense systems too.

I think what sucks the most is that I'm happy with what and who I am working with but I know I need to push my career forward. If it helps, I currently make about 80K as a level 1 Test Engineer or G8, and that is fairly comfortable for my location.

84,Am I being incredibly naive by wanting to leave my job?,1560911205,"I’m currently doing a co-op at a large defense company. This company hires *a lot* of people from
my school upon graduation assuming they did this co op, so I’m expecting to get an offer at the end of the next year when I graduate. I’m in what is considered the “fastest paced” department in the company, and I work on what many consider to be some of the coolest stuff in the industry. The reason I’m saying this is because I have had full time employees tell me that they’re jealous of my job, and I think that’s such bullshit to hear and extremely disheartening. I don’t like my job that much, and it’s not because I’m not doing actual engineering work. I’m definitely applying what I’m learning and doing “real” engineering work, but the main reason is I’m upset is because it feels like our potential is being wasted trying to simply navigate a global corporation.

Every week I’m having meetings with people across the US and in different countries, and the time difference means we have such a small window to actually interact. Additionally, getting a bunch of people from multiple different sites / companies on for a meeting takes a lot of planning, reducing our weekly progress. Im constantly waiting for them to get their work to me or at least give me updates, but that can’t happen because it’s so hard to get a meeting with everyone. I’ve been working on this project for months, and I feel like it could’ve all been done in a week if I could have everyone in the same spot devoted to no other responsibilities but this. My first internship was at a very small company and I LOVED it. Prototypes were flying off the printer left and right and it felt like I was spending all my time doing actual engineering work, not figuring out the logistics of getting work done. 

At this point I just want to work for this company so they can pay for my masters, and then I either want to found a startup or join one. Huge corporations seem great for when I’m burned out and no longer care about doing fast-paced engineering work, but right now it seems like I’m going to be pissed off going to work every day and feeling like I could do so much more in a different environment.

85,"Quality engineers, are you stressed out?",1560910634,I'm a quality engineer at a large auto manufacturer.

86,"Achieved my childhood dream of working in aerospace, and I’m not nearly as enthused on the other side...",1560909816,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve told pretty much everyone that I wanted to work in aviation/aerospace. Last summer I got my first experience in the field through an internship, and even got to take some flying lessons on the side, which was an unforgettable experience. I still hope to obtain my PPL one day. 

In December I graduated with a BSEE focusing in electromagnetics, and in February started working at a different aerospace company as an electromagnetic compatibility engineer. On paper, it’s everything my “dream” job ought to be. Four months in, while I don’t hate it, I’m already realizing I don’t exactly want to be in this industry, nor work in the same role, my entire career.

To be clear, I have no doubt I’m getting good experience, and indeed, I’m using quite a bit of knowledge from my EM and RF clases. I've already gained a ton of practical knowledge of EMC in aerospace just in a few months. My coworkers are nice and very knowledgeable, there’s some business travel associated with my job, and so far I’d like to think I’ve done a decent job of learning the ropes of what is generally considered a pretty niche field - even if I don't want to stay in it for too long.

But as I was warned about plenty of times as a student, the industry is very bureaucratic, with a seemingly endless list of standards and other technical documentation to follow for everything. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate why all of it’s necessary for safety, and absolutely respect the work of those engineers who spend their entire careers in EMC. Regardless, at the end of the day, even if I’m working around some amazing aircraft, the role doesn’t leave me feeling extremely satisfied or motivated purely out of passion. The office environment was also a somewhat jarring transition, and I'm still ambivalent as to how I feel about the routine of working 9-5. I miss the flexibility of university and having friends in such close proximity, but the freedom outside of work to pursue other non-engineering interests cannot be understated.

Anyways, my exit plan is to pursue my masters abroad in the latter half of next year, which I went into some detail [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/b0h73v/is_wanderlust_a_good_enough_reason_to_pursue_a/). I tell myself that everything I’m doing now - saving money, gaining relevant experience, learning my target languages, etc. - is a relatively short-term sacrifice in order to achieve that goal. In the meantime, I'm trying my best to keep other hobbies alive, and maintain a somewhat active social life.

So, r/AskEngineers, what advice would you give someone in my situation? If y’all have similar personal experiences, especially with aerospace, I would be happy to hear them. Did you change to a different role in the same industry, or change industries altogether? Were you ever worried about being pigeonholed?

I'm an experimental physicist tasked with building/designing a part that is similar to a hinge for a large door: 

There is a large rectangular structure, joined to a vertical support with two hinges. 

I'm trying to figure out how thick the two hinges need to be for a ""door"" of a given weight. Specifically, the pin which joins the two pieces of the hinge.

I've been thinking a lot about how companies in the US treat their workers, and it's pretty disappointing honestly. I am scared of getting stuck in a position where anything over 40 hours a week counts towards nothing. We're all told in college ""Find a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life!"" Frankly that's a load of bullshit. Sure you can *enjoy* work, but 40 hours a week is pretty ridiculous to begin with, and there are more important things to life than chugging away at whatever Excel document or CAD drawing you're working on. In a system driven by profit we are still undervalued, which means we are overworked, and I don't like the sound of that.
