1,Engine question regarding E85 fuel.,1460654818,"I am researching converting my car (2006 Saab 9-5) to use E85 fuel as it is available near me. Many people have thousand of miles on their converted cars using only an ecu tune. I would consider upgrading the fuel pump as well. Saab produced a biopower version of my same car which featured a better fuel pump, fuel lines, and apparently STRONGER INTAKE VALVES AND VALVE SEATS.

My question is, ""do you think that the factory E85 cars are significantly more reliable on ethanol than the DIY ones?"" I know many cars (EVO, SRT4) that have been converted to E85 and I've never heard of a valve failure from using ethanol.

My company business was about being a reseller for engineering software ( Caesar II, PV Elite). With economy condition was not good and oil prices too low in history, my company must explore a project to sustain their financial. My job there was a technical support engineer which to help customer who encounter the problem of the software. I also need to present to customer about pre-sales/technical part which for me it was boring part in my life. Now I involved the project which conversion P&amp;ID drawing from Autocad into Smartplant P&amp;ID. Although it was a little bit engineering but right now I am feeling good at last I am learning engineering.

Right now, I was thinking about my future. Everyday I thought about quitting the job, but if I quit, how I am gonna secure another job as economy condition still getting worse. What are other alternative that I need to do. I really need any opinions from other engineers like you guys.

13,Heat Exchanger Tube Leak,1460620726,"Hi /r/!

Please find the attached (http://imgur.com/WrE2Q6u) for my simple drawing of my shell and tube heat exchanger. (Relevant information is shown in the attachment).

Right,

Recently our exchanger (HX) tubes are leaking, and we have recently purchased some tubes for retubing of the HX; the fabrication work would take some 4-6 months and not all of the tubes will be retubed. 

The tubes which would be retubed shall consists of tubes that has more than 30% wall loss.

In order to preserve the other tubes which has negligible wall loss, we have drained all the waters inside the shell and tubes and isolated it from the system. 

As all of the valves are butterfly and pipe inlets and outlets can't be spaded, there's a probability that oxygen and a little bit of water could seep through.

We decided that to preserve the tubes, we should do dry storage in which dry instrument air shall be purged into the tubes, but the problem is that our instrument air header is usually at 6-8 bars.

If we decided that we purge the tubes with instrument air at 6-8 bars, could the tubes inside the HX withstand it? (We can't do continuous instrument air purging).

The HX does not have a pressure gauge installed and there's no possibility of installing it. (The HX was made in 1981 btw).

18,Is this an ethical issue in the engineering sense?,1460594142,"This is a problem I'm dealing with, but I want to get your opinions on whether this has any ethical problems from the ""engineering ethics"" stance.

Throwaway account. Guess why.

Me: Recently out of school, but not a professional.

I work for a company that is unionized. I am unionized.

I work with a bunch of other people my age in the same career stage.

The rules: Jobs are evaluated based on the skills required and the work performed. This is based on union rules.

My colleagues and I are all doing work typical of junior engineers.

The problem: We're all being grossly underpaid. On paper, we're all doing completely menial tasks. This is to skirt the union rules and pay us as little as possible. 
This isn't just me thinking we're underpaid. This is complete disregard for the rules established by HR and the union.

We're all on short contracts that get extended a few months at a time. We're all early in our careers, so we're vulnerable. It's risky to raise a stink with the union over this because there's a very high likelihood we would not be extended, and we'd lose any kind of reference for future job hunting.

It is my view that our boss is exploiting our vulnerability. We're young and early in our careers. We have limited professional references. We're in the stage where we have to suck it up and earn our place.

Our supervisor, the one responsible for all these shenanigans, is a Professional Engineer.

* Does working with a sub-contractor/specialty construction hurt any chances if there are any careers like so?

48,How do I get a job after a year of being out of college?,1460518075,"I graduated May 2015 with a Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering with an Emphasis on Structures.  My overall GPA was a mediocre 3.05, but my engineering GPA was about 3.5 with the majority of my junior and senior year classes having a grade of A- or above.  However, my overall GPA was below 3.0 before I graduated, and I lived in the middle of nowhere, so I was never able to get any structural internships during college.  The only real experience I have is a summer surveying job and a semester of volunteer work I did for an instructor at my university.  


I've tried applying for every entry level structural engineering job I could find in a specific west coast city, and I've gotten several interviews (all from small firms on craigslist, and with several of them complementing my resume/communication skills), but it feels as though it's impossible to break into this industry with a bachelors degree, no experience, and the need to relocate several hours across state at a minimum (since I currently live in the middle of nowhere).
 

1. Will I have a better chance of landing a job if I use a recruitment agency?  I have two ""working"" for me right now, but I haven't heard anything from them in ages.  

2.  Should I lie to recruiters and companies about what I have been doing this past year?  I doubt anybody would consider somebody that has been unemployed for a year, so I was thinking about just telling them that I've been volunteering my time to some project that they can't fact check me on (which I hate doing, but I have to get a job some way or another).

3.  Is it remotely possible to get an entry level structural engineering job (or any job, really) in a state I don't currently live in?  I've tried applying to large cities all over the US, but nobody has responded outside of my state.  

4.  Is it viable to move to a new city and do contract/limited period work, or is that too risky?

5. Are there any non-structural engineering jobs I can work in temporarily that will provide me the experience I need to eventually get a real structural engineering job?  I thought about AutoCAD drafting, but it looks like I need certifications or years of experience for that.

1) It needs to be thick so they can apply it underneath the barrel without it dripping too much.

2) It needs to be relatively quick.  I suggested Avesta Red but that even will take about an hour. The ideal time they want is about 15min maximum to etch 0.3thou, so 0.1thou per five minutes or so.

We are two dutch high school seniors working on an 80 hour school project. We are making a self driving arduino based car (20 x 40 cm). We want the car to be able to drive to a beacon ~50 meter away. We want to put 3 or 4 sensors on our car. Using these sensors we want to calculate the angle to the beacon, so the car knows in which direction it has to drive.
We have researched which sensors and beacon to use and came up with different possibilities, each with its own difficulty:
Directional antennas and a radio beacon. We will need to test in which setup these antennas need to be placed. The problem with using antennas is that these are pretty big and bulky, and we are not sure if our car can handle that. Especially since it also needs two receivers. Sound sensors. The main problem with this one is that the sound sensors we found for the arduino are fit for close range but not for 50 meters. And we are doubting if using amplifiers fixes this problem. A flickering light source (1s on, 1s off) and photoresistors. Using the ΔΩ from the photoresistors we can calculate pretty well from which angle the light origins. We felt like this one was a bit too easy and that we could do more.
We also came up with something totally different: using a camera and and high contrast colours. We wanted to let the car stop when it encountered a red contrast and continues driving when it encounters a green contrast (like traffic lights). Because this is something totally different we decided the car approaches the contrast straight on. When we discussed this option with our teacher he said that using camera input is heavy on computers, so we weren’t sure if an arduino could handle it. We are also not sure if it’s realistic for us to use camera input, because it is very difficult.
It’s hard for us to estimate which of these possibilities are realistic and which arduino we should use.

75,Otto cycle diesel engine?,1460428866,"This is not a ""what would happen"" or a ""product idea."" 

Could you run a gasoline-powered engine on diesel? Its effectiveness is irrelevant, this is just to satisfy my curiosity.

Back story:

My late grandfather was a well known bullshitter. The type that would spin yarns from his youth for hours on end. If there was a bullshit Olympics, he would be on the podium. Even as a young boy I knew to take everything with a grain of salt. Anyway, the story goes that as a teenager him and his friends had [""doodlebugs""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodlebug_tractor). During this time gasoline was expensive and at times hard to acquire, at least compared to diesel. 

They reportedly had a second ""tank"" the held a small amount of gasoline used for starting the engine and getting everything up to temperature. Once warm, he would flip some valves and run the engine on diesel. I would completely write this story off except for one detail that makes it plausible to me: the diesel fuel line was soft copper and a few feet of this copper was wrapped around the exhaust pipe to preheat the diesel before feeding it to the carb sitting on a warm engine.

The last part sticks in my head. I've seen pictures of oil spill fires and I've personally set fire to motor oil using a blowtorch (I grew up in the middle of nowhere and burning things in my driveway was a bit of a hobby). So, I know you can combust less volatile fuels.

Whenever I search for preheating diesel fuel I just come up with fuel preheaters and people trying to increase their fuel economy by 0.005% in diesel cars. If I search burning diesel in a gas engine, I just get people saying it's bad (which is why I'm not posting this on /r/cars or /r/autos).

The closest thing I've found is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_charge_compression_ignition But I'm talking about running a 1920-1940 gasoline engine on deisel which I'm has a low compression ratio (4.5:1 for a Ford Model T, just as an example) which makes this fuel preheating idea even less feasible.

83,Some Career advice/help,1460406484,"A little background, I graduated with my BSCE back a couple months ago. I never had any internships during college due to being unlucky or having to deal with family issues during the summer(taking care of sick father, etc.). Despite everything, I know either wanted to do structural engineering or design of some sort or project managemetn

During school I always enjoyed learning about the structural portion of CE which where I took my most places.  During my stay, I didn't do the best in my structural portions just little mistakes during tests ruined my grades and my school never really taught how to use programs for drafting. In other words, my AutoCad experience is below average and Revit knowledge is pretty average. Even though I really enjoyed learning about this subject and performing some of the calculations, me doing poorly in classes and not having much experience with design programs made me not that confident in doing Structural Engineering or Design proficiently as a career. 

I always thought Construction Management was interesting since I thought it was more hand-on with projects and what not. My school doesn't really have a construction management program (the minor program is very meh) and the one CM class is very basic like what is a bid or submittal (one that you can just read from a book, etc.) Also we never had a plan reading class and I can barely make my way around them. 

Anyways, I luckily landed a job within CM with a subcontracting company. However, I'm just starting with job (3 weeks in) and it's not (so far) what I expected. Nothing I really learned in school has applied much at all especially since It's really been is budgeting, phasing out projects, submitting time cards, job cost analysis, production rates, etc. I need to learn a lot and a lot of it is confusing and a lot of time not even sure what I'm doing. I do, however, really like going out to job sites and seeing all the progress and construction that's going on. The pay is okay (60k gross), people at the company are seem caring, nice and helpful (at least my senior PE I work at), and benefits are decent but the area in which this company is located is very expensive to live in and get by (i.e rent for a 1bd 1ba averages 1400-1800). I know too with CM that it can be very work heavy with long hours (which can depend) but can have a lot of career growth and opportunity. As of right now, I don't know if I see myself doing this long term. 

I don't know what to do right now. I can't really go back to grad school (which I know a lot of companies for Structural Engineers) since I totally bombed my first 2 years and ended with just under a 2.8 GPA. I'm really unsure with my design ability and calculations. And I'm unsure (so far) about construction management since it hasn't been all that exciting. Is it best to stick with the job, see if it becomes better and work my way up? Or maybe go into design/structural engineering work?  And somehow gain more design experience. I'm not sure how my CM experience even helps out with any design experience though. 

Some just added notes, I still need to take my FE exam (and I can become a PE at the CM company I work at). Also the slight experience would be from a design class where we used Revit a little bit and a little bit through my school's Steel Bridge team.  Any advice on what to do?

TL;DR: Not liking CM job so much since I thought it was something more. Difficult to go back to grad school with so-so GPA. Not very experienced with design/drafting programs. ",AskEngineers,JackGoff,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4eclw7/some_career_advicehelp/

86,Transitioning from Biology to Mechanical Engineering,1460396679,"Hi engineers. I hope this is the correct place to post this

I'm graduating this May with a B.S. in Biology and received a job offer as a lab tech. It's pretty much what I did during my internship and I'll be making decent salary but I realize I don't want to stay in this field.

I want to be a mechanical engineer. I enjoyed taking biology classes, but I don't know why I didn't decide on engineering since I feel I am more inclined towards it. Every since I was a kid, I always wanted to become an inventor. I finished multi-variable calculus in highschool and was in varsity math. I took java &amp; c++ computer science courses and and enjoy problem solving. I spent a lot of my childhood making bows and arrows. I spent my middle/high school designing/creating games using a game maker program. I know many will say i should do programming, but I just like the engineering field a lot. Plus, my dream is to one day patent my own invention.

So here's my plan:
I am going to take my GRE and apply to Boston University's late entry accelerated program (LEAP) for the Spring of 2017. I need to take a calculus math course and get at least a B on it, so I'll do it this summer at a local college. If I get rejected this application, I will take higher level math courses (differential equations, statics, dynamics) to prove I can handle the workload and apply again for Fall 2017.

My questions: 
1) Is this a sound plan?
2) If I keep taking prerequisites, will I be able apply directly to other engineering graduate schools?
3) Is there another way to get into the engineering field?
4) Should I still be working in a lab when I'm trying to transition into engineering?
5) Are there some kind of unpaid internships or shadowing I can do to get any engineering experience at all?

I have a bachelors in geophysics and am currently deciding between attending a school for a masters in geoscience/geophysics and attending a school for a masters in geotechnical engineering.

What are the potential industry career paths for a masters in geoscience/geophysics? Oil and gas used to be a no brainer but the current job market in oil and the general cyclic boom and bust turns me off from oil and its unpredictable job security.

If you've heard of St Jeans cobapress I guess maybe this is where my questions arise from. Since they cast and then forge the part(so it is possible to forge complicate shapes), it should be stronger than a cast? But actually they use a casting material that is usually rated weaker than something like 6061, it can't gain that much strength through forging, so what is the point of the forging step?

(Headphones bitperfect to the harman curve at least).  I've looked around and most seem to have a problem with the drivers having resonances and other issues mainly to do with inherent problems with the driver design.

Electrostatics seem to have the best, but still are limited.  I have no idea how well piezoelectric speakers work except for there being some headphones that people say are really good from japan but cost a fortune. I just know noone really uses the tech besides this guy and buzzers. Dynamic drivers and planar drivers are both heavy and don't track transients well.

Would removing the driver completely and working with a controlled electrostatic fluid acceleration setup be a viable fix for these issues?  Because they are very high voltage the biggest problems I could assume are them being next to your head or being very ugly for headphones and nonlinearity of having such huge step up transformers required for usage.  Electrostatic speaker and headphones need decent sized ones, but not nearly as high of a voltage as a EFA would.

Are there any studies showing the potential of something like this?

I am an electronics and computer engineering student from the UK and am about to start applying for a year long placment as part of my course.

In the application, we have to include our recent module results. The problem is that for personal reasons that I won't go into here, I suck at exams...like really bad. However,  my coursework is of a really high standard (if i do say so myself) which meant that I passed the modules overall (but barley).

I'm looking for advice on how I can advertise myself in a way that focuses on my strengths (my coursework) and doesn't bring too much attention to bad exam results.

52,Can You Be an Engineer if You Don't Like Pure Math?,1460087501,"I'm a sophomore in high school interested in environmental engineering.

First of all, I'd like to clarify that I'm not referring solely to proofs and theorems that mathematicians do. I don't really know what to call rote computational math, though. I'm currently in Algebra II, and I'm doing terrible. It bores me out of my skull. Don't get me wrong, the teacher is smart and tries to make it interesting, but I've just stopped caring. Now I have an F for the quarter (started a week ago) and a C for the year.

I realize that algebra is really important, and this is stuff I'm familiar with from Algebra I and my own fooling around with numbers. I feel like the reason I don't care is because evem though I'm aware of the importance of algebra in engineering and the like, it just isn't directly applied to anything ""useful"". I'm given an equation and told to find x, or y, or a, or q, or whatever. It's boring and pointless to me. Even with word problems, it's simply trying to find the vertex of the parabola when throwing a ball or something totally useless, that I would NEVER have to try and figure out. On the other hand, I have little problem with math in Biology and Chemistry, although sometimes I do something stupid and switch a variable around or two. But I don't get bored when doing a lab that's asking me whether or not the water is hard based on the amount of precipitate you have. I don't mind calculating the molarity of a solution and/or the pH because it's a direct, tangible result; I'm finding out information of value, not some abstract number.

That being said, I realize that Chemistry I Honors has VERY basic algebra that's covered in Algebra I (despite Algebra II being a co-requisite, not sure why), and the level of math is probably a lot higher in AP, so it may become something I hate. However, I really do think that my problem is not with math itself, but the lack of real world application.

64,"Hardware focused electrical/computer engineers, what software language/concepts have you found most useful to learn?(x-post from /r/FPGA)",1460050139,"I hated software coding in college (Java, C++). So much that I switched my major from Computer Engineering to Electrical Engineering to get out of some software classes. I've always been more interested in the hardware aspects, enjoying HDL languages and even assembly of some micro controllers. I like the sheer control, lack of abstraction, and knowing exactly what's going on in terms of bits. Perl comes and goes depending on how much text manipulation need to do. Hence, I've become an ASIC/FPGA designer.

Whenever I've needed to talk to software folks in my career, an understanding is usually met after some time. Now I feel like it'd serve me well to start coding some low level SW to get a better understanding of how SW developers perceive and use the hardware in which I develop. I don't think I'll ever be a full fledged SW guy, but it would be useful, I'm now seeing, to understand some SW basics.  Staring at code I don't know eventually till it makes sense and googling, or placing selective ""print"" statements to understand what's going on is a common way of what little I've debugged some non-HDL code.

There are endless debates and merits on whether one should learn C, C++, or Python first as a hardware person.

84,What type of microcontroller/board should I use to measure speed?,1459973530,"Hello Reddit community!

I am a student at Boston University in the Questrom school of Business and currently working on a new product design and business plan, and we need advice on what microcontroller/board to use in our product. We originally thought we would have access to an engineer for a few weeks to help design the specifications of the product but unfortunately were only given half an hour to have questions asked (mostly would our product work). We unfortunately did not have time to get a specific component and right now we're looking into sourcing the component. We were told we would most likely need some sort of Arduino board but were not given a specific type to buy.,

The Details I can give you about the project:
-we are measuring the speed of a small moving object using 4 IR sensors that will essentially (or from what I understand from the engineer) triangulate the position of the object.
-That speed calculation will then be output onto a small three-digit digital display that will be pretty much on top of the board.

Specifications:
-Must be no bigger than 2inx2in (50mmx50mm)
-programmable by machine (i.e. we'll be mass producing the product and the board needs to be programmed before insertion into the product).
-power 3-5v (i believe that should work)

We're also looking to go as cheap as we can go while getting enough functionality. We're not looking for a several hundred dollar test board.

From what I've been told, I'm assuming we need the full board in order to work but I want to ask if we can work with less?
Something I've found that I think might meet requirements is

According to the wikipedia article on [Electronic Stability Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_stability_control), ESC helps to counter oversteer by applying braking force to the outside front wheel.

I have always been a challenge seeker and highly ambitious person. I have never been some one to quit because it was 'hard'. But I am really starting to believe I bit off more than I can chew.

I find my self making careless mistakes in my course work more often than I am used to. The frequency of them has only been increasing and it starts to reflect into my research and in my personal life.

I feel often like I can't intellectually keep up with my classmates. It feels to me often that much of the class will grasp a concept before I do, sometimes even the undergrads will.. and despite how hard I work, I still feel behind the intellectual curve, even though my grades would show I sit somewhere around 1/2 a standard deviation ahead of the curve
My point is, sometimes I wonder if I should even be in grad school. 

I feel like a joke when I start assessing my own mental equity, especially when it is so 'easily calculated' and your professors are doing it right in front of you. When I am wore this thin, my lack in confidence in school starts percolating into my personal life, where even small decisions seem to mock me and start making me challenge my self worth... Even worse, I have been beginning to feed these thoughts. Only because I am starting to believe I am 'faking it to make it'. and that takes a toll.

It makes it harder for me to face each day excited and yearning to learn-- like when I started my program. I am aware I have a year left, but I never wanted to go to grad school out of pragmatism, I wanted to go for an education, and to do meaningful work, with passion. I feel like that has been taken from me, or I have surrendered it, and now I feel I am moving through my degree to finish. which defeats the purpose of why I began...
I feel a little lost and my map is growing darker, and I clearly can't express my concern to my lab mates or my advisor...

9,"I'm an aspiring aerospace engineer, and I'm dyslexic. Any tips or advice?",1459883108,"Hello reddit. Im 24 years old have been diagnosed as dyslexic about six years ago (I think it was ""mild dyslexia""). Recently I decided to become an engineer after graduating uni in my previous degree (completely opposite from engineering). Now, I'm noticing things I didn't before, like how I have to use different colors and highlighters to understand maths. Ex: to  understand difference of two things I'm comparing, brackets must be in one color, letters in another, roots in another, numbers in another etc). I see the other students understand concepts straight away, whilst I see struggle to ""read"" what's on the board. Any tips, learning methods and advice would be really appreciated :)

PS: I write with both hands at the same time, and often ""mirror"" my writing without noticing,especially under stress like exams, tests etc. 

I can ""see"" abstract ideas and think very quickly and creatively, but trying to understand what is asked, is what slows me down I think. I constantly study, sometimes to he point of burn out to try to catch up with the rest of class. I saw it was useless, so now I try to get a head start by starting assignments, studying subjects to be taught before hand to get a chance to take my time in understanding it mathematically (because the brackets, etc)

19,When you do put your foot down if you're sure a design will fail?,1459833803,"I work with a multidisciplinary team at school with a lot of other engineers. I'm the one of two people (on a team of ~60) with hardware/software background so people usually come to me if they need electronics help. Today I threatened to leave the project if specific designs were implemented and I'm not sure if I made the right decision.

About a year ago the new lead of the subsystem I work on began making a lot of very poor electronics design decisions. I strongly advised against it and tried to help with redesigns but they weren't interested. Things got tense and I ended up leaving the project and their design, as well as the next three iterations of it, ended up over-budget and failing.

I just proposed an entirely different design for next years team to the new leadership and they liked it. I already have a lot of the system-level design finished and the specifics of the electronics subsystems is nearly done as well. The lead of my subsystem, who is different from the previous lead I talked about above, immediately wanted to implement additional features that would make things wildly more complicated. The features they wanted were similar to the features that the previous guy tried to implement, that caused them to fail and me to walk.

**TLDR**

I have two options at this point. Either let him add his features and try to insure the system-level design is modular enough so a failure will not affect my systems, or put my foot down and have a my-way-or-the-highway approach, which would probably cause one of us to end up leaving.",AskEngineers,kri9,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4df2nq/when_you_do_put_your_foot_down_if_youre_sure_a/

Obviously we could perform a level 3 fitness for service, but I'd like to try for a lower level of analysis (save some $$). The following options are what I have come up with.

B31.3 - Gives out of roundness tolerance of 1%, we are definitely beyond that.

API 579 part 11 Dents -  Limited to components over 6"" OD.

B31.8 Gas Pipelines - Gives pretty clear direction on how to evaluate a dent. But this is piping... not a pipeline. I've never had to deal with going across codes before. My initial impression would that it's frowned upon. But it seems to be the most applicable.

API 579 Part 8 Shell Distortion - This is what the contractor's first thought was, and is the only thing similar mentioned in API 570. A level 2 analysis seems to be a good fit. I just am struggling with calling this dent ""out of roundness"".

I honestly am somewhat rusty in the field after having been unemployed for some time, but am hoping someone might be able to help me level-set on what I think could be a simple engineering question.

One of my new work projects pertains to a box problem (think of a hallow box that is cut in equal half horizontally). The box has some relative thickness that is approximately uniform throughout. I'm being asked to determine what the maximum force I can apply to the outside surface of the box before the box fails.

While I am able to use FEA to help solve this problem, I'm trying to wrap my head around what the ultimate objective is for this project. I understand that the part failure will be determined by the structural strength of the material. If I apply, say, a distributed force along the top surface of this hallow box, what's the best approach I should take in solving the maximum load requirement? I'd like to think that I can solve this problem by looking up the ultimate compressive stress allowable for this material, and then work my way backwards to determine the maximum compressive load. But again, I'm still brushing away the cobwebs from my brain in order to solve the problem. Any help and guidance would be most appreciated.

The sensor works fine, but the metal strips on the connecting arm itself that contact with the ball joint are quite worn, and I feel it's probably a good idea to clean/lubricate them before I mount it on my vehicle. They hold tight and I'm not worried about the arm coming loose, but it would be nice to reduce any further wear.

The joint is mounted underneath the car, connected to the suspension, so dust/water might be a concern. What type of lubricant would work best for these joints? I'm not really an expert. My first impulse was a typical liquid oil/grease, but some people have said particles can get into the liquid and cause more wear. I would think that solid particles like graphite would cause more wear to metals, but I don't know.

However, what I'm confused about is the fact that the two images don't seem to correspond to the same system: They are showing the rod attached to the piston (in the first image) as the equivalent of the pivot in the second image. I don't see how this makes sense though, since the force 'multiplication' doesn't occur at the pivot, but instead at the opposite end of the bar/rod/plank at which the torque is acting about.

So far my career has been very interesting. Starting out I found out I was managing an employee and essentially my job was to assist in the production of tools. Was paperwork, firefighting, and very boring at first. Then our segment transferred into a new segment. I got a new manager, and she was devoted to mentoring me which was fantastic. I grew into my role, found many areas for improvement and actually was able to apply my EE degree to various 'fires'. All was well, then my manager was given a new position, essentailly a demotion. This was shocking, but since the price of oil is so low, it is not a suprise. I got my new boss. He was great, young and very forward thinking. He got a promotion after two weeks of this and we got a new boss. So essentially i'm on my fourth boss after 6 months of work.

I really grew into my role. I was getting recommendations left and right from the functions I was supporting. I was networking pretty well. But alas , the only constant is change.

I was given a new assignment the other day. I am now a technical writer. I have the same pay but since the segment I am in needs to reduce headcount (not pay) they are laying off technical writers and putting engineers there. One of my colleagues was given the same offer, and two PhDs. The situation in the company is dire.

I feel for the technical writers, but at the same time I am still working here and it feels great to see that they are trying to retain me despite the situation.

My employee was devastated as we formed a fantastic friendship and he was working very hard for me. I had learned much about leadership from the soft skills courses we take and I had employed them in my day to day.

It was a great experience and I'm very happy I listened to the redditors that told me to stay. I was chosen to move as my colleague has seniority so he would have an easier tme taking over my responsibilities. I have also been promised its temporary and I will be placed into an electrical engineering role as I desired, which is fantastic.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have worked in sales now for several years.. I'm known for being long winded and will try to keep this short. 

My step mother works in customer service for a company that specializes in high pressure systems for sheet metal forming and densification of material. She said they are hiring for an entry level Field Service Engineer. The job is 90% travel and they are having trouble keeping the positions filled. She is pretty high up in the company and assured me she can get me an interview.

The job responsibility's are as follows:

Installs and commissions new systems within the schedule and budget provided by the project team.  This includes: mechanical, hydraulic, cooling water, inert gas, ultra-high pressure fluid, electrical and control systems.

Administration and reporting of projects

Accurate and timely documentation in identified software solutions.

Customer relations: including remote support of customers and co-workers as well as proactive engagement to assure customer needs are being met.

Travels internationally and domestically for short periods of time (i.e. a few days) to up to 4-6 months.


This is would be dream come true for me, from the travel (I'm a single 28 year old) to the field. There is supposedly a fair amount of training involved with their proprietary systems. I have some experience reading schematics, advance troubleshooting, great mechanical inclination and I'm kind of a 'jack of all trades'. I have work experience as a technician, worked in auto body/industrial powder coating and have plenty of sales and customer service experience.

Here's where my questions come into play... 
Anyone in a similar field what can I expect? What will be expected of me? My step mother said while an engineering degree is preferred it isn't necessary. 

I do know there are a few things I would be working with that I'm not very familiar with: First and foremost high pressure systems, also PLC's. I should be okay with the software and networking side if things. My degree was heavily weighted towards networking and software.

From my understanding of basic machinery, there'd be the motor and gearbox, and a shaft connected to the gearbox (output shaft).

We do primarily design work at our office, all of the manufacturing is done in China through vendors. I get around 50 emails every day from vendors informing me about current project status (Tooling manufacturing progress, CAD progress, etc.) and I want to consolidate all of this in an easy to read format and update as necessary with information from the emails. For example, vendor X sent me an email yesterday saying they were waiting for us to ship them certain samples. I want to create a task for a project with information on this, such as tracking number for the shipment and also a reminder to follow up with the vendor at a certain date.

Currently we just have a spreadsheet with dates and project names, but I would like to know if there are any ways to better organize my projects and keep track of various activity deadlines, note any issues etc. I've heard of Microsoft Project, but I'm not sure if it's suitable for my needs.

I have a bubble moving through a U-shaped glass tube filled with water at about a 30 mL/hr rate. The air bubble is not touching the glass but rather riding on a thin layer of water one each side. The tube is about 3.8” long. The bubble width/tube ID is about .225” and the length of the bubble varies between .225” and .525”. The bubble deforms sometimes after the tube has been sitting mostly empty of water for a few weeks. This is usually fine because I can fix it by scrubbing with Windex, but this doesn't always fix things and I have to scrub the tube with an acidic/abrasive paste to get a non-deforming bubble again. I am looking for a way to keep the bubble from deforming permanently with just Windex cleaning as needed.

I've been reading [this thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/ik1a5/any_tips_on_making_glass_hydrophilic_and_keeping/)

14,"Angling motors at 45 degrees from vertical, chronic failures due to overdrawing of current",1459420015,"I am seeing chronic motor overdrawing of current in some 3-phase induction motors I have been working on. They are mounted at various angles from 35-50 degrees from vertical (some have shaft pointing down, some have shaft pointing up). Motors are two-speed, weight 40 pounds, and are running nearly constantly. Overdraw faults occur when switching speed, as if the shaft is being caught and prevented from rotating. Motors are driving a fan, have deep-groove ball bearings that haven't shown excessive wear when disassembled, and fault out sporadically without much predictability. As problem worsens, excessive noise during normal operation seems to indicate a mechanical issue.


**My main question**: Has anyone else seen motors this size angled like this - not vertical or horizontal? I personally haven't, and figure this is the likely root cause. The real struggle comes figuring out what can be done about it (moving motors not an option).

Thanks!

Edit: I spent all morning working on this, pulling data logs for affected motors.
It occurs when the fan switches from off-&gt;low speed (never high speed, only occurs once in a while). Looking at the amperage draw of a singular fault occurrence that was caught, the motor appears to be locked when it tries to start up, draws 8-9 Amps, trips the TOR, shuts down.

45,Not all explosions are the same?,1459289205,"*Before I begin I have no idea where to post this question but I hope this would be an appropriate subreddit. Also I couldn't think of a better title*

In regards to explosions I understand that there definitely different however what I am unsure if one type of explosion from one source can cause the same amount or similar amount of damage to some specific objects as another type of explosion source. 
The object in question is an AR500 steel plate having a ballistic rating of level III+. Armor piercing bullets can definitely penetrate this plate however could an explosion result in the plate being broken? Here are two scenarios. 
An AR500 plate with the aforementioned rating is lying on the ground and is hit by an airburst 155mm artillery shell like the M982 Excalibur. Would that plate be intact and just flung really, REALLY far away or would it have been destroyed or otherwise penetrated? From my knowledge I know if it was a shaped charge such as that from a HEAT round it would have definitely blasted a hole but what about just a regular explosive round?   

Second scenario.Lets say in an airliner (Boeing 777) there is that ballistic plate in an overhead compartment and the plane explodes in mid air (similar to how TWA 800 went down) Would that plate also be completely destroyed or survive entirely? Thats where I'm stuck as to if different explosions can cause the same damage.

BHS: 2976 ft^2

SWP: 250 psi

Steam Flow: 40,000 lb/hr

What I am curious about is how the boiler guys came up with a flow of 40,000 lbs/hr.  In sizing the relief valve, this is a pretty critical piece of info and I would like to be able to show the calc as to how they got there, as well as implementing some type of SF to its age and condition etc and show the relief valve is sized properly.

I figured that they used the BHS (boiler heating surface: used in calculating boiler steam capacity) but when I plug and chugg this number into the formulas it does not come out right.  

Also,  how does external fires effect the sizing of the relief valve?  I have looked all over the internet and couldn't really find anything.  I came across the Crosby Engineering Handbook for sizing relief valves but I am currently stuck on determining the wetted surface area of the vessel.  I have a drawing of the original boiler but it's so old you cannot tell any of it's dimensions.

55,"Thoughts on using a shoulder bolt as a pivot point for a larger load?

A pop pin will be used to secure it at 0,45,90,135,180deg but I'm now focusing on how to design the pivot.

I came across shoulder bolts and was thinking they could be an easy solution. But my big unknown is if I should really be relying on it to handle the weight. Static load is max 150lbs (probably closer to 100-120lbs realistically), nothing should ever be sitting, resting or putting pressure on top of that. For testing and approvals we want a 4x multiplier on the load.

The stackup right now that I've been looking at is:

| 0.25"" ||[Thrust bearing](http://www.mcmaster.com/#3750k7)|| 0.25""|

This seems to limit me to a [1/2"" diameter shoulder bolt](http://www.mcmaster.com/#93985a502/). Depending on the stainless type, it's around a 40,000PSI yield strength.

77,"How to convert 3D models to STEP, avoiding CAD software? (Or, how to deal with difficult mechanical engineers?)",1459166112,"***CONCLUSION EDIT:***

Alright, guys. I'm sold. I'm going to teach myself SolidWorks so I can put it on my resume and avoid asking the MEs to do their jobs. Thanks for all the encouragement and advice! To the MEs who commented, you are a credit to your field and a refreshing contrast to my coworkers.

****

***TL;DR at bottom.***

**Disclaimer:**

It's a different sort of question, but I have no idea where else to ask and Google is being less than helpful.

****

**Backstory:**

I am a computer engineer specializing in embedded system design at a small design and manufacturing firm. The mechanical engineers use SolidWorks, and the electrical engineer and myself use Altium. By demand of the mechanical engineers, all completed PCB designs need to have 3D models for components and the whole assembly exported as a 3D model they can test fit in SolidWorks for component clearance.

The two mechanical engineers are... difficult, to say the least. Despite it being their idea, asking them to model a component in SolidWorks means they work on *just that* for a week. Asking them to change their process just slightly results in a week of arguing and elevating to the company owner. As such, I'd like to make my own models.

****

**Context:**

I'm no mechanical engineer, but I've been working with Blender for 11 years so making satisfactory 3D models isn't an issue. The issue is getting the models out of Blender and into Altium, which only accepts STEP models, and there's currently no STEP exporter for Blender.

I could learn SolidWorks and make models in that, but that's a pretty steep learning curve, especially since I've messed with 3D CAD programs before (Autodesk Inventor, FreeCAD, and OpenSCAD) and found them pretty counterintuitive compared to traditional mesh-based 3D editors I've used (Blender, Milkshape, 3DS Max, Softimage XSI).

****

**What I've Found:**

In grad school, I taught a lot of my (non-mechanical engineer) students basic Blender usage so they could use the department's 3D printers. I learned to export STL files from Blender, as well as the various caveats and tricks involved. I also know that STL can be imported by most CAD packages, so perhaps I could convert STL to STEP?

85,Going back to school for an engineering degree?,1459125290,"Hey y'all. I have a couple questions about returning to school for an engineering degree that I figured I would toss at the experts here. 

A bit of background first. I graduated from a top-50 school a few years ago with an undergraduate degree in finance. I worked for a short period of time at a consulting firm at which I was a technical analyst and focused on work involving lighting design and evaluation. 

I would like to work in the aerospace industry and to work in spacecraft design or propulsion. I'm still working through my interests and preferences, researching the fields, and talking to any engineers and other highly educated folks who will withstand my barrage of questions. 

I am unsure of the best path in returning to school to work in these fields. With an undergrad degree in an unrelated and seemingly useless field (in relation to engineering), I'm in a somewhat unique position. I think a good public university might be the best choice cost-wise and with the large number of options. I am willing to move most anywhere really. 

Getting down to it, I'm working on a couple paths. 
-Start at a community college to knock out basics and then move to a 4yr school to finish an undergraduate degree?
-Start again at a 4yr school and simply work through an undergraduate degree?
-Knock out basics at a comm coll, knock out more undergraduate courses at a 4yr school, and transition directly into working on an MS?
-Work closely with a grad department at the school of my choice, knock out a large number of undergrad courses while enrolled in an MS program, transition to actual MS work and research, and leave with solely an MS?
-Boston U's LEAP program?
-Other thoughts?

I would like to limit cost and time required of course, and I think that I would like to leave with an MS. I'm working through the potentially more complex question of how my education path will be viewed by potential employers as well, and what the best-looking path might be. Any and all thoughts and suggestions are appreciated! Thanks!

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**

21,How to manufacture 8ft of 32 pitch racks out of plastic?,1458939110,"Hi Engineers, 


I have a startup and manufacture my product in house in small batches. A major manufacturing pain point for me is making a rack for my device. 
Here is a [picture](http://img.directindustry.com/images_di/photo-g/20096-2786531.jpg). I need 8ft of rack for each of my product. I currently 3D print these but it is very painful process. The rack material should be plastic. 

Can anyone suggested a better alternative? Buying online is too expensive and most of the racks are very ugly. I was thinking of using a CNC and cutting cutting boards. I was also thinking of buying 8ft metal rack and making a mold to pour plastic into. 

Please guide me in the right direction. 

Thanks,

EDIT:
I searched online for options, but I am not happy with the options avalible. It's either too expensive or takes too long to ship or they are weird geometry.
Here is mine [results](http://imgur.com/7XcI2t4) of the rack using CNC and a cutting board for material.

So I hooked my preamp output to a spectrum analyzer. My output is Xaxis in frequency (0 to 1kHz in steps of 25Hz) and Yaxis in dbV. I'm aware of conversions to V/rootHz. My question is what exactly is Vrms in relation to a spectrum? Do I average my spectrum over my frequencies? How do I get my single average number out of a whole spectrum?

Also to double check: when converting dbV to V/rootHz I should be using the root of the bandwidth? So that would be my sampling step size (25Hz)? I'm usually a mech designer so learning the electronic noise is all new territory. Thank you!


Edit: figured out the Vrms part, I think. It is basically just the mean of the spectrum signal. So if I look at noise on a plot of v/rootHz vs frequency, I can draw a line going in positive x that is the overall average of my v/rootHz, this would represent my noise floor in most cases.

47,Does harvesting energy from a rotating flywheel generates a free energy forever?,1458812527,"Hello /r/AskEngineers!

So my boss is having this side project that I'm supposed to be working on.

The idea is more or less like this:
http://imgur.com/gkYxa1b

The BLDC will be powered by 96V battery, and it will be used to rotate the shaft with the flywheel attached to it.

Then, the generator shaft using a belt will be rotated as well from the flywheel attached shaft which will produce a 220/380V.

My boss thinks this will generate free energy as the flywheel will conserve the energy in the shaft rotation as it will power up the generator.

If the generator powers up, the power from it will be transferred to the BLDC Motor.

In my personal opinion, this will not work because of the laws of thermodynamics, but my boss kept insisting this will work.

Am I in the wrong here? or is it possible? 

If it isn't possible, how do I prove that this contraption is not possible?

If it's possible, how do I calculate the dimensions of the flywheel? What specifications do I need to calculate it? Can anybody help me to guide through or directing me to a guide or a book related to this?

In World War 2, the US Army was looking for an answer to the Japanese tree climbing gear, used by Snipers. And developed their own gear based on Pole Climbers http://i.imgur.com/NZAhA8r.png The big difference being is that the supporting metal brace was placed on the outside of the leg with the curve under boot transitioning into a spur that looks like could have been made in a press. Documentation does state the design was very cheap to produce for this reason. 
  
Similarly,  in the US Civil War, a similar design was also created. http://i.imgur.com/AhTJlnN.png even though more traditional Pole Climber designs existed in the same period: http://i.imgur.com/hI6aW7O.png

At a guess, this meant a huge difference in the material supporting the weight of wearer. The metal brace, versus canvas/leather straps which could be worn down more quickly with repeated use.

I know that 'very fast' is relative, so for reference, my current device can spin the disk at ~6,000 RPM. I'd like to get that as fast as I can without bad things happening.

There's just one real constraint: the speed can't vary too much. Again, for reference, my current device, at 6000 RPM, doesn't vary by more than about 10 RPM, which is about 0.2%.

Edit: sorry, let me add one more constraint: I don't really want any moving parts besides the main axis, I.e., I don't want to have to gear a motor up.

Other things that would be nice, but aren't as necessary, are:

* cheaper is always nicer
* smaller (&lt;ft^3 ) would be cool
* continuously variable speed would be sweet

So far what I've thought of is using a dremel tool, which can reach up to 35,000 RPM. But I'd have to make a jig to mount it, and I'm just guessing intuitively that the speed would vary a lot, because there's no reason for it to be designed not to. Also, it is designed for pretty small bits that are never very far from the rotational axis, so maybe the disk wouldn't work, if the motor is a tiny bit unbalanced.

64,Question on heat conductivity and capacity.,1458746825,"I’ve been trying to wrap my head around how differently stainless/aluminium pans behave when heated over a medium flame for an extended period rather than on a high flame for a short while. My layman’s hypothesis, based on how it feels to cook on, is that while the end temperature of the surface may be the same, the energy stored in the mass of the pan differs, possibly because heating of a high flame allows the top layer to reach the desired temperature before the mass is “saturated”, whereas heating slowly making for a less uneven heating gradient top to bottom. 

But I’m just a cook, and it’s been a while since I had to think in these terms, so I’m hoping you guys can pitch in and help me better understand this.

Background: For as long as I can remember, the title ""Software Engineer"" was unregulated in BC.

I'm given a simple system x1_dot and x2_dot both in terms of x1 and x2. Then, I choose a Lyapunov function V(x) that is clearly positive definite.

However, when I find V_dot(x), I find that it is not *always* &lt;= 0. In the example I'm working with, V_dot(x) &lt; 0 only when x1 &gt; -2*x2.

So this Lyapunov function V(x) clearly doesn't satisfy the requirements for the system to be stable (""in the sense of Lyapunov"", I guess). Given this, can I say anything about the stability of the system overall? Or is the jury out until I find a function that works? It so has it that later I find a V(x) that shows the system to be uniformly asymptotically stable. But before that, does the V(x) that doesn't work tell me anything concrete about the system?

My idea was to use this instructable as a base for the electronic requirements (http://www.instructables.com/id/OpenFuge/).
Could someone help me with selecting a suitable electric motor to power this? I was thinking of a motor that propels model aircrafts? On the wikipedia page for Peeler centrifuges I'm seeing that they typically go up to 2000G, so that should correspond with about 6500 RPM or more for this basket?


I've made a small perforated basket of 4,2 cm in diameter and 6,5 cm high with a shaft length of 11 cm. The total weight of the basket (empty) is 50g and I would expect that it would never be filled with more than 150g of slurry. The shaft is an inverted bolt, so it has threads where it should somehow connect to the motor.


If I assume that the basket is a solid cylinder (I=(1/2)mR2) when 'filled' with slurry then the moment of inertia should be 0,176 m2.g. To estimate the required torque, I guess I need to decide on an angular acceleration? For now I'll decide that I want it to get up to speed (108 RPS) in 1 minute. I guess that requires an acceleration of 1,80 round/s2 or 0,286 rad/s2. That would require a torque of 5,03410-5 Nm and about 0,062 HP? (http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.1760.286+(m%5E2grad%2Fs%5E2)+to+N*m)


Well even assuming all my math is correct (and it's been about 5 years since I've had to do any physics), I still don't really know how to select an electric motor from this. Additionally, do you have a good suggestion on how to connect my basket to the shaft?

Adding in the effects of soft tissue will make this crazy complicated and I don't believe that the improvement in the model will be worthwhile (it's the first study of its type so it'll be more a proof of concept than a proper analysis).

15,I'm in a very precarious ethical position involving a family member and some great new technology that will help the very large multinational corporation I work for. Need help navigating.,1458493956,"I'm trying to gain awareness within my company for a technology a family member is closely related with. Now it appears that I could be facilitating business relationships based upon personal relationships, but it's not clear to me given the nuanced nature of the situation whether this is a breach of ethics or not. I don't want to abandon the initiative as I truly believe it will bear fruit for my employer. Read on.

The family member and I have been talking about some burgeoning technology for a decade now. He was employed with the the company some time ago in a management position when I was brought on as an entry level engineer right out of college. We were in pretty disparate organizations; we never interacted through business needs. A few years ago he was let go as a part of an organizational shuffle and I remained. Now, partly as a result of our more recent talks on further advancements and partly due to my work experience, I see an opportunity for my company to benefit from a technology similar to what he's been involved with since his departure.

He sets me up with one of his contacts: a salesman for a vendor of the tech. I met with this salesman over lunch and am more certain now that this tech is the right fit for my company. Inspired, I spoke with a senior manager in my engineering organization broadly about his views of the tech to understand what he makes of it and what our strategy in this space is. This went very well - he's asked that I speak with some of his reports and schedule followup chats with him. Bear in mind that these chats didn't include talk of implementation (including the vendor the salesman works for).

Here's where things get tricky. My family member has been talking about partnering his ventures with the vendor. Practically, it makes a lot of sense for them to team up as the sum of their efforts and products would be very valuable. However the salesman is now (predictably) asking that I attend local summits and forward the senior manager's contact information to him in an effort to become the vendor of choice should my company move to adopt the tech.

For what it's worth, I won't attend summits or forward a colleague's contact information out to a salesman until 1) my company officially recognizes my initiative on this technology and 2) I see some broader acceptance or even expectation of the technology from those who work more closely in this space. I don't want to come off as pushy or overtly opportunistic if people aren't open to adopting it. Yet the bigger issue at hand is that at some point I'll have to reveal that my aptitude and drive in this space is inspired by and facilitated by personal relationships. **Relationships that may or may not financially benefit from my initiatives with my company**. 

Where's the red line here? How can I proceed with my initiative to integrate this tech I know will be beneficial and that I believe in without compromising my ethical standing as an engineer?",AskEngineers,throwaway389284,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4b8c5p/im_in_a_very_precarious_ethical_position/

I'd like to calculate the capacity of the bottled gas in hours. The gas is delivered from the bottle, through a couple of filters, through a pressure regulator (basically, to control flow), through tubing, into an enclosed (but NOT, by any means sealed) enclosure.

I use the isothermic ideal gas law, P1 * V1 = P2 * V2 and assume N2 is compressible. 

The bottles are 125 cu ft at 2000psi. My desired flow rate (which will be measured with a gauge after the pressure regulator) is 5 cfm.

That doesn't seem right based on hunch, and doesn't really check out with what I've been seeing. We have used this setup without a flowmeter, just using the pressure regulator to ballpark the flow.

55,Is there a good source for general engineering references with regards to building maintenance?,1458297666,"Hi everybody,

Before I start my story, I'd like to apologize in advance if my post isn't worded the right way, I had a hard time formulating what I thought was the best way to convey what I'm asking. A while ago I asked the moderators if it was okay to post it here (little over 9 months ago) so I hope I'm not entirely out of line here.

For a while now I've been working on a game that takes place in a bunker-like environment, and is focused in large part on engineering: facility maintenance, creating/maintaining machines, etc. The only problem? I don't know a lot about any of it. I'm struggling with creating for example lists of items, parts, materials and other resources that are used for the upkeep of machinery (basically going down to nuts, bolts and washers). I'm posting here in the hope someone could point me to reference works I could track down to do research, or perhaps lend a hand here and there. I looked at the Reference Library but the closest thing in there is a book on formulas for stress and strain.

69,How can I calculate the moment of inertia of the spine based on a large deflection?,1458234208,"Hey all,

I'm working on a master's degree in biomedical engineering and my current project is on scoliosis.  I'm analyzing the static response of the curved spine to forces applied.  Unfortunately, I haven't touched statics in 9 years and that only covered relatively simple situations.

My goal is to find the moment of inertia to predict deflections on other patients.  I doubt it'll have any sort of predictive power, but I need to see what happens.

I know the initial curve shape, the final curve shape, and the location and magnitude of forces applied.  Deflections are on the order of 20% of the length.  There are axial, rotational, and transverse forces.  The axial forces (gravity, angled applied forces)  are likely higher than the transverse forces and change with location along the spine.

The spine's moment of inertia changes with location and between patients.

I'll have stupidly high errors in everything I measure and assume, so adding some more errors won't really be the end of the world.

How should I analyze this?

A simply supported Euler-Bernoulli beam is appealing for simplicity, but that uses the assumption of small deflection.  I could also use the large deflection equation, but that assumes no axial loading.

Finite element analysis could also be done which would allow for a variable moment of inertia and then I could use linear regression to generalize it; this once again assumes small deflections.

I don't know any other methods, but I can learn easily enough.

Any ideas?

Edit: I only have measurements of deflection in one plane so I don't think I can get anything useful from non-planar forces.

Edit: I just realized that I don't know if I can determine stiffness from deformation in FEA, I only know how to do it the other way around.  Maybe I could iterate?",AskEngineers,AOEUD,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4au1yv/how_can_i_calculate_the_moment_of_inertia_of_the/

I'm wondering if anyone has or knows where I can find programs for visualizing downwash from a wing?

I have used STAR-CCM+ to look at the streamlines, but I want more programs to validate this information. 
I would develop this code myself, but my professor adviced against this since we are on a tight schedule. Does anyone happen to have one or know of any codes that I could use?

Actually I don't think a 2D Euler-steady model code would be what you use for this, but I can't think of any else that isn't CFD. 

Also are there any other codes that are easily available to aerospace students and that are useful in design or analysis? I have looked at a list of programs on the Virginia tech website and I found a lot of them useful. I had also seen a program in the flying wing video a while back that chose an ideal geometry for given inputs, I thought this code was amazing and I was wondering if there were any like these available for free or if I would have to create my own.

I have created my own take-off program that determines take-off using calculated lift and drag values from XFLR5 or Star-CCM+, so if I can find a take-off model that can verify these results that would be great too.

I had a difficult time deciding where to post this, so I figured I'd give you guys a shot. You're the brains of the operation, after all.

I work for a modestly small private business in the aftermarket automotive industry. Recently, we experienced an issue with our computer system that has put us out a decently-sized sum of money by way of invalidating a large roll labels we have printed with serial numbers. As such, we're looking for alternatives, such as creating the labels in-house.

Our requirements:

* Long-lasting
 * These serial numbers can sometimes be referenced from 15-20, even 25+ years in the past. We don't want these removed either, so the adhesion should be pretty darn solid. As an aside, a clean removal is totally negligible, since they're not supposed to be removed. 
* Durable
 * As with the long-lasting requirement, these are used to serialize fuse panels for aftermarket automotive applications. They adhere to a stainless steel box so they must be relatively resilient. These labels could see chemicals, heat, water, abrasion, corrosion, etc. Granted, these labels are not meant to be exposed to any of these things, but the requirement remains.
* Legible
 * Many of our customers are aged 50+ years or older so being receptive to clean and clear printing is a must.
* Price
 * In order for this to be worthwhile, we need to be able to print these labels quickly, efficiently and at less than $0.15 a label.

Here is a sample photo of what we currently use: http://i.imgur.com/pxfV1bj.jpg

I look forward to your responses and hope someone out there can help us with our dilemma.

For the record, if we need to invest in an initial purchase by way of a printer up to the task (aside from our in-house printers such as a Dell 5100, Dell C2660 and Dell 3100 or our Zebra thermal shipping label printers) that can be accommodated.

95,How do you keep your math and physics sharp after college?,1458126488,"Yesterday I had a technical test for a company I really wanted to work for. The job description was good enough to give me an idea on what to review before the test, but when the time came I didn't feel like I was as sharp as I was six months ago when I took my FE test.

On top of that, on a day to day basis my work has been so slow that for the past month and a half I've been more of a draftsman and overpaid secretary than an engineer because we have no projects that require engineers (with the exception of a need-to-know basis), so at work I've been lacking in any good daily practice as well.

So, I've decided to pursue what I probably should have done in the first place. 

My first question is, how many have transferred from a CC to a big program in this field? I currently live in Austin, and with my previous degree and a solid GPA UT is obviously the goal.

Second question. What's the recommendation on breaking into this career quickly? Like I said, I do live in Austin. It's a very ""IT"" centered city. I see ""analyst"" type jobs that are everywhere. I see bootcamps that offer 12 week programs that break you into some of these positions, like ""Hack Reactor"", what exactly are those guys learning? Those things are like 12-18k, that's crazy.

Basically my goal is to be able to get into the field, get some experience as quickly as possible, not only for the paycheck but for job outlooks as well, while focusing on GPA for transfer.

3,Strange situation with 1998 Corvette for EE's and Electrically-Inclined,1458084639,"Alright, apologize for not phrasing question in the title. I had difficulty trying to find a way to concisely phrase it. Trying to give as much information as possible without too much fluff. I noticed an interesting phenomenon while trying to help a buddy with his 1998 Corvette (let's asssume this was a title-less, non-road-driven car). 

He replaced the main computer (with it's odometer) after it had fried. The replacement computer had 30,000 less miles than were on the original. So he spun the vehicle's speed sensor with an electric drill while it was connected. It melted. He replaced it and came to me for help.

In order to attempt to solve this issue quickly and cheaply, I turned to an Arduino Uno programmable microcontroller powered via an Apple USB wall power supply. I measured voltage and frequency generated at various RPMs of the speed sensor (no oscilloscope, only a Fluke DMM) and attempted to ""see what happens"" for replicating the ~1 to ~8Vpp A/C waveform that the computer was expecting from its sensor. I connected my reference to the ground rail on the arduino, wrote a poor excuse for a sketch, and gave it a whirl (engine off, car on in accessory position). No result. The Corvette continued to display ""0 MPH"". As I disconnected everything to try other solutions, the car came alive and displayed ""54 MPH""... the only wire connected was the ground rail from the Arduino.. I removed the Arduino and had only the ground of the 5V USB transformer connected to the vehicle's computer--still 54MPH!

Was the car's computer most likely receiving the very small output ripple (from the 60Hz input) on the 0V reference of a well-made Apple transformer? I'm an undergraduate EE major and this has completely stumped me. The car was parked 10 feet away from an I-beam support, on smooth laminated floors, via extension cord, in a large metal aircraft hangar lit by some sort of very large Halide lamps 3 stories above it. A colleague suggested that there could have been radio interference/induced signal due to these lights, but it continued to work with the lights turned off.

Can anyone offer suggestions as to why one wire connected to a vehicle's computer (in place of it's speed sensor) without a completed circuit would be received as a readable speed signal to the computer? (Capacitive effects of the car??) Much appreciated.

7,Has the deployment of GPS services and navigation software/services had an appreciable impact on traffic patterns?,1458073125,"This borders on /r/AskHistorians material, but it pushes the 20 years rule.

Basically, I'm curious of whether or not it has concentrated traffic into ideal routes and if it has impacted the considerations of civil infrastructure planning.

I know many people (most, even) will not go someplace without first googling the route and following it as they drive. This becomes the way they know to get somewhere. Before MapQuest and whatever services existed before it, they only had maps to go off of, and so they'd figure out how to get there themselves.

I'm also curious (and this may be outside the bounds of this sub) if the services have had any marked effect on the psychology of drivers and to what degree that 'know where they are.'

13,"As an EE undergrad, how worried should I be about the BLS's ""0% growth"" projection for electrical engineering jobs?",1458052663,"Source: [BLS](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm)

For comparison, the BLS projects [3% growth for computer engineers](www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/computer-hardware-engineers.htm) and [17% growth for software developers](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm).

My intention is to add a CS minor to my EE bachelor's, but I'm wondering if there's any danger in going ahead with EE given this statistic, rather than switching to computer engineering or CS assuming that I am also interested in those.

What does this projection mean in practice? Does it suggest more that the remaining EE jobs will be more competitive, such that I should still be well-employable if I go to a top tier school and have a good GPA/resume? Or is it suggesting that there are fewer jobs with the strict title of ""electrical engineer"", such that more and more EEs are finding (even choosing) employment as software developers, etc.? Or in a worst-case scenario, does it imply that there are going to be more qualified EEs than there are jobs, and that their skills are not needed as much as they used to be?

16,Are there options on the market for electric motors with switchable power but constant speed?,1458033255,"The company I am working for is constructing a gas compressor. The gas is being compressed from 2 bars to 200 bars. 

Most of the time the compressor works in a mode, which does not require high power output. However, once a certain pressure is reached, the compressor requires significantly more ""juice"". The current solution is two interconnected motors 1 kw and 2 kw accordingly. 90% of the time only the first one is working. After that, the second one kicks in to provide a total of 3 kw for the pump to  finish the working cycle.
 
The system works fine, but we are looking for a way to minimize occupied space and use one motor instead of two if it's possible. Due to that, my superior asked me to find a motor with switchable power output. He proposed that the solution would be something like a motor with double winding, one for the the low-power mode and second to add more power to finalize compression. 

However, the more I look into electric motor (not a EE myself), the less possible this option seems to be from the construction standpoint. Nevertheless, I would appreciate if you could prove my assumptions wrong or offer a different solution. 

**UPD:** Thank you everyone for your suggestions! I was tasked to find the ready solution. Obviously there is none, so it's either customizing the available 3 kw motors or using the ""ugly"" option of two connected motors.

40,"Why is numerical integration not working well on logarithm function with bounds [-1,1]",1457955274,"So I guess this is an engineering problem since I am a graduated engineer doing some research work...

When I try to integrate function x*(log(x)-1) from -1 to 1, analytically I get 0.0000 - 1.5708i

When I try to integrate it numerically, using 10 points gaussian quadrature I get 0.0000 - 1.5826i. For 4 gaussian points, the numerical integration gives me 0.0000 - 1.6376i as is expected for less number of gaussian points.

The thing that keeps puzzling me is when I split the integration into negative region and positive region and sum them up later, I will be able to get a perfect result. For example, for bounds[-1,0] with 10 gaussian points, the numerical integration gives 0.7500 - 1.5708i. Similarly for bounds [0,1], it gives -0.75. Adding the split parts up will give me the correct result of 0.0000 - 1.5708i.

So again, why is splitting the numerical integration for function consisting of logarithm on negative and positive axis required for better accuracy?

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**

### Timeframe

This post will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted and stickied, and old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Once all the disciplines have been covered, a final thread will be posted with links to all of them to collect any more responses until archived. The current list of disciplines:

44,How does licensing an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) work exactly?,1457905183,"I've been reading up on ARM's business model.  At a high level, they don't create any chips, but sell IPs for any other chip company to include and build a design with, and collect licensing and royalty fees that can increase as the number of end chips being made.

Take for example an an ARM Cortex-M processor or Mali graphics IPs.  A chip company (examples are Apple, Qualcomm, even Intel for the Mali case) can get the ""code"" for the IP, and then physically implement it themselves.

For other companies, ARM can also sell their IP already ""hardened"" towards a specific process technology and foundry (TSMC, Global Semi).  Chip company can just take this physically hardened IP, and plop into their chip (vastly oversimplifying here).

What I don't understand though is the ISA licensing.  How does this work?  For something like ARMv7 and ARMv8 ISA, what is ""given"" to a chip company.  Examples are like what Apple did to build ""Swift"" processor.  It is it's own implementation of the ISA.  Why isn't something like an ISA easy to just copy without ARM's permission?  Is it because you could get royally sued if you used the ISA, made a chip from it, sold it, and then ARM found out later?

46,Mechanical BS with an Embedded MS?,1457901107,"Hi. I have tried other reddit subpages but it seems like question was not particularly relevant there, so I thought I would try here too. Maybe this time with more luck. Just to clarify, Im not looking for advice on major selection as im already on the course and dedicated to complete it.

Im a graduate mechanical engineer currently doing a masters in embedded systems. Originally I was going to do a mechatronics masters course but there werent enough students for it to start. Alternatively I choose embedded systems as Im interested in the related subjects and I have always wanted to gain more knowledge about electronics and programming.

Needless to say that the learning curve has been very steep but I find the subjects quite interesting and I hope to pursue a career within this field later on. Im particularly interested in green technologies.

According some, having a mixed disciplinary background will provide me with an advantage when it comes to job applications etc. I was hoping to get some input/ experience from people within industry or research.

-How is it valued from an employers point of view to have a mechanical bachelors and an embedded masters? Does it really provide added value over lets say a mechatronics engineer?

-Does embedded systems have a big future in green technologies? I have come across some interesting developments in controlled environment agriculture as well as sustainable home design through the integration of smart systems.

-What were your experiences after completing a similarly mixed combination of disciplines? Would you rather have continued a masters course with more relevance to your bachelors?

-How do you find the working life? I choose embedded partially because of the opportunity to carry out laboratory work, with plenty of hands on projects. During my bachelors I found the course to focus too much on conceptual design with little hands on experience.

-Is it possible to work within green technologies with an embedded systems focus? If yes, what are the pros and cons of your job?

As I understand it, when braking the rotation of the wheels will turn the rotor, inducing a current in the stator windings which will in turn create a torque in the opposite direction of the rotation of the wheel therefore slowing it down.

But for an induction motor, the rotor must be turning at greater than synchronous speed to act as a generator. How does the rotor turn at greater than synchronous speed when it wasn't previous to applying the brakes and the wheels will be slowing down?

If a liquid passes through a valve and its pressure decreases will this cause a temperature drop too?

62,Wind Forces to Eurocodes,1457826727,"Hi guys,

I've been told to work out the wind load for a pipe. It is pretty much a lamppost, so I was tempted to use the Eurocode that relates to them, but my ""mentor"" said to use the ""simple method"" in1991-1-4. Having refreshed myself lightly on the Eurocode for wind loading I have come to the conclusion once again 'simple' isn't an appropriate term to use. This isn't helped when I have guys in the office who are scared by the complexity of the eurocode and purely use the design software rather than understanding it by hand and as a result they have refused to use it in the computer program to find out the value (they know how to do it by the British standard, so they aren't working out things blind).

The bit that is confusing me is purely knowing what factors apply and in what capacity The eurocode just seems to throw about all these factors around without being particularly clear where they apply (at least for a junior engineer that's how it feels, I'm probably just a bit overwhelmed by it).  In particular the problems I have are in understanding, structural factors and then 'force co-efficients'/'pressure coefficients'? I had a look back at my university lecutres notes from last year and force coefficients weren't even mentioned... which doesn't fill me with confidence.

The impression that I'm getting is that the 'force coefficient' is a one method of working out the load and that doing it via 'pressure coefficients' on a surface is simply just another way, but I'm far from certain.

In terms of my main problem regarding the pipe; what i've got so far in terms of factors etc in my calc for the pipe so far are below, if someone with experience could take a look I'd appreciate it.

v(b) = c(dir) x c(seas) x c(prob) x c(alt) x v(b,map)

q(b) = 0.613v(b)^2

q(p) = ce(z) x q(b)

F = q(b) x f(e) x cscd x A

cdir = directional factor
cseason = seasonal fac
c prob = probability 
c alt = altitutude factor
v b = basic wind speed
q = pressure
f e = force coefficient
cscd = structural factor
A = area

Thanks for reading guys,

If I haven't been clear at any point please say so and I'll try and clarify

Have a nice Day,

I've been reading in Ullmann's Encyclopedia in the Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide sections. I'm specifically putting focus on the Double Contact (Double Absorption) process, with [elemental sulfur + air] as feed. Maybe I'm just rusty, or I'm an idiot (most probable reason), but there's a couple of things that I don't get.

1. It doesn't seem that the process is as relatively simple as most in-out processes. Most documents I've read include oleum as a component, without actually mentioning why it exists in the process. Is it an intermediate? An inevitability of a product?

2. I read a few pfds where they use some H2SO4 to dry the incoming air to be used for the sulfur burning. From what I can understand, they channeled some of the strong acid from the product to purposely absorb some of the moisture from the dry air to ensure that there's no water to poison the catalyst downstream. But that would mean they need to do a startup run till the acid reaches steady state, right?

3. Why do plants use &gt;1000 C to burn the sulfur? The boiling point itself is at like 400ish C. Is that the temp required for the S + O2 -&gt; SO2 reaction to happen?

I'll probably have more questions along the line. Would be nice to get a sulfuric acid plant expert of some sort for me to talk with in an instant-message manner, so I can relay the questions at a more rapid pace, since I'm kinda on the deadline, and I want to settle this quickly and be able to come up with a general pfd by Monday.

81,Need help regarding the force of the earth pushing in for underground shelter,1457721984,"So I have had this plan to build an underground shelter (or two) in my backyard. Initially I had thought of digging out the intended area, covering the floor and walls of dirt with high mil plastic sheeting, laying cinderblock for the walls, building a roof (probably out of wooden beams and joists), and then covering the structure until the earth has become level again, probably about 1-2 ft. below ground level. 

BUT... then I learned that lots of people have been killed this way because we non engineers severely underestimate the force the surrounding earth has pushing against the structure. 

Overall the structure would be no more than 15 feet deep, 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. I want to know what options I have for walls and ceiling that could withstand the force at this size and depth. I do not plan to play an actual floor, instead I will level and polish the earth, cover it with plastic sheet, and then lay carpet/rug over it.

I have job offer at a startup which is working on a software related to medicine (don't really want to give too many details). Its tiny, and run by two 22 year olds who are fresh out of college. But they're pretty organized and have a viable prototype that they're going to be testing with a few clients soon. I spoke to one of the founders on the phone, and he said that if I can figure out what types of things I want to be able to put on my resume after the internship is over, he would be willing to work with me on designing a special project around those ideas. He said that the company needs help with devising testing methods for their new product and processing feedback from their first round of testing in the next couple of weeks (figuring out what changes need to get made to the software). The startup is small enough that at the very least, I think I would be able to meaningfully involved in a lot of it (it looks like they have some software developers, some technical/business advisors, and the two founders) so I think I would learn a lot.

Is this a good opportunity for someone in my position?

This side is currently consuming roughly 120 kW from the servers alone, not including overhead, environmentals, etc..

The other side of the container is a fully operable data center with 1000 servers, same setup, consuming roughly 280kW with a power factor of nearly 1.

Currently I have grizzly screens that require wheel loaders to dump the mixed materials onto. But because of the demand, sticking to a grizzly/loader production set up seems to be extremely expensive. 

Ive been dreaming of a way to segregate 3 sizes of aggregates simultaneously, using as little energy as possible. I would like a 10 cu.m. dumptruck fed machine that can separate those 3 sizes.

Ive been doing some research and trommel screens seem to attract me! So lets describe the case:

Assumptions:
1. 10 cubic dump truck dumps approimately 10 tons of mixed material into a hopper.
2. Via conveyor system, there is a controlled feed rate feeding the trommel screen. 

My few questions are:

1. Have you every used a trommel screen to separate 3 sizes in one production pass?
2. How big should the, diameter and length of each differently sized screens be, of the trommel drum  if i intend to use to feed 10 cubic meters at a time?

Some Related Experience.,1457568993,"I completed a B.Comm program, worked in a family business that provides industrial construction and maintenance services, I don't do project management so much as I do operations management - we're typically performing very specific scope directly for project owners or as a subcontractor to GCs.

I'd like to find employment in project management for infrastructure or commercial real estate construction projects.

I think that my previous degree and experience in a family business, being among the ownership and gaining their perspective, would make me a good project manager given that its allowed me to develop an understanding of the business aspects that project management and construction contracting involves.

**1. Concerns:**
I had a weak year in my own work performance last year &amp; I'm worried that will create negative exposure beyond my team in the interview process, which only my boss &amp; mentor know officially. Also, after a 2yr rotational training program for New Grads, I've spent about 3yrs on team A, so am just over the learning curve. It's a subdiscipline I had no experience with &amp; still have much room to grow technically.  BUT! The team I'm on has limited projects to learn by, a common dilemma. While I do enjoy the testing &amp; analysis of team A, I wouldn't like the intensive coding required for team B' modeling tools (need to learn Python and maybe C# - I only know VBA &amp; C+ from college 8-9xyrs ago).


**2. Positives:**
Team B Engr role could open doors for me at my company since it is the most customer facing ""design"" engineering team. It could also be a stepping stone for me to connect with Sales and become a Project Application Engr, which I've had as potential long term career goal besides technical expert with life long path on current Team A.
Since I had a weak year last year personally, I see this as an opportunity to ""start fresh"" and I have better rapport with the other team (soccer teammate &amp; friend from training program) and have been decently close friends with the new team manager for some time (had Thanksgiving with him &amp; coworkers last year) so hope that may help.


*TL:DR-** Considering applying to new engineering role to start fresh after poor year with current Team A. Team B could open up career path where I'd prefer, I'd get along with team better, but is coding intensive which I won't enjoy as much day-to-day.",AskEngineers,Rawesome,/r/AskEngineers/comments/49pyom/application_deadline_today_3916_should_i_stay_or/

http://www.lstronic-led.com/index.php?_m=mod_product&amp;_a=view&amp;p_id=163

In short- it is  5m RGB programmable LED strip. Operating Voltage is 5V DC. There is 32 LED/meter.
Power consumption: 60mA/LED.

To power this LED strip- I purchase a 5V 12A power supply. Similar to this: http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/tdk-lambda-americas-inc/LS75-5/285-1831-ND/1918842

I connected the power to the supply unit. I connected the led using the DC power jack to the 5v of the supply unit. Nothing happened. I tested the voltage and did a continuity test. I am getting 5.92 V. I can increase slightly if need be. 

So why troubleshooting- the first LED on the strip(the one near power connector) lit up as soon as I touch soldered points that is connecting the led strip to the wires. Note that the wires to the LED strip has been soldered  while being manufactured so I could not have screwed up the soldering.

I thought maybe it is a faulty LED strip. I tested with another LED strip- same thing. It is like the LED strip is getting the power from my fingers although it is still connected to the power supply unit. Although I would like to bask in the glory of possibly being a new super hero, I need help. None of the other LEDs would turn on except for the first one.

Could it be because it is has to be programmed? Shouldnt they regardless display random colours because the strip is powered?

48,Punching shear in raft foundations,1457461556,"Hello Askengineers!

I am designing a raft foundation and I'm not entirely sure how to calculate punching shear under columns. I've seen people use 0,5d to 2,0d perimeter which obviously give different answers unless I use 2d/a factor in V.Rd.c to amplify shear capacity. Although that is used when calculating punching shear for columns with a separate foundation according to Eurocode.

Some say that it is unwise to reduce the shearing force by the reaction that is inside the shear perimeter. To me it seems a reasonable thing to do to avoid way too conservative results.

Some also say that punching shear should be calculated to concrete's minimum shear strength v.min which also results in a very thick raft. Using special shear reinforcements greatly reduce  raft thickness.

I tend to lean towards using 2d/a amplification, special shear reinforcement and force reduction inside the perimeter but I'm afraid I am bit too bold here. What do you guys think?

49,Ground water pressure,1457460591,"Hi Askengineers!

I am designing a raft foundation 4m below ground water.

https://imgur.com/GLXRUdu

This is a picture of soil reaction distribution without ground water pressure. As I understand it, when I add 40kN/m^2 of ground water pressure from below, the total reaction force shouldn't change, only the effective pressure in soil decreases, which is compensated by ground water pressure.

Total vertical load of the structure - effective soil reaction - 40kN/m^2 = 0.

Ground water pressure should be distributed evenly, so that leads me to the conclusion that in places where soil reactions were less than 40kN/m^2 without ground water pressure, will now be increased to 40kN/m^2, but decreased under columns to preserve equilibrium. So in essence, adding ground water will smoothen total reactions and transfer moments from under columns to spans. 

Am I on the right track here? Had a pretty lengthy discussion with a senior engineer about this.

Just gaining experience, a little bit of money, and maybe a career option much further down the line. 

My main skill is CAD and I have experience subcontracting work to machinists/cutters from industrial placements and still have those contacts.

My questions are;

Is this realistic as an undergrad/masters student?
Any free software suggestions?
Initial steps to get work/advertisement?
Any particular type of work that would be good starting place?
How to quote jobs?

The big limiting factor is professional software and the fact we can't do any in-house fabrication or manufacture.

55,ISA data sheets discussion,1457448680,"I graduated in December and just started working at a ""process control solutions"" manufacturing firm in the Dallas area. I interned there in summer 2015 and a minor problem has not been resolved yet.

We use some MS Excel ISA data sheets to help organize the process from quote to production. The sheets have been copied and pasted countless times and this has created some rough edges in the sheet formats, drop-down menus, check boxes, etc. We are looking at other possible solutions besides just using Excel. During my internship with this company, we obtained some trial software for [Megaflex Instrument Forms Plus PRO](http://www.megaflex.com/) but my boss didn't seem too impressed with the quality of the program. I am thinking we may give it another go because the desire to organize the ISA data sheet process has not been resolved and I am not finding a lot of solutions at the moment.

Does anyone out there use MS Access for this? Should I try to fix up these Excel spreadsheets? Is there another database management system program out there that is better and can streamline the process? Any input would be appreciated.

56,Help in barbecue grill project,1457446928,"I'm trying to make barbecue on my small apartment and the problem with it is the soot that comes with the smoke. I have a small, closed barbecue grill that makes a great smoked meat. I'm thinking about passing the smoke through water (like in a bong) however I want to mechanize the process. I have no clue on HVAC or ventilation so I don't know what kind of equipment I can use to create a mild vacuum inside a bottle and force the smoke through the water with a depth of 5~10cm (2 to 4 inches). I saw some centrifugal blowers and some of them have the information ""counter pressure"" as about 350Pa. The water column would apply a pressure of about 500Pa~1000Pa but I can change the height of the exit of the smoke inside the water. My question is, does this counter pressure is the ""vacuum"" pressure created by the blower? Can I use it as a measure to locate my smoke outlet inside the water?

I am currently working on a project that involves designing a fixture that is going to be exposed to both salt water and a good amount of sodium bisulfate.

65,Storage tank - Top fill vs Bottom fill. Velocity head question,1457405964,"Say you are filling a 10m tall storage tank with water. The base of the cylindrical tank sits on the ground. 
What are the differences in power requirements between the three methods of filling the tank?

http://imgur.com/LSAiLG4

1. Top fill - the water must go up a pipe into the top of the tank. So the pump is always pumping up 10m.

2. Bottom fill - the pump would only use as much power to pump to the current water level in the tank. However are you having to work against the head of the water pushing back down on the filling pipe?
Is this the concept of velocity head loss where the velocity and dynamic energy of the water is suddenly converted into static potential head energy in the tank?
Or is velocity head loss always present irrespective of tank setup, i.e. does it describe a head loss due to the molecules in the fluid slipping and sliding over each other in the pipe, which is more pronounced at higher flow rates?

3. Decant Fill - (as per image).

82,Steel Frame Bending Moment Due to Eccentricity Calculation?,1457321191,"Hi there,

I am designing a frame for work. To simply the frame connections for onsite fabrication I created a bolted connected for the single cross brace member at a 400 mm eccentricity to the corner connections opposed to using a corner connection gusset plate as shown in the attached image. I am trying to determine what the bending moment created by this eccentricity is to ensure that the beam (w8x35) can handle it without warping. I need to figure out the applied bending moment in the principle axis (say in the x and the y direction). Would the calculations simply be as followed:

For simplicity sake the cross brace resolved x direction force is 100 kN and the y direction force is 50 kN. Therefore would the bending moment of the beam be

400mm*50kN = 20kNm in the y direction (guessing this would be the major axis of bending)

With this said how would I calculate the bending moment in the minor axis of bending i.e the x axis. First glance would tell me there shouldn't be a bending moment in the x axis however when I modeled the frame in Staad Pro it came up with a bending moment in minor axis of the I beam, which has left me a little confused.

TF=G  (s tau)/(1+s tau)^3

So one zero and 3 poles.  As a response to a unipolar pulse, it gives a bipolar output.  It outputs the derivative of the pulse essentially.  We want to change the transfer function to:

TF=G  1/(1+s tau)^2

No zeroes and two poles, which would output a unipolar pulse as a response to the unipolar pulse input.

Basically we're going from the top image here to the bottom one:

However, I've got to say, I don't intuitively understand *why* a ""differentiation is removed"" when you remove a zero and a pole.  I've gone back to my old textbook and notes this weekend, and can't find much on it.  I see how to determine a zeroes effect as a function of it's distance from the poles, but that's about it.  Any resources I find online for control systems are more introductory and never seem to get to this level.  By the way, the book I have is Control Systems Engineering by Norman Nise.

Basically, why does adding a zero and coincident pole ""differentiate"" the input signal?  I can see in Matlab simulations that adding a zero to a first order transfer function, like:

TF = s/(s+1)

I have experience in house construction. But I'm a little bored with the traditional techniques. My area of expertise is in computer programming... so I'm thinking of combining the two areas to satisfy my curiosity... and maybe get a backyard studio out of it.

At the moment my thinking is aligned with using a CNC Table Router, to cut plywood sheets, into 'knock-together' self supporting [small] structures/boxes, that join other boxes, and so on.

I want to be able to solve difficult problems with less errors.  Also, due to my personality (I don't like dealing with people and for most of the part people just make me angry), I don't want to be a manager, I want to be and stay an engineer.  What can I do be be better.  After I finish my masters I plan on going for my GDT cert.  As a mechy I am not really looking into the FE and PE.  I am also doing a bunch of projects that involve electronic (ardriuno based stuff), chemistry (looking into carbon nanotubes for fun and precious metals recover from electronics, it might not be practical but it will be fun).  Any ideas of what I can do to be better.  Pretty much be that guy that you go to when you need a solution that a problem.  

If there is nothing I can do, just tell me.  I would rather have the cold hard truth than people B.S.ing me.

I want to find the flowrate throught the pipe bases on the pressure difference, diameter and height of the pipe. I wanted to use Bernoulli's equation here, but since the pipe has the same diameter on either end, the velocity terms cancelled out. 
I also looked at [Poiseuille's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_equation), but it doesn't take account for the height of the pipe.

5,Humidity Containment,1457204580,"Hi guys!  I've come across a bit of a household problem I've tried to engineer my way out of to no avail.  Here's a little backstory:

I live in an old NYC apartment building so the materials used are quite dated.  I've had energy issues since moving in where I've been feeling sluggish despite beign a very healthy/fit guy.  I tried a bunch of things to remedy this, including buying a hygrometer to check humidity levels during the winter.  It seems this was exactly the problem.

After calibrating it at several locations it seemed accurate enough where in most homes it would give a reading of approximately 40% humidity.  When I brought it into my own apartment, the humidity was an abyssmal 12%.  Definitely not healthy and would explain some of my recent grievings.  

I immediately bought a humidifier which helped cure my symptoms, but didn't fix the overall problem.  Sure I could get the humidity up to 40% and be comfortable, but after a few hours with it off it would immediately drop down to about 16%.  

I've been using this humidifier for over a month now and have easily pumped in close to 100 gallons of water into the air over that time period.  Where is all that moisture going?  Prior to this problem occuring, all the walls were painted with 2 layers of paint.  Gaps in the floor were clsoed with wood putty and then polished with polyurethane. I've also kept the heater down to a minimum to increase relative humidity.  

Is the moisture permeating through the walls/floors?  The drop in humidity occurs very quickly once the humdifier is off.  Roughly a rate of -1.5-2% every 15 minutes or so.

6,Sanitary Piping Fluid Velocity Sizing ?,1457201133,"Do you guys have any general rules for Sizing Piping/tubing for sanitary applications? I haven't been able to find much information on which fluid velocities to avoid. I used to do pump design and we had standards such as, API 610 and HI 14.6 to use as guidance. Anything over 10 ft/s makes me nervous but I haven't seen anything similar for sanitary tubing applications. The only thing I've come across is to avoid burst pressures but we're talking about thousands of psi. I've also come across much higher fluid velocities from looking at Piping systems already in place. 

Just some additional info:
When I say pipe/tubing I mean sanitary tubing which, has a nominal diameter email to the actual diameter. Largest size you can easily get is 6"". You don't get many options when choosing wall thicknesses. Most tubing comes in one or two options. Usually .065"" or .085"".

46,Looking for a pump for dirty creek water sampling that is better than what I currently have.,1457015873,"I work in the maintenance department at a water treatment plant. Our source is a creek that is prone to getting very high turbidity (the turbidimeter maxes out around 500 NTU). Currently, we're using Moyno 332 series progressive cavity pumps. They work great until we get sand and dirt in the water, and may last 1-3 turbidity events, depending upon how dirty the water is. Maintenance is easy, but frequent and relatively costly. The nitrile stator costs 50 bucks, but the 416 SS rotor is 400 bucks.

What I am looking for is a 120 volt single phase pump that can pump 5-10 GPM (the higher end is better). The total height it would need to pump is about 30 feet, with the the piping being about 3/4"" and 200-300 feet with very few 90s. The NPSH is about 50 psi. The pump needs to run continuously and preferably no surging, though a little bit of surging could be dealt with with additional equipment.

Any advice would be welcome, as I have little experience with pumps for dirty water, and neither do the other people I work with. What we don't want is to get a pump that has a longer maintenance cycle, but is more time consuming and expensive. Maybe the pump we have is the best choice due to ease of maintenance. It currently takes about 30 minutes to rebuild the pump end. However, we're rebuilding it every 3-12 weeks.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that the dirt must stay in the water.

I was listening to Darrel Issa this morning on NPR, he was speaking about the whole Apple/FBI unlocking fiasco thats going on. Something he mentioned was interesting, and sparked a thought.

I'll preface this with the fact that I have zero background in this field, therefore everything i say is purely speculative. 

One of the major issues is that brute forcing the iPhone is impossible. Would it be possible to copy the internal NAND memory bit by bit and then dump that into either 1, a significant number of hardware copies or 2, some sort of ""virtual"" iPhone where the brute forcing could be repeated over and over? Basically, brute force until your 10 tries are over, then try again on a different piece of hardware or virtual machine?

It blinks more frequently when there's more traffic.

Is it simply based on how many packets are processed in a given period of time? 

This is my hypothesis:

The hardware counts the number of packets processed every, e.g., 100 ms. If this a high number, say &gt;50, then trigger 3 blinks in the next sampling period. If it's not so high, then trigger only 1 blink.

So for example, in the following diagram, starting at T=0, in the last 100 ms only 10 packets were processed, so there is only 1 blink over the next 100 ms. At T=100, since &gt;50 packets were seen between T=0 and T=100, so there are 3 blinks in the 100 ms between T=100 and T=200.

    &lt;---100 ms---&gt;

I'm currently working on a capstone project for my program and am having difficulty with part of the calculations. I am designing steel friction collars that will wrap around trees to hold up a canopy. I have solved for the normal force needed to hold up the canopy, and am now trying to determine what area will be needed so as not to exceed a maximum allowable pressure. 


I'm having a lot of trouble trying to determine how to model the stress distribution along the inner surface of the steel friction collar. This is simplified as the pressure acting along half of a cylinder. 


I understand that the function modelling the stress will involve cosine, as the pressure is at a maximum when in line with the force and 0 when perpendicular to the force.

28,Bernoulli's Principle and Joule-Thompson expansion contradiction?,1456630571,"Although it arises from a great simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations, Bernoulli's principle results in fluid travelling faster having lower pressure.  Thus, points in a fluid's pipe with greater cross-sectional area experience higher pressure.  In the case of say, a refrigerator, the fluid undergoes J-T expansion, which causes it to cool.  However, this takes place in a part of the fluid's flow with a larger cross sectional area, meaning there should be higher pressure, not lower pressure (?).  How is this done such that it doesn't exactly contradict Bernoulli's principle?

I am recent graduate in mechanical engineering and doing my first job in a small startup company that makes pharmaceutical machines. Now for the first 5 months I have basically been using solidworks to make small parts that were already in one of our machines. All I have been doing is editing a few dimensions and then going and getting the part made. Now however I have been tasked with creating an entire machine from scratch. All I have been given is the main objective of the machine and what it has to achieve. No material list, no dimensions, nothing. Although I have a basic understanding of what my boss wants, how do I go about designing a new machine? 
These are my questions:
1) How do I begin making a framework for my machine? Is there any book or article that talks about how to design the main frame of a machine?
2) What are the key points to keep in mind while designing? Designing in school was easier because you had professors and other students always helping. I'm the only ME here. Should I adopt the same methodology that was employed at university even though the real world is different?
3) How long should I take to create an entire design? In my head this is the flow chart I've made:

Design Requirements -&gt; Research -&gt; Design Parameters -&gt; Rough sketch -&gt; CAD Model -&gt; Rough Draft -&gt; Final Design. 
What am i missing and would this flow chart suit me? 

P.S. - No one in my office is an ME so I am more or less expected to make this. I don't have a lot of pressure on me in terms of deadlines but I would still like this to be done well and properly. (Feel like this is a test lol)

We have done FEA on them, however in practical testing we want to see if our calculations are correct and if the components are indeed holding the load as expected. A way to do this that I have come across is to paint a single, very straight line parallel to the tubing, and perpendicular to the direction of loading. Others have used this for measuring permanent torsional strain of drivetrain components, but I think it could serve the same purpose if very brittle, inflexible paint is used. If the suspension components bend at all, the paint will not bend along with it and will visibly crack. While there are other ways of measuring this, this will provide a quick and dirty way to check if damage has been done without disassembling anything. What kind of paint has these properties, and is there any way of finding out the properties of different paints to find out at what amount of strain they will crack?

83,"In a bit of unique situation, looking for advice",1456424492,"I was lucky to get a job at a small engineering firm because of a connection. When I took the job, I was fresh out of high school. Since then, I've been here 7 years and it's taken that time to get my Bachelors in Civil Engineering. Long story short, I had 2 kids during this time, one with a major medical problem, and only went to school part time.
 
My job has been amazing. I have gone from driving around and filing papers to drafting design drawings and performing surveys to project manager and doing full structural analysis and design of large buildings. Right now, I literally do the same work as our licensed engineers, but without the pay. I am set to graduate this semester.
 
Our firm is very small. In the past, we've always had 1-2 guys going through school, and 1-2 full time engineers (not including the boss). Well, last year, the other student graduated and now works here as an engineer, and I'm the last school guy. Our work has slowed down and I suspect there will not be a (good) position for me here when I graduate. I would like to move on to a new company, get a fresh start as an actual engineer.
 
I'm trying to put together my resume and wondering what to include. For instance, I'm thinking I shouldn't even list my High school graduation date since it was so far removed from 2016. For work experience, I only had unrelated jobs before this last one. I'm thinking about just listing my current job, and in lieu of having a 2nd or 3rd job listed, using that space on the resume to go in detail on some of my most notable projects/achievements here. I feel like I have done a lot at my current job, and there's many projects and feats that would certainly impress employers and set me apart from the other recent grads. My problem is being able to fit it on one page. I know it's discouraged, but is there an exception to be made for a 1.5 or 2 page resume?
 
Also, how do I approach the subject of people wanting to contact my current employer? I don't necessarily want them to know I'm actively searching for a new job, but they're also the only real credible reference in the past decade as far as work goes.
I was so busy during school with my family and the medical issues that I never went to any clubs or extracurricular activities. I don't have a list of random awards or honors to include--this is why I'm hoping a few projects and related achievements can distract from any of that missing information.

I've been tasked with a drainage problem and have little/no knowledge of the market and what products are available.

We have been tasked very late in the day by the client with adding in some drainage to a design underneath a suspended concrete floor. (as a note. the area where the pipe is will be fully enclosed once the top slab is poured - which is why the pipe has to be supported from the ground up - for anyone who is curious; also the pipe has to be raised because it is going into a wall with alot of starter rebars at the bottom and we wanted to avoid these). 

I was wondering has anyone come across any products that can be used to support a gulley trap  from below (such as shown in the image)....

Any suggestions/ideas would be appreciated - like I said, I'm no drainage expert so until this morning I didn't know anything about this kind of detail.

91,How to set Convection heat transfer coefficient inside rectangular duct containing electrical heating element?,1456397890,"Hi, 
I am working on modeling a air-heater assembly. Please take a look at following figure:
[Simplified representation of heater duct](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2t2DDh93dfabG1vcm5jNlAyT1U/view?usp=sharing)

Following heat transfer happen simultaneously:-
1. Radiation from heater surface to duct inside
2. Heater to air convection 
3. Convection b/w air and duct
4. Radiation and convection losses from duct outside to environment

Modeling method is to divide assembly into 4-5 parts along length of duct and consider energy balance for masses present in each section. This means solving energy balance for air mass, duct mass, heater mass corresponding to each section. Model is run for 6000 seconds with heater on for  1 to 2000  and 3000 to 6000 seconds. 

Problem I face is that Duct temperature are over-predicted. (Observed temp is 60-75 C whereas model predicts 100 -130.)  I think this is incorrect \Delta T for duct/air convection. Air in each section gains temperature in lump-sum way i.e. all air mass inside each section is assumed to be at constant temperature. However as observed in some  CFd studies, only air very near to heater element surface is hot and air in contact with duct inside surface is somewhat cooler (this may be happening due to high flow rate of air). Wth this backgroud:
** My specific question is:
1. How to get heat transfer coefficient for convection inside rectangular duct if Re and Pr number of air inside are known. ?
