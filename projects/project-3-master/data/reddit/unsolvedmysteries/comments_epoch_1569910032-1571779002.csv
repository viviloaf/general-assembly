0,What training would a recent engineering graduate receive?,1571776411,"Hi,

I'm a recent graduate and I'm looking for something as a mechanical engineer. I was wondering what training have you seen recent graduates get when they first start out and is it in the form of 'here's a specific resource to learn this topic go study it' or is it more like 'here's a topic, go search the web and learn about it'?

Me, being a somewhat diligent recent MechE graduate, decided to run some numbers to check the safety factors of all the joints on the frame. I've run into a little bit of a snag as the thing is made of A500 rectangular structural steel and is dropping into a pretty low safety factor according to the methods I've used to calculate them (Chapter 9 Shigley's) so I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of any welding standards for machine design or crane-able structures that they know of?

6,Quitting first job out of college 6-12 months in,1571769083,"I just started working a few months ago as a Jr. Mechanical engineer, but my position is basically just a FEM and script monkey job. I've been trying to give the position some time to branch out into more interesting things, but my day to day routine is incredibly boring and repetitive, even compared to past internships I've had. In addition, the salary is not competitive, there are almost zero expectations (one of my coworkers had been here 2+ years and watches YouTube videos all day instead of working), and the discipline is my weakest/least favorite area.

I also think that it is important to note that this company is essentially a glorified staffing agency that hires new grads for cheap and offers no career opportunities beyond the opportunity to quit and directly work for the on-site client. Typical retention time is 1.5 years.

On the other side, I have a 'dream' company that I had an amazing intern experience at (summer/winter and part time during fall semester) but they were unable to hire me directly out of school due to the type of contract they get. Their next hiring period could fall anywhere between December and next August. 

How bad would it look for me to drop my current job before a year had passed to work with this new company? I can definitely see myself working at the new place for at least 2 years, and the difference in my interest between the two positions is night and day.

7,Looking for Some Career Path Advice (Student),1571768762,"I am a mechanical engineering student nearing the end of my degree. I'm looking for some advice on how to get myself going down a career path I'm actually interested in. I've worked as a co-op ( intern ) student at both a refinery, doing small maintenance projects, and at a consulting firm, working on building services designs and doing a lot of auto cad. I'm coming to realize that there are a lot of different types of jobs an engineer can do, and that I definitely don't want to work in consulting ( not building services at least ). ( It's not a bad industry, its just not for me )

I feel like for me I would be very interested in a quality control or testing roll, or perhaps working as a materials engineer in some sort of metallurgical industry, something more involved than sitting at a desk and picking parts from catalog or similar menial tasks. 

My issue is that I don't have a clue how to go about getting into these types of roles. Most people around my neck of the woods simply graduate and work for the same company ( once company pretty much runs every major business in the city/industrial park ) so its hard to find guidance in perusing anything different.

That being said, couldn't oscillation to rotation be messed up if the oscillations are happening too slowly?

If the connecting rod doesn't pass the middle point (where the rod is angled at 0°), another oscillation might cause the connection rod to push backwards, reversing the rotation. Also, if the rod is angled at 0° (almost exactly), the linkage might jam because the oscillation isn't being directed one way or another?

I don't know if this is the appropriate subreddit to post this, but here it is... 

I am feeling kinda lost right lost now and need some career advice. So, I am 23 and graduate in June of 2018 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a Canadian University in Toronto with a 3.3 GPA. And during my time in undergrad most of my courses were revolved around thermal systems design and thermal power generation. Also during this time I was unable to get internship or co-op experience, which I regret massively now that I am unemployed after graduation.

Since graduation, I have been working full time in a retail position, and have been applying for jobs online through indeed and linkedin, as well as reaching out to friends. From the approximate 400 to 500 applications I have sent in the last 17 months, I have gotten 8 interviews, 3 of which were for sales engineer position and the other 5 being design positions. 

For the sales positions, I found that going through with the whole interview process,  that these jobs were not really a great fit for me, as I felt like my sales and relationship building skills are not that great, and was evident in my interviews. As for the design positions, I thought I did decently but nothing was offered from these interviews. The last of these interviews was in July 2019, and have not gotten an interview since that time.

I know that where I live (Toronto) is very competitive when it comes to engineering jobs, so I knew that it would take a while to find a job after graduation, and I have been expanding my search to other cities in Canada in the last couple of months. However, now that it has been almost 1 year 5 months since I graduated, I starting to feel anxious and stressed that I may never be employed after spending this much time without any meaningful engineering experience. At this point I am reconsidering my career choices, and going back to school for computer science or software engineering. Should I consider a career switch or should I keep applying? And how would I go about gaining relevant experience? Volunteering? Projects? I would really appreciate any advice.

53,Curious about spit bolts and rust expansion,1571690500,"Hey y'all!

I am debating the safety of rusted ""spit"" bolts that are set into natural limestone (ie, caves) as anchors for rope access (human-weight only). When I'm caving, I commonly find ones that are heavily rusted, and I believe they need to be replaced with modern stainless steel wedge anchor bolts. Unfortunately, this is often met with resistance from others because *reasons...* 


.  
Background: A spit bolt is a sleeve with a female end on one side (where you attach the screw and hanger) and four ""wings"" on the other side that expand outward into the rock when the bolt is placed. (See links below for an example). These bolts are usually placed in a wall, with the force downward (perpendicular) to the bolt. 

Unfortunately, it is/was common for people to use non-stainless steel spits. 


.  
This [photo](https://i.imgur.com/5uXzPG3.jpg) is a good example of the bolts that I find. Note that the male screw, along with the hanger for attaching carabiners, has been removed. 


.  

**My question** is: 
Would you expect [this bolt](https://i.imgur.com/5uXzPG3.jpg) to fail? 

My argument is that yes we should expect it to fail because the rust causes expansion and therefore the ""grip"" of the expanded ""wings"" into the rock is jeopardized. It also seems logical that the rock (limestone) around the bolt will be compromised due to the rust expansion (rust jacking). 


Additionally, does anyone have some good resources to help me support this argument...? It is surprisingly difficult to convince people that the bolt is not safe. 

*Or,* am I totally wrong in thinking that the rust will affect its hold....?

54,How to separate glycerol from bioethanol fermentation broth?,1571690177,"TLDR in the end for those not interested in context.

Hello!

As a last year MSc in ChemE student, we have to design and develop a process in the most important discipline of the course (before thesis). After some research in several articles, and following one teacher's advice, we investigated the production of bioethanol from fermentation, since its broth contains glycerol that we plan on using as raw material (to produce formic acid).

However, to do so, we have to find a way to separate the glycerol from sugars (such as glucose, xylose and xylitol) and acetic acid. We do not need to separate it from ethanol, since we will be assuming that we have access to the broth already without it (bioethanol is the desired product for others, so we'll assume they've already separated it, leaving us the residues).

The question here is how do we separate glycerol from the remaining compounds in the broth, since we weren't unable to find a proper method.

I hope I made myself clear, but if I haven't, I'll try to clarify.

Thanks in advance and have a nice day!

58,"[Discussion] How would you, as an engineer, solve the problem of crane maintenance due to everyday stress?",1571684569,"Context -&gt; Problem Statement -&gt; Who are we

Context: Cranes are used extensively in industry. Currently, cranes are equipped with several fail-safe mechanisms that prevent unsafe operation. However, these measures are not fail-proof. Continuous monitoring of the crane's condition could be a different approach to this. For example, one could measure the strain that the equipment is subject to daily. This will provide an indication to the impact of daily operations on the health of the crane.

Problem Statement: Construction technology companies (eg. Surbana and Keppel in Singapore) are interested to develop a strain monitoring solution that is easy to retrofit on existing cranes. The solution should focus on accurate strain measuments of different components in the crane. Ideally, the solution will provide wireless communications for real-time/on-demand monitoring. Solutions can start by measurig the hinges - the most stress-heavy components (however, that is just a suggestion). 

Who are we: My team and I are university students. Recently, we were looking for a problem to solve for a startup program. However, the problems we found online were either too general (eg. Air pollution) or specific, but out of our fields (eg. the crane problem statement above). Yet, we realised that engineers/scientists/professionals on the web might have great ideas on how to go about solving these. Hence, we are trying to see if we can tap on the collective smarts of intelligent subreddits to come up with solutions to more bespoke problems. The bottom line is that we are trying to find ideas which can be developed. If we can't take the solution forward, hopefully students and entrepreneurs in that particular field can come across it when searching for problems and see if they can take it forward.

66,Smoothing out river flow rate in urbanized areas during rainfall events.,1571678296,"This is a serious look at a half baked idea.

For urbanized areas, rivers tend to experience extreme but brief surges in volume &amp; flow in response to the increased run off that urbanized areas cause. As compared to water being absorbed by the ground and passing to the river over a much greater period of time. This typically is not good for the health of the stream. The flows can rip up the banks and scour the bottom of vegetation. They are more likely to create significant log jams, which in turn redirect the river and cause more scouring / erosion.

To some degree this is natural of course, but we're not dealing with natural conditions in urbanized areas.

I'm asking here for some help in dusting off some actual problem interpretation skills I hope I still have. Also input from persons whom certainly encounter these issues in their actual jobs.

My approach is first to understand the river's flow between two rainfall events. This will give me a total volume of water, and peak/trough flow rates that I want to find a way to smooth out over the time between events.

From there, I know what amount of water I'm dealing with and how long I have to disperse it in a better fashion.

Then comes the twin problems of moving and storing water. Looking at storing it first, I want to use large underground tanks - but that's getting ahead of myself for a moment, so just some imaginary tanks that I totally have a place to put.

Then comes pumping it, with piping considerations and power consumption considerations.

I'd want to take water from preferably the sewer system before it reaches the river, but also I could see using the river as part of the storage system by pumping downriver water into the storage system and releasing it up stream.

_____

As to where I'm getting ahead of myself on those tanks -I realize I'm probably looking at a huge area without making the depth of the tanks unreasonable. And it hit me, where do we have a lot of empty space? Sports fields. High schools, college, community, etc. All large open spaces presumably with minimal underground infrastructure &amp; no deep rooted plants. Just grass and bleachers.

If the total volume can be divided across several (several) sports fields with tanks of reasonable depth, perhaps the environmental program could be combined with everyone's favorite use of taxpayer money.... NEW SPORTS FACILITIES!!!!

_____

I'm looking at the Rouge River, MI, as my problem river. I looked at the last year and selected this period as a rainfall event to work this out on. A high of 1100 ft^(3)/s falling to a low of 40-50 ft^(3)/s until the next rainfall event.

I'm trying to best determine the volume over this period. Maybe the USGS site has a feature for this, but it's quite a clunky site for a noob to use. My current thoughts are to just approximate some curves that fit the flow rate, and integrate them to get my volume.

We've been rice cooker shopping recently so, as the product itself doesn't matter too much, I thought hey I'll make a portable, rechargeable battery powered rice cooker.

In my design it's for personal use, so I've maxed at 2 portions in capacity (2 cups cooked rice, about 600ml)

I'm basically wondering how feasible this really is, specifically finding a battery that can deliver the power required (which seems to be around 600W) for the time required to cook a cup of rice (a few mins) and be realistically portable and chargeable.

Is it worth it even if you aren't sure if it's exactly the engineering field you want to do (e.g. systems engineering instead of strictly mechanical/aerospace)?",1571609724,"Some background: I am a senior studying mechanical &amp; aerospace engineering, and right now I'm set to graduate next December (2020). Last summer I had an internship at an aviation company and have a great offer to return this upcoming summer. However, my ultimate goal is to work in the space industry (not aviation). I recently received an offer for a systems engineering co-op at an aerospace company where I would be working on their spacecraft. This would be from January - July. This seems like a great opportunity to get my foot in the door with the space industry, but I am trying to decide whether it would be worth it to take a semester off school and push back graduation again (co-ops are not required at my school so they do typically push back graduation, though they are still pretty common). Also, I haven't worked in systems engineering before, so that adds another challenge to the decision since I don't really know what to expect from that. Ultimately, I'm torn because while it would be stressful to take the job, move six hours away, take a semester off school, etc., I would hate to pass up the opportunity to work in the space industry and end up back in aviation.

So, my questions are: in your opinion, is it worth it to take a semester off school to take a co-op? For those who have done it, did it help you much in your search for full-time jobs? Would you recommend taking a job like this even if it may not be the exact field you want to work in (e.g., this job is systems engineering, not strictly mechanical/aerospace)?

9,How to best avoid jamming in roller-track system,1571602464,"I'm looking at putting together an electric hoist lifting system that would lift from a ground floor to an indoor loft floor, very similar to one shown in this [video](https://youtu.be/kjlZHgo2w-Q). 

I'm just concerned with the setup in this system. The hoist attached to a single point on the carriage in between the 2 roller tracks, which imo gives a possibility of the rollers jamming if the load on the platform is not centrally located.

Two options considered were having a pulley shaft, or adding more tracks. 

*  The pulley shaft would be a rod in between 2 pulleys, with cables attached to both ends of the carriage, and will let both ends be at the same height and raise at the same rate despite different loading conditions. An issue is I am not exactly sure how to attach the electric hoist to the shaft. Would it be viable to attach the chain to the end of the shaft and wrap it around the rod?

* The other consideration would be to add more tracks to reinforce the systems, like adding 2 tracks to have a total of 4 evenly spread out tracks. Issues it has is that I feel it may still be susceptible to jamming, but more importantly the tracks would be in the way. The carriage in my application will be attached at the edge of an indoor loft, meaning the back would be the unloading direction at the loft level. The central tracks could be made shorter than the other tracks and the rollers could be attached to the bottom of the carriage, but I have concerns of the rollers sliding out if the tracks are too short, or the tracks still being in the way if they are too tall.


Are there any other ways to avoid the jamming issue, like special rollers? Or are there considerations I could do to address issues for either of my 2 current ideas? Or any questions on the details of my project that may be relevant?

My project is centered around a specific dryer in our plant that takes forever to dry parts. Without getting too much into the full details of the project, i am introducing a blower into the dryer to recirculate the hot air and direct it at the parts we need to dry. 

Currently, there is no air flow around the parts (measured 0 m/s with a handheld air flow meter). When i put the air flow meter inside the current blowers exhaust port, it measured only 0.22 m/s. The additional blower i would be introducing to the dryer, is rated to deliver air out of the exhaust port at 13.5 m/s. 

From this equation i found on:  [https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/convective-heat-transfer-d\_430.html](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/convective-heat-transfer-d_430.html) 

for convective heat transfer: Q=Hc\*A\*dt  and Hc = 10.45-v+10v\^(1/2)

since currently the velocity v is 0 around the parts, i would be raising v to 13.5. 

From this equation, it looks like this would cut the dry times to close to a third of the current dry times. Am i right on all of my assumptions? Does it look like i might be missing something?

23,The State of AskEngineers (2019),1571551740,"# Overview

Hey everyone, it's been a hot minute since I've done one of these and I wanted to give an update as to what all is going on these days with AskEngineers. I'll try to keep this brief, but there are a few things in the pipeline.

As always, your feedback is important and we're always looking to improve. Please use this thread as a forum to ask questions, express concerns/grievances, etc. Critical comments are welcome as long as they're constructive.

# 1. Updated CSS

AskEngineers is now using r/eddited, courtesy of /u/12px. It's not actively maintained anymore, but it's much more simplified compared to the old code. The old code had quite a few bugs which prompted me to finally sit down and roll out this update.

Please report any bugs with the new style, and we'll do what we can. Unfortunately no one on the mod team has much CSS experience, so if you're interested in helping out in this capacity please [**message us.**](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers)

Unfortunately the `dm` URL prefix to enable native **Night Mode** doesn't work with this style by default, so if you want Night Mode you'll have to use RES for now.

# 2. Filters

Probably the number one complaint I've heard is that AskEngineers has too many career posts. I understand the frustration and often it feels like they've taken over the sub. However, at the same time it has generated some of the more interesting discussions and it seems like there are plenty of users that want to discuss career topics. I've tried my best to remove some of the more spammy topics like *""what major should I pick?""* and similar posts, and redirecting those people to our FAQ which I think does a fair job of answering the question.

Regardless, career advice posts are here to stay and we'll continue to manage them. But if you prefer to not see any career posts at all, there is now a filter in the sidebar which will do just that. This obviously only works if users flair their posts, and we do have Automod set up to remind all OPs to do so, which seems to be working. I was completely remiss on this for a long time, and I apologize for that.

Also be sure to use the **hide** button below the post title if you don't want to see it.

# 3. New recurring topics

Recently we've gotten some ideas for potential recurring threads. The two most popular ones are:

1. ""What's your salary?"" (quarterly)

1. [Engineering challenges](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/d80gkq/how_about_a_monthly_raskengineers_challenge/) (courtesy of /u/mudtug)

The first is easy to implement, while the second requires considerably more logistics. Depending on how the challenges are setup, it would take more bandwidth than the mod team has right now, but we're still interested in setting it up in a way that makes it easy to participate. Feedback and ideas on this are welcome.

# 4. Other stuff

* Setting up acronym bot (this request is a year old, if you want to add to the acronym list go here: https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/acronyms)

* User flair applications are on hold indefinitely until we expand the mod team to the point where we can process applications in a timely manner.

* FAQ additions / updates planned

* Sidebar cleanup planned, specifically the ""Resources"" section

* Minor rules revision planned (mainly wording to provide clarity)

40,Help with symbolic analysis of resonant system,1571519597,"I know this question may sound trivial to some, but please bear in mind that it's been ages since uni, and unfortunately my career path strayed me from differential equations.

Let's take a simplified unidimensional mass-spring system, where one end of a zero-length spring of rate ``k`` is fixed at the origin and the other end is be fixed to a mass of ``m`` kg.

We apply an outside force ``Fo(t) = cos(2*pi*f*t)``.

The spring force is ``Fs(t) = -k*x(t)``.

The total force is ``F(t)=Fo(t)+Fs(t) = cos(2*pi*f*t) - k*x(t) = m*x''(t)``.

If I solve the differential equation ``m*x''(t) + k*x(t) - cos(2*pi*f*t) = 0`` for the initial conditions ``x(0)=0`` and ``x'(0)=0``, I get [this result](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=m*x%27%27%28t%29%2Bk*x%28t%29-cos%282*pi*f*t%29%3D0%3B+x%280%29%3D0%2C+x%27%280%29%3D0).

Now, what irks me is that this function is not defined for the resonant frequency of the system, and I don't quite understand why. My expectation would have been some function with ``t`` in the numerator and outside of the trig functions (i.e. maximum displacement would rise with time).

As such, she's asked me to design something automatic that dispenses a controlled amount, holds the toothbrush in place, is easy to clean, and gives my sister some more independence. Think automatic soap dispenser in a public bathroom. Since I'm still waiting on my research funding and need a hobby, I thought I'd give it a go. 

There's a surprising lack of electric toothpaste dispensers available, which I attribute to being a very, very niche product, however, I've looked into a couple different designs for ""automatic dental hygiene dispensers"" and have come to find two main types. 

The most common is one that uses two rollers on a rack and pinion or screw rod, which could then be actuated by a stepper or DC gearmotor. The rollers move down and compress the tube to move paste out. 

The second design uses a peristaltic pump to dispense the toothpaste. This is currently my preferred choice of design as it does not require any mechanical linkages and only a single stepper motor.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is then: Will a small peristaltic pump, driven by a stepper motor, be suitable for this application? It is my understanding these types of pumps are generally used for dosing in medical or chemical applications and would likely be used for lower viscosity fluids.

51,"Physics, Mechanical Engineering or General Engineering Degree",1571499750,"Im from the UK and Im about to apply for university. Im curently doing maths, physics and chemistry A-Level. I took further maths but only finished the AS and dropped the subject after a year to focus on the other three.

I definetly want to pursue a career in physics. I enjoy understanding and learning the different concepts but I also enjoy solving problems using physics. I want a job where I can research and manafacture my own invention/product i.e. working on a new faster, more efficient engine at BMW, working on more efficient solar panels or working on a new contraption that would help clean the ocean.

I really enjoy new tech so if I was going to become an engineer I would like to work on current, modern technology.

So when trying to apply for university I dont know which course to apply for. One of my options is a physics degree. I want to learn as much physiscs as possible so that I am knowledgeable in enough physics to be able to take part in any engineering project. My second option, after a bit of research, is mechanical engineering since I found out that it combines a lot of the other engineering fields into a single course. Therefore, providing me with enough knowledge to pursue any kind of engineering project. The third option is general engineering which is a course offered by a few UK universities that starts off general and then in the remaining two years can be specialisd into one of the engineering fields.

Another worry that I have is that the concepts of physics used in engineering will change drastically (quantum engineering?) and my degree in mechanical engineering, for example, would be outdated and I wouldnt have the knowledge to take part in modern engineering projects.

So my question is which course should I apply to in order to have a chance to pursue my dream job. Also do you think that engineering will change drastically to the point where my engineering degree will not have taught me enough to take part in modern projects.

52,Would this permanent magnet generator concept work?,1571497384,"**Introduction**

The following concept sketch describes an electric motor that, with low power consumption, constitutes one element in a self-driven generator setup. The sketch should be considered a series of open questions rather than a full-fledged solution. The hope would be that the sketch, based on the “open design” philosophy, may act as general inspiration, a starting point for optimization and development of the ideas presented, and—eventually—a contribution to the search for easily accessible, cheap, and decentralized energy supplies in both private and communal contexts. The text has been divided into two, the first part describing the overall concept, while the other part briefly describes a concrete experimental setup based on the concept.

*Disclaimer:* As the author of the document, I’m simply passing on the ideas presented and don’t actually work with the concept, don’t intend to, and possess no detailed knowledge on the subject. Because of that, the description—which is primarily based on conversations with the now deceased inventor—is without a doubt lacking. I also won’t engage in discussions of the concept.

&amp;#x200B;

**The concept**

The motor consists of a vertical, rotating rod fitted with two discs or, alternatively, a disc and some kind of bottom metal plate. On the periphery of each of the discs, an even amount of permanent magnets are attached—every other north and every other south. Between the discs or between the disc and the metal place, an air core coil is placed. The air core coil receives power from a vario transformer.

The concept is grounded in the idea that the magnetic field of the air core coil can act as a kind of contact that “pushes” the magnets of the discs with short impulses, which in turn creates mechanical motion that becomes stabilized through a meaningful relation between the impulse of the air core coil and the rotation of the disc.

As such, the vario transformer provides the starting impulse for the motor via the air core coil and delivers at the same time to the setup a supposed appropriate frequency at 50 Hz alternating current, which means that the magnets on the disc (say 100 in total) are each individually propelled on when the disc’s rotations land on 100 per second: 50 times positive sine and 50 times negative sine. The magnets on the disc will, in effect, move at 50 Hz and therefore match the input.

*1st Sine: +Sine; -Sine*

*2nd Sine: +Sine; -Sine*

*...*

*...*

*...*

*100th Sine: +Sine; -Sine*

As each sine wave equals 0.5 Hz, the entire setup would be based on that same figure.

Note: Whether in praxis it actually makes sense to base the design on 0.5 Hz is not established. An alternative might be to base the process on, for example, 1 Hz with the disc doing one full rotation every time the coil receives an impulse. Whatever the details, the basic idea remains that rotations in one way or another should correspond to the impulse; that is, the Hz. This is essentially the “collaboration” or match that needs to be established.

It is furthermore central that the motor’s power consumption is low. The absence of an electromagnetic core in the air core coil limits the loss of energy to resistance forces, which also limits the necessary energy in the conversion of impulse from vario transformer to magnetic fields (although this of course also means that the magnetic field created is relatively weak). In addition, a further reduction in energy supply may be accomplished through the use of various tweaks to the setup. For example, one could imagine that the kinetic energy of the movement of the disc is somehow relevant in the overall equation and that this effect might be strengthened with the use of a larger and heavier disc. Many such potential optimization moves might exist, and some may even be decisive in terms of having the concept make sense at all.

At this point, the motor concept is supposed theoretically valid, and everything should run by itself.

The assumption would then be that the energy-efficient motor—technically optimized and designed at an appropriate scale—when embedded in a larger generator setup, slowly helps build surplus energy, eventually settling in a process that is no longer dependent on input from the vario transformer because of a gradual lowering of the power consumption and the fact that the energy for it is part of what’s created in the generator itself. The expected additional surplus energy can then be directed towards external purposes.

Because the concept is scalable, it is possible to tailor it to various power demands and purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prototype A: Elements and setup**

Here follows a short description outlining the elements of a concrete experimental model based on the motor concept. The model consisted of materials that were already available at the time and place of the build, and the various parts of the setup were only partly assembled and activated. As such, this description has only been included in order to document the entirety of thinking and doing in relation to the practical realization of the concept. Because of that, this also should not be regarded an argument in favor of the soundness of the overall concept or one detailing how to optimally realize it.

The model consists of a stationary soft iron plate (40x30 cm), supporting a vertical, rotating rod with a disc attached (⌀17,5 cm). Mounted in the periphery of the disc are 6 permanent magnets—every other north and every other south. An air core coil (0.65 mH) is placed between the iron plate and the disc. The coil is connected to a vario transformer.

During the first actual test, a 5V battery was used without a resistor, and the battery immediately died.",AskEngineers,False,WasteChange,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dk4w25/would_this_permanent_magnet_generator_concept_work/
53,How plausible does the power source for this fictional giant robot sound?,1571496187,"Here is a massive treat for you engineering fans.
First off a little context. 
The giant robot in question is called Mazinger Z, considered to be fiction's first pilotable mecha, launching the super robot genre.
Now while it's a bit of an engineering joke how implausible giant robots are, the creator of this work, Go Nagai, wanted to have some realism in presenting how a giant mecha would work, from difficulty of operation, multiple upgrades, it's lumbering movements, ect... (see here for more: https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lets-watch-all-ninety-two-episodes-of-mazinger-z.381572/) Even the power source was realitivly realistic when first introduced. It was simply what happens when a special element undergoes nuclear fission: a large amount of photons and it gives off no pollution(see here: https://mazinger.fandom.com/wiki/Photonic_Energy)

Why do I call this relativly realistic? Look at this concept: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_photonic_rocket The thing about photonic rockets is that they require a ridiculous amount of energy to convert mass into photons, something that isn't an issue for Mazinger apparently. 

Here is something a friend said when we were discussing this

&gt;in the first episode of the 70's anime Dr. Kabuto [the robot's creator] demonstrates the power of photons by firing some sort of electric bolt at a block of Japanium (the basis for photon power and Alloy-Z as well as its variants) This releases a huge mass of light, I'm assuming the supposed photons.

&gt;This light could be one of two things; one being a waste product like how the Cherenkov effect in nuclear reactors causes them to glow blue but doesn't aid in generating electricity. The other, less likely but still feasible, being that the photons released are harvested via the photovoltaic effect, meaning that Mazinger Z is technically solar powered in the same way that most nuclear reactors are technically steam generators.

&gt;The solar power solution definitely makes more sense, as it goes in line with the ""100% clean"" qualifier, but Dr. Kabuto would have had to invent technology far more advanced than our own in order to make solar cells than are that efficient. I don't think we even have solar cells today that work this well, and old man Kabuto is working with 70's technology.

This gave me more to think about...researching I came across Photon-intermediate direct energy conversion:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon-intermediate_direct_energy_conversion

It sounds very similiar to what my friend described...it is also interesting because as some research on the subject has stated: https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:22058014
&gt;In addition to electric power, photolysis makes other product forms possible. These products include useful feedstock or combustion chemicals, such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and excited molecular and atomic states, used for laser amplifiers or oscillators.

This is really interesting as this reminds me of some of Mazinger's weapons, making me think that the robot is a walking weaponized reactor :)

56,"First Year Aeronautical Student in UK, thinking about where to work in the future",1571489616,"Hi everyone. I am a first year student in the UK at a very good university (don't want to name for privacy reasons). It is very early, but I have been thinking about where I want to work in the future. I think it is time to start thinking about my future, such as internships, where to work etc.


UK salaries seem pretty low in comparison to some other countries, e.g. France, Germany, Switzerland. And from reading online briefly apparently working as an engineer in the UK isn't fantastic compared to other countries.


 Particularly Switzerland, where some websites say the average salary is about 70,000+ pounds. Which seems crazy? I know it may not be that high because these websites have a small sample size to work from, but my point is that in other countries the salary seems a lot higher.


But the downside is learning another language. I have a decent basis in French (A* in GCSE, but still very basic) but nothing in German. And learning that in four years whilst studying seems difficult unless I take a year abroad.



And in these countries, perhaps the cost of living, healthcare vary and the higher salaries may be outweighed by other factors. I do not mind moving to another country so much as it seems it would be an amazing experience. But there is also brexit to think about, but brexit's effects seem hard to predict.



So my question is, has anyone moved from the UK to another country like this, or does anyone have any knowledge on doing this? Would it be worth it to learn a language, and is the salary really that worth it (maybe there are other factors, e.g. higher taxes)?

This may not be the right place to ask this, but it's a good place to start I think. I am looking to start making guitars, which are made of wood usually, as you know. I am a big fan of using beeswax+mineral oil as a finish since it's mostly hypoallergenic, non synthetic, safe, and a non-degradable (at least to what I know). Because of the current crisis with bees, I would like a more ""vegan,"" if you could call it that, material to work with that has similar properties, and can be turned into a wood finish by mixing it with an oil. Mineral oil isn't exactly sustainable either, but I'd like to take this one step at a time.

The current finish recipe that I use is a 1:1 ratio (by gram) mixture of medical grade mineral oil and foodsafe beeswax. It results in a very oily paste that is solid at room temperature, but easily melts when heat is applied to it. This finish is extremely useful since it stays inside the wood, and repels water very nicely due to its greasy nature. It's safe to touch and use, which I feel is important when making things that are touched by human hands. This type of finish is used for cutting blocks in cooking for these reasons.

16,"Engineers of Reddit , what would you do ?",1571360196,"Hello fellow redditors, 

TIL that I might be screwed. Let's begin. 

I graduated from ITT back in 2013 and basically spent my time trying to leave my then customer service position to jump into the electronics industry. In 2016, I purchase my first car and successfully make the jump into a technician role. That company eventually falls behind financially, and I get laid off as a result, eventually leading to me finding another technician position. During my time here I applied to multiple engineer positions &amp; I eventually land a job as a Manufacturing Test Engineer for a small company and I work here from 2018 to now.  

My significant other needs to move up towards northern California to be near family, and as a result I need to find a position up north. In doing so I end up finding out that even though I graduated 3 years before ITT was shutdown, multiple employers view ITT degrees as basically worthless &amp; as a result, I am scrambling to determine what I should do. 

I know that I want to be an electrical engineer, but I feel as though I am stuck , and I am not sure how to proceed from here. Discovering that you wasted four years of your life on an education that placed you $45,000 in debt is pretty devastating.

35,Suggestions for my career? Feeling burned out and question my engineering career.,1571339214,"Throwaway for reasons. 

Graduated in 2015 from a very good engineering school with my BSME in the US. Went automotive (tier 1 supplier) for about a year as a design engineer (surfacing for plastic parts) and left because I was on contract being strung along with low pay.

Current job of 4 years, in a global agricultural equipment company as a Product engineer. Designing and supporting automated equipment for commercial farms. Its nothing super technical and is ran very poorly.

I hate my job. I'm questioning whether I even like this career anymore. Due to the lack of technical stuff in my job, I have noticed my skills and knowledge from college are slipping. I struggle to recall basic statics and dynamics problems (once I familiarize myself it comes back) and I feel like the longer I'm here, the more trapped I will become and stuck here, because I won't be desirable in the job market anymore.

I struggle with interviews, mainly because I'm taking anything I can get just to get out of here so I'm not fully interested and it shows in my interview. I don't know what industry I want to get into bc my judgment is clouded by my stress of my job and wanting to escape it.

&amp;nbsp;

# Things I like about my job:

* paycheck is good

* 40 hour weeks

* I enjoy the little uninterrupted  time I get, designing stuff and trying to think outside the box and make something new and ""innovative"" 

&amp;nbsp;

# Things I dislike about my job:

* too much support of our customer service department and answering stupid simple questions that a non-engineer could answer. And answering the same questions even though I created reference sheets for them about that product, that they don't use.

* salesmen drive everything (which is fine, they are the voice of the customer, but they go in circles and never give definitive input until after the it's designed. I start product development and for 2 years, I've been chasing my tail bc every other month they do a 180 on what they want. I ask for input at meetings and no one contributes anything so capturing design intent prior to designing is nearly impossible. 

* my boss is a train wreck. She is always stressed, dealing with service calls from farmers, and getting pulled in every direction by salesmen accusing us of not getting anything done. She nearly cries in meetings and always bitches to us about problems she's dealing with the sales guys.

* she requests features that the sales guys want that are completely in practical. It's not just outside the box it's  on another planet. And there is no reasoning with her or the sales guys about it.

* orders with insane lead times. 300k worth of product to be manufactured and shipped across country in 2 weeks when our listed lead time is 3 months. Leads to bastardizing products to substitute parts that are available. Leads to issues months from now and reworking the bastard again to make it functional. This also results in being gone 1 week a month to the middle of nowhere, working at farms on stuff that should never have been sold. 

* products in general, are boring and not interesting.

&amp;nbsp;

_______

# Details about me:

* I enjoy cad design without interruption and I'm a very organized and methodical person. I don't like having to do something twice when it's easily avoidable/foreseeable.

* I'd be willing to work more hours if the industry was structured and the work was interesting. 

* I do NOT like customer support. By this I mean, getting asked questions from customer support ""what is this part in this picture"" with no background or details. I feel like a detective most days. Some support is understandable and necessary, but I'd rather it more technical related. Overall I want to avoid it as much as possible though. 

* I think I'd be interested in getting closer to the manufacturing world, but I have no experience with it and everyone wants you to have 5 or 10+ years experience. 

**Hobbies:**

I enjoy on my free time, tinkering with my computer, learned some networking stuff for hosting my own nextcloud server, which led to learning Linux and writing small scripts to automate stuff. So sometimes I wonder if I should pursue something computer science related or maybe PLC related since that's closer to my current education. 

Other hobbies include hiking, camping, hunting, and anything else that gets me away from people every now and then.

When I was getting ready to graduate (civil engineering), I had to take a senior class, where we discussed ethical situations and everything else in between that.

He mentioned how we couldn't call ourselves engineers until we had our P.E. license, as we would officially be engineers. This might sound a little egoistic but I'm curious to know if anyone else sees that those of us who actually have an engineering degree can't call ourselves engineers, and in some cases can't have the word engineer, design engineer, or similar in our job titles.

I have noticed in the construction field, the term Project Engineer and Field Engineer, are heavily used for people with none engineering degrees. In my case, I'm currently an Engineering Intern, and this makes it sound like I'm still in school, and dealing with clients makes it a little more challenging.

38,Accepting a sponsored 45k offer ?,1571330953,"So this post is for my international friend not about myself. 

He is from Korea studying Electrical Engineering here in the US on a visa. He recently received a 45k job offer from a local company in the Dallas/Forth Worth area. He asked me for advice if he should take this offer as I am already working but his situation is different than mine as he would need sponsorship.

I feel like 45k is very low for the Dallas area. Hell, I still haven't quite graduated and I'm working making 60k but since he needs sponsorship he feels like this is one of the few jobs he will be able to get. He will graduate this fall and since he thought he was not going to be able to get a job, he applied for a graduate school as backup to remain in the US and got accepted. 

If he does not accept this position he would continue studying here for a MSEE.

What I told him was to take the job and keep looking for another job while he works since SOME money is better than no monies. Now I'm questioning whether this was good advice or not and maybe he should get his Master's and then job hunt again. 

Can he even get another job while sponsored to one already? I'm not entirely sure how sponsorship works.

40,What is the actual difference between Generative Design and Topology Optimization?,1571324926,"Hi all

So, full disclosure that I’m a student and do not know much about either practices other than a basic description. Being in a Mechanical and Materials dual major Im pretty interested in both and want to know what the substantive differences are. 

From my understanding, TO is where you start with an actual part/structure that fulfills some required parameters and then iteratively remove enough material to the limit of sustaining those required parameters. 

Generative design OTOH is where you put in parameters/constraints and an algorithm builds the part UP from nothing to the best possible geometry based on those parameters.

Apparently GD has wider array of options but its all pretty new and buzzwordy, most of the info coming from CAD companies so im sure how much is the real deal or and how much is sales spin. I can see its power when couple with 3D printing though.

I need to have a means of communication between two devices, one of which will be a computer and one a teensy 3.6 (most likely). Since it needs to work very reliable and fast I was first thinking of using 2.4gHz, but it is going to be used in indoor envoriments with lots of wifi. This is why I have now switched to using 433mhz instead.

But, I need the update rate to be as fast as possible. I'm thinking about using GFSK modulation, but then the question remains how to actually format the data packet.

I don't want to limit to just sending characters to represent numbers, and instead use hexadecimal values. But then how do you normally indicate an and of message? The end character could just as well be a value of the message. Delays between packages are also not wanted as they slow down the transmission. What is common solution for this?

Secondly, can I find some common best practices in designing a format like this?

2.) 1997 Ford F-250, naturally aspirated, gasoline 5.8 351 Windsor  --  *This will range from 20-25”. Similar to the ones above, we can offer them with a 1/8-27 NPT female thread. 20” (135501-00820) and the 25” (135501-00825)  - The grommet mount options are 20” (GA33501-01120) and 25” (GA33501-01125)*

 

3.) 2013 Hyundai Elantra, naturally aspirated, gasoline, 1.8L – *This one is more of the unknown. I would estimate that it would be a slightly lower restriction set point when compared to the truck but not 100% certain.

This seems like a better option than spending thousands on a slew bearing.

Here's where I'm having trouble. At the end of the belt that is 15 inches away from the axis of rotation, obviously I'll need the other HTD pulley wheel. What is not so obvious to me are choices of components and parts. I want to attach the shaft (C2 in the figure) to both a pulley wheel and a gear. The problem as I see it is that pulley wheels are attached to bushings which take a key, so I need a shaft with a key slot. However, if I want a gear on the same shaft, it would need to have a key slot of the same size as well. The shafts for gears rarely have keys though.

I've been searching and searching on the McMaster Carr site, but it seems to me that shafts which fit pulley wheel bushings are different from shafts for gears. If I want a gear and a pulley wheel on the same shaft, how is best to achieve this without coupling 2 different shafts? Also, at the intersections of C2 and C3 with P1 and P2, how should I set the rods to rotate? Should I use sleeve bushings? Bearings? How is this done in practice? Or, am I going about this all wrong?

75,Help! Specific question about Space capsule for a presentation - High School,1571258335," Hi there,

I'm still in high school (17) and have a presentation to make about space travel (and it's not going to be my last one). So I chose a less chosen theme to talk about which is the returning of the astronauts back to earth from space. While collecting some info I stumbled on something that somehow isn't clear enough to me: (since I'm interested in it as well outside of school)

While entering the earth's atmosphere with the capsule/command module, which has a heatshield on its bottom to protect the people within, the shield protects the model for several minutes from the enormous heat until it's through the atmosphere enough to deploy the parachutes at an altitude of ca. 2 miles. According to Wikipedia ""the surface of a capsule can get to 1480 °C (2700 F) as it descends through the Earth's atmosphere. ""

**Apollo 15 splashdown:** [**https://youtu.be/0T5t8eBnjS4**](https://youtu.be/0T5t8eBnjS4)

**SpaceX Dragon capsule splashdown:** [**https://youtu.be/\_zF7PF7tpGI?t=243**](https://youtu.be/_zF7PF7tpGI?t=243)

I don't get why there is no steam (in all splashdowns as I've seen on the net) from the water that vaporizes due to the hot shield. How is it possible that it isn't even a 100°C hot to make some little steam around the capsule? Even Lava is between 700° and 1,200°C and it steams like crazy when it comes into contact with water. What amount of time would the heatshield and the rest of the module have to cooldown from almost 1500°C/2732°F in a standard procedure between entering the atmosphere and till final splashdown? Is there a way to calculate the temperature approximately by knowing the heatshields construction and airspeed after the parachutes are deployed? So that we could say for example ""after the parachutes are deployed, the shield cools down with ca. x°C per second"".

I mean like, **for example**, the module has a speed of 30 mph after the parachute deployment which happens at 2 Miles altitude, which would give the shield a timeframe of 4 minutes to cool down below min. 100°C to not make any steam on contact. Meaning, the shield has to cool down 370°C /min. or 6°C /sec.

Is there a specific answer to that? Can I find a kind of a *detailed* protocol of the whole procedure with exact numbers? (documents preferred over video) Like an explanation of how this happens? I can't find any specific answer to special material or ""space capsule heatshield cooling system"" that could deliver such a cooling rate.

I found some helpful pdf here ( [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/CSM06\_Command\_Module\_Overview\_pp39-52.pdf](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/CSM06_Command_Module_Overview_pp39-52.pdf) ) to copy some info for the presentation, but still, not exactly what gets my attention the most. I can find some articles about the capsules, but what I'm looking for are numbers from a source like NASA. (i posted this in another subreddit as well in the hope to get faster answers)

I hope some people here could help me out somehow since I'm really into it. Thanks in advance!",AskEngineers,False,Abitlostindigo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/diveig/help_specific_question_about_space_capsule_for_a/

77,"Please, could you give me advice for my undergraduate final project on automation?",1571256054,"Hello.  
I've  been working on my final engineering project this year, and working partime as  well. For my final project I choose to automate a gypsum/plaster  production system, with a rotary kiln, pretty much like those plants to  produce cement, but at a medium scale. Gypsum happens to be produced at  more or less 150°C, so requeriments are not so extreme as cement or  quicklime/lime.

I'm happy about my  theme, but it is quite extensive, and I'm begining to lose focus. I  have to work on the mechanical, electrical, and control systems. How  deep I dive on any of those subjects is on me... just one machine is  enough to write a project/paper about, let alone a complete process, so  I'm a bit lost and afraid about the presentation being too  rushed/superficial. The time to do the presentation is quite short, 45  to 50 minutes. I also need to show parts of the systems working on that  time. I'm going to show the scada with a funtional model of the kiln,  but even then time is my concern.

What  are the most important points of showing how to automate a process?  What should I focus on?

90,Hydrogen/Chemical/Refinery Plant Process Engineering - For Hydrogen purification looking to calculate PSA electricity consumption. Help!,1571241448,"Hello everyone.

**TLDR: I need help finding how much energy a PSA specifically consumes in a hydrogen purification plant at multiple scales (SMR)**

I turn to you o' ever wise internet for help. [I'm an entrepreneur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrelorenceau), working with a [pretty damn cool Scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-naderi-01/) in [an awesome program](https://www.joinef.com)

Ali (the Scientist) has developed a Hydrogen purification membrane that is truly multiple factors of much better than anything we've been able to find both commercially and in research papers. He's combined multiple of his polymeric inventions together to make one that has far better selectivity (read: efficiency), heat and pressure tolerance (read: major cost savings on cooling/depressurizing gas) and even high permeability (flow-rate-ish). So much so, that we think we can really replace a large amount of PSAs with higher capacities. 

If you know how SMR/PSAs works, skip this paragraph - To get hydrogen, basically you take natural gas, you put it in a 'steam methane reactor' (SMR) which does chemical stuff (science term) to the gas, pass it through another 'water gas shift reactor' to enhance the amount of hydrogen, then through a heat exchanger to cool it down so you can put it in a 'pressure shift adsorber' or PSA which separates the Hydrogen from it. Voila, pure hydrogen from Natural Gas. Believe me, this is the easy version of this explanation.

We know our 'total cost of ownership' at 100 / 1,000 / 10,000 / 100,000 Nm\^3/H but we are struggling much more on calculating the price at those same volumes for a PSA system. 

We have extrapolated from an old DOE study ""DTI Task 2 Report HFA, Archive of the internet, NREL DOE"" but for reasons, that's a bit of a stretch. Overall we have not managed to find a consistent way to calculate Energy expenditure for PSA systems. Chemicals like Zeolites we can figure out by size of bed, and size of bed, straight up from Alibaba, but energy of PSAs is a mystery, especially since you have to include the necessary heat exchanger.

Cost of the whole PSA (minus shipping install and maintenance) is hardware (bed) + chemicals (Zeolite) + Energy. I can't figure out energy, please help. I find the energy expenditure of a whole SMR process, but it's proven extremely difficult to find a reliable method for pricing PSA energy expenditure for a 100 / 1,000 / 10,000 / 100,000 system. I realize they have different design and vary, but there's gotta be a rule of thumb. or at least raw data.

97,Is my version of a space elevator plausible?,1571236478,"https://imgur.com/yU8ttVq


Here is my revised space elevator idea. This variation of the space elevator concept solves the flaw in most designs because it doesn’t require carbon nanotubes for the cable and instead uses floating platforms that are coupled to segments of the suspended cable which alleviate stress. A high strength steel cable can be used instead of an expensive graphene or carbon nanotube based cable which would be cost prohibitive and cost exponentially more. 

There is an air loop which has an inlet and an outlet. The red is air that is harvested from the atmosphere of earth and is warmer then the outlet air with is supercooled air. The warm air is pushed up into this loop from earth into space to a satellite that is in geosynchronous orbit above the earth. The air is in a container but exposed to the extreme cold of space and this super cooling condenses the air into a solid or liquid form. Once it becomes condensed it is then fed down toward earth from space (blue side in image.) Liquid air has an expansion rate of 860x so this is what provides the thrust for the platforms to hold up segments of the space elevator. The satellite could use solar polar to power the air pump. This would have zero carbon impact. 
In the image the yellow are the platforms, the black rings are couplers, the green squares are nozzles, the blue is super cooled air line  (liquid or solid), the red is the return air line, the blue arrows from the green blocks is the expelled supercooled air which expands and provides thrust to hold up the platform.

10,Transitioning from product design engineer to product manager?,1571213647,"At a bit of a professional crossroads, and could sure use some outside perspectives...

Over the last 10+ years I've become a halfway decent product design engineer. I've defined projects with customers and conceptualized product architectures and marketing strategies. I've designed assemblies and parts for nearly all processes and scales. I've built and led teams of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, industrial designers, and graphic designers. I've launched products from napkin sketches to volume production. And I feel confident that I could effectively drive the design and development of most products that don't require extremely specialized knowledge (and even then, it's fun to work with specialists if the project has such resources).

I could continue down this path as a senior level product design engineer, but I think I'd like to transition towards higher-level roles.

Last year around June (06/2018), my girlfriend at the time got into the weed culture and smoked outside a lot with mutual friends.

1. How much will my incompetence/lack of knowledge on the job bother others? I’ve worked as an operator in a manufacturing setting and a lot of the operators there talked bad about the engineers, calling them stupid and incompetent. 

2. I’m starting to fear I will be fired for incompetence, I can’t ever imagine someone paying me 60 thousand dollars to do a job, I couldn’t even fix my own car let alone be thrown into a totally new manufacturing setting and have to diagnose issues with machines I’ve never seen before in a high pressure situation.

4. Was work more or less stressful/mentally difficult than school?

I'm a recent mechanical engineering grad who received a job offer for a junior mechanical engineer position today from a manufacturing company of just 22 people (yay!).

The company is well-established, seems to have some great opportunities for growth, and the pay is good ***BUT*** there's two things I'm deeply hung up on:

1. **I would be the** ***only*** **person with an engineering degree on staff.** This means my mentors would be the CEO and the sales VP. Although I did have an internship with another small manufacturing company in the past, I feel that I don't nearly have the breadth of experience required to take on such a key manufacturing role, especially without another engineer to either double check my work or collaborate with.
2. **No 401k plan/match**. Achieving financial independence is important to me, so I'm not sure if this is a deal breaker or not. What's your take?

While one side of my brain is screaming ""you dumbass, this is an incredible opportunity to throw yourself in the deep end, gain some serious manufacturing experience, and jump start your professional career!"", the other side is screaming ""WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?! You have pretty much zero long-term industry experience, will have no mentor, no one to turn to, and no one to assess your work! You're going to be thrown into the deep end with no life preserver and an anchor strapped to your foot!""

Proportionally and size-wise it shoud be similar to a pen. Rotation should be around 10 degrees, not much.

I  am currently a third year mechanical engineering student and have had a  couple career related jobs, but just began my first full-fledged  internship this past summer at a local company. My current gig (at what  we'll call company A) is ongoing -- basically 20ish hours during the  semester and full time on breaks. I enjoy what I do and am gaining great  experience. This internship could very well lead to a job after graduation, as they usually hire interns.

Before landing this  job I was pursuing a summer internship with company B -- talking to  recruiters and was told to apply for Summer 2020. This company is in  another state (I'd enjoy living somewhere new for a while) and centered  on what I want to do when I graduate. Company B would only be for a  summer, i.e. 2 or 3 months.

My question is this:  
Is  it possible to work for Company B for the summer, but still come back  to Company A in the fall? Would this be totally inappropriate and/or  insulting to Company A? If this could work, how do I go about talking  about this with my current boss (who is very supportive in general)?

I'd  appreciate any insight about the feasibility of doing this with  engineering internships, or how you would handle this situation  yourself.

In an ideal world I  would be able to take a couple months off from Company A to work for  company B, simply with the goal of diversifying and gaining experience. I  am NOT unsatisfied with company A, but I just would really like to  pursue multiple opportunities and get even more experience under my  belt. I kinda need the income during the school year, and am enjoying  company A, so if it came to picking one or the other, I'd stick with  Company A.

75,What components in unpowered mechanical machines implement seemingly-digital control logic? (Case example: sewing machine),1571095027,"There are modern sewing machine that can be operated completely mechanically (i.e. with the power off), and supports tens of types of ""stitches"". The simplest stitch is the ""straight stitch"", where one stitch follows another in a straight line. Another is the ""zigzag"" stitch, where a triangular sawtooth shape is made on the fabric; the apparent motion of the needle is a combined of 'forward' and 'left' and 'dig', then 'forward' and 'right' and 'dig'. There are other stitches that are quite more sophisticated, like those resembling flowers, where an intricate sequence of moving left, right, forward, and backward is involved.

The motion itself is effected by the needle itself moving left and right (but staying stationary in the ""y-direction""), as well as the ""feed system"" moving the fabric backward and forward (in the y-direction). So ""move forward and 45 degrees to the left"" translates to several components (the needle, feed system, etc) making their own equivalent deltas.

What's interesting about this is that with the especially sophisticated stitch types that consist of about 20 steps each, there is clearly an element of ""memory"" and a program that at any point in time knows at which step it 'currently' is, and what the next step is. There also seems to be some ""reset"" logic where if you change stitch types midway, e.g. you were doing a 'flower' stitch and you switch to a 'zigzag' stitch and then back to 'flower', the memory of where it was within the first flower stitch gets lost (since when you get back to it it starts a new 'flower' from step 1.)

All this is happening with no electronics involved (power is switched off and machine operated manually.)

So how is this ""mechanical logic circuit"" implemented? Are there known high-level mechanical equivalents to digital electronic circuit components (flip flops/registers/etc) that can keep memory and instructions? Or does this actually boil down to really implementing the corresponding digital circuit from mechanical ANDs/ORs and timing/synchronization chains?

Obviously its area changes as it moves, and I'd like to find the sum of all of the areas of the triangle as the ladder moves from an upright position to a horizontal position.

87,"Hi engineers of Reddit, I have a question about how to find the specific thermal efficiency of a Cummins B-Series Turbodiesel Engine",1571078476,"Hi! 

I have been not been able to shake the idea of more affordable aviation through the use of compression ignition engines. After having done some research I found that while rare, at least here in the US and North America, CI engines in aircraft is not as infeasible and crazy as it sounds... Especially with the prevalence of Aluminum in diesel engine nowadays allowing for much lower weight. Upon digging a little deeper, I found the most common model out there is the Diamond DA Series of aircraft that use an engine called the Austro AE series. These are essentially just repurposed factory Mercedes automotive diesels that were definitely never intended for use in aircraft not were they EVER designed with that in mind. As such, I got to thinking that the Cummins B-Series, given its rich aftermarket and ease custom design would fare much better given some key changes. Why? Well, rather than being designed for the automotive duty and then adapted for aviation this engine platform was initially designed for industrial use AND THEN adapted for use in the auto industry and commercial trucks. It's a doomsday engine.. especially when used with the famous Bosch P-Pump MFI system. However, with my simple knowledge of head flow and a few other things, I've always figured that the 24 valve would be more efficient overall than the 12 valve B series. I'm trying to figure out if it would matter all that much in the name of efficiency to use one over the other when another extremely important factor of aviation is simplicity and reliability. I've scoured the internet for number regarding efficiency and I've found fuel flows but only for most recent engines.. I've tried to work out some math but I do not have the time nor the knowledge to come to a conclusion answer on whether or not a build like this would ever make sense. The internet has tons of PDFs detailing government efficiency studies testing technologies to increase thermal efficiency but they do not specify the original bte. So, after having not turned up any data on the internet (and I'm honestly surprised considering how many Cummins 'bros' there are out there, and how many racing builds there are, not to mention tractor trailer usage) I'm turning to you folks here at ask engineering to see if y'all have any data regarding Cummins B-Series thermal efficiency numbers, or could give me any direction on the math needed to find it? It would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! 

OH, and before any of you aviators call me crazy and tell about me sounding like I don't make sense... I'm a college student, and I'm not STEM. Nor do I have my private Pilots License (as of yet, and likely not for a while ... Lol). This is more a fantasy from a passion for aviation, especially after having seen the 55-60 gallon / hour fuel flow numbers in a daher TBM850 with around ~800hp... Yikes.

I took the FE in August but unfortunately failed it. I'm looking for a good review course (PPI was what I used but it was severely lacking in most areas that weren't general for environmental) but in the meantime, Im looking for a job.
Everywhere I've applied to has requested that I wait until November or December to begin my search, which seems odd to me since I thought you were supposed to look for jobs 6 months in advance. Should I keep applying for jobs anyways or just wait?
Because I failed the FE, i feel really limited in which jobs I can do. It seems like everywhere wants that EIT certification.

3,Is there any particular jobs that fit my wants/expectations/abilities?,1571053699,"Hello AskEngineers,

Essentially I've come to ask professionals from every background to get insight on jobs within their profession.

A little context first:

- I'm 22 years old and live in Australia, Sydney. 

- I'm a newly graduated Robotics and Mechatronics Engineer with a sub major in CAD. I graduated this past September, but finished all my units last year November (work experience, blekh).

- I stared my work experience at an engineering and manufacturing company, and gained a full time role quickly.

- I love Engineering as a whole, and love my job to death. We mainly do elevator and escalator work, and while neither of those words excite me, I love designing and manufacturing anything and everything which is the reason I love my job, despite having no feelings *for* the job.

Now, I'm a Mechatronic Engineer that's been working as a Mechanical Engineer for a year now. I'm looking to change jobs as soon as possible for a few main reasons. Firstly, the job I'm doing currently only has relation to the mechanical side of my degree, and I can see that as being detrimental to any future job applications toward anything robotic/electrical. The biggest reason however would be that I currently am not too fond of my job. When I first started I could work a 90 hour week (and I did) no problem and still be there at 7 every day the next week. Now, the stress of the job is really getting to me. I work about 65 hours a week, even when I only want to work my 8 hours per day and leave. I have a 2 hour commute every day. Everything is rushed and whenever something turns out wrong it gets ugly.

I have done an immense amount of mechanic work as a hobby during university, and would love to get into something automotive, but unfortunately there are no jobs in Sydney like that, that I know of.

I just want to know what jobs I should be looking for that align with realistic working hours, without the stress of meeting incredibly unrealistic deadlines, leaning toward an electrical/automotive position. Possibly even a CAD intensive role. I've been searching and applying to many different places but I seem to be getting ghosted as well as have no actual knowledge of what a lot of jobs are expecting/what will be my job if I do get accepted.

I hope I haven't broken any sub rules! And I thank everyone in advance.",AskEngineers,False,Ekral0297,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dhpffu/is_there_any_particular_jobs_that_fit_my/

However, I was wondering if the balls would get stuck considering the speed and angle the balls hit the velcro is variable.

I have a high pressure air tank that I'd like to use for different tasks (filling the air in my leak riding mower tires  without unraveling 50 ft of extension cords and air hose to the end of my property, possible short use of an air ratchet just to change tires, etc.)

I had this in the back of my mind for a long time, but never tried to work it out because I didn't have a way to fill the tank.

Anyway, I recently found out they have relatively cheap manual high pressure pumps that are not the easiest but can pump up to 4500 psi.

So, assuming I:

1. Hydrotest the tank for leaks for safety
2. Attach the appropriate regulators and set the accordingly

...am I understanding correctly that the math to figure out the comparable application is just pressure x volume? So my tank, which is 45 cubic inches = .194 gallons x 4500 psi = 873 (not sure what units that is) which would be the same as 100 psi in an 8.73 gallon tank? 

In other words, would a 45/4500 hpa tank at capacity be almost like having an 8 gallon carry tank at 100 psi, and have similar applications?

Most digital design engineers in semiconductors, defense, aerospace, etc. seem to have a common thread of enjoying the part of the job where it's writing RTL code.  Whether it's VHDL, Verilog, System Verilog.  I know for me, the creativity aspect and satisfaction of seeing my design come to fruition within waveforms is a big part of enjoyment in my job.  Being able to optimize down to the last clock cycle for latency, looking for power optimizations with gating, simplifying logic to reduce area and increase performance, etc.  

However, grounds up digital design pure coding jobs are not as plentiful it seems vs. say software engineering coding jobs.  The hardware design industry is much more mature.  You are often dealing with legacy code and hacking it here/there.  Also the digital design coding is a small aspect of the overall job.  For ASIC designers, you have to deal with working with physical design for timing closure, validation for corner case bug fixing, and with mixed signal ICs have to work with analog designers.

CPU RTL design is pretty cutthroat from what I've seen in big companies like Intel, Apple, AMD.  Competition is fierce with lots of smart people for these kinds of positions.  I think it's because that is the pinnacle of the ""fun stuff"" for digital designers at heart.

36,Suggestions for predicting the displacement of a graph or force estimation.,1570930678,"Hello

This question is aimed mostly to engineers but whoever believes he can handle it may give his valuable advice.

I have a tabular data set of Load/Displacements in Newton/mm of a material using an Instron Machine, applying compressive forces.

Those data are my reference or gold standard. The same material is depicted on images where unknown forces are applied to the object and the object deforms as it is a rubber material. I want to estimate the forces caused that deformation.

My idea is developing a model that measures each column of the image that the object is depicted under strain. I measure the heigh of the object in each image column and find the difference from the gold standard that I have. Sounds simple right? I was thinking an interpolation method to bridge the gaps between the gold standard and the measured data from the images. E.g. if the gold standard data for 5 Newton is 2 mm displacement from its original position (undeformed material), then how many newtons are required to displace the same object at 5 mm from its original position. Something like that.

Can you help with suggestions and ideas please?

The room has a 2.5 Ton AC system (condenser is outside, air handler inside) and I have a 12,000 BTU window unit running and the room is pretty air tight. There are a total of 12 computer exhaust fans (4”, 105 CFM/ea) on the units that exhaust the hot air into a manifold that is then discharged through the ceiling. However, I cannot seem to get the temperature below 72 degrees. I tested the pressure in the room by lighting a candle and cracking the door which drew the smoke into the room giving me the impression that I have negative pressure and I assume it is because of all the exhaust fans. I am assuming that with negative pressure the computers cannot get enough air to properly cool and they are “air starved” which is why the temperature rises. If I shut off all of the AC units and open a window the pressure stabilizes but I have no control over the temperature or the environment.

I have applied to entry level jobs and have not gotten a callback. I have 3.0 GPA from an ABET state university with no in field internships or experience. I do have work experience in retail (working through school). Student loan payments are not crushing me (woooo, FASFA). I have no issue with interviews, but it's getting them to give me interviews. And yes I have gotten my resume checked by 4 different engineers and HR people about what looks good and what does not. 

I am at the point where I have one job offer for a technician and another interview for a different technician job (more on this later). If I take either of those jobs, I plan to still try to get an engineering job within two years. I am planning to take the FE exam in those two years to offset the lapse in working with engineering stuff. I also would get my Ham Radio license to learn more about circuits (I am a ME). I feel like a year or two in either job is better than more time in a retail setting. Is this a good path to take? Any advice?

Now for the tech jobs. I have one that is in semiconductors and the other is in synthetic diamond manufacturing. The truth is I want to be in aero, but that isn't happening right now with my grades and lack of work experience (let's be real here). The job offer is with the semiconductors while the interview with the diamond manufacturer. I am more interested in the diamond manufacturer because it is a direct placement instead of a contract.

47,Why is PID generally used over a proportional control and a constant?,1570905250," Currently  working with a robot which I want to turn a certain number of degrees —  the angle of the robot is input from a sensor and the power of the  motors is what I output to/control. The goal is to turn the robot as  fast and accurate as possible.

My  current understanding of PID (is it correct?): in my case, only using P  (proportional) will cause the robot to slow down as it gets closer to  the target. Eventually, the error will be too small, and the robot will  stop moving before I reach the target. This is why I (integral) is  needed — after the robot stops moving, the integral will continue to  increase the output value, and the robot will start moving again.  However, this will cause the robot to overshoot the target to compensate  for the time it was stopped. This overshoot eventually corrects itself  (oscillation above and below the target with decreasing amplitude.  Lastly, the adding the D (derivative) diminishes the overshoot, but  slows the entire process.

Based on  this, I think that the reason integral is needed is to prevent the  robot from stopping. However, it adds the problem of overshoot. My  ""solution"" to this is only use proportional term, but if the output power is too little (the robot will not move), the controller will  output the minimum power the robot needs to move. The robot would then  move until it reaches the target, then the motors would shut off. (The  motors would not overshoot/continue to move because it was using the  minimum power, so it should stop right as it reaches the target, not  taking into account the latency of the sensor.)

52,Designing a motorized transfer case shifter,1570898957,"First off, apologies if this is the wrong sub. Just wanted to share the project also see if anyone had advice for it. Sort of a long post coming up with questions scattered throughout, but I would be glad to get any sort of input on the project.

I am designing a motorized transfer case shifter. The transfer case is controlled by a shaft that sits in five different positions over a range of about 90°. Torque required to turn varies by position, but early tests show a maximum of around 12 ft lbs.

Space is a bit tight (shaft is circled in red): [https://i.imgur.com/k93TVWQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/k93TVWQ.jpg)

**Shaft:** Here's a model of the shaft. Total length is \~19 mm with the threaded portion being \~13 mm. Threads are 3/8-24. The notch at the end of the shaft doesn't currently exist, but is planned as an interface with a potentiometer.

[https://i.imgur.com/unMfgqI.png](https://i.imgur.com/unMfgqI.png)

**Gearing:** For the torque required, I was thinking worm gearing would be best, although I'm not at all tied to that. Worm gearing would also have the benefit of helping prevent the transfer case slipping out of position. I've never experienced that problem myself, but have heard of it happened with others. Clearance depends on a few things, but keeping the gear below 60 mm would probably be best.

**Worm Gear:** With that in mind, [this Boston Gear G1043](https://www.bostongear.com/ecatalog?page=product&amp;cid=worm_gears&amp;id=G1043) 30:1 worm gear seems like a good fit. Being bronze, it will wear faster than the worm, but when it becomes worn it can be remounted rotated 180° to double its life. The bore of the gear will have to be drilled out to \~9.5 mm. The hub conveniently is around the same diameter as the base of the shaft (\~19 mm) but it will have to be cut to shorten the overall width of the gear enough to get a nut on the shaft, and it will also have to be cut to fit on the 'key' of the shaft. I don't have the tools for the last part, but I might just carefully cut a channel using an end mill bit in a drill press (don't yell at me too much.)

 [https://i.imgur.com/MVc3m6F.png](https://i.imgur.com/MVc3m6F.png) 

**Cap Nut:** I don't normally like mixing stainless steel fasteners with other metals, but with the relatively sealed environment with some threadlocker applied, I think [this cap nut](https://www.mcmaster.com/92994A331) will work well. A hole will be drilled in the cap so it will act as a sort of guide for the potentiometer shaft.

**Worm:** I'm a bit confused about choosing a worm to match the worm gear. [This is the one](https://www.bostongear.com/ecatalog?page=product&amp;cid=worms&amp;id=LVHB-1) I am currently planning on using. The worm gear has a DP of 16. This worm is 16 DP, but it says the mating gear is 8 DP... I'm not really sure what that difference means.

**Motor:** [This motor](https://www.mcmaster.com/6331K13) seems like it would work well. With a starting torque of 159 in oz, 30:1 gearing, and maybe 20% losses, that gives a max torque of about 20 ft lbs, which should be more than enough. The shaft is a bit shorter than I would like. I'd probably drill a small hole in the shaft to secure the worm to it.

 [https://i.imgur.com/Y0pmIbH.png](https://i.imgur.com/Y0pmIbH.png) 

**Shaft Support:** If there is too much play, I might add a bearing and a free floating shaft that is just short enough to fit while allowing for thermal expansion. I don't really like this idea and am unsure how effective it would be, especially if the it is not rigidly secured to the motor shaft.

 [https://i.imgur.com/fSPt8uH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fSPt8uH.png) 

**Lubrication:** Probably a moly-fortified lithium complex grease for everything but the bearings.

**Potentiometer:** This will be the primary means of preventing damage from incorrect shifting, so I'm okay paying a bit extra for a very reliable part. [This one](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Vishay-Sfernice/P30LL0FLS103KA?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtC25l1F4XBU5W%252BqmBrUt0dNq75HyBEFgA%3D) seems to be a good choice.

**Housing:** 3mm aluminum should be within my ability to work with and braze together. Will probably braze everything except the front face, which will be sealed with RTV and secured with bolts that thread into the back face. Never tapped threads before, so that will be interesting.

 [https://i.imgur.com/nbSmV3L.png](https://i.imgur.com/nbSmV3L.png)

65,"How would you build a system which, triggered by the onset of dementia, will painlessly end your own life?",1570867111,"When I was a teenager, my grandmother suffered through several years of severe decline from dementia, before passing away from failing health. It was a painful process  moving her out her apartment she had lived for decades, and into a home, while she went in and out of periods of coherence and frustration. We comforted her and reasoned with her over and over; every few days, sometimes hours, she had forgotten where she was and who we were, and I can’t imagine how frightening it would be in her shoes.

After a particularly frustrating day, we got in our car to return home. My mom gathered herself for a minute before turning to me and saying “If I ever get like that, just take me out back and shoot me.”

After thinking about it for a moment, I realized some day *I* will be in her position. More than my grandma, a good portion of my family on both sides had a history of severe mental decline somewhere in their mid 80s. I’m not going to want to put *my* children in the position my mother is in now. I want to make sure I can leave this world peacefully, right about when I become a burden on my own family. That’s a pretty fascinating challenge:

How might someone conceive or build some system, which ends your own life peacefully, just before your own mental health declines to the point of being a painful burden to your loved ones?

85,How do you define work/life balance?,1570830456,"So I'm an entry level mechanical engineer, been working as an EIT for over 2 years now. My company is very flexible when it comes to hours worked, but of course us salaried employees have to get at least 40 hours.

Part of my performance evaluation a while ago, my boss indirectly told me that I should be working more than 40 hours. Now I don't think he's a bad boss, but I think I'm being unfairly compared to the senior engineers that regularly work 50-60 hours every week. This being my first job out of college, I didn't want to argue with him about it. 

But the whole time we were having that conversation, I was thinking what the hell. Is 40 hours not enough these days? I'm a young, fairly inexperienced EIT. This means I don't have a ton of responsibilities, i.e. managing projects or leading the design teams on huge projects. So if I'm getting my work done on time &amp; meeting my deadlines, why should I be working more than 40 hours?

Of course, there are days or even weeks when it's crunch time &amp; in the past I've worked over 50 hours before, but that's pretty rare. To me, maintaining a work/life balance is very important - I don't want to drown myself in work just because that was the norm for the previous generation.

87,Advice on a lifting project,1570828681,"Background: A project I am working on involves moving items from the ground floor to an indoor loft. The items range from multiple bicycles to boxes of supplies (generally 21'x21' and 50lbs or less). Currently, these items are carried up a narrow set of stairs, which seems inefficient, but mostly dangerous. so my team is looking for different ways to move the items up and down in a safe and efficient manner. Other general info is that the loft as a 3 foot opening that is blocked off, but could be used and even expanded for use.

I proposed to my team the idea of using a lift that would re-purpose a garage door system to lift a small carriage as a sort of freight elevator, but it has multiple safety and liability concerns that will make it difficult to get off the ground, even with the safety systems and devices that come included in many garage door installations. There is also a concern or properly anchoring the device as we need to avoid using a structural member of the building, so we cant use the ceiling, but the indoor wall on the side of the loft is available.

Another possibility the team proposed was using an electric winch on a trolley that can extend in and out of the loft. It mitigates the safety concern of people falling off the top of the loft while using the lift, but electric winches, at least the ones that have been found, have a problem of lowering items at a safe speed, essentially allowing the load to free fall. 

If it is alright, I ask for advice on finding something that can be a safe alternative to carrying up bicycles and somewhat heavy boxes up a narrow set of stairs. My team and I have had difficulty finding existing options on the market as it seems to be a unique situation. The closest thing we found was a suspended platform used in window washing, but that is much bigger than necessary.
Is there something else we could re-purpose to fit our needs but still be safe to meet, say, OSHA standards?
I hate to ask but my team and I feel stuck and going back and forth between these ideas and others that seem unreasonable in terms of cost, safety, and time, and having advice from professional engineers on what other things that currently exist would be a huge help, as I feel we haven't considered every option.

Constraints include the design having a footprint that fits within a 34'x80' footprint on the ground floor (it can be smaller, just needs to consider safely lifting bicycles and the boxes, but not necessarily at once)
The loft ceiling is curved but it ranges from 90' to 84' from the loft floor.
Generally less than $3000 total (materials and installation)

6,Math Heavy Engineering positions,1570786377,"Hello guys, 

I know that many of you are probably thinking ""here we are again"". I'm sure this has been posted many times, but it's a difficult topic to search for because everytime you put math and engineer in the same phrase you'll get pages and pages of results about the math used in engineering or how difficult the math is in a engineering course and so on and so forth.

So, I'm a physics undergraduate student in Italy. I'm doing quite well grades speaking, however I'm not interested in a career in research. There is this MSc at my university (at the lenght i've got it, it's alrealdy a quite common offer in many universities worldwide) called ""Mathematical Engineering"" that I'm thinking to get into but I'm quite ignorant about the doors that it will open easily (if they exist) and the ones that will be really hard to go through after such a path. So, the question is, are there some very mathematically heavy jobs in engineering that could be a good fit for such a student?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. The course's mandatory exams are the following:

* Real and Functional Analysis 
* Numerical Methods
* Mathematical Physics Models
* Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena 
*  Nonlinear Systems 
*  Computational Fluid Dynamics 
*  Electrodynamics of continuous media

I am developing rough concepts for this and I can either attach the crossbeam using a channel nut like [this one](https://www.unistrut.us/product-details/p1006-thru-p1010) or drill a hole through the strut and stick a bolt through it which attaches to the crossbeam end which is shaped similar to a clevis joint. I'm examining the second option because the crossbeam might be meeting the post at an upwards variable angle and can't use a premade angle fitting, and it's the technique that my company has been using in less critical applications.

In this case, I don't expect the bolt to have to carry much load, maybe 100 lbs for the walkway section and a couple hundred for humans on the walkway, but I've always been wary of using a bolt in pure lateral sheer especially due to the safety considerations.

I've tried to find any information on shearing across bolts but can't find anything. I understand that they are not designed for this purpose but I expected to be able to find something.

Im looking for some thought/guidance on how you guys all organize your dwg library. At the company I just started working for a few months ago, we have a few thousand drawings that are pretty much all over the place. Luckily, we have an excel sheet that lists the detail and drawing number of the part, along with the part name. But they only put in about 400 of those few thousand parts...

Fast forward to me doing some digging around. The past two days I've been trying to figure out how to recreate a master library. Ideally, id still like to use excel since everyone uses it here, and its somewhat easy to work with. I made a document with a few hundred drawings, with columns for the drawing number, part description, and then a column with a hyperlink. So when you find the drawing you want, you can open it up right from excel and not have to do another search in the file explorer for it. This works great.

The issue ive found is that alot of the drawings weren't named consistently. Ti make my process easier ive found that I can use the autocad data extraction tool to pull out information like dwgname, dwgno, file location, and file path, which I use to make the hyperlinks. However, Ive found that the data extraction tool doesnt seem to happy when you try to scan hundreds or thousands of drawings.

Has anyone found a good tool or way to organize their drawings in a manner similar?

36,Adding yaw to ultrawideband positioning system - sensor fusion or beacons for angle detection,1570723999,"Hello everybody, new to reddit and I believe this is the right spot for this question, otherwise I'm sorry.

I have a system of ultra-wideband transcievers (using chips from Decawave) that allows me to de accurate indoor positioning (20mm max deviation when also using the IMU). I'm using this sytem to locate a kind of remote control (eventually I want it to plan routes for an indoor flying drone). The thing is, I also want to know in which direction this remote control is pointing while moving it. To be more precise, I want to know what the spot is that it is pointing at using its inbuild lidar sensor. The angle therefor needs to be pretty precise, as the spot could be several meters away.

Using an IMU I am able to accurately calculate the roll and pitch, but yaw is a problem. A magenetometer on its own is not that accurate too, but using sensor fusion algorithms such as the madgwick algorithm will help of course. But you still have the problem of chasing magnetic fields inside of a room. So as far as I know, there is no 9DOF sensor that allows for reliable yaw detection within 1 degree deviation when moving trough an indoor space. But I would love to be wrong!

So to solve this, I was thinking of ways to integrate the beacons in the orientation algorithm. Possibly using directional antennas, either using the ultra-wideband signal or adding another signal to (some of) the beacons. But I can't seem to find much on this.

40,Medical device engineers- career advice?,1570715674,"Dear medical device engineers, my career is at a crossroads and I need some advice, I hope you can chime in: 

Some context: 
About myself: Live in Singapore which has a rather small medical device industry, but reasonably big pharma one. 

Education: Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering with a specialisation in Biomechanics; Masters of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering. 

Career so far: I've worked for 6 years in Academia, first as a biomechanics researcher in a university hospital and for the last four years as a 3D printing Engineer in a University 3D printing Research Centre, specialising in biomedical 3d printing applications.

Skills: CAD, FEA, some CFD, wide variety of 3d printing and machining experience, some project management and quality systems, IP and contracts. 

Career goals: I'd like to go on to be a design engineer in implants, primarily orthopedics. The possibilities that 3D printing has for custom medical devices also interests me so if there is a crossover between the two that would be the ideal place I'd like to work. Something like a custom implant designer.

The problem: 
I have a year left on my contract at the university, but I feel I've outgrown the place and I don't get as much opportunity to learn anymore- I've become the go-to guy for project management and other administrative stuff like contracts, getting around review and ethics boards, getting grant funding etc, which while important I dont get as much time to practice and develop technical skills and I don't see this changing in the immediate future. However, I've done a good job of securing strong collaborative projects with a leading global implants manufacturer (was the lead engineer for one project) and also kickstarting ISO13485 QMS for my university. There is a strong possibility that the global implants manufacturer will be starting a small scale plant in about a years time. If I remain working on the projects I may be a good candidate for them to hire eventually, but this is a risk. 

On the other hand, I have recently received two other offers: 

1) A leading global pharmaceutical firm is offering a position as a 3D printing engineer. This is not the ideal path I would take- it would be more of a parallel move but to my mind industry experience is useful (medical device and pharma are similar industries) and I think it would give me the chance to grow technically. It would, however, entail me giving up working on the current collaborations with said implant manufacturer. 

2) A metal 3D printer manufacturer is also offering a position as a research engineer into optimisation of 3D printing parameters for production. This is less enticing for me, but is also a chance to grow technically.

Both new offers are offering a significant bump in salary.

41,Help! Calculating stability &amp; amount of tilt (list and trim) of a Barge,1570708576,"I am looking into a project and I have need to use a 2 person manlift that is able to reach 70 feet off the side of the barge to a bridge. I am trying to determine what is the maximum amount of reach we can have before the barge becomes unstable and could potentially overturn the manlift. Here are the inputs that are known:

Assume stability of water from wind and waves as that barge will be stationary and in steady water.

Snap together barge will be used for a total length of 80 feet x 24 feet wide x 4.5 feet deep.

JLG 1850SJ Manlift with weight of 45,000 lbs

The manlift will need to be positioned 2 feet from the front edge of barge in order to achieve the length needed.

JLG recommends only using manlift on barge when list is 1 degree or less

Assume 500 lbs of persons + equipment in manlift + 500 lbs of basket weight = 1000 lb load

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone point me in the right direction here on how to determine the max weight &amp; reach that can be supported before you would get the 1 degree of list?

As a resident of Florida I can very easily get a medical marijuana card but I have not because according to my brief research, it may hinder my eligibility for some jobs. 

From my understanding, because the card is government-issued, a government employer or any employer associated with the government can see that I have the card. From there I suppose another candidate with the same record would be preferred over myself. 

I have not yet tried to get a medical card because of this specifically. I did have a previous drug test that I failed and I was contacted by the medical review officer who asked if I had a card or not, which made me think that I would have passed the screening if I did have the card at the time.

State government because I ""wanted to help people and save the environment"" (such an idiot) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness because I have lots of student loans (no comments please, I know what a mess it is).

In the last 4 or so months I have begun to seriously question if I even want to be an engineer anymore.  I look at my to do list and there is no way I will be able to meet all my deadlines (which are set in out state statute).

I've tried talking to my boss, but she doesn't seem to think my workload is unreasonable, but I'm not sure she really knows how much I have since I don't work in our main office.  

The icing on the cake was an email she forwarded me today from a pissed off engineer who forgot - not once, but twice - to include a wastewater report with his submittal.  To quote said engineer, ""I’ve been working successfully with \[the place I work\] on very similar projects for 18 years now and never have I been treated with such disrespect and utter disinterest.""  All because I denied his file for the very valid reason that he didn't submit a report.  Mind you, this was not the only denial point, but one of nearly 20 on the second round of review.  He also continued with I am ""out of line"" and this is ""unacceptable.""  To be honest, this shitty behavior is pretty much par for the course.  There is no ""professionalism"" when it comes to development and making money.  I get shit like this at least once a month, if not more often, and it almost always reduces me to tears because it feels like a personal attack.

The beginning looks great and everything else is garbage. I've also tried 50-60hz (remove potential noise from powerlines) but that doesn't clean up noise at the beginning.  

&amp;#x200B;

Solutions I've been thinking of:

Chop up the data and apply different filters to different sections of the data. i.e. at 100 mHz to 1 Hz range, I apply a 1 Hz low pass filter to get rid of the noise. 

Do experiments at each Hz interval and filter by test and reconstruct a bode plot piecewise. (seems a lot more time consuming than just putting a swept sine in)

&amp;#x200B;

So how does one obtain a frequency response in industry?

Dear Ms. Reader,

I’m an Environmental Engineer,  and engineering. I have come across Ramboll through friends.

The reason I’m a suitable is that I have qualifications both from acclaimed universities. I had several internships including working in laboratories in another country, collecting samples, working on excel files and scientific reports, data visualization and lake modelling program. What I lack in experience I make up in conscientious, passion for the technical field and desire to learn and solve complex problems..

One thing that makes me stand out as a candidate that is very beneficial to your company is my ability to follow instructions no matter how complicated. That comes from the fact that most of my computer skills are self-taught, same with surfer-8 modelling program. I did very well on book exams during my Master Degree studies. Since I have also worked abroad, and Ramboll does have many projects abroad such as the Waste-water plant in Romania I would be eager to travel to any part of the world. SInce childhood I had passed advanced math and chemistry courses.

Also I did assembled an electric circuit, build a hydraulic toy robot, and assembled Ikea furniture by myself :D",AskEngineers,False,abond0082,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dflr8s/criticize_my_cover_letter_be_brutally_honest/

78,Need advice about joining an electric vehicle racing team/project in undergrad,1570647094,"I'm starting undergrad at an Electrical Engineering faculty and need advice on which student organization/project to join.

The program I'm in is focused on electric vehicles (mostly powertrain - batteries, BMS, power electronics, but also some vehicle autonomy and other programming). My previous experience includes running a 3D printing team at my previous university/student org and published research in Li-ion battery chemistry. I'm interested in both design and fabrication and I think I'd like to get a job in an R&amp;D department of an electric vehicle or subsystems company. 

The teams/projects I'm considering are:

1. a prominent 50-60 person team working on an electric race car (racing in Formula Student and Formula SAE) - they have a rigidly organized and well-funded team (basically a small company complete with a marketing department)
2. a smaller 15-20 person team working on an electric go-kart (racing in e-Kart competition) - they seem more like a family than a company - more freedom to choose your niche, learn in many areas, and work on several things
3. an electric motorcycle team within an established vehicle aerodynamics team - the parent team has a lot of experience but the electric motorcycle sub-team is a brand new project (to be racing in MotoStudent competition), giving an opportunity to learn how to do a project from beginning to end, learn in many areas, and lots of flexibility in the role I could have

All the above have won awards and seem to have good people on the teams. The first one wasn't actively recruiting, but agreed to consider me due to my previous experience. The latter two were very enthusiastic about the possibility of me joining their student org.

I would really appreciate advice on which team/project would be the best to choose. I'm interested in a bunch of stuff and would like to learn a wide range of skills, but I don't know what kind of experience is more important to employers in this area (R&amp;D/ multi-role positions).

From what I understand they maintain the pressure upstream of the valve instead of downstream like a PRV would. 

The only way I can think they work is on a closed loop with a pump which doesn’t have a VSD. So valve is reducing the pressure before the pump knowing that at this reduced pressure it will recirculate after the pump at the upstream setpoint. The purpose being to maintain a consistent pressure drop when a system is bypassing.

22,How to factor for wind load when applying with crane load (ASD)?,1570583878,"I am analyzing a rigid frame that supports a crane beam and am trying to determine the appropriate load combinations. 

From IBC 2015 1605.3.1 Exception 1:

""Crane hook loads need not be combined with roof live load or with more than 3/4 of the snow load or one-half of the wind load.""

In my case, snow load is negligible so I'm left with wind load. The way I interpret the IBC exception, my load case would be 1.0DL + 0.5WL + 1.0(crane load). 

My boss says this is incorrect. He says that wind load mentioned in the exception is actually 0.6WL because wind load always has a 0.6 factor applied. He says this goes back to when the wind speed was increased in ASCE 7-10 and now wind always has a 0.6 factor so the wind load is not really different from ASCE 7-05. (However, he has no documentation to support this interpretation.) Thus, according to him, the load combination would be 1.0DL + 0.5(0.6WL) + 1.0(crane load).

I graduated from engineering 2 years ago with a specialization in water resources engineering and I work in consulting. Lately, I've been feeling pretty un-inspired and unhappy. I'm not sure if its because I am the only woman in the office and often feel lonely and lack a support system or if its because I'm in the wrong role. I enjoy working on the big picture/concept of projects but don't really have a strong interest for spending hours on the detailed designing and modelling aspects. I have been praised by senior management for my strong communication skills like writing, presentations, and coordination; all of which I enjoy doing. I feel like I lack a lot of knowledge related to construction, etc and I don't find myself motivated or interested to learn more about it. As this knowledge is important in this role, it makes me concerned about my potential to advance in the future. 

I'm super confused about how to move forward in my career. Ideally, I would love to work in a role that allows me to still use technical skills but leverage my strong communication skills to advance in the career. Since I'm still pretty early on in my career, I'm open to trying new things and broadening my knowledge. My main questions/concerns:

1. There are only some topics in my major that I actually enjoy learning/working on; this makes it a very narrow search. If I want to go into something that isn't directly related to my major, do I need to go back to school to broaden my knowledge/technical skills or can I leverage my degree?

3. Aside from design, what are other career choices in engineering that might be a good fit (private and/or public)?

2. Would project management be a good fit? If so, does it have to be related to my major or can I potentially branch off and how?

4. Should I transition into business instead and completely stop my progress towards being a professional engineer (P.Eng/PE)? Which roles/industries would be a potential good fit? Do I need to go back to school?

I have 3D scanned and designed all necessary parts to make 1:1 reproduction, and am looking for information on a suitable material substitute to cast in a DIY environment.

looking for information about the casting of the material or how to locate or spec a comparable material or product that would be a good analog or alternative to PU commonly used in footwear.

My hunch is that since this item is in direct contact with moisture, air and water by design, PU is probably not an optimal material to replace the sole with a material in the same family of chemical as the original materials that have all failed. Unless something has changed, PU used in footwear over the last few decades seems to have broad issues with crumbling after contact with humidity in air and given a small amount of time fails and brakes down from normal typical use.

Can anyone lead me in a helpful direction to ask question specifically on the topic of DIY casting and material selection for the above topic?

Any good ideas where to ask around about information on this topic?

Any known forums or user groups on the subject to read?

Are there any knowledgable people on the subject here that perhaps know about the materials used specifically for footwear, and hopefully on alternative analogous materials to PU that could be used in this way in a DIY environment?

Ive graduated in summer 2018 with a master's in mechanical engineering and joined an engineering company in September 2018 as part of a graduate scheme - one year rotating through 4 departments, and then settle into the department that originally hired you.

During this year of rotations, the company went basically to the brink of bankruptcy - which means headcount reductions and thus the department I was supposed to go into told me there's no space.

Now I'm stuck in a rotation I don't care about being given pretty much secretary work and not being able to learn and expand as an engineer while HR are trying to sort out the mess and find me a department to go to.

I've approached various directors and managers but the answer I've been told is always the same - they have no time to train me or no headcount available in their department.

I feel like I'm vasting away not doing anything, not learning anything and becoming more and more un-employable due to no experience being gained.

I'm at a loss at what to do as much the economy isn't great and very few companies are hiring - and those that do will want to likely have someone that gained more experience during their year. Due to shitty managers and bad HR I've gained maybe a maximum of six months work experience during my twelve months at the company.

Do I just stick it out and wait for HR to ""find me a job"" or should I quit before I become completely unemployable?

50,3 year ME at a crossroads between design and stress analysis.,1570549196,"Hello,

I've been quite unhappy at the job I started a year ago because I was told it was a role for design of flight hardware, but it was actually closer procurement/systems engineering. Though I enjoyed my team mattress, it was a very poor fit as far as the job goes.

As a result, I began applying and recently received an offer for a design role at a great company doing ambitious things (imagine being hired to design support equipment for the Saturn V in the 60s).

The kicker is my whining finally got me something at my current company and, about a week ago, a stress analysis manager decided he likes me and let me transfer into his department (imagine being a stress engineer for something like the 747 flight structures when it was first built). 

A month ago I would have been ecstatic to receive and accept the support equipment role. It's a fun ambitious project with a ton of cool factor. But I can't help but feel that getting experience in flight hardware analysis (including composite materials) will open up a lot of doors for me in the future. 

Even though I've typically been a design engineer, I feel that the stress analysis experience is interesting and I enjoy the rigour. If I don't like it in the long term, I believe it will make me a better design engineer and possibly open doors for me to be a design engineer for flight hardware.

Any feedback on whether my assumptions are correct, or advice on how to weigh the pros and cons would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",AskEngineers,False,ProjectWheee,/r/AskEngineers/comments/df1pbk/3_year_me_at_a_crossroads_between_design_and/
51,"Boss taking sole credit for my work, how to approach this?",1570548451,"Background:
I am a new engineer. I had a 'life crisis' and went back to school for an engineering degree. I have a professional business background. I just started (3 months ago) and my new boss really played up being a 'team', and that everyone shares knowledge. Also relevant: I am not actually doing any 'engineering' work. This role is primarily project management.

Current Situation:
I lagged behind after a meeting to do some action items that were assigned to me. While I was sitting there, my boss (Tim) started talking to his boss (John) about an issue that our team is dealing with.
---
Tim: Well I was going back over the spreadsheet, and noticed that....(XYZ). Then I begin looking at (other important documents) and noticed that...(XYZ). I wanted to get this lined out and brought to your attention. I don't the moment to get here and then we aren't ready.

John: Good observation, you are completely right. Let's sit down and talk about it later.
---
Sounds completely innocent; except for the fact that I made the discoveries, I made the argument, and I am the one raising the red flags. I actually entered into a yelling match with my boss trying to explain to him the legal repercussions because according to the documents, we are on the hook.  He fought me 100% of the way until I brought in an individual from the business department that agreed with me.

It started out small with little instances that he would take credit for. I am fairly witty and he has even taken credit for some of my quips.

I wasn't worried about it before, but now I am concerned because I put a lot of work into this issue and was genuinely looking out for the company and our team. I also feel like I could be setting myself up for career sabotage if no one sees that it is my work, and primarily thinks of me as a secretary.

What is the best path forward?

Dear Ms. Reader,

I’m an Environmental Engineer,  and engineering. I have come across Ramboll through friends. 

The reason I consider myself an excellent candidate is my extreme passion for Engineering, technical field and my will to read and expand my knowledge to find solutions to Environmental problems. The reason Ramboll stood out for me is that it collaborates and supervises projects and provide solutions for several challenging environmental problems in various countries. In Rambol I would like to expand my knowledge, expertise and work locally and as an expat in different parts of the world

I’m serious worker, I have been called by my boss as a hard worker, I would love to travel to different countries and work on Environmental Projects. I have good computer skills, math and understanding of physics and chemistry. Therefore, I believe I would make an excellent employee for your firm

Sincerely,

somedude somewhere

This involves my group sending out requests for info and deliverables to these groups. 

My job is basically get a list of requests from my manager and shoot off emails asking for these things. However, most of my emails get ignored. My manager will then advise me to go find the engineers in person and ask for the deliverables. The engineers angrily tell me to go away and that they’re too busy to waste time putting things together to send me.

I’m asking because it would make sense (to me) to stick a small 20KW battery in the car, which is constantly charged by the turbine (turbine would spin at a fairly constant RPM). This way, if you could avoid the usual trouble of slowing down and speeding up constantly that would reduce the efficiency. And as the battery reaches max, the turbine can either come down to a very low RPM but if the driver is too harsh on the gas pedal, the turbine can slowly ramp up to meet the demand, again, without having to either increase or decrease RPM rapidly.",AskEngineers,False,Mr_Ignorant,/r/AskEngineers/comments/denn09/how_feasible_is_a_turbine_engine_in_a_car/

Last week my boss asked me to be thinking about the kind of position I want to fill and to be sure about it so I don’t get stuck doing something no one wants to do.


My choices are pretty much the following: Quality Engineering, manufacturing engineering, or design engineering. 



I’ve been told that Quality can pay super well especially after I get a graduate degree and that it can translate really easily to other industries. I’ve also been told it’s relatively low stress.


The manufacturing position has more to do with assembly stations and developing the manufacturing processes in the plant. I’ve been told it’s easy to get sucked into a technical spot in manufacturing that can pigeonhole me long term and hinder growth potential. Ive also been told this position spends the most time with the plant and the demand for my physical presence at the office will be required more than other positions, especially during times of crisis.


The design side of things has to do with the development of plastic prototypes in autocad software. I’ve been told there isn’t as much demand for someone to fill this position so it could be harder for me to get in, but the work seems very easy and has the highest potential for allowing me to work remotely, which I appreciate.



Is there anything that has been vastly misrepresented? What all should I know about these fields? What was YOUR experience in choosing one of these paths? What would you go back and change about the path you chose?

This is really just a thought experiment at this stage, but I wondered if anyone who is familiar with small, high torque motors might give me some advice on what to Google.

I don't have a lot of physical room to play with; roughly in the 20-40mm\^3 range. I've crudely measured (with a torque wrench) the required torque for a single shift under pedal load, and I reckon it peaks at about 2Nm. Therefore I expect for the size constraints I'm going to need some kind of gearing, ideally built into the motor itself, but I'm open to other approaches.

Obviously this is going to be a closed loop system, with positional information fed back to the control electronics, however I expect this will need to be external to the motor in order to ensure accuracy and avoid drift.

Please correct me if there is a better sub to inquire about this in, but here it goes: I am a design student doing a project on Milk Crates (yes, your standard, injection molded, multi-colored, plastic milk/produce/whatever receptacle). 

There is very little information about the design and form of Milk Crates available on the internet, and so I ask you; why is there so many different variations in the support structure patterns of milk crates. I know this seems like a pointless question but humor me. For example: several of the crates I have documented and studied have an oblong-hexagonal support structure, while others have a diamond or square grid structure. I have found other examples that have octagonal, triangular, and arch supported grid patterns. I know that, practically, they have geometric support structures for added structural integrity and lower material cost—but why is there so much variation between the geometry of the patterns from one crate to the next? If you don't know what I mean, google images of ""Milk Crate Wall"" and you will see the variations side-by-side.

33,Getting back into engineering after 6 years,1570413968,"Hi all,

I graduated back in 2014 in chemical engineering and physics. Long story short, I did well in school but never had any industrial experiences. Just a lot of academic research experiences. After university, I pretty much did everything unrelated to engineering (computational bio, emergency medicine, coding). I'm trying to get back into engineering via any entry level positions but I'm not sure how to go about making myself a competitive applicant after a 6-7 year hiatus. Ideally, I'd like to end up in environmental work. I was thinking about taking the FE to have that on my resume but besides that I'm not sure what else to do. Does anyone have any advice or experience with transitioning back into engineering?

36,"About to graduate, got offered a position with TS/SCI clearance, but I took LSD for the first time a week ago",1570405850,"**TLDR:**

I feel very confident I can justly explain my personal drug use. I'm not concerned about my history with weed (it was very far and in between), I'm mostly concerned with the fact that I did LSD for the first time a week ago. Should I disclose this?

I got extended an offer from one of the big defense contractors in a software role. I am not a habitual drug user, but I have occasionally smoked weed throughout my years, and I have recently taken LSD for the first time. I have my own reasons for having done this, but it wasn't at a party or anything like that. I did it for my own personal exploration and note that this was about a week and a half ago. How do I answer the company's security questionnaire and the upcoming security clearance forms (TS/SCI) from the government?

I have read previous posts on this subreddit that have essentially concluded that they don't care that you smoked weed (maybe not the case for harder drugs). They just want to see that you don't have any skeletons in the closest that can be used to blackmail you for confidential information. 

I understand all of this is very contingent on my investigator and what they think of me. I guess my question comes down to: Should I disclose this information, or keep it to myself?

40,Is it possible to 'filter out' water - selectively capturing gas and vapor - from below-ground tubing,1570391498,"Once a year, my team at work samples and analyzes the soil gas generated by below-ground contaminates, 80 or so feet beneath a facility (unnamed).

 In most cases the process is effective - a canister under vacuum is connected to plastic tube buried to a specific depth (lets say 80') below ground, the negative pressure draws soil gas into the canister within a several hour time-interval, and then sealed. The canister will collect water vapor and other gasses fine - but for a variety of reasons the sample cannot be collected if liquid water is pulled into the canister. 

However in some cases this hapens - the tubing pulls water into the canister as well. This may happen because the ground water level has risen, or the amount of vacuum generated by the canister is high enough for water to migrate from unsaturated soils into the tubing (it is not from condensation in the tubing). 

Is there any way to 'filter' out this free water in the line, without compromising the composition of extracted gasses? I've considered descants and selectively permeable membranes, but they would likely affect the sample composition.

I love to travel so that was the draw to this job coming right out of college. However, now I'm starting to feel that this job is more a technician job and not a true engineering job.

Basically, I go to customer sites with their systems already in place and my job is to babysit an installation, install software or troubleshoot an issue by referencing tech support or documentation. There is not too much ""thinking"" involved. If we are not at customer site, the expectation is that we help out with technical support but we do not have any access to hardware like main tech support people.

I'm starting a project using 2 DC motors, and I wanted to know how I'd go about controlling them. Specifically, the project has 5 main steps (in sequence):

1. The first motor rotates for x number of rotations
2. The second motor rotates for y number of rotations
3. The first motor rotates for x number of rotations
4. The second motor rotates for 2y number of rotations in the opposite direction
5. The first motor rotates for x number of rotations

x and y are variables that I need to define, but those are dependent on whatever gear ratio I end up using

So, what kind of equipment would I need and what tutorials should I watch to make this happen? I've never worked with actually controlling motors before, as I'm very new to the hobby of building robots, and I've only ever just directly powered motors before.

For my motors, I was just going to use some extras that I had lying around from a previous build because I need a lot of torque.

88,Is it worth my time post-BSME graduation doing work as a logistician/provisioner?,1570282381,"Throwaway account.

I use logistician/provisioner to describe the work of receiving blueprints/schematics from the actual builders/manufactureer of a machine and then determining which sub components on those machines will be something that can be maintenanced/fixed instead of having to purchase/reinstall an entirely new sub component. There isn't ANY stress calculations being done, no safety factor determining, no calculations of any kind, ie no design work. I'm not sure if those job titles are accurate in this case. Correct me if I'm wrong.   

I recently graduated this past May with a BSME degree and wasn't really getting positive responses 2.68/E.I.T. (I got a lot of ""we're sorry to inform you but"") to any of my job applications aside from a few staffing agencies contacting me. Eventually I got asked to interview at a large, nationally recognized (USA), company and said yes because at that point I just wanted to work doing something. I get the job, and it pays competitive entry level ME salary for my area, I get a low level sec clearance, I get the title 'Mechanical Engineer', within 3-4 years I could be making just shy of 80k/year and it has really good benefits overall. All of that sounds amazing to me, however I don't use ANY of the math, physics, or engineering theory I was taught in school which is kind of a gut punch because I genuinely enjoyed that sort of problem solving and math/physics application I was doing in school and would like to do work where it's needed. I don't mind toughing it out and just dealing with the job for now to learn as much as I can from it and to keep looking at the salary/benefits silver lining aspect. 

However I'm worried that if I work a few years at this job future employers that actually need a mechanical engineer who's capable of applying engineering principles etc are going to pass over me for someone of comparable time in an industry but actually did design type calculation/work and/or someone who has more relevant/recent experience.

96,Diffusing LED light in 3d-printed PLA plastic,1570268338,"**Goal**

I'm  learning about 3d printing and various engineering techniques, and  trying to create a hollow cube (maybe 6-7 inches external measurement,  approx 1cm wall thickness) which lights up, as consistently as possible.

**Tried**

What  I've done thus far is to design the cube and carve out spaces for 2x  LEDs within each the wall of each face, where the LEDs naturally and  snugly fit.

With 3d printing,  there's a choice of ""infill pattern"" (internal structure) to the walls.  I've tried a default 2d honeycomb (which extends in one axis but not  others, so isn't consistent), a 3d cubic pattern, an entirely 100% solid  pattern and a randomised line pattern which rotates at a random angle  about the vertical axis as each layer is printed.

**Problem**

The problem I'm facing is that there are still very obviously two ""point"" lights per face.

The  ""solid"" infill attenuates the brightness far too much (even with  ""transparent"" PLA - which is only really a little more translucent than  ""white"" PLA). The 3d cubic pattern works well, but doesn't  distribute/diffuse the light much.

**Solutions?**

I've  found a few basic resources around total internal reflection, and light  pipes, but the material I'm using really isn't like flawless  transparent plastic or glass.

Other thoughts:

* The  further the source is from the target, the more gradual the gradient  will be I think: so move the LEDs out of the walls somehow? - though I'm  also looking to maximise brightness.
* Maybe the LEDs shouldn't point outwards, but into the internal structure some other way?

I'm  not sure what to do to learn more or come up with other experiments to  try! I really don't know what I don't know, if you see what I mean.

(I wasn't sure a of the best place to ask this, if there is another perhaps someone could point me in the right direction?)

Then we proceed to give \[0, 1\] and keep the motor running till future commands are sent. **The problem is**, when we would like to stop the motor and send \[0, 0\] to the Motor Control Center (MCC), they cannot receive this change and stay at \[0, 1\].

19,Negative push back after co-worker decides to leave,1570198290,"So we have this new-ish person in our section. They are doing a ""rotation"" in our thermal analysis group for 6 months and have made it to about 5 months. They did another 6 month rotation elsewhere prior.  We had planned to offer them a position, but they came to me a few weeks back talking about how another company is interested in giving them an offer. After speaking with them at length, I don't have much of a reason to deter their decision. In my mind, they are getting a promotion, raise, and shorter commute with a similar industry and scope. To get the same salary at my current employer, they would like have to work at least a year. 

My issue comes when they were talking to the department manager about their decision. They mentioned they had spoken with me, their mentor, about this decision. So now the department manager and general manager are breathing down my neck to change their mind and dislike that I told them I don't think I can without false promises or lying. They countered with, ""You're their mentor. It is really your responsibility to persuade them that this is a better decision, especially after the two rotations we have put into this candidate"". So, what I am reading from this, is to pressure my mentee into thinking they owe us and convince them to stay. I am ethically and fundamentally against this, so I told them I would only give them my opinion about potential career growth and different paths available. I work for a huge employer, so the growths and paths available are truly abundant. 

Any of you had a situation similar to this? How do you think I handled it? Is this common for employers, because it seems to me it would just breed discontent amongst those affected. This would not only cause them to leave eventually anyway, but dislike/speak negatively about the employer anyway. They may be a bit rough around the edges about this because our group has needed people and wasn't able to find them, so we have been training them and this employee is a good one.",AskEngineers,False,dreadknot65,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dd7w3o/negative_push_back_after_coworker_decides_to_leave/

22,"Is there a job I can get where I do ""full cycle"" electronics design?",1570189436,"Hi!

I'm currently a first-year grad student in aerospace engineering. There have now been a few times where my research lab has needed a custom circuit to do a thing, and I did the full process of it, and I really really enjoyed it. I mean the whole thing. Hunting on digikey for parts, using Eagle to make a schematic, then a board layout, then putting in all the traces, then sending the design off to China, then assembling the boards, then probing with a multimeter and debugging whatever issues come up. It's all extremely enjoyable for me.

I feel like in the ""real world"", these are, like, three separate jobs. Usually a person will design a board layout, then send the design out, never to be seen again, unless someone says ""we need a new revision"". Is that the case?

I think the big thing I enjoy about this is that it all feels extremely practical. I need to design this board so that I can assemble it so that I can give it to someone and say ""here you go, it works!"". I want a job where I can be the one holding the soldering iron. I don't want my whole life to be ""theoretical design"", where my board files are sent to someone else to assemble, but I also don't want to be making someone else's designs. I get a huge amount of enjoyment out of doing the whole process. 

Also, if it matters, all my understanding of electronics is self taught. Even so, I have a real knack for it. At this point I'm ahead of some of my labmates who did EE in undergrad. 

I'm somewhat afraid that after I get a PhD in aerospace engineering (after the bachelors in aerospace also) that nobody will want to hire me to be a ""circuits monkey"", if that makes any sense. There's a lot of dimensions of my feelings that I won't be able to get a job doing this. I really like the prototype-y experience. On top of this board stuff, in the past I've had a good time doing CAD and 3d printing parts for systems. Mixing that in would also be a good time.

For a bit I was thinking toy development at Mattel or something would be cool, but my understanding is that a lot of that stuff is outsourced these days.

Sorry this is a huge ramble by now. I just want a job where I can feel like I'm DOING things every day. It's a very fulfilling thing for me.

I'm from Ontario Canada, currently working in an odor control lab as a formulation chemist and hold a BSc in Chemistry that I obtained in 2018.

Though I did test various things like flow rate, mass change and such, as well as sometimes help the plant to process a little bit more smoother by giving them chemistry suggestions.

46,Begining to feel that my job isn't what it was sold to me as.,1570143935,"Hello all, I wanted to get some feedback on some things at work that are bothering me.

So about 5 months ago I started my first full time job out of school as an engineer. I work for a smaller company (~50 employees) and during my interview I was told I would probably spilt my time pretty evenly working with employees on the shop floor doing inspections, work station design, training new employees on processes, and working in the office on other such things.

Well, shortly into my time there I was asked to help build some of the products we make. No problem, it'll give me a chance to familiarize myself with the process. I quickly became very proficient at it. 

Well, the guy who was assembling these parts quit and I was asked to help build in his absence. No problem. They got a new guy in and he was a bit slow so they asked me to step in an help make parts about one or two days a week. Ok, sure. 

Since that guy was slow and they needed to get parts out, they moved him to another area and got a new guy in to train, and they asked me to train the guy exclusively on the new process I developed after doing some time studies. I've been doing so for about the past two weeks, making sure things were moving fast enough to get what we needed out the door. It isn't really a difficult process and after about half a week the guy was able to build parts on his own. 

Fast forward to today. They need to get parts out in a hurry and they ask me to help out. Ok, sure thing. In about 2.5 hours we crank out 15 parts together which is what they needed to get out. Since we had what we needed, I left to go work on other things. I came back at the end of the day, about 4 hours later, and this guy had built a grand total of 1 part by himself in 4 hours. I ask if he had any issues, he said he had a minor issue, but not one that should have delayed him that significantly. 

I'm beginning to feel like a pattern is emerging that the workers feel they can slack off and just have me come back and bail them out when they need parts to get out. Is this a regular thing at the beginning of your career? Is this something I should be putting up with? Or should I start looking for new work? My boss is the one who asked me to help out, so I don't feel like bringing up the issue to him will help my situation.

Background: I graduated back in May 2019 with an EE BS and a GPA of 3.0. I worked all through college to avoid taking out student loans. As a result, I didn't have free time to work on projects or participate much in clubs. I also don't have any internship or research experience.

I had a phone interview for an entry level hardware engineering this morning that apparently went well enough to get me an in person interview. I was asked to prepare a 10-15 minute presentation on a project I have done that shows my design capabilities.

Based on the questions I was asked in the interview, I don't think any of the few projects I worked on have enough actual circuit design for what they are looking for. During the interview, I was specifically asked about my experience with MatLab, building schematics, simulating circuits, and CAD programs. For qualifications, the job description lists training with one or more of the following: DSP, RF circuit design, analog circuit design, digital electronics design, and FPGA design. Of those, I have introductory knowledge of DSP, analog circuit design, and digital electronics design. The interviewer also said he is looking for a person who is strong with the foundations and eager to learn.

Any suggestions for a short project I could work on at home which shows a strong grasp of the foundations as well as DSP, analog circuit design, and/or digital electronics design?

50,"LED voltage, power supply, and connection questions!",1570136791,"Hello!

I'm pretty new to the world of electrical engineering and I had a few questions regarding the voltage of my LEDs, the power supply I'm using, and the proper way to connect everything. The project that I'm working on is pretty simple, I have a handful of SMD5630 LEDs, and I'm trying to connect them to a 2 x 1.5v AA battery pack.

A few questions concerning what I have so far:

* A battery pack labeled 2x1.5v AA, means that the power output will be 3 volts, right? If not, what is the voltage output? How can I calculate that?
* Looking online, the voltage of the LEDs are about 3 volts, will I be able to connect multiple LEDs to one battery pack? Or will the battery pack provide each LED with 3 volts?
* A lot of projects that are similar to mine are using resistors, where the resistor is connected to one side of the LED and a wire is connected to the other side, with an extra wire connected to the end of the resistor. Will these two wires be my +/- connections to the battery pack? What is a safe way to test the connections?
* Lastly, is there a limit on the number of LEDs I can use while only using one battery pack? Or should I invest in a power supply with high voltage?

Honestly, I got the idea for this project from a lot of those ""DIY Glowing Mushroom Lights"" videos, and while the general overview makes sense, they don't do a great job with specifics, and the slight modifications that I had in mind bring up a lot of questions.

I've  worked in various fields, working around electronics in  some form or  another, whether it was testing, repair, servicing and most recently  design. In my current position, which I've been in for 2 years now, I'm helping design data acquisition systems and writing firmware. I'm  not formally trained in firmware development, my degree was focused on  hardware design,  but my boss encouraged me to take the position.

I  like creating proof of concept designs or bits of code, but I don't  particularly like having to make robust designs that can withstand  whatever is thrown at them. At the end of the day I have no interest in going home diving into the nitty gritty shit, all I wanna do is turn my brain off.

63,Is there anything i can do if management won't invest in (what i deem) essential equipment for our plant?,1570123674,"So i work as a technician in a waste processing plant (aerobic digestion). Although it's a great place to work, there are quite a few things that could be added to it for improvement, some of these are things that really should have been in place from the date of commissioning. 

Our water treatment system (the plant discharges a large quantity of water on a daily basis) is poor. There is an automatic system in place but it has not worked properly ever since the plant was opened, over ten years ago, despite being 'fixed' many times. We're currently treating the water manually via chemical and physical oxidation of the water but our results are inconsistent and we regularly record high levels of hydrogen sulphide in our discharge (and that's the only thing we check). Something like a membrane bioreactor would be fantastic!

There is no thorough analysis done on our exhaust air. We do have an air treatment process (scrubbers and biotrickling filters) which works well - but me alone saying 'it works well' is so unprofessional since quite frankly none of us actually know in detail the composition of the air we treat and the air we emit. All we check for is ammonia, and that's just done at one single point in a day via a single-use detection tube. We could really do with some sort of constant, fixed gas analyser, connected to our SCADA, which gives us a record of the VOC composition and how it varies. Considering the company is extremely vocal on their effect on the environment it's mind-boggling how there is nothing installed to determine if we're doing what we say we are doing, which is emitting pure water vapour. Surely something like this would be required by law too, there are no records of what we emit other than ammonia, and since we're dealing with the breakdown of organic matter we're dealing with a VOC rich gas stream.

There are many other smaller things but those two stand out to me the most. After talking to my supervisors i've been told that it's unlikely that any improvement can be made on these aspects. I feel like management are more concerned with the logistics and finances of just our waste input and output, rather than on the other aspects of the plant that, yes, won't generate money, but are important for the plant's effect on the environment, and could potentially even save money by having to pay less for our water discharge since the water quality would be quite good.

Let's say management don't ever decide to invest in these little things, going forward, is there anything that i can do? I've thought about getting in contact with people further up in the company (that don't work on our site) but i'm reluctant to as i feel like that could do more bad than good - i.e. whistleblowing. I have spent money on my own small handheld equipment (i naturally have an interest in instrumentation) but equipment like this is on another financial level. Are there any organisations who might provide funding for this? (grasping at straws here). 

Environmental and efficiency impacts aside, i'm young and my colleagues are also, we're hungry for the specifics and want to challenge ourselves! It would be great for our own career development too to have more equipment like this on site to work with and understand - a lot of the instrumentation here is either no longer in use, faulty or not required.

75,For those car guys out there- can a MacPherson suspension system have cantilever dampers?,1570090637,"I've been building a project car for a while now and I've been getting inspiration from many different racing styles. I love how Hill climb cars both look and function, but Subaru's gt300 Brz made me think differently about how I wanted to build my project. With it's small Subaru engine, it was able to fit a dual wishbone suspension system in it that had longitudinal push rod (cantilever) dampers. With researching that system a bit I found out it was beneficial in formula racing as well, as it provides a lower center of gravity and ability for more downforce. As of right now, the project cars that I'm working on (I also forgot to mention that they are also Subarus) have independent systems that consist of a coil damper and a control arm (MacPherson?).

It seems within the land footprint of existing power plants, nuclear could scale to provide much more energy since volumetrically it's so compact. For instance, if I had a nuclear submarine with a reactor room that takes up 1/10th of a football field, if I scaled it up to cover the entire field and then made it ten layers deep, I've now vastly increased my power output without dramatically increasing the amount of land I'm using. With new reactor designs and restrictions lifted on reprocessing fuel, the amount of potential radioactive waste and contamination is much reduced.

These reeds are for a bagpipe-like instrument, and they are very sensitive to moisture, so I need to be sure that the air is dry. 

At the moment the setup consists of a compressor, which is hooked up to some pressure valves, which then blows upon the reeds, and I have a piezoelectric sensor to measure the pitch produced.

Moisture will cause the reed to degrade, so I think I need to find some way to pass the air through a desiccant- but I can't think of a way that will maintain pressure, or risk spraying small amounts of desiccant on the reed.

35,Using a new offer from an outside company to change roles in current company?,1569987398," 

Let me preface this by saying that I do not like my current role at the company. I don't feel like I am doing anything exciting, just a bunch of tracking of product, pointless meetings, and constant crap from my manager. I would say that my relationship with my manager has deteriorated since I mentioned I would like to take on other roles outside of the group at my end of the review. They didn't take that too lightly. Ever since then, I have noticed they have been condescending when they speak to me. In addition, at my mid-year review he mentioned that I was not pulling my weight and started naming a laundry list of items I could work on. I am not saying I am perfect so I tried to work on what they said. But nothing seems to change.

So after months of being complacent I had enough and started to look around. Recently got a call from another hiring manager offering me a position, nothing in writing yet.

Here is my dilemma, I have have been networking within the company to see if anyone would let join their team and project. Luckily found manager 2 and manager 3 (they work together) who were willing to help out. To not step on anyone's toes, I got my current manager with manager 2 and 3 to talk about a potential plan for me to work outside our group. However, my current manager was not willing to cooperate and practically turned away manager 2 and 3. Manager 2 ""gave up"" on me due to my current manager not willing to work with his needs. After continuously working to make something happen, I was able to get my current manager and manager 3 to a timeshare plan where I would be 50% on both projects.

So here is where I need some guidance. Before getting the offer from the outside company, manager 3 told me that manager 2 still needs someone. On top of that, the work with manager 3 has been delayed till later this year, so there is still a buffer between when I could with them. So I am still stuck my current role and manager. Would it be unreasonable to tell HR and my current manager that the only way I see myself staying at the company is if I were to transfer out of my department to another? This is so I can be out of the clutches of my current manager. On top of that, that I immediately work with manager 2 (manager 3 said he is willing to speak to them)50% and stay with my current role 50% until the work with manager 3 comes in? The reason I would want to stay with manager 2 and 3 is because their work actually sounds interesting. On top of that, the company would have to match my offer (I know they won't exactly match, but I feel like they should come close).

Or should I call it and leave the company? The work is better but the only thing holding me back is work that I actually want to get into with the other managers.",AskEngineers,False,ven716,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dc4tp0/using_a_new_offer_from_an_outside_company_to/
36,Mechanical PhD research areas,1569986237,"I got my Bachelor's in 2018 and immediately started working in a relatively small but highly specialized and mature aerospace company doing mechanism for satellites. I kind of hate it. When I was in school, I was taking graduate level dynamics courses and applying my noodle to really interesting problems, and that's something I really miss. Instead, I'm filling out ECOs and waiting full days for 1-hour tests I'm not allowed to perform myself to be run. Happily, come May I'll have my loans paid off and will be in a position to look for something more interesting; to that end, I'm thinking about heading back to school for a PhD (applying for next year).

Unfortunately for me, it seems like most of the MechE programs I find are doing one of the following:

\-CFD

\-Nanomaterials

\-Non-nano-materials

\-Biomedical engineering (with an emphasis on the ""bio"" - biomimetic mechanisms would be very cool, but it seems like most of what I find is actually to do with biological processes)

\-Control systems

Now personally, I'd really like to do some work with mechanism design as a terminal research goal - things like [Dr. Atwar's work](http://psdl.engin.umich.edu/research.php) in kinematic flexture mechanisms are AMAZINGLY cool and emblematic of the sort of thing I'd love to work on. But it's proving frustratingly hard to determine who's actually doing it - at least in part because it doesn't seem like the sort of thing that gets sexy grantbux stuffed in its garters from Uncle Sam. I know this sort of research has substantial overlaps with MEMS development and robotics, but again, it's hard to sort out exactly who is doing what, or what they'll be doing in 3 years.

So, my actual question - does anyone have any insight into how I might best find myself a research position in cutting-edge mechanism design? So far I've been approaching the problem by brute-forcing it - I check all the MechE faculty profiles and publications for each university in order. But that's a drag and a half, and I'm pretty sure I'm missing things by going about it in that way.

I ended up choosing engineering because it was my second option, and on the university I applied for, engineering was stronger than computer science education wise.

Months ago, I started a intership as a junior process analyst (is very common for any type of engineer in Brazil work in management). This job is related to production engineering and sometimes i had to automate stuff through coding. I realised the coding part is the one I like the most, so the idea of pursuing a CS/IT cameback to my mind and since then it has been pretty strong. 

I talked with my parents about switching careers and although they ""support"" it, I know they think I lost a lot of time, and to be honest, me too. Now, I have the opportunity to study abroad after I graduate. I want to go to Canada and I can sustain myself for 2 years, but the problem is, bachelor's degree in CS is 4 years. First, I was thinking about getting an associate degree in CS (I know Canada does not have the associate's degree but there is an equivalent which is 2 years long), but after lurking on some subreddits, it seems like a bad choice. Instead, a masters related to CS/IT sounds way better, since is generally 2 years long and it won't be a ""waste of time"".

I want to use aducation as a way to immigrate, because Brazil is not going financially well. Here, Canada is being advertised as in need of IT professionals and even has some programs to encourage people to move there. Are there reallyt oportunities for people who immigrate? What is my best choice?

* 1. Switch careers, go to a public university and get a bachelor's degree in CS. After, get a masters in CS in Canada.
   * Pros: Completely in the IT field. Chance to get a job and immigrate.
   * Cons: Long time to complete. Go through the financial crisis. Maybe won't find a job.
* 2. Switch careers, go to a private university and get a bachelor's degree in CS. Private universities are sometimes better because they have better partnerships for internships. No money left to go to Canada.
   * Pros: Completely in the IT field. Better chance to find a job and survive through the crisis.
   * Cons: Long time to complete. No possible immigration.
* 3. Go to Canada and get a masters in CS with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.
   * Pros: Less time to complete. Chance to get a job and immigrate.
   * Cons: End up in a job that is not so IT related, but still able to code.

For me, 3 seems the best choice, but can you guys give me advice on what master's degree should I pursuit?

58,The 10% Engineers/Advice PLEASE,1569965413,"I am in my last semester of college, graduation with a double major in computer engineering and electrical engineering. To get straight to the point, I have noticed that about 10% of the engineering students I attend school with are not your ""average engineer"", I consider myself in this group. We are very social, love to get to know new people, and are very driven. 

I currently work at one of the largest/oldest companies in the nation (US). I only have 5 co workers that I know of under the age of 35. We got into a conversation about dress code and environment with some older engineers. The older engineers absolutely love the far business casual look (shirts, ties, slacks, leather shoes, etc), whereas us younger engineers love our casual fridays (typical millennial lol) where we wear jeans and a t shirt. The older engineers absolutely love (I can't stress how much they enjoy this) the cubicle environment and lighting lowered, whereas us younger engineers would much rather have an open environment where we could have conversation. Also, most of the older engineers like to take things slow and chill. Whereas us younger engineers want to work hard and kill it (not that the others didn't want to, we just REALLy wanted to).

At first I thought this was just a ""generational thing"", like older people vs younger. Than I started talking to class mates and it seems as though probably 90% of them thought the same thing as my older co workers. Most of my classmates want to find a job in government and live the rest of there life there. On the other hand, us other young engineers want to avoid that at all costs. I would say we look and act more like people in the business school but we are engineers. We want to avoid too much structure in a workplace so we can bloom and kill it.

My question is, are their any jobs out their for us 10%? I would love to have the freedom to work 80 hours in a week if I wanted to and only 30 if I was having a bad week. I almost feel like just graduating then bagging engineering and taking a job in business, probably sales because I love commission based pay.  I am really starting to get nervous that I will fall into the pit and take a cubicle warrior job making 85k the rest of my life. I don't see happiness in that at all.

Before anyone says ""suck it up"" or ""what did you expect as an engineer"". I know what reality holds, but I also know if you look hard enough you can find what you are looking for. I am only 23 years old, I think(and hope) I am young enough to explore my options and find something that will truly make me happy.

59,Question of energy dissipation in a sonicator,1569964373,"Hey guys,

I'm building a sonicator to venture into the black magic world of ultrasonics. I'm doing FEA in Autodesk Inventor and here's what I've got.

[https://imgur.com/a/r49Ym9I](https://imgur.com/a/r49Ym9I)

A sonicator consists of two parts, a horn and a transducer. The transducer is a peizo electric crystal that vibrates when excited with 300V+ (yeah I call the power supply the murder board for a reason) Here the transducer is the conical shaped object on the right, and the horn is the stepped cylinder on the left. I'm happy with my horn design. However the transducer is an off the shelf component that I bought on ~~fleabay~~ Ebay.

The question I'm currently trying to answer is, is it a good idea to reduce the diameter of the transducer. The diameter I'm referring to is the largest one on the part. The upper picture is when the transducer is reduced, and the lower on is when its stock.

I'm an electrical engineering student so forgive me if any of what I say is obvious. All of this is new to me. 

I'm doing a modal frequency analysis in order to find the resonant frequency of the whole system. This means that the maximum amount of energy makes it from the transducer into the tip of the horn. The whole goal of this device is to cause cavitation at the tip(red, narrowest part), so a maximum amount of movement there is desirable. I'm using a 100W transducer, so the amount of energy I can put in is fixed. 

My big question: Would you say that more energy is being dissipated in the body of the version with the reduced diameter transducer. My FEA suggests that there is more movement else where in the body, which would lead me to believe that its dissipating more energy. However the metric for the quality of a horn is its amplification, that is the difference between the displacement of the tip vs the other end of the device. Those are the two labeled displacements. the version with the reduced transducer shows a better amplification than the non-reduced version. But then again if energy is lost to the body of the device there is no point.",AskEngineers,False,Braeden151,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dbzxfk/question_of_energy_dissipation_in_a_sonicator/
60,I have a few questions about GSM antennas,1569963923,"So recently I've been getting interested in antennas mainly for artistic purposes. I had already asked a few questions some time ago but I'm still interested.

As you probably know if you get an AM radio and put it close to a smartphone you can ""listen"" to the packets (or I don't know what they're called, those little *tsch tsch* if that gets the idea) being sent to the tower which I think is super cool. I recorded some stuff like power bricks or TV and I want to make something with them.

So I was wandering if it was possible to do something similar with a GSM antenna. When I walk to school I always pass underneath one and it's pretty close to the sidewalk like 10 meters up and 10 meters away pointing at my direction (actually where I used to work they had one mounted on a railing where you could reach it with your hand but it wasn't GSM, it had the same look to it though). I still haven't tried listening with an AM radio while standing underneath it but, is it possible to pick up something audible with the radio? I know there are those directional meters that also make sounds so I have a general idea of the structure of the noise they make but those things are like 300 bucks. Is there anything cheaper that works? I have an SDR but the quality of the recording is a bit different so I still haven't tried that. Also, any other spots you think could have an interesting sound? My favorite are power bricks because those things sound like demons screaming when you unplug them.

Now this other question is completely unrelated to what I'm doing but out of morbid curiosity, how long do you have to keep your hand on front of your average 4G or 5G antenna to get burned, or do you not get burned? I obviously do not intend to do this, but this thought comes up in my head every time I see an antenna. Like, there's this white box that's blasting microwave radiation into the air and the only safety measure in place is that the antenna is far off the ground so nobody can get to it.

I began thinking of ways to join the pieces of carbon tubing coming together at 90s. I thought a solid hardwood (mahogany) T would be a great option (nice aesthetics, easy for me to shape, strong, takes epoxy well).

I want to drill to a bigger diameter (D), until there is no more corrosion, then manufacture a cylinder and tightly mount it (H7p6) then drill the hole at the original diameter.

so I need to know this maximal (D) bigger diameter, but I don't know where to start. Could you lead me to how to calculate it ?

Thank you so much,
Sincerely.",AskEngineers,False,JeezyEa,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dbtdng/mechanical_help_with_mechanical_calculation/
87,"How do you avoid, or reverse, getting a negative image at work because you've been asked to implement a technology from an external vendor that has a lot of bugs?",1569935738,"This is something that I'm going through. I am in charge of managing the support cases with the vendor to get the vendor to fix these bugs, and I am doing an incredible job, spending a lot of time and being extremely proactive and diligent. I have escalated these cases to their management, locked down access to the one system available for troubleshooting these cases, documented everything in detail, and been in regular contact with our account manager with my manager cc'ed on the emails. The vendor has never seen any of these bugs before, and the process of solving these bugs is by nature extremely time consuming and uncertain. Therefore, the progress on these support cases is extremely slow. Those in management who aren't hands on, who aren't paying enough attention, are responding and behaving as though I am dropping the ball, struggling, and need to grow more as an engineer to be able to meet my duties. This is extremely taxing on me in my work life, consuming so much time, forcing me to explain so many technical details to people who are poor listeners and too hands-off. I dislike managing support cases; I'm a developer not a support engineer. But on top of that, it's a completely thankless job and it's putting a black mark on my name at my company.
