11,Where are the healthy work environments?,1439742595," I'm a bit stuck, and looking for advice from someone with real life experience.  I just enrolled back in school and I keep bouncing between ME and CS.  I'm trying to stick to the rules and not make it a question about what i should major in,  i'm more concerned with what kind of work environments either majors would provide for me once i graduate.  I live in the south east of the USA but am not against re locating.  

Please feel free to correct ANY misconceptions I have about either of these majors.
 
I'll start by saying I am more interested in the subject matter that ME has to offer.  I feel that learning the principles of engineering, physics and different materials will benefit my long list of hobbies and other skills i'm looking to learn in the future( building motorcycles, robotics, metalworking, woodworking, leatherworking, etc.)  but from what i've read and heard online is that a large majority of engineering jobs are not very healthy work environments.  i.e. bad co-workers, long hours, lack of actual design, just sitting at a desk wearing a tie.  (please correct me if i'm mistaken)  but i'm a pretty laid back guy,  have tattoos (that I can cover) a beard, and like to have some fun.  I'm afraid this environment will suck my soul dry!  I know every business is different but I tend to hear a lot more about the negative ones than the positive ones when it comes to engineering roles.  I just want the simple 40 hr. week, with a healthy work environment that I can leave my work at when i go home for the night.  
 
Which brings me to CS,  Idk if people are just trying to make it sound super ""hip"" and a fun environment because theres supposedly a shortage of good programmers?  But the software world sounds like it would be a lot more accepting of casual attire, laid back attitudes, work/life balance, alternative lifestyles, and all around a more fun place to be.  I find CS interesting enough that I could buckle down and learn to love it,  some people have a passion for it so theres gotta be something to it.  And the little bit of coding i have done i've enjoyed, just not on the same level as working with physical objects.  But If it means the possibility of leading to a more fun and exciting career, than CS would be worth it to me.  

TLDR;  I'm more interested in ME but the work/life balance that the software world ""seems"" to offer is what draws me towards that.  
 
Sorry if this topic gets posted a lot,  i've done all the research I can and i've hit somewhat of a dead end.  Any advice will be very much appreciated.  ",AskEngineers,AdviceSponge11,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3h7nk4/where_are_the_healthy_work_environments/

Apologies if this post belongs elsewhere, or is wandering, though I think engineers are the best people to ask. I did read the content guidelines, and wasn't sure if this is toeing the line or not.

I currently work for a large tech company in Silicon Valley. My role is psuedo-technical; I work directly with engineering teams and engineering managers, though I am not an engineer myself and do not have a technical schooling background. My role is more of a support/advisory role - I analyze bug reports for validity/pontential cause, and impact on the site.

For example, someone might report an error message. I would look at logs, stack trace, or http requests or whatever, to understand what might cause that error, and then try to gague how widespread it is or the business impact. Then prioritize that bug with engineering and drive it to resolution.

One of my goals in joining this company was to enhance my technical skillset, since pre-employment with this company, I didn't even use or know SQL; and I have done this to a degree - I am now comfortable navigating unix systems and the terminal, I've written a few tools in Python, can write intermediate SQL/HiveQL queries, and have a pretty decent understanding of RESTful APIs. 

I am interested in further exploring the technical space and strengthening my skills, but I don't know to what end. 

I don't think I'm interested in actually being an engineer, probably because I don't think that this far in my career (graduated undergrad in 2009) I could attain that level of knowledge in an amount of time that would justify that path. (eg. if it takes me 3 years to get to a Jr engineer level, I would feel like I'm regressing my seniority to an extent)

I guess my question is this - what types of other roles are out there, where I can excercise and enhance a technical skillset, that aren't specifically as an engineer?

I do like my current role right now, with some caveats, but I'm trying to project into the future (18 months), and give myself some direction for future goals. Hope that makes sense.

If it was made from EPS (polystyrene) then it would have to be coated with a hard finish which would add to the cost. &amp;nbsp;


If made from plastic then it could probably be done with a plastic which will automatically give the hard shiny finish I want. &amp;nbsp;

36,Extending Tesla range by dividing the battery into two...,1439639974,"Hi Everyone, Ladies and Gentlemen
A few weeks back, I asked guys and gals here whether it would be feasible to divide Tesla batteries into to, have one set power the car while the other rests, then when the other is depleted to its minimum allowable depletion, the car's computer automatically switches and draws power from the one that was resting, connects the alternators and begins charging the depleted battery. I had thought alternators have no resistance or forces opposing motion whatsoever when connected to the wheels, generating current to charge batteries. Engineers here dispelled that myth and proved that when current is connected to the alternator, there are EMF forces that would have a force opposing motion so to speak, in turn draining more power from the batteries than the generators would be generating hence inefficiency. One even said its tantamount to driving the car with the hand brake on. We spoke about regenerative braking too which extends range but not very much.
Since EMF forces are the problem here causing inefficiencies, as engineers, I bring in Fluid mechanics or let me say hydraulic systems.(little force huge load think brake fluid car brakes)
Wouldn't a device that is powered by the wheels, that requires negligible force from the spinning of the wheels to move because its powering a hydraulic system designed to lower the effect of the alternator EMF or make the alternator's EMF negligible by design to charge the batteries then make it feasible for the Tesla to divide its batteries into two, use one until its depleted, connect the other and charge the depleted battery with this hydraulics (fluid mechanics device) powered by spinning alternators with negligible drag to the wheels?

70,Would it be possible to use the ground effect principle for personal transportation?,1439535576,"I was watching a documentary about the Soviet ""Ekranoplan"" of the 1970's. It used a bubble of high pressure air to gain lift and float just over the surface of the water, enabling it to deliver its payloads at high speeds. One of the reasons it failed was due to turbulent air from the ocean surface disrupting the air bubble, thus causing unstable flight.

But I had a thought: assuming you drive over a relatively even and unchanging surface (roads), this turbulent air could be either reduced or, with modern control electronics, entirely eliminated and actively compensated for. This would change the limiting factors of efficiency and speed of the vehicle to one partly of aerodynamics, and partly of power/weight. Since there is no direct mechanical link from the engine to the road owing to the vehicle floating on a bubble of air, gas turbines would have to be used.

The form factor of the vehicle would be about as large as a heavy motorcycle. The basic idea is to have the turbine constantly turning at a high RPM, and using passing excess heat through a system of recuperators to preheat more incoming fuel, increasing thermal efficiency. The cold side of the recuperators, while still relatively warm, could have their air forced downward toward the pavement through the exhaust, thus generating the bubble of air to support the vehicle and its driver at a dead stop. Not only would this prevent aerodynamic stall at slow speeds, but it would be an increased safety factor: cars behind you need not worry about their front bumpers being melted off.

When moving forward at medium to high cruising speeds, aerodynamic surfaces on the bottom and sides of the vehicle would generate the vortices necessary for the bubble of air to remain under the vehicle and not collapse. The majority of thrust would then be forced out the back of the vehicle, providing forward movement. To handle deceleration, airbrake surfaces which flare outward in use can quickly bring the vehicle to a slower and safer speed, while control electronics redirect the exhaust to the vents under the recuperators. When parked, the vehicle's kickstand would extend downward from the bottom, such that the vehicle would be resting on them.

It has many practical applications. A state police officer could use one of these vehicles in hot pursuit of a fleeing criminal, while not running the risk of running over friendly spike strips. A paramedic could use it to rush to the scene of an accident and start treatment on the injured before the ambulance units arrive. A tourist could use the vehicle's blistering speed to quickly traverse vast stretches of open desert road.

73,How can an ice-cream bucket recharger be constructed effectively by using household items? (details included),1439504894,"I am the proud owner of an ice-cream machine.  Instead of requiring ice and salt to operate, the bucket has thick walls which contain a liquid solution that must be frozen beforehand.  The ""freezer bucket"" lives in my freezer because I don't always know 24 hours before I want to use it.

My unit looks very much like this:  
http://www.cuisinart.com/products/ice_cream/ice-21.html  
(It might actually be this model, but I'm too lazy to go check.)

This setup has advantages, and disadvantages.  For instance, It takes up space in the freezer, and can only be used to make one batch a day.  I've had a number of events where I've needed to bring home-churned ice-cream in excess of 1.5 quarts (private events, I don't do this for money).  This has necessitated doing a batch a day for several days.  Also, I'd like to be able to bring the machine with me to events, and churn a batch on-site.  (can't let the bucket thaw even slightly in transit)

I have a few routes I could go.  I could buy a second freezer bucket, but that takes up twice as much space in the freezer, and doesn't help me when traveling across town.  I could buy a machine with a condenser (expensive), I could buy a machine that takes ice and salt (messy, and I'm trying to avoid spending even that much - but thinking about it)... Or I could make a glorified ice-pack to fit into my freezer bucket.

-----

It's this last option that I'm inquiring about.  If I were to make a bucket ""recharger"" (basically an ice-pack to fit inside the bucket), how would I do so in a way that would be inexpensive, effective, and non-toxic (or minimally toxic)?

I do have access to a home vacuum sealer.  So far, I haven't been able to find anything online better than 1 part rubbing alcohol and 2 parts water.  There are other home-made ice-pack designs, but I'm not trying to be gentle on skin.    I want to cool as much as possible, as fast as possible, for as long as possible. 

If I understand correctly, the very high specific heat capacity of water is hard to beat.  I don't know anything about rate of heat transfer, or any such thing.  This needs to be somewhat malleable on the outside, to attain good contact with the inside of the bucket, but can otherwise be rigid.  The shape will be consistent.  Multiple layers, multiple materials, solid items, etc are all viable, so long as it doesn't get expensive, or hard to obtain.  (a replacement bucket is $30, so less than that... preferably much less)

For instance: Would an outer layer of something like steel wool soaked in alcohol/water improve rate of heat transference?  I'm not saying this would work, but it's the sort of thing that I'm hoping you geniuses can cook up.  Should there be a solid ice core, or would it be better to have alcohol slush throughout?

Also, I'm unsure how long the bucket would need to sit in the freezer with the recharger in place before it would be good for another batch.  Any guesses?  An hour?  5 hours? 12?  I'll find out by experience, but having realistic expectations would be convenient.  (I try not to let the bucket completely thaw during cleaning if I have another batch to do, but most thawing is unavoidable.)

74,CFD crash course,1439504457,"I decided to go and talk with one of the professors at my university who specializes in CFD to see if he could use some help with research. Turns out he has no problem bringing me on to help out with one of the projects he's taking on this year. He says he's got an MS student as well as a Capstone design team also helping out but that it would be a great way for me to make some contributions and get my feet wet. My only problem is that I really have no idea what the hell he was talking about today when he started explaining the project to me. Slight language barrier aside I realized that the total extent of my knowledge is limited to the fact that CFD is just a way to utilize computers to simulate flow. He started talking about adding boundary layers and optimizing frequency at atomic levels and I started to wonder what I had gotten myself into. 

I am coming into my junior year of mech eng. and will just now be taking fluids, dynamics, and thermo. Aside from the knowledge gained from these classes I was hoping you all might have some additional resources you could recommend I utilize to make myself a contributing member of the team.

10,Regarding resignation notice,1439403461,"Hi guys -- I'll try to keep this as concise as possible.

**[details removed and replaced per suggestion with the following]**

&gt;For reasons I'd rather not divulge due to anonymity concerns, I'm being seen as the only expert on a few specific aspects in my company's operations in the US 

About 4 months ago, my significant other and I decided that we wanted to move across the country.  So the plan was we would both quit our jobs near the end of this year.  I felt OK with this, as my new work was developing something that I knew would be finished by the time I left.  

The problem is, yesterday, my chief engineer informed me that we are kicking off a new project, and due to my ""expertise"", he wants me to manage some people and be the technical lead on a big portion of this project.  I was flattered, my manager said he was so proud, and all that -- truly something that I should be ecstatic about, but I only felt a huge internal conflict, of course.  I then had a meeting today with a bunch of managers where basically the next 2-3 years were mapped out and how my role would be in those aspects. 

So, I think you can see my dilemma already.  Everyone that has quit since I've worked here has always given 2 weeks notice, and that's all.  On the one hand, I would feel really bad to get really deep into this project, and then, in 4 months, I tell them I'm quitting with only 2 weeks notice.  But on the other hand, if I tell them right now that I plan to quit in 4 months, are they just going to force me to resign right then?  Does anybody have any experience with something like that? Am I thinking too much into this and perhaps I'm having a bit too much hubris?  I'm feeling very conflicted at the moment, and I'm unsure how to proceed.

I did and the same salary expectation question came up and I this time I told her I will have to do some research first, since this position is in Colorado and a higher cost of living than where I currently live. I checked glasdoor and the average salary for that position says $87,000. The thing is I only have one year of experience so I'm afraid to ask for that much. Electrical engineer.

19,Designing a City from Scratch (pt2): Energy Considerations; Solar else if (?,1439367530,"Hopefully this can be a short series of questions related to ideal utilities and transportation (industrial and personal). 

-------------------

In part 1: Internet Utility: We more-or-less-collectively decided that the simplest all-round solution for internet across a 10km diameter desert island was cell towers. 

Cell towers would first involve only stringing fibre between ~4 LTE towers towers to completely cover a barren version. In extremely density the new 5G towers can do 10gbps  (Samsung has claimed up to 20gbps), and one could be placed in the centre of each skyscraper. In example, the world's tallest residential skyscraper (worse case scenario) with all apartments streaming movies (~100 of them), each might have only ~50mbps (for reference, 4k resolution from Netflix requires 15mbps). In a rural area, someone might get the full 5gbps for themselves. For extreme use scenarios such as a server farm, fibre to point would be done.

------------------

For part 2: We look at energy for our 10km diameter desert island. 

Let's assume two things. 

1. Everything is electrically powered. Cars, appliances, HVAC, rollerskates, watches, etc. (this simplifies things)

2. Power must be carbonless, but can otherwise be anything. OTEC, wind, solar, tidal, etc. 

And there are two goals:

1. We need to know the average annual energy use assuming US/EU averages of an individual who uses electric everything (most data does not include stoves, heat, cars)

2. We need to know how to store energy throughout a worst-case-scenario series of overcast/windless days, and consider this against solar or wind for example.

24,Can I seriously make this much money?!,1439340608,"Hey all,

I will be graduating with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering in December. 

I'll be looking for jobs in Colorado, and all the websites I look at for salaries (salaries1.com, payscale.com, glassdoor.com, BLS, etc.) seem to agree that the median salary for an entry level position for a BSME, in Colorado,  is worth between 58k and 62k a year.

When I see numbers like that, it boggles my mind, and I think I must be missing something.

Are these numbers even based on working 40 hrs a week? Or is it more like 60 hours? 

How do I know what a reasonable offer would be, compared to the average, from a company wanting me to work 40 hrs, vs. a company wanting me to work 60 hrs? Or even a company that wants to pay hourly?

Also, should things like Formula SAE experience,  having novel projects that are patent worthy, and managerial experience typically make me worth a bit more?

How do I even gauge such a thing?

25,Mechanical engineering graduate job choices.,1439337364,"I have a couple of job application going through and currently have two jobs on the radar. 

The first job is for a project management role and seems to be ideal. It's an 18 month graduate scheme with a lot of people vying for it. The job role is to work in manufacturing fuel tanks for cars and trucks. They rotate between 3 plants over an 18 month period in which finally they offer a permanent position at one of the plants. 

The second job role is in the poultry industry. Where it is in manufacturing and repairs. 

My conundrum is this. The poultry industry job seems more positive about the potential for a job but the contract they are offering is for 3 years which I find to be a long period of time with a role I am unsure of.

I don't know if negotiating the length of the contract is a good thing to bring up and whether it's reasonable for jobs to ask for that length of contract. 

Also if hypothetically I wish to move to another company which doesn't do food handling will that be a possibility or would I most likely end up working within this industry?

The area I am in is not suited for a young engineer like myself and I need to explore other options.  I had a very hard time finding a job in the beginning of my career and took the first opportunity that presented itself with an offer.  I did this because I needed the engineering experience and some cash to start paying my bills.  The job has been great to me.

I am a year out of college and have been with my company almost two years (first year as an intern). I have my BS in Industrial Engineering and am working on my Master's, the company is reimbursing me 80% of tuition.

When I first started working here there were a lot of fires to put out which kept me pretty busy.This lead to me being handed a job offer on my last day as an intern, which I took,didn't even look around cause I knew I wanted my Masters and I thought having a job that paid well while still in school plus the tuition reimbursement was a no brainier. I love what I do (did), but about four months ago my boss was promoted to Operation Manager of the DC and had to reassign me to another Manager. I like my new manager, he is a great guy and very intelligent, but he doesn't really know what I do/ what I should be doing.  Over the last four months my work load has diminished a lot, to the point where I probably spend more than half my day doing nothing but surfing the web, listening to podcasts. I have talked  to my boss getting more work or if he needs me to look into anything and nothing comes out of those conversations. My old boss told me when he got his promotion that even though he had to technically give me up he wanted me to come to him with my ideas because he didn't think the new manager would understand everything I was trying to do ( which kind of threw up a red flag at that point). With his promotion though he doesn't have much time to talk about ways of potentially improving departments/ our cost per unit. I have been given some admin responsibilities but they don't really mean much besides taking care of some paper work once or twice a week. I also have been promoted to have Admin rights to our WMS system to fix issues when the come up but that also with the increase in responsibility is still a task that maybe one gets used maybe once a week.

The issue I'm dealing with is that I feel like I am cheating the company and myself by not really doing anything.  Don't get me wrong I still have ideas for improving my DC but my new manager/ the other shift managers aren't as motivated to rock the boat and change things. Our DC has the lowest cost per unit in our company so its not like the DC is in bad shape and when compared to other companies' DCs it is by far the best (I have toured a couple DCs for my BS and MS). I have also met resistance in the form of busy work which has stopped me from actively pushing ideas out to the managers.

Sorry for the wall of text ,I feel like I'm rambling, I just don't really know what to do anymore. My days are becoming long and drawn out. I'm basically watching the clock to see when it is time to leave.

(No current. static and dynamic friction, as well as viscous damping using my very custom, and very expensive, motor test setup).

I continually find that motors with higher cogging forces also have a higher average friction for a given RPM and for a given diameter and for a given stack size. Note that a larger diameter motor typically results in larger frictional forces, so I have to control for that. Also, I am not looking at the peak cogging torque. I am looking at its average.

When I ask the motor manufacturers this (I am talking directly to the design engineers), they can't (won't?) provide an explanation. Most of these engineers specialize in one type of motor, and they don't compare to other manufacturers. Either they don't know,  they are hiding something, or I am missing something...

I have even taken a motor with the same class of bearings, upgraded the magnetics, and measured the friction. I get higher cogging as well as higher friction forces.

39,New hire fairness,1439297567,"Question for all of you.  I graduated with my BSME in may this year with a 3.7 and other honors.  I interned with a company for 3 years, and eventually accepted a full time position there after i graduate.  Now i knew their salary was lower, but figured with my experience there, and they liked me so i could get a little extra than their typical starting salary.  Someone who graduated with me, from my school, who had identical grades, all the same tech electives, and no intern experience whatsoever.  He is getting almost $5k more a year than me.  I normally am not one to complain, but is this fair?  Money isn't everything, but I've done a lot for this company, turning down other offers, and i love the workers, bosses, and the job.   I just don't see how that big of a gap is fair.  Am i just being whiny, or is this normal?

Edit: thanks for all the help!  When my yearly review comes around i will most definitely try and negotiate as high of a raise as i can.   I enjoy the work im doing, and it is the field i want, so i don't want to move without giving them a chance.

40,Problems with my homemade metal melter,1439286219,"First I saw [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCrqLlz8Ee0) movie about how to make a metal melter, first I made one with a single transformer, but I was thinking of getting some more power,

So I got two more transformers and connected everything like [This.](http://imgur.com/a/Q3cVe)

Now my problem is the when using just one I melted nails, screws and everything similar but now that I assembled all 3 they are just strong enought to get the nails to glow, not melt.

When I connect the transformers to whatever I am going to melt I connect the L1 to the left and the L2 to the right.

Any suggestions on what the problem might be?

41,vacuum Impeller design(?) and pneumatics,1439283189,"Hey folks, two sort of linked questions:

This is for a robot with a pneumatic actuator,  I'm looking to use a vacuum impeller to help anchor it to the ground (powered by a brushless motor probably), I also had the idea that I could exhaust one side of the actuator to this reduced pressure zone to increase its actuation speed without increasing system pressure (though i'd lose downforce for a moment).

So: questions!

1.  I've seen various impeller designs (GIS), some shaped like cones, some shaped like turbines, some are flat and have fins on the outside, I'm not really sure what type would be best for my purposes (and be tolerant of dust and shit being sucked into it though i'll clean it regularly if needed)

2. to go with the cylinder, it accepts gas from the side, it seems to me that a better way  of supply gas would be from the back face of it, with more room for a larger opening and applying more even force to the piston, im guessing its not done this way because the force that is on the part is probably lessened along the corners, is that right or is it just this way for ease of mounting?

47,Company low balled me an offer and then freaked out when I declined.,1439249673,"Sorry for the throw away but I don't want people to be able to identify me.

The situation is a bit more complicated than the title lets on. I'm a mechanical engineer and I graduated in 2013 and started working in the auto industry. I have a fair amount of responsibility for someone my age, I am the only mechanical on one of the very high volume programs and I was even given my own summer intern to be in charge of this year. 

About a month ago my boss gathered all the other mechanical engineers in our group and informs us that all of the current programs for they type of product my division makes are going to be have their mechanical and electrical responsibilities transferred to the companies engineering facility in mexico. He also said he was told that there ""was no money in the budget for restructuring"". Or whatever that was supposed to mean. He seemed to be almost as taken by surprise and in the dark about it as I was. He said he would do his best to get us positions somewhere else in the company, that was not very comforting.

I went ahead and put my resume up on indeed that night and for the next 3 days got like 5 recruiters calling me or emailing me per day. It got to the point where I had to pull my resume off because it was getting hard to keep track of who was who. I ended up following through with one of the recruiters for a position that was basically identical to what I am doing now. Within the span of a 2 weeks from when I found out about , well whatever it is they want to call what they were doing to my division, I had an offer sitting on the table from this other company. I interviewed on Friday and they literally gave me an offer Monday morning. 

Initially during the recruiting process I had asked for about a 15% raise. They came back with an offer that gave me a 2.5% raise with a signing  bonus that would make total compensation for the first year 9.5%. They also have 20 days of vacation for first year employees and I only get about 12 at my current place of employment. 

Overall the offer was not that awful, it could have been better, but my current manager came through with a really cool job that would really put me on the cutting edge of where things are going. This is something that is probably going to end up in many next gen autonomous cars so it is pretty exciting to be able to work on. Last Friday I met with the chief engineer on the project and we basically ended the conversation with him saying that he is going to talk with HR and see what the next steps are to get me going.

With renewed confidence in my position at my company as well as the prospect of this new exciting position I called up the other company's HR rep and left a message that I would not be able to accept the position, I also called the recruiter and told him the news. The recruiter called me back and basically tried to get from me what exactly it was that I needed before I would say yes. I told him that I was not prepared to give an exact answer but I would entertain another offer if they wanted to try again. Not 20 minuets later I get a call from their HR department wanting to talk to me. I let it go to voice mail.

I guess I want to know what some of you with more experiance would do in my position. Work on the really cool product and probably get a 4-5% raise each year, or hold out with this other company you already told no and try to get more money out of them while working on the status quo. 

**tldr:**  My job prospects weren't looking great and I started looking around. My current company ended up lining me up with a really cool product but a competitor gave me an offer and seems fairly desperate.

I am a performing mentalist outside of my regular job. (I'm a chemistry teacher in a highschool in belgium)
For a long time now I've been making Magic Squares and doing the knights tour on stage. For years I've  been playing with the idea of combining the two. I know that somewhere in 2005, the ""magic knight's tour"" has been proven impossible. The Semi-magic knights tour however is very possible.

Here's what I'm trying to do. I wanna call out 2 spectators on stage and have SpecA cross out the numbers as I call them out while performing the knights tour. SpecB writes down the numbers on a blank 8 x 8 square starting from the top left corner. When all numbers are crossed out and SpecB has filled in the blank square, I want the former blank square to be turned into a magic or semi-magic square. 

When I came up with the idea it seemed a very nice mental feat. but I've really been busting my head on this one, I have made at least over 50-60 squares and I just can't get it right. At first I thought it was just a matter of time before I found a sequence that would work but now I think it's impossible.

I am getting confused about all these pressure changes and how they affect the system. I guess my Thermodynamics understanding is miserable.

Could you talk me through?


This is how I understand it, notes I took from A Working Guide to Process Equipment (Lieberman) 3rd Ed - McGrawHill (2008)  - an amazing book btw:

    	1. High-pressure motive steam enters through a steam nozzle.
    	2. As the steam flows through this nozzle, its velocity greatly increases.
    	3. As the high-velocity steam enters the mixing chamber, it produces an extremely low pressure. 
    	4. The gas flows from the jet suction nozzle and into the low-pressure mixing chamber.
    	5. The rest of the jet is used to boost the gas from the mixing chamber towards the higher pressure in the condenser.
    	6. Sonic Boost: When steam and gas flow into the converging section of the jet diffuser they accelerate to or above sonic speeds (otherwise no boost) and it generates a sonic wave or pressure wave front. This sonic boost will multiply the pressure of the flowing steam and gas by a factor of perhaps 3 or 4. 
    	7. Velocity Boost: As the steam and gas leave the diffuser throat, the flow then enters the gradually diverging sides of the diffuser. The velocity of the steam and gas is reduced. The kinetic energy of the flowing stream is partially converted to pressure as the steam and gas slow down. This increase in pressure is called the velocity boost, which will multiply the pressure of the steam and gas by a factor of 2 or 3. ( The overall boost is called the jet’s compression ratio.)
    	8. The condenser will condense the steam at a low temperature and low pressure. The steam accelerates toward the cold surface of the tubes in the condenser, where its large volume will disappear as the steam turns to water.

    Critical flow and the sonic boost
    The lower velocity in the throat does not affect the jet’s performance, as long as the velocity remains above the speed of sound. If the velocity in the throat falls below the speed of sound, we say that the jet has been forced out of critical flow. The sonic pressure boost is lost. As soon as the sonic boost is lost, the pressure in the vacuum tower suddenly increases

78,What is the job like in physical engineering?,1439136237,"Hello,

I am currently studying ME and have the feeling that I will be stuck to CAD stuff for the majority of my job, which I don't really like. So recently I discovered the major ""physical technology"" (word-for-word translation from German), which focuses on lasers, sensors and optionally med. eng.
This sounds really awesome because I like applied physics.
So I have a few questions to people who work in those industries or studied something similiar:

* After some research I found out that the process of building lasers is done by very few companies which are mainly based in China and the US. Physical Engineers are more responsible for the application of lasers (movement of the laser, calculations regarding the laser beam etc.). Could someone elobrate on how true this statement is and what the application of lasers consists of?

* How does the job/day of a physical engineer look like (compared to a ME)?

* Is physical engineering more of a niche industry which makes it hard to find a job? There are only 11 universities in Germany which offer this major.

* Do you think it's worth it switching from ME to ""physical technology""? (Stupid question, I know)


I hope there are some people who can help me. Thank you in advance ;)

I used 2 power supplies for +5V, +12V; the drive starts up with no funny sounds, so it's either good or the pcb is faulty. My usb to IDE adapter doesn't pickup the drive, but the device manager mentioned something about the model number of the drive for just a moment. I'm assuming my usb isn't compat?

I assume this question could be answered in google somewhere but I was hoping for a more direct and clear answer. I apologise for any rulebreaking or so.

I can understand that when you give gas on a rear-wheel drive car that there will be more weight on the rear wheels because they are being powered. If you lift of the gas the weight will transfer to the front
I recently got into playing 'simulator' type racing games. Usually what I do when I approach a corner, I let of the throttle for a bit because I believe this gives a better 'turn-in', is this because of the increased weigth at the front tires. which will then increase the grip and allow for higher-speed turn-ins? Is this a wise thing to do? I could imagine that this could also upset the car too much and cause the rear to break free due to all the weigth being at the front tires.

I'm a civil engineering graduate working in a development team for multi-national engineering company in the UK. I've been in the job for 11 months now and in that time I have worked on a number of projects writing Flood Risk Assessments (FRAs) which are submitted as part of the planning system in the UK. The FRA looks at the flood risk associated with a new development and its general aim is to ensure we only build in flood risk areas such as flood plains where necessary. The Flood Risk Assessment will outline how any risk will be managed by the proposed development and the proposed drainage strategy including limiting runoff from the site. The hope is that all new developments will include sustainable drainage systems but that doesn't seem to be happening (that's a discussion for another day)

So the FRA is written along with loads of other documents, for example transport assessments looking at how the existing road network will cope with increased traffic along with any junction improvements that might be needed. There are tonnes of other documents that are written by architects and planning consultants (yes there are people who's job it is to make sure stuff gets planning permission) and other engineering teams and they're all submitted to the Local Planning Authority(LPA( who look at the plans and in the end either approve or refuse permission. During this process the LPA will consult with local residents and statutory consultees such as the Environment Agency or the Local Authority Highways Department.

In the time I have been in my job so far I have had a hand in the submission of 4 major developments, 100+ houses each, yet none have been approved. And I should clarify the ones I have had involvement with have only been for outline planning permission, that is to say yes we like your idea, now go away and design it fully. Then the developer goes away and does the full design and submits again for planning permission.

There's other things I could go into, a lot of planning permissions I've seen have been commissioned have been conditioned so that something else is done before hand.

So I'm interested what would it be like to develop a housing estate in your country?

I’m looking for some help with an optimization problem. Imagine you have ten different lengths of a wooden 2x4, steel bar, whatever that need to be cut from a single constant length, X. Variable X is always fixed.

Apparently our facility scrapped 35% of our stock material last year. I have an opportunity to minimize this scrap by purchasing material at a different length from our supplier. The quantities of each manufactured length are different each month, but have trends that I can utilize to make my design assumptions.

17,Technical question - enthalpy conversion issue,1438960001,"I’m trying to create a function that converts air at a specific drybulb temp and wetbulb temp to its enthalpy. The way I’ve been working through it, I’m converting the temps to Celsius, working through the calculations to yield a value in kJ/kg, and then converting it back to btu/lbm. But somehow, my conversion from kJ/kg to btu/lbm is goofed up. Is the conversion not (enthalpy in kJ/kg) * 0.42992 = (enthalpy in btu/lbm) ? 

Let me use a specific numbers. Drybulb = 102.5F, Wetbulb = 77F. Converted that’s 39.2C and 25C respectively. My calculator right now yields an enthalpy of ~76 kJ/kg, which appears correct. But converting that with the above conversion gives me ~33 btu/lbm, and the correct answer is just north of 40. 

It’s been too long since I did this in school. What am I missing?

EDIT - SOLVED. Enthalpy is calculated at a reference temp of 0 at 0F, and 0 at 0C, so they're different scales. To correct for that, you just need to add the difference between the two (32*0.24 = 7.68) back after the conversion.

20,I designed a folding CNC plasma table to save space in my shop. What problems have I completely overlooked with my design? (animation inside),1438948500,"I got my hands on a Gerber Samplemaker SM1000 tangential knife-type x-y plotting robot. I'm using the gantry, motors, power supply, and other miscellaneous hardware to make the plasma table of my dreams. The original table had an 5'x10' working area and the gantry itself is huge (7' across). My shop doesn't really have the space for something that massive to take up space full-time, so I designed a table that folds up out of the way with one elegant motion. It's partly designed around another custom setup I saw on [CNC-Zone](http://www.cnczone.com/forums/plasma-edm-other-similar-machine-project-log/245162-cnc-software-forum.html). My gantry doesn't allow for me to entirely copy the table as the gentleman on CNC-Zone made it because of how wide my gantry is.

[Pic of gantry on temporary setup](http://imgur.com/OANMthT)

If I placed the pivot as high in the air as it needed to be to keep the gantry from hitting the ground as it rotated, it would cause the table to almost be five feet in the air when deployed for cutting. I didn't want to make the pivot offset to accommodate for the height issue because I was worried about having the table slam down violently if someone wasn't strong enough to deal with its mass. As I type this though, I'm thinking that might've been the solution to pursue the whole time :-/

In any case, [here's the animation](http://autode.sk/1HBjsvJ). I still want to pursue the original design if it's not completely idiotic. I did put a lot of thought and effort into it.

Basically the red strut causes a sub-assembly that supports the pillow blocks to raise up approximately 19"" as the table is rotated. The larger tubes have thick bronze bushings that ride over 1.5"" DOM tubing.

.  
this got me thinking, the only difference between my mediocre moka pot and this nice one is that you leave the valve closed until it reaches 150ish psi, so that it brews better.  so, with a simple valve and gauge (and a drill), I could turn my cheap one into something better.  
.  
then, I started thinking ""what if I don't watch the gauge until it reaches pressure then open the valve.  what if the pressure itself could open the valve for me?""  
.  
so, what do you think is the best way to hold the pressure until 120-170 psi, then release the water through the grounds?  
.  
here is a gif of [how a moka pot works](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Moka_Animation.gif).  I would simply be capping the top part until it had enough pressure to push the water at something in the neighborhood of 150psi.

disclaimer:  I simply plan for this to be an experiment, and would definitely use extreme caution.  there is a built-in pressure safety valve already, and I would do any test with the moka pot inside a larger container in case the gasket fails.  trust me, I'm an engineer [electrical ;) ]

39,"Designs/technology for small capacity ( 100 gallons, ~600 GPH ) fine filtration?",1438880079,"I have a test bed aquaponic system in my basement for trying out various ideas or deliberately creating problems and seeing how to resolve them.  

My latest issue is filtering out silica from the water.  

Taking a step back:  There is a 50 gallon blue drum that holds fish, that flows into a 5 gallon bucket fashioned into a radial filter (http://www.ecofilms.com.au/diy-radial-flow-filter-for-aquaponics/), the overflow/output then goes into a 50 gallon grow bed filled with 80% light expanded clay and 20% light expanded glass.  This then flows into a sump tank beneath the bed where pump starts the whole cycle over.

The expanded glass is disintegrating and letting out a small but steady stream of fine silica particles.  This was expected but now I am trying to figure out how to filter it.

Things on my todo list:

* A ""bead"" filter ( example - http://www.evolutionaqua.com/acatalog/K1_Micro_Bead_Filters.html )

* A lamella clarifier ( I am doubtful it would work given sizing constraints - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamella_clarifier )

* a very tall but narrow radial filter ( 1' diameter pipe with input entering the bottom and a weir at the top, no idea on height ).

Unlikey ideas:

* Fluidized sand filter ( example - http://cichlid-forum.com/articles/diy_fbf.php ), this seems more for biological filtration, even with larger sized particles.

* Strainer filters ( my pump has a 1,000 GPH flow rate at level, ~600 GPH after rising 4' up ).

* Foam clarifiers/protein skimmers ( supposedly will trap fines BUT also removes nitrates which is not ideal - http://www.koiacres.com/koi-acres-products/clarity.html ).

* Floculants/conditioners or any other chemical ( may kill, starve, or poison the plants ).

Stuff I've tried:

* Filter floss ( works for ~6 hours, diminishes flow rate even when fresh ).

* Hydrocyclone ( very fun to watch, does not filter anything due to sizing or perhaps some other mistake on my part ).


Of everything I've looked at, bead filters seems like its the most effective but I figured I should ask before I go and buy ~10 lbs of 5mm plastic beads and cobble something together.  The motivation for using a poor quality media ( expanded glass ) is that I live in an arid environment with lots of dust.  For outdoor systems, it will be inevitable that they collect that and given AP's recirculating nature, it will build up until it becomes a hazard to the fish.

Is there some other idea I've missed ( perhaps something in waste filtration systems that can handle 600 GPH in a compact space, keeping in mind that I will eventually scale it up to 1,000 to 5,000 gallons ).

41,Emergency wiring rules and earthing requirements for small industrial plant.,1438876522,"Good Day /r/askengineers.

I am a final year EE student currently working as an intern with a small engineering firm in the UK. Before I went to university I worked in the offshore oil and gas industry as an electrical maintenance technician.

I have been tasked with designing, constructing and installing the electrical and control equipment for a small piece of industrial plant in our company warehouse. The plant is a small flow loop designed to pump water around approximately 6m of 3"" pipework.

I have two questions I would like to ask about two different problems I am currently facing with this project.

Firstly, I have just come out of a meeting with my boss who has asked for a design change which in my opinion will make the system less safe. My original solution and the change he has asked for are detailed in the diagrams below. The diagrams have been GREATLY simplified for simplicity of asking this question.

http://imgur.com/a/dazA0

My initial design is exactly the same as what I experienced while working offshore, using a low voltage DC contactor to isolate the pump when the emergency stop button is pressed. This is how every offshore installation I have worked at does it and is specifically named in IET regulation 537.4.2.3. 

My boss (who does have an EE degree but as far as I know, no plant experience) doesn't like this as he claims if anyone was to be electrocuted while working inside the cabinet, the emergency stop button will not totally isolate the cabinet. His proposal is to route all 3-ph power through the emergency stop station. There is nothing wrong with this either, IET regulation 537.4.2.2.

Despite the regulations saying both are fine, I think the latter is less safe because the emergency stop station is in the designated ""safe area"" where the operator will be standing. I don't see the need to put 415V into this area. I don't believe this is as safe as keeping the 415V completely contained inside the control cabinet and using a contactor for isolation purposes. I don't see any advantage to isolating the entire cabinet because nobody should be working inside the cabinet while it is live anyway, AND the main incoming 3-phase supply is protected by an RCBO which should interrupt supply as soon as a person starts being electrocuted. The cabinet is locked shut with a key, specifically satisfying IET regulations for access control (IET 416.2.4.)

My first question is, is there a good argument to be made either way for which method is better? I'm not looking necessarily for an argument as to why my solution is better. If his method is better I want to hear others thoughts on that method too. I want to hear thoughts on which is best and more importantly, why.

Secondly, I would like to hear some opinions on earthing requirements.

Our warehouse where this system is to be installed is directly beside our main office with all the other staff on the other side of the wall where our flow loop is to be installed. Because of this, noise is a big concern and minimizing any noise created by the loop while operating is very important.

My mechanical counterpart is doing this by using rubber sheeting between the pipe clamps and the pipework and rubber feet on the main system pump. My concern here is that there will be a potential difference between the pipework and the supporting structure. Thinking back to my days offshore, I do not recall seeing earthing conductors attached to pipework however none of these pipes would have been electrically isolated from their support clamps.

The regulations are crystal clear about earthing requirements for supporting structure. However (as far as I can tell) I can't find anything saying how pipework itself is meant to be earthed. I'm almost certainly just going to earth everything anyway as it's certainly not going to do any harm, but if anyone has any experience with something like this or would be able to point me roughly to the chapters in the IET regulations I should be reading up on, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.


***EDIT***

Thank you everybody for your replies.

Perhaps my choice of words was not perfect in describing the first problem. There are other isolation sources in place for anybody working on the system but I did not include them in the drawing I posted here to try to simplify them. Perhaps this was an oversight on my part but the E-Stop button would not be used for isolating for maintenance. There is already an isolator installed with a lock out feature for maintenance and long term isolation.

***EDIT2***

Sorry this is also something else I should have pointed out.

The operator will not be controlling the speed of the pump by interacting with the VSD directly. The VSD is to be set up to be controlled by a 4...20mA current loop. The operator will be standing beside the emergency stop station with a SCADA system. It is at this system that the operator will set the speed they want. From there the SCADA program interacts via ModbusTCP with a 4-20mA IO module which will then in turn control the speed of the VSD.

The control cabinet will not be interacted with under normal operating conditions.",AskEngineers,BreachLAN-gemini,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3g0m8h/emergency_wiring_rules_and_earthing_requirements/

Part of the motivation is that I am currently looking for a belt for a small pulley system, and I am researching what material to use (Neoprene vs. Viton vs. ???).  But in general I don't know much about thermosets vs. thermoplastics vs. elastomers.  Another concrete example is when to use Nylon, Acrylic, or Delrin, and what their strength/brittleness are, how machine/form/mold them, and how to weld/glue/join them.  Any favorite introductory texts for the engineering minded hobbyist who is interested more in using polymers (rather than synthesizing new ones)?

Firstly, I apologise if this is in the wrong sub. 

I was hoping to gain some insight into building a career which will translate from UK to Canada. 

I'm a 20y/o Junior Design Engineer who works primarily on SW to create (fairly basic mechanical) bespoke products for the Oil and Gas industry. In December I'll have 2 years experience and next May/June I'll have a HNC in Mechanical Engineering- which my company is paying for. 

Going further I'll hopefully go on to complete a HND in MechE (again, paid by the company) which will take a further two years. And a bachelors will take another two years beyond that. 

My long term (~5 years) goal is to emigrate to Canada. What can I do to help make this a possibility?

Should I consider studying abroad (Canada) after the HND to gain a foothold? 

Any advice/insight would be immensely appreciated.

48,FR4 (Material used in PCBs) - Deformation under heat and mechanical load,1438849577,"Hi,

I work for an electronic manufacturer, and have come across an issue that hopefully someone more mechanically minded can help with.

We have received information that some of circuits have deformed when thermally cycled between -40 and 125degC. Temperatures which I'd consider to be okay for a standard board.

My concern comes that the customer has soldered a spring to the board, which is imparting a point force of around 15N to the PCB.  Given the pad size this equates to a Pressure of 1.3Nmm^-2.

The circuit is essentially a 26mm diameter circle made of 0.8mm FR4, 

I think the load's excessive for a board that small, but I'm not 100% that is the root cause. What do you guys think?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

I want to like it, but it's just not happening for me. This could be due to still being in the learning phase, but even still I just find it to be dull. It lacks that ""spark"" of engagement.  
  
My real interest is in automotive performance. I interviewed with a company (also 20ish employees and same commute) that makes aftermarket performance parts, and I was head over heels.... at first. They gave me the offer and not only was the pay ($1/hr) less than what I am making now, but the benefits weren't as good as my current job.  I believe I can negotiate some, but I know it is a desirable field and they can more/less name their price for engineers.  
  
I wish it was as clear cut as ""do what makes you happy"", but the reality is that benefits and pay are a crucial component to the equation. Here's a brief overview:  
  
HVAC company: 401k in effect, 5 days vacation and 5 personal days left to use by the end of the year, 10 vacation days and 5 more personal days after 1 year (Jan 2016), and good healthcare provider.  
  
Car company: 5 personal days after 6 months, 2 weeks vacation after 1 year, 401k after 1 year, questionable healthcare provider.

89,Asking for experiences or company insights regarding a worldwide job search,1438684945,"Hello everybody!

I'm not really convinced, this is an allowed question/thread, so if it's not I'll delete it and ask it somewhere else.

I’m using a throw away/new account because some of my coworkers know my regular account and I don’t want them to know what I am planning, at least not yet.

I have a couple of general questions regarding working as an engineer in other countries. I realize that every country hast its own system of regulating engineering jobs and handling foreigners, but I hope I can get a few examples or just some guidelines to follow or consider. Like how would I start, do I first try to get a job and then start worrying about the rest or should I first pick a country and make sure I meet the criteria for a work permit and have the necessary paperwork ready, before even considering applying for a job there? I found some similar questions, but most of them are related to the US, but I’m asking for a more general approach on the subject. I don’t really care where I end up, as long as the potential job sounds fun and something I would like to do for a long time, most likely that would be a position in R&amp;D or product testing, but who knows what positions are out there and who even wants me, but that’s a topic for another day. English as a first language would be nice, but I’m not in a rush and willing to learn. If I had to choose, I think I would go to Canada, but that’s not really important.

A little bit about myself, just to let you know it’s not just a wild dream but I’m willing to work and learn, so your time replying isn’t wasted. I’m from Germany, currently work in the R&amp;D department of a medium sized company (~250 people, 5 in R&amp;D), have professional training as a draftsman and a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering, which I did in part time, so in total I have about 7 years of experience in product development, plastic part design and other related things like product testing, documentation, patent research and others. I have driver’s licenses for almost everything (car, motorcycle, truck, forklift), am fluent in German, English and know the basics of Dutch. I don’t want to write a resume, just give a general overview, so I’ll stop here ;) I just finished my degree and because my company paid for it, I’ll have to pay them back if I leave in the next three years, so I don’t plan on leaving before next summer and the amount has gone down a bit.

I hope some of you are willing to share their experiences going to another country to work or can tell from a company’s point of view, what a foreign applicant should have done before applying or if you/they don’t care and are willing to help get a visa etc. if necessary and if they even would consider a candidate from the other side of the world for a position in their local team.

I’m probably forgetting some big things, so if you could enlighten me, I would be thankful ;)

93,Materials and finishes for an aluminum shaft sliding in a plastic sleeve?,1438655153,"I'm looking for a bit of sanity checking on some material and finish selections for a simple mechanism. In short, I've got an aluminum shaft that needs to move linearly in a plastic sleeve, which is fixed into a stainless sleeve. All materials/finishes need to be corrosion resistant to the extent that they'll work in a swimming pool.

My current thought is that the plastic sleeve (delrin? UHMW? oil-filled nylon?) bushing gets pressed into the stainless sleeve (316?), probably pinned in place, and then the bushing's ID is precision machined. The aluminum shaft that slides inside is probably 6061 with a polished metal plating (electroless nickel?). All movement is slow/occasional (hand movements, not motorized), but the system needs to work well both in and out of water. This is for a consumer product so material cost is a consideration (read: no exotic stuff).

Other thoughts include possibly slitting the plastic sleeve to improve the action.

I'm well aware it would be cheaper and easier to buy one pre-made, I'm dead set on building my own. This project is as much about the learning process as the end result.*  
  
I've decided that the best way to achieve adjustable height is with a gas spring. After a few days of research I've found there are [many types of gas springs](http://www.dictator.nl/Downloads/EN/Reg.6/603-E-Functioning_of_the_Different_Types.pdf), and I'm not sure which would best-suit my needs.  
  
I'm looking for something that will ""lock"" at any point during the stroke. If the gas spring is 50% extended it should hold steady, only compressing if enough force is exerted. Locking gas springs have this feature, but I don't want to press a ""release valve/button"" in orders to adjust the height. Ease of operation is just as important as adjustability, and having to reach behind the monitor in order to adjust it seems inconvenient.  
  
Really appreciate any insight, and I'm happy to give any additional details if needed.

4,Manufacturing vs Mechanical Engineering,1438618262,"Hey there,

Having just finished my 2nd year in engineering, I am now forced to make a choice. A choice, which will define my life and career. Therefore I come to you oh redditors to enlight a slicer of light in the hollow shadows of my indecision.

I have been researching differences between this 2 degrees, and it seems quite clear (correct me if I'm wrong):
Mechanical: focused on a more theoretical aspect of engineering and design of the machine.
Manufacturing: concerned with the creation of the machine and production methodology.

My main concern comes to job prospects. Mechanical engineering from what I've seen, appears to be more valued by engineering companies. On the other hand, manufactuing looks slightly more into operation management, perhaps is a better route for a project manager? If you guys could share your work experiences so far as an Mechanical/ Manufacturing Engineer, this would provide me a more realistic insight into what the differences are.

Where would I like to end up?
1. Create my own business (start up), or taking an entrepreneurial approach in supply chain management.
2. Become a project engineer

    B. Basic hydraulics (e.g., Manning equation, Bernoulli theorem, open-channel flow, pipe flow)

    D. Water distribution systems
    E. Reservoirs (e.g., dams, routing, spillways)
    F. Groundwater (e.g., flow, wells, drawdown)
    G. Storm sewer collection systems


That being said, I'm already well prepared for the Ethics &amp; Professional Practice (have written subcontracts in my internships) Construction (multiple internships), Surveying, and Materials sections from having worked with a civil contractor, as well as creating asphalt mix designs during a summer research program. 

Those aren't going to be on the ""Other"" test. And the ""Other"" test contains areas that are rusty. 

It's been 5 years since I took Gen Chem, 3 since OChem. I think I'd be fine on the sections concerning Instrumentation and Data Acquisition as well as Safety, Health, and Environment. 

However, it seems that there's a strong focus on Fluid Mechanics (let me put it this way, I'm retaking it my final quarter), as well as Thermo (I got an A in that...), and Heat Transfer (taking it this summer). I haven't had much experience with Electricity, Power, and Magnetism outside of freshman physics and what I've experienced in my construction internships (not much). 

For those of you who have taken it, what would you do in my situation?

8,[update] Resurrecting a waterjet for my internship assignment. More than halfway there but I'm hitting some walls.,1438616603,"First off, thanks for the tremendous amount of help and encouragement from all the generous and patient people on this forum. There's no way I'd even have gotten this far without you guys.

I went with a LinuxCNC/Mesa 5i25+7i77 pnp kit setup. I currently have the a computer running the software and about 80% of the wiring done for the Mesa cards. If I understand it correctly, I still need to ground the analog drives, wire 24v field power and correctly wire the limit/home switches to the 7i77 card. I've read these manuals a few times and been reading threads on the linuxCNC forums but I still have a few questions I havent found answers to.

For reference:

[Waterjet wiring diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1kdAuhpoFaocnhpdkRvanFaM3c/view?usp=sharing) Sheets 3 and 5 are the relevant diagrams right now.

[Pictures of the wiring cabinet](http://imgur.com/a/65oDV) 

[7i77 card diagram](http://imgur.com/jDA7gi0)

[7i77 manual with pin descriptions starting on page 11 of pdf](http://www.mesanet.com/pdf/parallel/7i77man.pdf)

**Analog Dive interface.**(TB5 on 7i77 card diagram)  I've wired into the AOUT0 and AOUT1 to drive the x and y axis but I've not grounded them yet. I've found the ground wires for the drives in the wiring cabinet and they were both screwed into the same ground terminal and BOTH labeled pin 4. On Sheet 5 rungs 13 and 34 you can see  x and y drives are grounded to pins 3 and 4 respectively. This leads me to believe that it doesn't matter which ground wire I screw into the 7i77 analog drive gnd for  0 and 1 (pins 3 and 7 on TB5 of the 7i77) as long as they both are grounded. Also, on the diagram it notes ""DO NOT TIE (SIG GND) COM OF THE +/- 15VDC SUPPLY TO GND, UNLESS OPTO ISOLATION IS NOT REQUIRE).  Not really sure precisely what this means and if I'm in danger of conflicting with it.

Also, for the Analog drive interface, each drive has 4 pins. (See 7i77 manual with pin.. page 15 of pdf) The first two are ENA0- and ENA0+. I assume these are used to enable the drives but I don't understand where wires that normally go to the servo drivers should be attached here. 

I suppose the other possibility is that the enable pins are sent to 308CR (Sheet 3 rung 8 @ Waterjet wiring diagram) but I'm not really sure how I should try to accomplish that. I read in the yaskawa servo drive manual that these shouldn't be powered up and down frequently but I don't see how I can avoid it since it appears that the drive ENA -/+ should be wired to the one single relay that supplies power to the system.

Or am I mistaken and what's actually happening is that the CRM (Sheet 3 rung 15) sends power to the servo drivers and then 308CR simply enables them via the ENA  -/+ pins from the 7i77?

**Limit Switches**
Luckily, it looks like finding the wiring for the limit/home switches will be super easy since it's already labeled in the cabinet and clearly marked on what used to be a 60 pin ribbon cable. However when I go through the pncconf for linuxCNC, I'm not really sure how to set those. 

When I select my components (which I'm still not really sure if I'm doing correctly) I see 2 I/O tabs and 2 smart serial port tabs. In each tab I see a bunch of different drop down menus where I can select an axis limit but I'm not really sure how my selection there translates into which pin I need to wire to. I obviously see pin numbers beside each menu but how do I know which TB those signals are being sent to?  I'm reading through the pncconf write up and it doesn't really mention this. I've also watched a few videos about going through the pncconf but they were for stepper motors so I'm not sure what does and doesn't apply. I think this is such a obvious answer that they never thought it would need to be explained but here we are...

**PWM**

On the first part of setting up my configuration, the menu box for setting up pwm base period is grey. Also, it doesn't allow me the option to select a number of pwm generators in the same way I can select '3 encoders'. I'm not sure if this is normal, I need to make another selection or if I didn't locate the 7i77 firmware files correctly in the directory.

In the same way I'm unsure of how to designate limit switches and their corresponding pins, I'm not really sure under which tab and which pin I should be selecting PWM for a given axis. Right now, my analog drives are wired into TB5 drives 0 (x axis) and 1 (y axis). 

Random question but why are there so many field power inputs? From page 6 of the 7i77 manual, it says pins 1-4 are for 8-32v field power. I'm just curious why there needs to be more than one? Is that to accommodate higher load conditions?

**PID control**

For the 'base' tune, should I just go with the default settings and then change it after I see what it does to the servos?  Also, to avoid a catastrophic crash, I should probably disconnect the servos from the ball screws. Is there anything I should know before I do this? It seems like it's just a matter of unbolting them from their position and letting them rest there disconnected but I don't want to overlook anything there.

**Encoder resolution**

In the 'pncconf  step by step guide' it seems like it's telling me to to basically throw some numbers in there and then through trial and error of how much the machine actually moves vs how much I tell it to, determine the resolution of the encoder. Is this really the way it's done?

Two companies have even ended up saying that they are unable to do the type of manufacturing I'm asking for, when their websites clearly say that they do indeed do this kind of manufacturing, and they provide many examples of such. All companies that I've been working with claim that they are happy to work in the batch volume I've been asking for (~500 pcs/order).

This project, specifically, is a cast 17-4 PH stainless steel part with only a couple specific and easily attained tolerances. The difficulty of the part comes in that it has a few difficult angles and thin walls (1.5-2.5mm). Both metal injection molding and investment casting seem to be prime candidates for this project, and all companies I've contacted claim to specialize in these processes.

How do you find companies who follow through with their commitments and continue the quote process all the way to production? All of my email and phone correspondences have been kind and professional, and I have not made any special/unreasonable requests of any company. 

I'm working with a budget of up to $15,000 for the first year of production. I understand that the sales engineer that works with me isn't going to buy an Audi on this kind of project, but I don't see my RFQ as being valueless either. Are there any special tricks to working with these kinds of companies? Am I just having bad luck, and I need to keep persevering? Do you know of any investment casting or metal injection molding companies that are renown for their follow-through?

Thank you very much for your help, /r/AskEngineers!

**edit:** Thanks for all the suggestions! It seems that one of the biggest issues that I'm facing is that most shops don't want to work with such small orders. It's likely that the preliminary quotes that shops have given underestimate the final costs. When they realize that the job is more complex than they originally quoted, they send me into the forgotten abyss of ""we'll do the job if we don't have something better to do.""

It seems that my options are to better specify the drawings in the RFQ stage so that the companies have a better chance of quoting the project upfront, and increasing my order volumes.

Since it's been pointed out in many different ways on this post, I'll try to clarify a few things:

* I consider myself a genuinely nice guy. While it's possible I don't realize I'm an asshole, the likelihood that this is the point from where the difficulties stem seems lower than some of the other suggestions.
* I'm flexible on the price of the part, and the quotes that I've mentioned have been from the vendors, not an absolute price that I'm demanding the vendors stick to.
* The vendors have been quoting the tooling prices alongside the price per part. The quotes have been in the range of $600 to $1200. I'm fully willing to pay the tooling costs, and haven't been asking the vendors otherwise.
* The part must adhere to three specific dimensions and tolerances (±0.1 mm), but all other tolerances can be ±0.25 mm. Is this unreasonable? What are the industry standard tolerances for investment cast or MIM 17-4 PH stainless steel? I assume that there will be post-cast machining to reach the ±0.1 mm tolerances on the holes that need those tolerances, but all others can simply be cast.
* The shape of the part can't change much. I realize this significantly increases the complexity, but it simply cannot function if it's a different shape. The tolerances are fairly broad, but the overall shape and dimensions are critical.",AskEngineers,entrequeneur,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3fmiih/im_at_my_wits_end_after_two_years_and_six/

I have a [basic diagram](http://i.imgur.com/gnj71jJ.jpg) depicting how the gear ratios will turn out but I don't quite understand what happens between it.


The engine turns a 13 tooth sprocket which is connected by chain to a 62 tooth sprocket.  The 62 tooth sprocket is on the same shaft as a 30 tooth sprocket which is lastly connected by chain to the drive shaft with a 28 tooth sprocket.

None of this takes into account the shifting to different gear ratios as my main concern is how much torque I am actually getting at a maximum.


So my question is: How do I understand what kind of transformation the power (sorry if that's the wrong term) is going through?

A couple of my friends recently bought a gutted sailboat (I am in no way implicated in the ownership of the boat). The area around where the mast mounts to the deck was all rotted and they had no idea how to fix it. So they called me.

I proposed we cut out all the rot (about 12X24"" on the deck, plus part of the bulkhead), make a patch plate for the hole in the deck from 3/8"" aluminum plate (with a 1"" doubler plate where the mast bolts through) and replace the rotted bulkhead with new wood.

I'm 99.9% sure that my fix is bullet proof and way stronger than the original, but the worry wart in me is wondering if I could be held liable if part of the boat failed and caused mast to tip over, causing damage to an expensive yacht parked next to it or something.

I've seen it's firing order listed as 1-5-4-8-3-7-2-6, following the diagram of the crank given [HERE](http://files.americanmuscle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/flat_plane_vs_cross_plane_crankshaft.jpg) (though the ford uses an u-d-u-d crank shaft, the crank pin and cylinder number are the same) and the explanation given [HERE](http://what-when-how.com/automobile/firing-order-of-cylinders-automobile/) under B, would the firing order not be 1-8-3-6-4-5-2-7?

The current firing order loads the same crank pin just 90º apart, for example 1-5 would fire opposite bank, but same crank pin. This would lead to torsion issues (hence their vibration issues with the exhaust headers), and put unnecessary work on the oil system.

They're current firing order looks a lot like Ferrari's v8 firing order 1-5-3-7-4-8-2-6... its almost as though they went to the wikipedia for ""firing order"" saw that Ferrari's was listed as flat plane, and figured they had to swap cylinders 4-8 and 3-7 to account for the different shaped crank...

My concrete piers that support my steel beams are connected into an existing foundation wall on one end with walls plates + anchors and on the other end we are pouring new concrete footings + piers which also support the cantilevered portion of the beam. My issue is that there is an existing tunnel foundation adjacent to my concrete pier+footing, thus the only workaround is to design a eccentric footing. However, my axial load is so large, that I am doubtful it would work. I'm thinking I would have to go with a strap footing most likely, but I do not have any other concrete piers parallel to the way my beams are spanning.

A quantity of water is heated with steam of 5 bar (6 bar abs) from a temperature of 35 C to 100 C over a period of 20 minutes (1200 seconds). The mass of water is 500 kg and the specific heat capacity of water is 4.19 kJ/kg.oC.  



Heat transfer rate:
    q = (500 kg) (4.19 kJ/kg oC) ((100 C) - (35 C)) / (1200 s)

Amount of steam:

* **Superstructure**

*MERLIN-DASH*

http://best.umd.edu/software/merlin-dash/index.html

University of MD

College Park, MD 20742

(301) 405-2011

Not that bad of a program, for simple beam analysis/configurations; can design/analyze for AASHTO LFD and LRFD up to edition 6.  Known Program Limitations include: Only Line Girder Analyses (has been a while since I used it, but I doubt they added frame or system analyses, so don’t let the 3D picture fool you).  I can’t remember how it handles floorbeams/cross braces.  Limited to Steel.

*MDX*

http://www.mdxsoftware.com/

(573) 446-3221

A pretty powerful program.  It’s expensive, but I prefer it.  It can do a full frame analysis with really high skews and curved girders.  I really like how I can have the coordinates for all the points in my girder system in an excel sheet, convert that sheet to a text file, import them directly into MDX and have my model generated.  Known Program Limitations: Cannot design for arch forces (2-D only), Unable to directly analyze a built-up floorbeam (but you can input the geometric properties and get end-member forces).  If your built-up floorbeam is also continuous between bays, MDX will only allow it to be modeled in-between bays, and doesn’t play nicely with a floorbeam spacing of less than 1’-0” (long story… but suffice it to say, we had a very “unique” framing plan, which needed us to model a built-up floorbeam with a bay of, like, 6”).  Limited to Steel.

*Bentley’s LARS Bridge* (I think it stands for something like “Load And Rating of Systems” Bridge).

http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/LARS+Bridge/Index.htm

Well, when the program is working correctly, it certainly has a *lot* of potential.   It can do line-girder analyses of Steel, concrete (reinforced and prestressed), timber, trusses, variable-depth beams, etc.  But, HO-LY HELL, it’s got issues.  Working with Tech Support is a bit of a pain, too; I think they may only have 2, maybe 3 people providing support for LARS.  There are also not many technical examples or comprehensive explanations for the program inputs.  Can be very good for simple structures, but I’d recommend most anything else, for the most part.

*Bentley’s LEAP CONSPAN*

http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/Bentley+LEAP+Bridge/Bentley-CONSPAN.htm

A solid design and rating program whose only limitations seems to be that it can only be used with Prestressed Concrete.  LFD and LRFD design and load ratings.  Advertised to be able to input loads into RCPier to continue the design process. Deck design and analysis only works with LRFD.

* **Substructure**

*Bentley’s LEAP RCPier*

http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/Bentley+LEAP+Bridge/Bentley-RCPIER.htm

A solid design program for substructures.  The ability to create trucks which are compatible with the Auto-Live Load Generation is really nice.  You can’t have it design for or analyze a stepped pier cap to design the pedestal, but you can apply additional axial/shears/moments onto the pier cap after you separately design the pedestal as a short wall.  Program limitations:  It can’t design or analyze post-tensioned structures.  The foundations can’t design or analyze prestressed piles.  There are some limitations in the load inputs from CONSPAN.  There is no option to load rate a substructure unit.

*BRASS-Culvert*

From the Wyoming DOT (WYDOT BridgeTech, Inc).

Pretty decent and easy to use program for 3-sided and 4-sided concrete box culverts.  Applies stream flow forces, and surchange.  Unable to analyze for live loadings traveling parallel to the longitudinal centerline of the culvert barrel.

*BOXLRFD*

From the Pennsylvania DOT, very similar to BRASS-Culvert with the same limitations.  The inputs and usage of Engineering Assistant (a program utility from PennDOT that gives a better graphical user interface for their programs) allow for a bit more options.

*ABUTLRFD*

Also from PennDOT, a program that helps to design reinforced concrete abutments and wingwalls.  It can also be used to design retaining walls

* **Steel signs/luminaires**

*Sign Bridge Analysis and Evaluation System (SABRE)*

http://best.umd.edu/software/sabre/

University of MD

College Park, MD 20742

(301) 405-2011

A bit of a “bucket of bolts” program, can design and analyze Sign Structures and Luminaires according to AASHTO LRFD 3rd – 6th edition.  Known Program Limitations include: will run the analysis or design *without actually attaching the sign to the structure without notification to the user*, most design consideration for fatigue need to be done outside the program in Post Processing mode.  Can only model arms/trusses within one plane (i.e. all non-single-mast-arm structures must be in a “butterfly” configuration).  Can only apply loads to the Mast Arm / Truss.  I’ve also had issues with the hardware key / USB dongle, where the program will have issues detecting it, thus preventing usage for a time; every time you close the program, you need to wait 10ish minutes for the license to “refresh”.

So the design program I have for the civies out there:  What program, if any, do you use to design a pre-stressed concrete pile?",AskEngineers,gremark,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3falaw/a_suggestion_for_a_side_bar_sticky_xpost_from/

57,Opinion: is engineering a form of art?,1438290700,"So this has been on my mind for the last few months. I'm studying engineering right now and when I was designing a part for a design team I'm on I realized that engineering (at least the design aspect) is a form of art. This seems counterintuitive as we are all told that art and engineering are opposites but hear me out.
 
Let's look at the most fundamental form of ""art"", that of the painting. The artist does several steps to create that painting. He (or she) creates an image in their head which they try to create on the canvas, and then they create it manually using learned technique. How is that different from designing an engineering part? We create an image in our head and then we create it, though using software. 

If they paint a region in a colour they don't appreciate then they change it. That's iterative design just like engineering. 

People often will say that engineering is too mathematical to be considered art. Is it really though? When you are first coming up with the concept of a part, you don't use math right away. You envision a solution that may work then you do the math later to refine it where it doesn't work. Also artists use math as well, but of a different form. Things like the golden ratio and fractals are mathematical concepts which they utilize to create a ""better"" piece of art. This line is blurred even more when you consider modern art sculptures which generally include large amounts of mathematics to determine form. 

Another requirement of art which I've heard people say is that (good) art must be able to elicit an emotional response in the viewer. I'd argue that great engineering creates this same effect. Take the example of a bridge. When you see an enormous bridge which spans a chasm so large you never thought possible, does this not inspire awe in you? For me I feel an emotional response of amazement in viewing such a sight. Yes, the shape and design was probably thought up by an architect (which I consider more of a traditional art instead of engineering), but what it looks like isn't what causes this effect. It is the marvel that this thing can exist which causes the amazement, this is the work of the engineers. 

This also brings up the topic of beauty. This word is defined as the quality of sensing an object or thing to be pleasing. Whether it be a beautiful painting or song or play. 

This is actually what got me thinking of this topic in the first place. I designed that part and was taken aback at its beauty. Not in a classical ""artistic design"" sense but beauty in its functionality. This sort of beauty is pleasing to us, but more in an intellectual way instead of visual or audible. Beauty in simplicity and functionality. 

Of course not everything engineers make fits these qualities, just like how a painting done by a 10 year old doesn't elicit an emotional response by most.

I would like to install an apparatus so I can do some basic bodyweight exercises. I intend to hang gymnastics rings from the tube. I do not intend to use it for dynamic exercises with momentum etc, just pullups, dips etc. No fancy stuff that use momentum/kipping.

The setting:

corridor, 1,3m (4,3') wide

one side is concrete, the other is [hollow bricks](http://www.jayadevtiles.com/products.php?cat_id=4&amp;sub_cat_id=42) +plaster, etc.

I intend to install a steel tube, heavy duty.

Now, what's the best way to do it?

My plan so far is

a steel tube that's 15 cm larger than the width of the corridor (both walls are 12cm or so wide)

make 2 holes on each side, at least 8 cm deep, allow some slack so I can actually put the tube in.

clean them, fill them with epoxy adhesive for concrete-metal (I can't find a link in english, basically it is a compound similar to stucco in its texture that's actually harder than concrete when it gets dry). Basically I fill the holes with that, stick the tube inside, fill it again if there's empty spots, let it dry. Afterwards I reapply plaster and paint.

So my question, will this be safe in the long run? I am asking mostly about the side with the bricks. If not, what's the plan?

I cannot put something in the ceiling, like anchor bolts or similar, for a number of reasons.

84,How to become a (better) mechanical design engineer.,1438229800,"Hi all,

I've found myself asking ""how do I become a good mechanical design engineer"", and after looking at related posts on this subreddit, I remained unsatisfied.  So I've made this post in a desire to get an answer to my question, and to serve as a resource to anyone else who finds themselves in my predicament. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The Problem**

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a recent MechE graduate (BS) who has always loved mechanical design, but has never really been every good at it.  Whenever I try to think of a solution, it's usually overly complex,  weird, and not very good,

I recently applied for a mechanical design position, and realized that not only are my mechanical design skills lacking, but understanding of other basic things such as GD&amp;T, recommended tolerance for parts in an assembly, manufacturing methods, etc are as well. 

I've always wanted to be a good designer, and with that in mind, I'm asking you, the engineers of reddit to help guide me and recommend ways I can overcome my apparent lack of talent.  

&amp;nbsp;


**The Solution, Part One: Things I Should Read**

&amp;nbsp;

Some quick research from the subreddit has told me I should read:

[""Geo-metrics III""](http://www.amazon.com/Geo-Metrics-III-Application-Dimensioning-Tolerancing/dp/0201633426/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438222262&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=geometrics+iii) - for GD&amp;T

[""Machinery's Handbook""](http://www.amazon.com/Machinerys-Handbook-29th-Erik-Oberg/dp/083112900X) - for all things machining

""[Making it""](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Manufacturing-Techniques-Product-Design/dp/1856697495/) and  [""Manufacturing Processes for Design Professionals""](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Manufacturing-Techniques-Product-Design/dp/1856697495/) - for manufacturing related things


However, I really lack a knowledge of mechanical components beyond the basics like screws, bolts, gears, etc, so it'd be really helpful if you could recommend a mechanical version of something like [""Encyclopedia of Electronic Components""](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1118?gclid=Cj0KEQjw8-GtBRCMl7m54PzgjNQBEiQAIZckvzvqRy4BBvgB1-1fEo1G9FW0xMRaXqsihkdavqdYepMaArhg8P8HAQ)

I've also been reading [""The New Way Things Work""](http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Way-Things-Work/dp/0395938473) and it's been pretty helpful, but I'd love more recommendations on books or other resources that'll show me mechanical components and mechanisms in common applications. 

Other things I'd love resources or recommendations about would be ergonomic design, good resources for sketching, Design For Manufacturing (DFM), and anything else you can think of.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**The Solution, Part Two: Things I Should Do**

So I think this is just generally taking things apart, sketching and CADing them, and then reassemblying them to get a better intuition about mechanical components and mechanisms, a feel for the size/scale of things, and common mechanical failures.  I plan on using Craig's List as my source for free stuff, and hope to use whatever I can salvage as raw materials for DIY projects.

Feel free to recommend things I should take apart, good projects to try, etc.

&amp;nbsp; 

**The Solution, Part Three: The Unknown Unknowns**

Basically what else should I do to make myself for mechanically inclined?  What am I missing that you think would be helpful in this pursuit?  I'm open to all thoughts, questions, recommendations, and hope to make this a really enriching post for myself and others.

Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR**  A MechE who's bad at mechanical design asks for specific resources and advice on becoming better at it.

What I've got in mind is several segments linked like a bicycle chain with a torsion spring at each axle acting on two segments. Like the hammer and base of a mousetrap. Each segment would have a 60 degree range of motion relative to the segment it's connected to.  15 degrees ""up"" and 45 degrees ""down"". Problem - How do you link each segment so that they all pivot at the same time and speed(rate)? Ex -  If there were 10 segments and each segment pivoted 9 degrees the final segment would be 90 degrees from its starting orientation.  Mercy on the drawings, I'm just trying to get a functional mechanism before I add springs, links and properly size the parts.

Edit -  I Got it! Thanks for all the ideas, I didn't follow one persons suggestions but worked it through with a couple of different inputs. The mental breakthroughs - The reason that the original structure was rigid WASN'T obvious to me. After some thought I came to the conclusion that I was giving the link attachment points(disks in the original, bars in the solution) both fixed and free spinning attributes. Can't have both. I created each segment to have one fixed and one free spinning bar. Surprisingly this worked. In the CAD pictures the red bars are free spinning and alternate between left and right on each segment. It's hard to see in the pics but the red bar closest to the base is anchored to the base. It turns out that it works as two mechanisms, one side controls the even segments and the other side controls the odd. [Album of solution](http://imgur.com/a/QL3HA).

Yet despite this, I am finding that I still have to request more work when I am bored/light workload. Also despite being heavily involved in a project, I am often never invited to meetings and must instigate contact with the PM to get included or have more information on something.

I see other engineers in my department not having this same problem; they get invited to meetings and are frequently asked what their availability is when more work is brought into the office. My only logical thinking why this is would be because I am one of the more junior engineers at the firm. So I understand a sense of hierarchy, but it still seems illogical to ask the engineer with 7 years of experience to take on another project when they are busy and I am sitting bored with nothing to do. Also another engineer in our department has about the same experience as me (2 years) and he constantly is given work, but he is also the boss' nephew... :/

When do  bigger or smaller crystallites exist and how are they distributed when, e.g. I compare diagrams of the same thermoplast which was injection molded at different temperatures?

14,Any suggestions for further stabilizing my standing desk design?,1438138360,"Hello all, 

I'm currently converting my boring, old desk into a fully adjustable standing desk through the use of an Arduino and a couple of [these](http://www.progressiveautomations.com/linear-actuator-ip66) linear actuators, which are rated at 400lbs. Figured this would be a good summer project while I'm home from school. 

The design is about as simple as these things can get. There's just an inner shell that's sliding up and down within another shell. I'm relying on a tight fit between the two shells. This is currently the only way I'm stabilizing the desktop. I had thought about adding some guide rods, or vertically lining the inner area between the shells with cylindrical bearings to provide constant tension, but I dismissed those ideas. 

Are there any additions I could tack on to this thing to make sure that it is as rock solid as it can get? I'd really appreciate any input/criticism that would enhance my design.

20,Project Ideas for High School Student interested in Mechanical or Civil Engineering,1438121140,"I have read the rules of the board, and I think this may be on the border of acceptable, but I thought it was worth a try.  I am mostly asking this question to this board as you all have gone through training to become an engineer and I think you all have an expertise in how to help foster someone's interest in engineering.

Background: I am a physics and math teacher with a degree in both fields and in astrophysics.  Most of my knowledge is theoretical and I have limited experience in building projects, in planning using a specific budget for a project, etc.

That being said, I have had the fortune of teaching a great student this past year who has gone from wanting to work in a library to wanting to do something in the application of physics.  She went to a camp this summer mostly for rising seniors as a rising junior and has asked for some support in continuing her experiences throughout the school year.  She is a rising junior, is going into Calculus and is studying physics for a second year.

Specifically she did the following (quoted from a recent email):

&gt;For Mechanical Engineering, we were shown a machine that, when the stick within it was rotated, would display the power/energy used/created when turning the stick. The goal of the lab was to construct something able to move the stick to generate the highest Wattage (or something along those lines), when held underneath a stream of running water from a sink. The provided materials were ""priced"", so the invention would have to be cheap, lightweight, and would have to work.

&gt;Another group project at the camp was to make a cardboard table out of a 60x60 in (I think) cardboard slab, with a seamless tabletop of 400 sq  in, which had to be balanced and had to withstand at least 400 lbs in a compressor.

&gt;The last group project my section did was for Civil Engineering, where we had to construct a two story model of a house (second floor had to be 18cm up from small cardboard base, and the entire building had to be at least 36 cm high) using plastic straws, a string, paperclips, and pins, all on top of the cardboard foundation. It would have to survive an earthquake simulation (being bounced around on a wooden slab connected by rubber bands to an outside rim) on its own, then with up to 10 bags of 250g of dirt, each.

&gt;All of these projects were great exercises in brainstorming, planning, trial and error, etc. (They were also a lot of fun!)

I am looking for projects or ideas for projects that might be able to take her from where she is now to greater heights.  A book or collection of projects / problems to solve may be best.

Or I am looking for a competition she could enter either in Arizona, or nationally to work towards.

The Catch: we are a small charter school with precious little money for a project with anything more than a few hundred dollars.

have a ridiculous amount of books and I want to make my bookshelves mobile, like the ones in the library/ filing archive.


I already have the shelves (and books!)  I just need to make them mobile.


Some considerations:

1) They will travel in straight line

2) they are quite tall (over 2m) but shallow (17cm, back to back makes 34cm) so I'm definitely worried about toppling

3) I have some concerns about tripping over rails on the floor/ difficulties in cleaning/ pet paws caught on rail etc.

4) I probably can't transport very large and heavy items like steel I-beams  (live on an island with limited transportation infrastructures) 


What would be the best setup for

1) maximum safety (prevent toppling over, ""derailing"" etc)

2) Good weight bearing capacity

3) least friction (i.e. least effort to move them, I'm a small woman)


I went to the hardware store, they have guide rails, linear bearings, ball bearings, casters, hard plastic wheels, rubber coated wheels (with littler ball bearings), groove wheels etc.  If none of them are good options I'm willing to look again, or order online.  I just want some pointers as to what are the pros and cons for each of these mechanisms.

27,Need general advice on the cooling requirements of a stationary motorcycle engine.,1438115619,"A friend's dad died recently and he wants to take the engine from his dad's motorcycle and incorporate it in to the tombstone but, he wants to be able to fire it up when he goes to the cemetery. My friend is obviously really busy with other stuff at the moment so I want to help him out with this project (circumstances aside, it's really cool) and that brings me here.

I'm not an engineer by any means but I think the main issue is cooling. As far as I know, most motorcycle engines are either air cooled or use an air cooled radiator, but have no fans whatsoever to pass air over the engine or radiator. I'm not sure what kind of engine his dad's motorcycle has but if it has a radiator then i think it will be pretty easy to attach a fan to it for cooling. He's probably only going to run it for 5min at a time so my questions are:

1. Will cooling actually be an issue if he only runs if for 5-10min a couple times a year?
2. If the engine is purely air cooled, and cooling is an issue, would it be possible to attach a heat sink of some kind to the engine, like a liquid cooling system for a pc?
3. If the engine is air cooled, and cooling is an issue, could we just use a large fan to cool the engine?

34,Recent environmental graduate looking to get into chemical engineering.,1438100620,"Crossposted from /r/chemicalengineering

I graduated this spring and currently work at a large civil consulting firm in their water/wastewater department. While I really enjoy doing process design for treatment systems, I'm not too passionate about the civil side of things i.e sewerage design, pump stations, etc. I'm getting great experience now but I really can't see myself in the AEC industry for more than a year or two. Based on how my hiring went I thought I would be doing a lot more process design but so far those have projects have been much less frequent. 

Unlike most civil/environmental engineers, my degree (bioenvironmental/bioresource) focuses a lot less on the civil side of environmental engineering and focuses much more on the chemical engineering side. I've taken a year of unit processes, thermodynamics, fate and transport, a year of organic chemistry and a bunch of other science based courses. My capstone project involved me designing an activated sludge SBR to treat wastewater and I had a great time doing it. 

In addition to my curriculum, three of my summer internships have all been laboratory based. Two were microbiology oriented (biophysics and bioremediation) and my third was in the R&amp;D department at a small chemical plant. Working at the chemical plant was a great experience because I also had the opportunity to work in the factory with the operators as well as the lab developing new chemicals and seeing how they scaled into the plant. 

With my curriculum and experiences in mind, how difficult would it be for me to transfer into the chemical engineering industry? I'm quite flexible in where I'd want to end up but being a process engineer at a chemical plant really interests me. Especially if it would be in wastewater treatment design. 

I understand that my major does not cover everything that a chemical engineering curriculum would, but I feel like my research experience and internship at a chemical plant could be enough to get me into the door. I'd also be willing to get my masters in chemical engineering in the future. What do you guys think?

47,Rigging Help,1438052912,"Hello,

My name is Brooke and I'm in the process of converting an old TV news truck into a mobile drive-in movie theater. I've come to the point in the project where I have the electronics figured out and I'm in the process of figuring out how to best mount my screen.

So the truck, has in its center a pneumatic boom, it raises to 40' tall. I have a 16'x9' piece of fabric I'm going to use as the screen. I've googled around and found lots of projects that highlight how to do something like this, but not with a single pole to mount everything to. In most cases, its two or three post that are on the sides and center. I've been looking at pictures of square sails and how those were made as I think that will be the closest thing to what I'm doing.

I'm looking for any advise on how to rig this thing up. Ideally it should be easy to take up, and bring down. Also wind is a factor as I live in the desert. (note I have no intention of having this thing hoisted in high winds)
I'm wondering if anyone has drawings, or video that could help me come up with something. All your advice is welcome and helpful.

Thanks, Brooke

I have a pump/motor system that has been seeing a high volume of maintenance issues due to its set up.  Right now, the pump/motor sit at floor level.  The room that it sits in has a moderate to high probability of flooding, causing water contamination to the motor ending in failure.  What I want to do is raise the motor a few feet from the floor and use a belt to transmit the power to the pump on the floor.

I have my calculations for belt/sheave design but what I do not know about is the overhung load exerted from this setup to the motor and how it will react.

To calculate the overhung load on a motor I would do the following:

F = (126,000*HP*Load Coeff. Factor*Load Location Factor*Safety Factor)/(Diameter of Sheave*Shaft Speed)

Now what I don't know is if all motors come standard with an allowable OHL.  If they do, and I am able to find it, all I would need to do is determine if the calculated OHL is within the allowable OHL.

54,Mechanical Engineer currently having a career identity crisis. Looking for some advice.,1438021390,"I’m a mechanical engineer about to go into my senior year of college, and I’m really having trouble figuring out what I want to do with my life. So far I’ve interned at 3 oil and gas companies and I’m about to have to decide whether I want to stay at this company and get paid well, but maybe not doing work I enjoy, or risk it and try for something better.

The great thing about this industry, obviously, is the pay. I would start out with at least a 6 figure salary, and would work either a 2 on 2 off schedule or a normal 40 hour work week. The issue is, I’m not sure if I’m really passionate about this work. So far I’ve found the 3 companies to be fairly interesting in terms of work, but nothing that I’m excited to do. I’ve never really had the feeling that I’m extremely passionate about what I’m doing.

So my first thought would be to try other industries. I’ve looked into automotive, product design, and even interviewed at several investment banking companies, but I’m just not sure. I fear that I could probably get bored at any of these companies as well, and most of them pay about half to 2/3 what I’ll be making here. As a mechanical, I’m lucky that I can go pretty much anywhere. To be honest, my dream would be to run my own business. I’ve done the startup route, and it was fun and exciting, but not something I could turn into a career. Maybe down the road when I have more capital, but it’s just not safe right now.

So I was hoping to get some advice. Is it just a childish dream that we should love the work we do? Should I suck it up for the money, or maybe go for something else that will pay less and maybe be equally unrewarding? Was hoping to get some feedback from those who went through similar situations.

I've been seriously looking into breaking into the budding renewables industry as a career path: it was my academic focus in college and it's something I'm really passionate about doing. However, it's been very hard figuring out a solid career path for breaking into it, especially at this early stage when I'm trying to get my foot in the door to get some direct work experience.

58,Seeking professional development guidance for first job out of college: Office Job or Lab Job?,1438014143,"Hi all,

I'd really like some advice on this. Any experience you'd like to share is very welcome!

I'm a senior undergrad studying Biomedical Engineering (for context: I'm in the US at a top-rated university). It's a very broad degree, and I plan on going to graduate school for a Master's Degree in a few years (M.Eng or otherwise; maybe in some kind of Chemistry). The Ph.D course is not for me. Ideally I'd get a job and have them pay for my degree. I've always seen myself ending up in a pharmaceutical-type of industry, but I'm not sure if I want to be there in the labs doing ""hard-science"" (R&amp;D) or in the offices at a desk.

I'm working on my thesis project right now that involves polymer chemistry and characterization, experimental design, microfluidics, and in-vitro/in-vivo testing for nanoparticle drug delivery in cancer. I'm really happy doing this work -- it's the science that I dreamed of as a child!

Before starting this project, I was thinking about becoming an engineering consultant as my first job out of college. I have a lot of varied interests, and I see this as a ~2-year gig that will expose me to different fields that I can explore and evaluate to better plan my career path. Maybe this will lead to me getting an MBA or or MEng and continuing with industry / office jobs. Maybe it will dissuade me from the office jobs and lead to me working lab jobs and going for the strictly science/eng graduate degrees. I have no idea at this point, but I think that's alright.

My biggest worry right now is that I'm afraid of locking myself into one path or the other depending on what I choose as my first job after graduation. I see this as a ""fork"" in my career path, and I'm unsure of which road to take. Both seem to offer unique intrinsic benefits, but if I start down one of them for a few years I'm afraid that I won't be able to switch over to the other one if I decide the first is not for me.

Has anyone been in this situation before? Has anyone switched from hard-science to an office job or vice versa?

Again, any experience is very much appreciated! I'm looking for a bit of perspective to help me figure out my plan moving forward.

59,Limiting factors of RPM on a lathe,1438013809,"Hi folks,

I'm a machinist / programmer, and I'm looking to calculate a maximum ""safe"" speed at which to turn our raw material.

We're in the process of upgrading to some new inserts, which are designed for a surface speed of roughly 2x to 2.5x what we're running right now. For parts with small internal diameters, to reach that speed (1475sfm, 7.5m/s) we'll need way more RPM than I'm comfortable (or have experience) with... I'm also writing software that will assemble programs based off our Solidworks drawings (and each program needs a max spindle speed designated)... and to top it off, I'm a committee member on the OHSC, so I want to make sure I get the math right.

What is most likely to fail first as the RPM grows? The chuck jaws opening or deforming? The motor for the axis pushing the insert? The steel going all-in gumby style?

My gut feeling is that we'll be limited by the rigidity of our work-holding on long or thin-wall pieces (introducing chatter) long before anything failing becomes a concern (we're already nearing those limits on our longest / thinnest parts), but on our smaller/stockier/bulkier parts, we can hold the piece very well and the cutter happily dives in the faster we go (drying up all my courage before we hit even 60% of the chuck/machine ""maximum"").

The material is almost exclusively [1026 steel](http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6583), with the occasional [4140](http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6769), the chucks are [Kitagawa B210](http://www.kitagawaeurope.com/power-chucks/open-centre-chucks/b-200/b-210)'s, the machines are late-model small Okuma/Haas, and if I've not provided enough information, please let me know!

60,Discussion: what weekly topics do you want to see?,1438013318,"Hey everyone. I apologize for the lack of updates, but unfortunately work has gotten busy for me so I don't spend (as much) time on reddit these days.

I wanted to get some quick feedback from the community based on some recent observations, and also to get comments on anything I've overlooked. Specifically, how are the weekly threads doing?

You can find our last discussion about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2klfx4/which_topics_would_you_like_to_see_as_weekly/).

### Here's my take on the current state of weekly topics:

1. **[Career Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/search?q=career+wednesdays&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)** is doing fairly well, meaning most top-level questions get some sort of helpful reply, and followup replies. The thread doesn't seem to interfere with /r/engineering's Monday career/hiring threads, and probably helps users that miss it.

1. **[Failure Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/search?q=failure+friday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)** does exceedingly well on some days, with some [great stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/39kp18/failure_friday_june_12_2015_did_you_break/cs4pe6e) showing up occasionally... and other times not much. But it seems to be doing its job of letting people blow off some steam after a long work week, so it'll stay for sure.

1. Speaking of failures, **[Sci-Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/search?q=sci-friday&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)** seems to do consistently poorly so I'm thinking of taking it off the rotation, and make Failure Friday happen every week.

**If there's a weekly topic you'd like to see, or if you have any general feedback/suggestions, please comment!**

73,How do you calculate energy absorption of a viscoelastic material in collision?,1437953500,"So the scenario is that an object (lets say a rectangular prism with a mass of 1 kg), is dropped 1 meter onto a very hard surface (maybe cement).  The object has a 2mm thick layer of a viscoelastic material on all sides.  It impacts the surface perfectly on one side (dimensions of the side are 10mm by 100mm). 

It's easy enough to calculate the energy and velocity of the object immediately before colliding with the surface.

How could I calculate the amount of energy that the viscoelastic shell would dissipate?  I either want to calculate that or a rough estimate of the max acceleration felt by the object, but I feel like the energy dissipation/absorption would be easier to calculate.

It's a somewhat complex scenario, so I know that it would be a very rough estimate and that more assumptions should be made to simplify it (the temperature is 75 degrees fahrenheit....).  What material properties of the viscoelastic material are necessary to know? (I've seen some data sheets listing things like bulk modulus and stress at 20% compression, but that's about it.)  Do I need to know the modulus to strain rate relationship to come up with any estimation?  In what ways could I simplify the scenario further to come to a rough conclusion before moving to actual testing?

1. MS v. PhD

2. ME vs. BME (or something else?)

3. Is there an area of research for bionics (a broader area) that can help me narrow my search? I'm having difficulty using the term ""bionics"" for phd programs because that's generally not a wider area of study.

82,"I need help with ""comp time."" I am accruing comp time way faster than I can use it or cash it out.",1437897126,"I can't divulge too many details about my situation because I want this to be as anonymous as possible for obvious reasons (hence the throwaway account). I work for a company that pays ""comp time"" which is a regularly hourly rate for us salary workers. We are exempt. We have so much work to do, we are constantly working 60-80 hour weeks and we are all accruing comp time that is basically being saved by the company. We can take time off and use that comp time, or we can cash it out. But we are only allowed to cash out 20 hours per check. So if we are working 60 hours a week, there will be 20 hours adding to our bank of comp time per paycheck. This really bothers me because there is so much work to do that taking time off (to use that comp time) is not realistic. It would cause serious problems with the projects that we manage. You can't just leave in the middle of a project, nor can you wait until there is a break or ""slow time"" because there NEVER is any of that! It's always long long hours and in the years that I've been working there, we have never had a slow week (40 hour week). 

Many of us working there have hundreds of comp time hours saved up (held by the company). Employees that left the company were not paid their comp time (one employee lost $10,000 worth of comp time when he left the company). They do not give us all of our comp time in our last check. So I am not sure what to do. Even if I took some time off, that would not even put a dent in the amount of comp time hours that I have saved up. I would still have a few hundred left. Is anybody else in this situation? Is there some way to mitigate this? I do not think the law legally requires them to pay us for our comp time, so I feel that this is very unfair for the amount of time we sacrifice out of our lives to make sure the work gets done. I barely have time to take care of my responsibilities with my house, bills, and chores. No more hobbies, there is not enough time. When you work 12-14 hours a day, it leaves almost no time for anything else besides sleep.

Could somebody that has experience with this give me some advice?

I had to turn a few down because I am not going to take a pay cut switching jobs. I have more interviews coming up in the following weeks and those are in a totally different industry, so those might actually work out. I appreciate all the advice. I could get my comp time in writing, but doing so would hint to the company that I'm leaving. If they know I'm concerned with losing comp time, that only means one thing: he/she is leaving and wants to make sure they get paid for their overtime hours. So until then, I will have to strategize so that I am working less than the max I can cash out.**",AskEngineers,Legalcat14,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3en44j/i_need_help_with_comp_time_i_am_accruing_comp/

88,How to transmit rotary force without physical contact? I want a 100% waterproof motor,1437882343,"I want to build a robot that lives **underwater** indefinitely in a swimming pool.

I have external manipulators that are going to rotate. The gears and other mechanisms can get wet, but the motors have to be protected from water.

That means I need to have either a) motors that are sealed from the factory (very expensive) or b) get ordinary motors and encase them in a watertight enclosure/  The enclosure is the easy part. Eventually you need a shaft to come out into the water to rotate the robot's manipulators etc.  So then the problem becomes how to get a rotating shaft to exit the  enclosure (in deep water, let's say 6 feet) without leaking water into the enclosure.  It seems the common approach is a rubber rotary seal that goes around the output shaft to prevent water from coming in. With either A or B, the seals are organic materials, they eventually break down and leak water, damaging/destroying the motor and possibly the electronics.

So I started thinking, what if I eliminate the shaft, and transmit the rotary force through electro/magnetic fields?  Then my motor could be in a completely watertight enclosure, guaranteed to stay dry for a very long time.  I see on my electric toothbrush it somehow charges by induction yet the toothbrush and charger are both watertight plastic, there are no electrodes.  If I can transmit electrical energy across a watertight plastic, can I transmit torque the same way, through electromagnetic induction or whatever?

**More info, added July 26:**

The fluid is tap water, left to sit for an unknown amount of time before being cleaned. The water might be replaced once a day, or once a year.  It might be clean or dirty (but definitely not saltwater).

Even though I recently completed my bachelors in biomedical engineering, this was the best offer I received at the time and I really liked a lot about the company. The position is also of interest to me but, as mentioned, it's more of a technician position than an engineering one. While my job description does state that I'll be supporting the engineers, that's very vague and I won't really know about how I feel towards the position until I get started.
Yesterday, I got a phone call from an agency to gauge my interest in an engineering position with a global healthcare company. I've spoken with agencies before regarding career opportunities and my experience with them has been a mixed bag. The position, on paper, is clearly more related to my major than my current full-time position and both companies are equally as valuable to work for. The only thing is, the engineer position is a contract for about 7 months, with the potential for an extension.
So I guess you can see where my dilemma is. I've broken down the information for both sides to the best of my knowledge.


Company A - Currently with 1. Position: Full-Time (employee at will) in **maintenance** 2. Salary: Slightly above $27/hour 3. Very good benefits, pretty good vacation 4. Location from home: 45-50 min drive 5. Company focus is in medical products.


Company B 1. Contract position for 7 or more months as an **entry level engineer**, with the potential to lead to a full-time position. 2. Salary: ~$31.50/ hour 3. Assuming no benefits or vacation since it is a contract position. 4. Location from home: 50-55 min drive 5. Company focus is in global healthcare


I'm not going to think too much about it unless I hear back from Company B regarding an interview but I wanted to hear your opinion before that point. The main conflict for me is that the position I am in with Company A, while full-time, isn't that related to my major. Company B is offering a position that is related to my major but its a contract position so no benefits or job security. My thoughts, as of now, is that in event I do receive an offer, try to either talk with Company B about possibly making it a full-time position or talking to my boss in Company A about Company B's offer and seeing if I could, at some point, move to an engineering role within Company A.

0,Hydraulic to pneumatic,1437833952,"Today I bought an air over hydraulic ram as part of a little project of making an aluminium can crusher, just for my own amusement.

I wanted a 2 or 3 inch pneumatic cylinder, but these seem to cost a ridiculous amount, so when I saw an air over hydraulic ram, I bought it, without really realising what I was buying.

In short, the air pump for it is ridiculously slow, so slow that there's no point using it, which I'm not.

As it's hydraulic, I have to use it vertically, which doesn't really suit my needs, but will do.
The main problem though is, while it's an 8 ton ram, I can only fit 16 cans or so in the wooden frame I've made and crush them and in the time it takes for that, it's easier and faster to just stomp the cans flat instead.

So, what I've been reading about is running a hydraulic ram on air instead.
I have an air compressor already, which can supply a tad under 120psi.
Unfortunately I haven't found any pages which explain HOW to run a hydraulic ram on air.

Can I just drill and tap the release valve and fit an air fitting in there? Looking at how bottle jacks, etc, work, it looks like this is how to do it.

This will let me use the ram as a pneumatic cylinder, I know it won't be 8 tons, but it should be pretty good. I'll be happy to just crush one can at a time at a quick rate.

TL;DR - How do I run a hydraulic ram pneumatically instead?


Edit: I unbolted the bolt that the... plunger (?) goes in, the cylinder was the size of an air fitting, so I bought an imperial tap and die set, tapped the hole that the plunger went in and bolted an air fitting straight in.
This is better and a lot safer I guess, than tapping the release valve hole, as it means only the high pressure side of the ram ever sees the 100 psi pressure from my compressor.
I just need to buy a strong spring so it'll automatically return when I release the pressure.

The force from the ram running fully pneumatically is enough to crush 4 aluminium cans to about an inch flat at the same time. Fun.",AskEngineers,finger_blast,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3ek7kh/hydraulic_to_pneumatic/

Say you have a rectangular board, like a table top, with castor wheels on the corner. So the board will move along the ground rotating freely around when a force is applied. Then add springs attached to the middle of the castors wheel on either side and to the board. Now the board will roll forward in one direction and only have limited range in the turn (as the springs attached to the boar prohibit the full rotation of the castor wheel) when force is applied to it and then return to it's original position. Ok so the question is; if you had a bar on either side of the castor wheels, from the middle of the wheel to the top of the castor and instead have the spring attached to the top of that, is the a way to get the bar to be in two halfs and have the bottom one rotate 180 degrees while the top stays in the same position?

11,How to calculate the weighted base/legs for an LED TV standing arm mount?,1437767630,"I am working out how to build a standing mount that will allow me to have a 39"" LED TV (&lt;50lbs) ""Hover"" over me in bed. The rough idea is:

||======== [_TV _]

|| (-------------------------------Bed-----------------------------------)

||========= (legs under bed)

So it would be two or more 2x4 ""legs"" supporting a vertical 2x4, which has the ""arm"" attached to the top. I then mount the TV to the arm via a small tilt mount.

* How do I determine how long to make the legs?

* Should I just use a weighted base instead?

* How do I calculate how much weight to use?

* Is there a better overall (cheap) way to do this?

17,What base salary do I need to see in order to accept this offer?,1437750061,"Welp, I've offered up my personal experiences and advice in this sub before, so I'm hoping you all may be able to help me find my way through this decision.  I have a new job offer on the table that I'm considering, so I need to figure out if I stay or if I go.  For those kids out there, this is also an example of job shit you need to consider.  Here's the details:
 
Format will be CURRENT/OFFER
 
- Base: $81,500 / $85,000
- OT: $39.18/hr / $40.86/hr (both after 40 hrs)
- Annual Bonus: 10% min / none, but $3,000 one time signing bonus
- Insurance Premiums: $0 / $1200 annual minimum
- Vacation: 10 days / 14 days
- Sick: 10 days / 5 days
- Holidays: 8 days / 9 days
 
To this point, I look at total compensation as follows:
 
Current = 81500 * 1.10 = $89,650 w/ 28 paid days off
Offer = 85000 - 1200 = $83,800 w/ 28 paid days off
 
I see the $3,000 as a nice gesture, but not a deal maker in the grand scheme of things.  From compensation side, I have to go with my current position.  Now, culture related items:
 
- Office with lake view / Cube in the cube city
- Some travel, typically 2 weeks to 3 months duration / Some travel, typically 1 week or less
- Moderate job security, did recently go through layoffs / No layoffs in 18 years
- I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt / Jeans and a polo seem about right
- Genuinely want me here in 10 years / Genuinely interested in providing me a long term future
- Make my own hours and work from home as needed / Flex is limited to nine 9 hr days and every other Friday off
- 15 minute commute / 30 minute commute
- Similar OT for both
 
On the culture side, I think I definitely prefer my current job.  So it's probably pretty obvious I should reject the offer, but here's the X factor: a higher compensation is being negotiated.  Let's say they come back with $100,000 base, then the revised total is $98,800, a 10% bump.  Is 10% enough?  What if it's 110K?  150K?  OT goes up accordingly too.  What base salary do I need to see in order to accept this offer?  This isn't a decision I have ever come across, so I'm hoping to draw from others' experiences.

[This is a cross section of a differential drive in a pan/roll head I'm building](http://imgur.com/OHgRUZn).  When the J &amp; K motors turn together, A pans around I.  When they turn opposite, A rolls around H.  The yellow parts are 3d printed.  the green are laser cut.  the red are bearings.  The grey I have to buy or already own.  I is a smooth 8mm bolt.  H is a 1/4"" hex bolt that does not roll.

The big picture is that I need to measure the angle of pan and roll, instantaneously.  Backing up to hit a switch and counting from there is not good enough.  

My current plan is to measure rotation of D and C to calculate pan/roll.  I have [12-bit hall effect rotary encoder](http://www.madscientisthut.com/Shopping/agora.cgi?cart_id=7888236.19069&amp;product=CNC%20/%20Robotic%20Sensors&amp;user4=Rotary%20Encoder&amp;xm=on).  A small magnet turns 1mm away from a chip, the chip picks up the magnetic field and calculates the angle.  For this to work one magnet needs to be centered on the axis of rotation of C and another needs to be centered on the axis of rotation of D.

Both halves are symmetrical, so consider one half of the problem: C needs to somehow go through B1, over I, and hold the magnet in place.  It can't permanently block access to I and it needs to turn with low friction.  How do I do that?  [Something like this](http://i.imgur.com/VqGtj87.jpg)?

To further complicate my life, the budget is very small.  I don't have access to a break press, a milling machine, a lathe, or any kind of metal cutting.  I can get most any kind of bearing and open timing belt.  Endless timing belts are way out.

the gangway runs east-west, so the mirrors would be sloping straight out from the house, or with some sort of bifurcation to account for sun movement from east to west.

they would be affixed with rigid metal to the house, water-proofed with clear spray and with a space at the bottom to let rain escape. maybe bring them in for the winter to account for snow accumulation or just add it to the list of things to brush off. cleaning should be easy as they would be within arms reach (or with a short brush) out the window. integrity of design is important so backing the mirror with wood is probably in order.

(Each point with a tensile test has fiber data associated with it.)

My thought on determining the system model is to analyse 1 input variable and hold the others constant to determine the impact on the output quality and then repeat for the other input variables. Is this a realistic approach? The main problem with this is the fiber characteristics all change when the refining of the fiber changes. So to hold the fiber properties constant is pretty much impossible (There will be hardly any valid points to determine the impact.)

Basically here is my scenario: I've got a BS in Electrical Engineering, and am working on my masters in Applied Physics (Optics). I'm looking to work full time as I'm finishing up my Masters. My significant other has one more year to complete his Electrical Engineering degree. Since I started my Masters right after graduating (like a few days after), I haven't really had any time off. 

I was wondering how possible it would that before my boyfriend starts his job after he graduates that I could ask for a month or two of unpaid vacation, at which point I would be with the company for 9 months.  I also have family abroad, and family in other states, so I would like to spend time with them as well since I have had very little time with them over the past 5 years. Would I be better off sucking it up and not taking this trip, quitting my job and finding a new one after some time off, or do you think a company would be willing to allow that amount of unpaid time off? What do you think is the maximum acceptable amount of time off for a first position? I'm looking for Jobs mainly in Portland and the Bay area, and I do need to take a job now (traveling now is not an option).

Hi, I'm a Mechanical Engineer I'm in the final year of a part time masters degree. I have also worked in the aerospace industry for 9 years doing gearbox development test/design work.
I have a problem in that my skills/interests seem too stretched and broad. I'm interesting in a wide range of engineering disciplines and I have a fairly good academic understanding of them (fluids/stress/dynamics/control/modelling etc..) however I feel that I'm not an expert in any one area which is bothering me. I get the jist of what people are talking about from a technical point of view but I'm not sure I'd be able to do the analysis or work on my own.
For example, earlier this week I was at a meeting and one of more senior guys said ""I'll do a calc on that to check the affects"" (because of a small manufacturing defect on a part). My question is how does he do this etc? How do you learn the process to do this? Is there software the I'm not aware of or standards for this particular analysis that I'm just not aware of?
In the past two weeks I have attempted to educate myself with Simulink and I have also asked to get PATRAN/NASTRAN analysis tools on my work PC so I can use and become proficient in them but I'm not sure this is the right way to go about this.

In those cases, however, everything was spelled out for me (+ purchased for me), and I never wired a panel with an E-Stop.

This application is for homebrewing (Beer, not software or whatever else).  I intend on using either a PID controller or Raspberry Pi (Leaning towards the Pi) to control a SSR, which controls a 240v heating element.

[Here's the portion of the diagram that's got me stuck.](http://i.imgur.com/zNfULWd.png)  I didn't zoom in enough when snipped, that fuse is 2A slow blow - there shouldn't be too much current in this control circuit.  I've got a good grasp on everything downstream, and I think I've sorted everything for this out in my mind while typing this up, but I want to be 100% sure.  This relay will control the contactor, which will control the power to the whole panel, and will allow me to get a proper E-Stop in there.  Other homebrewing panel wiring diagrams have an E-Stop set up to intentionally trip a GFCI, but that really bothers me and I know that's bad practice.

I just want to make sure I know how this circuit works.  Does the whole thing stay connected because the middle input (left) continues to power the relay, even after the momentary switch is re-opened?  That's what makes sense to me.

77,Isosclese triangle? No. YOU-sosclese triangle.,1437524165,"Ok. I'm having a woodworker make a cabinet for below my television.  Unfortunately, because of joist placement, and the type of wall mount we had, the TV is mounted at an uneven angle.  Like, it's doesn't sit symmetrically in the corner. My girl friend has an obsession with things looking centered.  The TV being off center with the corner is a lot for her to handle but she's managing ;).  I was hoping at the the very least, I could have a cabinet built that sits under the TV and from the front, fits evenly below the TV.   Here's the rub- We want the cabinet to be shaped (from an overhead perspective) like an isoclese triangle so that it can be used in our next home.  If we build a cabinet that exactly mimics the shape the TV makes with the walls, we will have an odd shaped (scalene) triangle shaped cabinet.  No good.  

Measurements:
width of TV                                                    52""
distance from the wall to left edge of TV       42""
distance from the wall to right edge of TV     33""

what is the widest a cabinet be, have it be centered below the tv, not extend beyond the front of the TV and still be an Isosclese triangle?

https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3e3t98/can_you_push_two_solutions_into_a_container_with/

It was recommended I ask you folks about how to accomplish my goal.

To give a bit more info, I need to infuse N2 into H2O. I need approx 1bar higher pressure with agitation in a sealed container to make this happen.

CO2 will carbonate water nicely at low temps, but N2 is much trickier. I don't need a whole lot, just enough to add some nice ""mouthfeel"" to it.

An aspirator was suggested and flipping the liquid and gas positions, I also considered a carburetor setup, but that would have to cycle...

Ideally, it would be set up so that you could open of a faucet (coming out of the sealed container) and let it run without it having to cycle and still accomplish the goal of ""nitrogenating"" the water.

Ive designed all of the rest of the device I need to build, this last step is killing me though...

It may not be that I need immense pressure, but just more volumes present in the liquid. The reverse-aspirator idea is interesting. Also, perhaps running the water through a mesh of sorts that has the gas also being injected?

80,Why are some freeway bridges built as 2 separate structures?,1437513440,"I'm sure there are countless exceptions, but I've noticed that many interstate bridges/overpasses are built as separate structures for each direction. Many times they are within feet of each other. For interstates in particular I've always guessed that one major reason is so that, in failures of one structure, vehicles can at least detour onto the opposite direction's bridge and continue to flow at a reduced, but existent, capacity. I've also guessed that it could be for embankment/drainage purposes, as well as simply that if the two directions are far enough apart it just makes more sense to build two. It could just as easily be all of these reasons.

Of course every one of these structures are built on a case by case basis so it's possible for all kinds of variations and exceptions, I'm just curious as to whether or not there is an underlying rule for it. I've had trouble finding any kind of discussion about it online. 

Also, fyi the question is inspired by the collapse of a portion of I10 in Cali between Phx and LA.

&gt;As the stage accelerates and G forces rise, you would expect materials in the stage to be pushed down, but instead they want to float up. Buoyancy of materials within the stage increase proportionally to G ratings. So as more G forces are exerted on the rocket, the more buoyant the tanks inside become. The purpose of the struts is to keep the tanks in place.

They suspect a tank strut failed, causing the premature release of liquid helium.  The bottle the helium is contained in is held to the chassis by struts.  What I don't understand is why the tank would have a tendency to become *more* buoyant as acceleration increases.  Is this simply analogous to the phenomena of a helium balloon moving from the back seat of a car to the front under acceleration?  

I'm having a hard time imagining that the liquid helium would behave like gaseous helium in this case.",AskEngineers,ihateusedusernames,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3e30m4/a_question_on_the_spacex_failure_of_june_28/

It should deliver 0 gpm at 63 psi, 5 gpm at 50 psi, 10 GPM at 40 psi, 16.5 gpm at 30 psi, and 17.5 gpm at 20 psi.

As it is right now, the pump has some incredible wear on the intake area. What remains of some kind of seal is a rusted metal ring inside the plastic housing, it is not smooth, it is as if it was knurled, but the bumps have worn down, also the diameter changes, so something had to have been there.

The impeller is relatively untouched however there are two divots in the impeller.. as if, there once was two rubber seals that rubbed on the plastic?

So I'm intending to make an aluminium sleeve to press fit on the intake surface of the impeller, then find some material to build up the other surface.

As it is right now I've got at least a 1/16th inch diameter difference between the impeller and the plastic housing that fits over the impeller, as a result I suspect I'm getting a maximum pressure of 30 to 40 psi.

Forgive me for not being too specific.  I hope this is enough detail as to get some quick advice and save me some groundwork.  I have no recent experience in metal fabrication.

I have had an idea and I would like to construct a prototype.  I need a metal frame that would go inside a gas grill, right on top of the grates.  So it needs to be reasonably heat-friendly.  I will also need some stainless steel for the parts that will contact food.  I think maybe 1/4"" steel sheetmetal, folded, for the frame.  I wouldn't know how to protect it from rust though.  Powdercoat?  I also don't know how to make the stainless prongs for the food.  

I worked in a local sheet metal factory when I was a teenager and I could maybe ask them to make the frame.  I don't recall any of the sheet steel there having been food-grade or anything.  I wouldn't know where to start for that.

Last consideration is price.  If the prototype is successful, I'd want to manufacture it in the USA, legally, and pay a living wage.  So I don't want to completely overspend for materials either.

34,What to do with A/C causing too much voltage drop?,1437320116,"I was here not too long ago asking about alternatives to an air conditioner unit.  I ended up buying an A/C unit along with a ""kill a watt"" watt meter and it turns out that the A/C unit causes a huge voltage drop (I think it hit 70 volts on one of the outlets I tested) so that the compressor turns off between 5 seconds to 2 minutes after I turn it on (large difference due to different outlets).

This is a floor a/c unit because I cannot install a window unit in the apartment.  The unit's nameplate (the only place I can find power as even the stores people had no idea when I was buying it) states this draws 9.4A.  This was the second smallest A/C unit I could buy, it can handle up to 300 sqft and since I have a very large apartment and my living room is actually larger than that anyway...

Right now the only thing I can think of is to return the 300 sqft unit and get the 200 sqft unit and *hope* that it draws little enough power to be able to actually run.  I would expect the current to be about 20% less as the unit I bought is 10,000 BTU and the smaller one is 8,000 BTU.

To be honest, I really do not even want to get the smaller unit because even if the voltage drop is not enough to turn the compressor off it would probably be enough to damage the compressor over time and it will wear out quickly.  There are really only 2 outlets I can use however.  One is a 20A fuse the other is a 15A, but the 15A has my massive gaming pc + projector so realistically speaking I only have the 20A fuse.  The 20A fuse is the one where the voltage drops too low within 5-10 seconds interestingly whereas the 15A lasts much longer (maybe less wire was used from fuse panel to the 15A fuse?).

So the question is: can I even have an A/C unit and if so is there something I should do additionally?  Example, I know industrial places uses capacitor banks to up the voltage, but this is not at that scale!

My question to you Reddit is can you help me devise a system to breed tilapia in a more efficient manner than we currently have in place. As of right now we have a several thousand liter tilapia pond that is on the property. The only issue with this is that it can only breed one generation of tilapia at a time due to the fact that you cannot have both fingerlings, juveniles, and adults in the same pond. With the limited resources (money, equipment, land, etc) What would be the best way to have a multi-generational system were we could be eating tilapia all year round?

The idea I had was to purchase a large(sizes range from the very large 6000L to smaller ones of 210L) ""TopTank"" that are sold in the near by city of Kisii and use this as a breeder tank. With that being said I understand that air stones and sunlight are needed for the fish to thrive. Am I totally off base with this idea or can something like this be accomplished?

I want to take the mold of a plastic screw in hole about 1.75 inches long and about 1 inch wide. I basically want to make a mold of the plastic screw that already threads into the plastic threaded hole. I am wondering what I could use to make this mold so that I can get a better picture of what part of my product will look like with the correct threading to attach to the already created product. Is there anything that I can use to take this mold (pour in plastic, pour in rubber-not sure if it would thread in the plastic hole, etc.)?

Thanks in advance for any advice!
Edit: here is a similar design to what fills the plastic screw hole. I guess what I am trying to say is how can I go about making a plastic/rubber screw in to fit the hole that threads?

My site-planner's initial design for the wooded lot called for the removal of a stand of mature trees to make space for a rain garden. What!!? Long story short,
I need to be directed to a tutorial that will let me do my own
analysis. 

The county manual gives a formula that says that the volume 
of water that needs to be handled is a function of 
        1. The rainfall target
        2. A ""dimensionless volumetric runoff coefficient

This obviously ignores the runoff coefficient of the pervious
area, which will be between 0.0 and 1.0. If my house could be
surrounded by a magical ground cover with a coefficient
of 0.0, I should have no runoff subject to regulation, right? In fact,
it will be surrounded by woods with a coefficient of between
.10 and .30. I need to know how to compute the actual runoff
at the property boundary that is attributable to the roof and
other impervious areas, given the actual ground cover. If the
result is sufficiently more favorable to me that what the county
computes, I will ask for a variance from the regulations.

I also have a valid U.S. passport. I came here as a non U.S. citizen. When my father became naturalized back in 2001, I was below 18 at the time and as such I automatically became a citizen through his naturalization. At least that's what I think happened. The choices offered to me in section 9 of SF-86 does not reflect my current citizenship status.     
Here are the choices: 

* 1)  I am a U.S. citizen or national by birth in the U.S. or U.S. territory/commonwealth.    
* 2)  I am a U.S. citizen or national by birth, born to U.S. parent(s), in a foreign country.

The house is large; 2 finished floors and an unfinished basement, with fairly generous ""ceiling"" clearance. There are several I-Beams in place supporting the house in the basement that are anchored on the bottom in the cement foundation.

The supports under those I-beams look like this:

http://i.imgur.com/1lk3jAN.jpg

That cylindrical support at the bottom of the photo goes down into the foundation with that screw-like shape where it joins the I beam going into the cement. Two questions:

1. Imagine ~400 lbs or so suspend between two of these, with motion creating additional stress. The anchor points would be the hammock twine around something. Would this be at all bad, or is this structure here so strong that that weight should be negligible? For the purposes of this, assume we looped the hammock anchor around the narrower part of the support beam, just under the I-beam.

2. Is the diagonal metal bolted into the wooden part of the structure likewise safe?

Physically the whole thing feels rock solid to me, unsurprisingly, and I tend to feel personally that the whole thing is designed to maintain structural integrity despite small shifts due to soil compression/etc, and so the stress of the entire weight of the house vs one hammock is so hilariously outsized that the hammock is a non-issue, but I wanted to get an opinion from someone with structural/civil engineering expertise.

90,equations for simulating a pneumatic damper to absorb impact energy?,1437010525,"Hello,

Just wondering if their is an equation for how much energy a pneumatic damper would absorb in a given impact, given it has a single orifice, open to the environment.

I'm looking for a general solution, but if you like specific examples: say you have a 22 kg object impact a damper piston at 16 km/h. The piston inside the damper has a bore of 50 mm, with a stroke of a 1/2 meter. 

The damper is a simple pneumatic cylinder, with an orifice open to the environment. How can I figure out how much energy the damper absorbs from the impact, so that I can choose an orifice size that completely decelerates the vehicle within that 1/2 meter stroke.

92,How can a n00b become a better engineer,1437002148,"So I just graduated as an ME. Did pretty awesome in school, and found most of technical topics fairly easy to grasp. Struggled a bit with the design courses but did relatively well in them nevertheless.

&amp;nbsp;


Having fixed cars my whole life, I'm fairly in touch with the hands on and physical aspects of engineering. It's the soft side that I can't seem to master as well. Dare I say, I am struggling at my job?

&amp;nbsp;


I'm doing machine design work and work cell design with a consulting company. So basically picking off the shelf components, and integrating them together in Solidworks. While the technical elements are no sweat for me, I find myself not working very efficiently. Whether this feeling is justified or not is debatable but I feel that I am taking more time to complete my job than it should and it is stressing me out.

&amp;nbsp;


Engineering is an application of science for achieving practical goals. Verifying the science is no sweat for me (ex. figuring out the size of a bolt, stress verifications, pump calculations, etc) but coming up with my own bespoke designs that work is challenging. Often I would have to go through several design iterations before I converge on a solution that works, or I would design myself into a dead end because I neglected to consider a key factor earlier on.

&amp;nbsp;


How can I become a more efficient engineer? People say design is an iterative process, and while there is some truth to that, the first iteration should be 90% correct with the subsequent iterations fixing the little gremlins. My iterations for the most part are radical reworks.

So I'm starting to have some real problems at my new job.  To give you some back story, I graduated with a degree in Electronics Engineering Technology a few years ago have worked as an electronic technician on various systems including radars from the time I graduated until a few months ago when I got a new job as an entry level Electrical Engineer.  When I was going through the interview/onboarding, my new employer was very close to the chest about what they'd be having me doing at the new job, but they were very attracted to my radar experience.  So I figured that because they hired me due to my radar experience that that was what I'd be doing, or would at least be given an opportunity to learn more about EM.

Now that I've been at this job a few months now, it's become evident that I was hired to be their go-to ""radar guy"" who is knowledgeable about the engineering aspects of radar systems.  I'm starting to be asked more and more questions about radars and various EM questions.  The problem is is that I have close to zero EM experience - not a one class about Electromagnetics, along with almost no calculus experience (I'm currently taking Calc 1).  I feel like a piece of shit everytime I get asked and have to reply with ""no idea"".

Our options are stainless steel direct metal printing (DMP), Powder sintering, or cast. We have our eye on stainless steel direct printing since the cost of cast aluminum was too high ($1,100) and weight isn't a huge concern (comes out to about 150 grams for stainless frame).

15,"(BSChE) Unsure of what to do when I graduate: work for a few years, or go straight to grad school?",1436922604,"Hello, AskEngineers!

I was hoping the community could give me some perspective on my future plans and opportunities, since I feel like I am at a crossroads.

I have one semester left of school (US), so in December I will graduate with degrees in both Chemical Engineering and Paper Science Engineering.  I got recruited into paper mainly because I was offered a scholarship upon entering the ChE program if I did a dual major, and I like that it is a relatively green industry.  Since my paper program does a great job of getting students jobs, I have pretty much only worked in paper (three internships, one co-op, and one summer lab assistant position), though I did spend one summer after freshman year as an EH&amp;S intern for a pharmaceuticals company and the summer before my senior year of high school working for the EPA.  I have a good amount of experience, but working in paper mills has shown me that I really don't want to work as a process engineer; partly because I feel the culture/location of a mill/chemical plant will not suit me, and partly because the constant optimization and reliability work just doesn't get me jazzed.

Recently, I have been toying with the idea of going to grad school to make an impact in the renewable energy sector (solar, fuel cells, biofuels, etc.), or maybe green materials (e.g., plastics from cellulosic sugars); I want to help solve some of the world's problems, a la the Grand Challenges for Engineering.  From looking at jobs with some of these focuses online, it seems pretty much all of them require some type of graduate degree.

Most of the ""research"" work I have done so far has mostly just been working in the lab following someone's directions, so I have not really had the opportunity to lead a research project.  I intend to work for my adviser this coming semester on a project of his, but I am not sure if that will be enough research experience to prepare me for grad school.  I have a 4.0 GPA, so my adviser said I shouldn't have much trouble getting into a top grad school, but I have heard without research experience many grad schools will not even consider you.  

I think I want to work for a few years before I start grad school, though, to bolster my finances and make sure I am not worried about money while also devoting my time to research and/or rigorous coursework.  However, I really do not want to just take a job I will hate for a few years just to make some money.  Could I get any type of research job as an entry-level engineer to get my foot in the door, then progress once I have an MS or PhD?  I have not seen many jobs in the fields I am interested in that require less than a graduate degree (and/or several years of specialized experience), and even then I am sure the competition is fierce.

I'm not sure if I'm just worrying too much at this point, but soon it will be time for me to make a choice one way or the other.  I know I want to go to grad school, I am just not sure if I should go straight there, or if I will be able to find a job I could work and not hate with just a BS degree.

I see myself as having 2 options. 1: I can get an MBA or 2: I get an MSE with a focus in design and manufacturing.

My question is: as someone who wants to lead design teams and manage stuff like that, which graduate degree is going to be more worth pursuing? I'm leaning for the MSE. If you have a similar background, would you mind sharing your choice and the outcome?

Some pics for reference: http://m.imgur.com/a/NQgXa

Converting a carport to screen porch - previous owner built it all - and would like to widen the space between studs to increase viewable area to yard. 
Currently the end wall consists of 4 4x4s that are 4 feet apart (16' span total) and between each pairing of 4xs are two 2xs @ 24"" oc .... 
Ideally, I would like to eliminate the 2x4s and split the difference with one 4x column between what is currently there (so 7 4xs across a 16' span approx 36"" oc)

Some info in the spots link:
- double top plate acting as header, unfortunately no 2x6+ or this would be easy. Side walls have one 2x4 top plate but cannot be much load bearing since there's a ten foot span to drive a car through. About six feet out from the house (carport attached) is another 4x column on the sidewalls AND two internal ones that are the corner posts of a closet (assuming these take some load).

Do not know the live or dead weights and the snow load in the Carolinas is minimal. It's only a 16' x 16' room and the roof joists (see pics) are 2x6s. Do not intend to remove the sill plate (no point load).

I have a pipe made out of AISI 1026 Carbon Steel

Carbon, C	0.220-0.280
Manganese, Mn	0.60-0.90
Sulfur, S	≤ 0.050

Per EPA and others, over-exposure to Manganese will give me Parkinson's and ultimately kill me. But then again, I see grades 304 and 316 also have 1% manganese and that's used for cookware. Nobody seems to think that is a problem. Almost all grades of stainless have a small amount of Manganese and nobody seems to be dying from exposure to Manganese.

Company A is where I work now. I just started and haven't even made it to my first paycheck. They were very eager to get me in person to interview, and within days of my interview they made an offer that is great for the area, though on the low side as far as electrical engineers go (which I studied in school). The pay itself is fine, for this part of the country where I am now it's well above what the average household makes, though it's not the salary I was told to expect for a job out of college with a BSEE. The work is mostly just training as of right now, just learning on the job alongside interns but with a real project in mind for a few months down the line when I've become comfortable with how everything works here. However the initial project they want me to do is more along the lines of streamlining a process rather than anything I learned in school.

Company B, which I will do my best not to name, is one of the largest technology companies in the world. I applied during my job search and am only now hearing from a recruiter who contacted me on LinkedIn. The recruiter wants to have an informal chat and asked me to send a resume to their email address (which is @'companyB'.com so it's really from this company which is freaking me out). 

I don't have a problem with Company A. The work is really simple, the pay is not ideal but it's comfortable for the region, and it's located in a small town which I prefer considering that I hate driving and traffic generally so it's really relaxed. I think I might have bought in a bit too quickly, though. I had other interviews lined up for the few weeks after the interview here at Company A. I told Company A this during my interviews so I could get a little time to make a decision, but they decided to make an offer within two days of my interview with a soft deadline of the next Monday. If I declined in order to interview with other companies AND if all their other candidates didn't work out, the offer would still be on the table at the end of July. The state I'm in is at-will and there's no non-compete or anything like that, so in theory leaving would be a matter of breaking the lease on my apartment and redirecting my mail (probably to my parents' house, temporarily).

I don't really know how I'm supposed to let this recruiter from Company B know that I would like to talk. They do the exact kind of engineering I studied and wanted to do. It's cutting edge product development in the heart of Silicon Valley. I don't need the company to sell themselves to me to want to be there, whereas with basically every place I interviewed I had to at least learn a little about what their industry niche is. Company B is a titan, and better yet they aren't recruiting me to do software. It's hardware development.

Please give any advice on what to do or what to say, I'm kind of shellshocked since I had sort of tracked my mind into thinking I would be here at Company A for at least a little bit (has a very high employee retention rate, one person I work near has been there for nearly 20 years).

Theoretically if I had to go in person, I could take vacation days as the management here made (verbal but still) promises to me about being flexible as I adjust to here, so I could take some days for 'personal reasons' if I potentially had to fly out.

I need to make 200 of them however.  I was thinking about using .043 thick copper sheet (because it would be somewhat beefy in the hand but yet should shear and form ok) and machining a combination punch and die. An oak leaf would look cooler but the die would be long and probably wouldnt work very well.  A maple leaf is symmetrical and compact (lots of webbing for strength).  I have access to a 30 ton Enerpac cylinder press at work to do the punching and forming.  My questions are as follows:

1.  17-4 is probably the hardest metal I can get my hands on.  Will that last for 200 parts?  Could I possibly use plain A-36 steel for the punch?  That should be fine for the forming die right?  Dents and dings add individuality,  but I don't want it to get all jammed up.  I'll try to make it from 17-4 but I don't know if they will let me have a big chunk of that even if I can find it.  

2. A single punch/die design would be idea, minimal materials and setups.   Should I have some sort of progressive cutting design, like a piercing tooth at each sharp corner of the leaf?  I could resharpen those with a file every few dozen parts I guess.    

3. What kind of copper would be ideal?  MSC has electrical grade which I think is pure copper.  I am making some parts of of that now and notice it is hard on HSS tooling.  Will that be a problem for my punch?  Would another grade be easier to cut and form?  

4. I figure the top and bottom forming dies should be offset the thickness of the material.  The punch should have minimal clearance between the male and female sections (sorry I dont know the proper terms)?  .0005"" ok?  I think I can get some time on our wire EDMs before October.

57,"Questions about the best way to modify my quadcopter (receiver) antenna, as well as one question about how antennas work....",1436789138,"These questions are regarding a quadcopter I recently bought.

I'll start with one question about how antennas work. I watched a video on how antenna polarization works, basically ideally you want both antennas to be oriented the same, like - and - or | and |....

They way I understand it, the antennas I have now are both (TX and RX) omnidirectional and low gain, so it does not matter how I hold the controller. But lets say I buy a directional antenna, this one (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZWPRUI/) specifically, and lets say the antenna on the quad copter is horizontal (-)... How would I need to hold the antenna in the picture.... I'm imagining that the antenna has to point to my left or to my right with the transmitting side (front of antenna) facing away from me... that way both the quad and the transmitter antennas are parallel to the ground, correct?

Now, lets say the quad is now at a 45 degree angle from where I'm standing, so it's pretty far and also pretty high, and I have a high gain antenna (lets say 11DB) so the copter loses signal because of the antenna, if I point the antenna straight at the quad copter with the antenna still parallel to the ground I shouldn't mess up the polarization, right? or does the polerization still screw up because the signal is propegating upwards (and at an angle) and not parallel to the ground?


My next questions regard antenna orientation:


Question 1: Ok, so the antenna inside my X5C was horizontally mounted like this - (and not like this | )I'm looking to get a bit more range, what will give me more range:
1- Poking a hole out of the side of the quadcopter, and keeping the antenna horizontal like this - but sticking it out of the side of the quad. The bad part about this is that even though the antenna is now sticking slightly outside of the quad, the antenna is still sticking out of the FRONT of the quad (where the quad goes forward) and therefore will be pointing away from the transmitter at all times)
2- Poking a hole out of the bottom of the quadcopter, bending the antenna downwards and now the antenna is slightly curved and more vertical like this | ( the antenna is now sticking slightly (5cm) out of the bottom of the quad, so the reciever antenna will always be within line of sight of the transmitter.... The issue I'm not sure of is that will the polerization be screwed and therefore I get less range?
Question 2: Can I reverse the direction of the X5C, and if so, how do I do that? Do I reverse/swap the positions of the motors (the clockwise and counterclockwise), so I keep the motors in the same place and reverse their power wires?
Question 3: If I'm able to reverse the direction of the X5C via question 2 above, and I did what I said in question 1 option 1 (antenna sticks out the side of the quad) now the reciever antenna is pointing towards the transmitter at all times, would this be better than the receiver antenna pointing away from the transmitter? or would this make no difference?",AskEngineers,blackjackel,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3d49o2/questions_about_the_best_way_to_modify_my/

66,"Am I an engineer at the bottom, an engineer at the top, or an overpaid technician?",1436729700,"Hello all,

I recently graduated and got an amazing job, and am able to say I am a plant engineer at the age of 22, and I have recently been questioning if I am actually in an engineering position, or a tech with the name engineer in my title.  

In my internship my school required me to get, I got a spot at a small manufacturing plant near my home town in a little country town.  They only have a plant engineer there, and over the winter he left the position for something closer to home for him.  I was offered the position, and I hopped on it.  Our facility produces friction media, and all of the equipment is from the 50's and 60's, and the biggest part of my job is to keep the equipment running.  I am originally a mechanical engineer by degree, and I got a nuclear concentration, but I wanted nothing to do with the office and tie wearing life.  I work with electronics, hydraulics, thermal systems, mechanical systems, and lots of PLC's and control setups.

All of the maintenance personnel work under me and instead of just sending them out to a problem, I work with them, and that gets problems solved quicker.  I have heard from multiple area supervisors that they have never seen machines get put back online as quickly as I have gotten it done.  I make my own prototypes, I have my own tool box I roll everywhere in the facility to work on things, I make my own PLC programs, wire up my own equipment, and machine my own parts.  

The part that makes me think I might not be as much of an engineer is that I keep hearing from people at work that they have never seen an engineer as dirty as me, or that they have never seen one do what I do.  On top of that, every week I go see all of my friends I graduated with back in the city and get a beer and burgers after work and they are all dressed really nice, and are shocked at me in a wrangler shirt, or just tee shirt, dirty pants, and boots all covered in iron powder and graphite and they all think I'm a tech.  The projects I do are all very fast paced, I analyze everything I can to try and prevent future failures, and am trying to be able to do every job that people that work under me can do, as well as be a perfectly rounded man of the trade.

Looking for some feedback and critique on how I'm planning to mount this 200 oz-in NEMA 23 stepper motor which will be used to drive an ACME 1/2-10 screw (not shown) for a hobby-level CNC mill. I hope to mill mostly wood, HDPE, and aluminum. 



I know next to nothing about specifying or manufacturing sheet metal parts, so any feedback, including that on improving manufacturability and reducing cost, would be really appreciated. 



This stepper motor must be recessed into the base plate to provide clearance for the carriage which will pass just above it. I am using the same layout for each axis, so the mounting solution must work in any orientation (i.e. for  (X) the motor shaft and mounting plate are both oriented horizontally as shown, (Y) when the mounting plate is vertical and the motor shaft is horizontal, and (Z) when the mounting plate is vertical and the motor shaft is vertical). 


I am concerned that there is not a lot of material on the side with the cutout that the timing belt passes through, and I don't know if it is reasonable to put other bends and gussets so close to that cutout. 


Also, I don't really have a sense of what material/gauge I should specify for this application. The material in the current drawing is 1/16"" thick, and I'm assuming that mild steel would suffice. 


Lastly, if there is an obvious, less-complex solution that I am not seeing, please tell me!

87,Contemplating a job change and would like to get some feedback from those that have been in a similar situation.,1436582358,"I know this is a decision that only I can make, but I'm sure I'm not the first person to have been in a situation like this. I have a pretty darn good job right now for a major aerospace company. I'm making a pretty competitive salary, plus I have a healthy bonus, profit sharing, better than average vacation, and the best medical insurance I've ever seen. I have 10 years of experience, and 5 with my current company. Really the only downsides to the job are: 1) I work in a design office only, no manufacturing, just cubes and if we want to see our results in the real world, travel is required. I would prefer more of a hands-on manufacturing environment. 2) Location. Not where I want to be long term. It's about 3.5 hours from my (and my wife's) hometown and we'd both like to be closer to family. And 3) the medical benefits are going to become decidedly less stellar next year, and probably less so the year after that.

So, as the title implies, I just got a job offer from a company near my hometown, in the city my wife and I would both like to live in permanently. But decisions like this are never easy. The base salary offer was essentially straight across from my current salary + bonus. The medical is much worse because well, I actually have to pay something for it, but probably on par for the industry. My vacation will get knocked in half. The work is for a defense contractor and classified, so I know very generally what I'll be working on, but they can't offer specifics. I do know several other people there and they seem happy enough. It would get me back into a hands-on manufacturing environment, and they've got some impressive state-of-the-art facilities. There would also be more room to move up the corporate ladder. My current company is a bit flat in my smallish satellite location, so in order to move up past a certain point I'd have to move anyway.

I know adding up the tangibles makes it seem like a lot of sacrifice financially. But there are a lot of intangibles like all those tanks of gas we spend driving up to see family once or twice a month. Eating out when my wife and I are too tired to cook dinner for our 3 (soon to be 4) kids, when we could potentially call up the mother-in-law's kitchen and place an order there. Getting to watch our children's grandparents attend t-ball and volleyball games. Free babysitting from aunts and uncles. 

So has anyone been faced with a similar decision of taking what essentially amounts to a pay cut after the total package is considered, in order to get back to a hometown and city they love, and for a potentially more enjoyable and rewarding job? How much are those things worth?

Based on a system that pumps 2500 GPM of fluid at a speed of 6.7 ft/s, what other information do I need to gather to determine what size pipe is needed to effectively discharge all incoming fluids?  

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/sTQ1oB2.jpg) is a diagram of the fluid system and how the over flow works.  Based on the containers inlet flows and velocities, how would you determine the size of the pipe that is needed to be able to discharge all of the fluid, assuming the inlet and outlet of the discharge pipe are open to atmosphere. 


My fluid mechanics are not all that great and I think I may be overlooking something here.

**The air compressor:** [DATA!](http://www.viaircorp.com/88P.html#tabs-2)
Using the CFM vs PSI chart provided we can relate the flow rate of the compress to any given pressure with a linear equation. Obviously, as the pressure in the tire increases the flow rate of the compressor decreases. The equation looks like this CFM = -a*x + b

**Problem**
If the volume of the tire is 2.43 ft^3 @ 0psi, determine how long it will take to fill the tire to 30 psi assuming the flow rate of the air compressor can be described by CFM = -a*x + b.

79,At what point in a young engineers career is it safe to start exploring other job opportunities?,1436293032,"Sorry for another ""career related question"" but I would really like to have a discussion about when it is a good time to move on from a starter job and begin looking for higher level/paying jobs.  

I will start by first explaining my situation and then asking a bunch of both generic and specific questions.

Current Career/College Information:

* **College Degree:** Bachelor Degree in Mechanical Engineering Tech. (ABET Certified)

* **Current Job Title:** Process Engineer

* **Place of Employment:** Paperboard Mill

* **Time on the Job:** 1 Year and 10 months

So like my background explains, I landed my first ever engineering job back in Sept. 2013 as a process engineer.  I am now starting to think that I need to get the hell of out my area and start exploring higher challenging/paying jobs.  Since I have been with the company I have had an enormous amount of experience working and managing a number of projects.  From the second week that I have been there I was thrown right into the frying pan with a massive three million dollar capital expenditure project that I was at least 60% responsible for (company also has a plant engineer that has a strong background in electrical engineering).  Even though I only have 2 years of experience i feel like I have jammed in at least 4 years of valuable experience as an engineer.

1. Based on your experience as a developing engineer in your field, at what point did you start to look for better and more challenging jobs?  

2. Because I only have about 2 years experience as an entry level engineer, is it worth going out and looking for a mid-level engineering job or hanging tough for the full three years??

3. What are companies looking for in young engineers that only have a few years experience on the job?

6,Best configuration of radial+thrust bearings on lead screw?,1436193390,"hey all,

Still working on designing my new CNC mill. 

[This screenshot](http://imgur.com/xC83cak) shows my Z-axis slides and ACME screw, as well as the stepper motor that will drive the screw. My understanding is that I need a radial contact bearing to deal with forces of the timing belt, and thrust bearings to deal with axial forces on the lead screw. 


It seems like most mounted-bearings have both race faces coincident, so if I were to just but the thrust bearing up against it, it would contact the housing, outer race, and inner race of the mounted bearing, which would defeat the purpose. If I put in a thrust washer, the force of the thrust bearing is against the inner race of the radial bearing, which means that it is now taking the same axial loading as the thrust bearing. 


I know there are dual-angle bearings, but I can't find any small enough, or ones that are mounted or have flanges. Is there a better way to do this?


Another option I was thinking is to put only the radial bearing at the top, and to put two thrust bearings at the bottom of the screw (where there isn't any radial loading).

Do these inverters play a major part in the cost of vehicles? I can only really find pricing on solar inverters, which seems very varied (in addition they're normally aimed at producing 110/240/400 V power at 50/60 Hz for grid use, not for variable frequency drives). 

Bonus question, I understand the Tesla has the inverter attached directly to the engine, do EMU trains do the same or do they have a inverter shared between several motors/carriages (I'd assume this is a cost savings from scale vs advantages of individual drive question)?

16,How to estimate solar thermal collector output in Kw with very limited data? Details attached.,1436136140,"I am working with data from 2 solar thermal collectors, a flat plate and an evacuated tube, that feed into a residential housing unit on a college campus. I have very limited data to work with since this entire system was set up with poor documentation and the original company contracted to get it up and running went bankrupt and abandoned the project after it was installed. 

I am trying to find a way to determine how much equivalent power this system is producing so I can do a rough carbon offset estimate. 

Here is what I have to work with:

1. Glycol temperature in the collectors recorded every ten minutes
2. solar radiation W/m² every 15 minutes
3. Average Ambient Air Temperature
4. Aperture Area
5. a very rough flow rate estimate since no one seems to know what it is (2 gpm with a max of 6 gpm)

That's it. Is there any way to figure out some rough estimate of how much power this system is saving compared to if the whole residential unit was just using electrical heat? Even the roughest estimation is better than nothing.

My hope is to be able to say ""this system roughly saves ""this much"" electricity... which means it offsets carbon and other greenhouse gas by ""this much"".

47,Geotechnical and Structural Question regarding PVR and slab damage in high PI soils,1435936257,"I am a contractor and land developer living in Texas.  Alot of work I perform entails removing massive amounts of high PI soils and coming back in with engineered, manufactured base to minimize PVR in the foundations, thus preventing slab damage. It seems pretty standard among the structural engineers to put notes like ""remove and soils that have a PI above 19 to bedrock or a minimum of 5' below beam depth and place select fill (having a PI of less than 12) in 8"" lifts and recompact to 95% standard proctor at optimum moisture, blah blah. 
I see this or designs very similar all over Texas- I fully understand why the low PI soil needs to be between the high PVR material and the concrete and why it needs to be so deep (to reduce the chance of moisture content changes- as well as other reasons)

However, I also do very deep excavations (35-45' deep) for large infrastructure projects and we oftentimes do this in areas with very high groundwater levels and require massive dewatering operations. If we are installing a large concrete structure (lift station wet well or vertical turbine pump cans) and recompacting to 95% is very difficult simply because of the sheer volume of backfill needed to recompact or we do not want to mechanically tamp close to our newly poured or placed structure.  We have learned crushed stone mechanically interlocks and ""compacts"" itself at placement and will not settle once placed.  Therefore, we oftentimes fill huge holes with crushed limestone up to about 3 feet below the surface, place multiple layers of filter fabric over the top (to prevent soils from migrating into the gravel voids), then place select fill on top of the fabric and pour concrete slabs on top of the compacted select fill.  I have done this on multiple multi-million dollar projects for public facilities (pumping stations, lift stations, etc)
As a precationary measure, we always install at least a 6""pipe vertically with thousands of holes drilled in it to the bottom of the gravel and place a pump with a float on it at the bottom to dewater the area.  We have been told this is not necessary, but we do it anyways. 

Here is my question... On a simple slab for a building or a house, select fill can be extremely expensive if you've got to place 5 feet of it on top of clay. 
Instead of removing all of the high PI soils, could a layer of gravel underneath the beams and the slab that lead to a sump with a pump prevent the underlying high pi soils getting saturated enough to heave and crack the slab? something [similar to this.](http://i.imgur.com/XN3uQ80.jpg?1)",AskEngineers,poe_zlaw,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3c009p/geotechnical_and_structural_question_regarding/

I'm doing this artisanally, making the molds myself, doing everything myself.  i have promising results for the basic shape, using resin impregnated fabric to form a sort of fiberglass. but the toxicity, combined with the amount of sanding required, combined with how destructive it is to the molds, all adding up to tell me its maybe unrealistic

i made a part for the attachment system out of Kydex T, heating it carefully with a heat gun and just using manual pressure.  the result is just fabulous, durable and just the right combination of rigidity and flexibility.  its so much easier and less toxic to work with than resin/fabric combination.  i realized i could cut production time by 70% if i could use this approach to thermoform the shells, by hand with a heat gun and manual pressure.  (i can't use vacuforming, the draw is way too deep and the shell wraps 350º)  if i can find the right plastic i would be so far ahead.

Kydex T is made to be chemically impervious.  its going to be hell to glue anything to.  reading around the holster makers forums (popular with these guys) it sounds like paint peels off.  i get the impression its more of a standalone kind of material, meant to be mechanically joined to other things as opposed to chemically joined. on the plus side, its indestructible.  it resists impact and deformation.  .060 feels right for thickness to my as-yet-inexperienced eye

Styrene might be better as a surface -- its chemically friendlier to paint and adhesives.  but is it impact resistant?  does it get brittle over time? at the plastics warehouse today i saw a stack of white .040 which had discolored, and it cracked when i bent it. they claimed its still salable in that condition.  so, does it deteriorate quickly?

there are millions of plastics.  in my searches i haven't come across a good reference guide to all the species -- if you know of

here's my spec:

rigidity / flexibility / durability similar to Kydex 

thermoformable manually (heat gun, pressure with dense foam pad) (my tolerances are loose)

smooth surface (many brands of Kydex are pebbly, faux leather gain etc)

compatible with some kind of paint

compatible with some kind of tough clear resin (have to overcoat several materials w resin)

Currently I'm thinking about double stacking two Styrofoam cups with a layer of aluminum foil between and some sort of epoxy to seal the two cups together. For a lid I don't have any ideas other than to use a piece of cardboard or another cup inverted to try to hold heat in. A second idea I have is to get a glass bottle with a small mouth, a can large enough to hold the bottle (like a paint can), fill the can with a insulate, put the bottle into it; and then finally using a cork to hold the thermometer and close the bottle up.

94,Coolant Loops,1435699348,"This may be the wrong place for this question, and it may very well be a stupid question, but I'm a tad stumped here... 

For a coolant loop in a vehicle, would you want water to initially hit your warmest component (ie, motor), or your coolest component? I would think coolest initially because it causes the coolant temperature to avoid any dramatic rise throughout the looping process preventing it from getting too hot before it reaches a cooler component. If it's too hot by the time it reaches the coolest component they may already be in equilibrium and therefore provide no actual cooling benefit. On the other hand I would imagine you want the water to hit the hottest component when it's at its coldest so you get the most cooling. I can see logic for either configuration, but I can't seem to find much information regarding which would be the better configuration... Does it depend largely on the system? Or after a while will the water in the system reach equilibrium anyways so it becomes irrelevant?

95,Learning and applying engineering to my field,1435696366,"I'm a marine biology student who would like to learn basic (and maybe slightly more advanced) engineering skills and practices for future application in research. For example, one project I have in mind is developing an affordable and compact underwater ROV system for marine and freshwater exploration.
I currently know next-to-nothing about engineering. But I would love to know what resources helped you with engineering, pretty please. I know for a lot of you that means intense college course, but I'm more looking for reading materials and online resources/tutorials.
Any help you can give is greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance.",AskEngineers,briseymo1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3boaaz/learning_and_applying_engineering_to_my_field/
96,To study Vibrations or to study HVAC?,1435693938,"I Have one semester left until I finish my degree in Mechanical Engineering and I have one technical elective left to choose. I am stuck with choosing between:
1.Vibration analysis
2.HVAC studies

I was wondering which choice would be the most applicable for the most engineering jobs. Unfortunately I have no Idea what I am going to do in the future, as I have not found a job yet. 

I know what I am interested in... (Military or Defense or Test engineering maybe R&amp;D and potentially nuclear or renewable energy)...

I also know the quality of the professor who is teaching HVAC is (much) higher than the professor teaching Vibrations.

If I could hear some perspectives from engineers who have experience with either discipline, that would be wonderfully helpful. I am leaning towards taking the HVAC class because I know I could learn a ton and also solidify my knowledge of heat transfer a little better.

98,Please help clear up some confusion about cooling a house with fans,1435682235,"All of the following concerns a freestanding house that is fairly well shaded by trees. Also note: We are not interested in cooling through wind chill/convective, i.e. ""the fan feels good blowing on me""; this is about changing absolute air temperature only. In fact, the less air movement in the house, the better. Here are the Fan Enforcer's working rules:

1) When Outside Temp &gt; Inside Temp, all windows must be closed. 

2) When Outside Temp &lt; Inside Temp, a protocol is observed that involves opening all windows, and using fans to blow air directly into the house and  to ""feed"" it to interior rooms.

Right now, for 1), we just do a comparison between the local temp appearing on the iPhone and a ballpark guess for the inside of the house. However, often times I open a closed window, and some amount of cooler air definitely begins to flow in. I suspect that there is a temp difference between the official local number and what it is right outside our house in the shade, but even in theory, I have a question about this. Even if the outside air is hotter than the inside air, can it sometimes be beneficial to open windows anyway? Perhaps due to pressure differential and/or wind speed?

On 2), let's say that windows are open with fans blowing from 4-10am, when the temp condition is met. In a decent sized but not enormous house with lots of windows, it seems to me that the real determinants of how well the house can cool are things like house construction, insulation, etc. Can you force cool air into a house at a greater rate than it would flow naturally over a period of several hours, in other words, ""stockpiling"" cool air in advance to last you over the course of the day? Furthermore, is there any use to secondary or ""feeder"" fans placed away from windows, to continue to pump cool air like a current? More generally, what happens to air temperature when you try to pump it at a high speed through a wide opening, such as a fan through a hallway? Can cool air be transferred this way? What about concerns such as hot air moving to cold (not vice versa), particle speed, etc.?
