3,A case for software engineering,1472854521,"Anyone who has spent time in the engineering realm knows about the flame war between traditional engineering disciplines and software engineering. I've been undecided about the classification but am becoming increasing more accepting of software engineering being a legitimate engineering discipline. I am looking for thoughts, opinions, criticisms, etc.

Software engineering fits the broadest definition of engineering: the branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures. Instructing a machine to operate in a certain way definitely concerns the design and build of that machine.

Software is becoming increasingly more important in our society, and there are millions of life-critical systems. Software engineering is often critiqued for being an immature field and not having the rigor of other engineering disciplines. For many systems this just isn't the case. Additionally, I work with several MechE's who work on designing and developing swimming pool liners. Their work isn't life-critical and therefore you cannot say software engineering isn't a legitimate engineering simple because not all systems are critical.

Software engineering's generally come from computer science backgrounds, and a computer science curriculum is just as rigorous and mathematically challenging as (if not more so) than many traditional engineering disciplines. Some core classes at most universities: Calc I, Calc II, differential equations, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, discrete probability, statistics, numerical analysis, calc based mechanical physics, calc based elctromagnetism, thermodynamics, ethics related class, etc.

Software engineering is quickly becoming extremely well regulated and there are a lot of compliance mandates similar to other engineering disciplines

I agree that the field is immature in it's methods, but after reading Kuhn's, Structure of Scientific Revolution I began to look at SE in the same way as chemistry in it's post alchemy phase. I think that in 100 years there is going to be no debate about whether SE is a legitimate engineering field or not.

9,Trying to calculate battery requirements for AGM/Lithium,1472829706,"Hey guys,

I'm comparing AGM to Lithium right now for power. Lithium is stupidly easy. You just look at the output of the battery, and as long as it's not super hot or super cold, it's relatively consistent on output power. Many testers have actually found that the output for lithium batteries is even better than they are rated for.

The example I'm looking at is an espresso machine with a 4000 watt 220 volt boiler. Roughly 18 amps. And it will be running about 1/3 of the hour during the busy times to keep the temperature up.

[Using this guide](http://www.powerstream.com/battery-capacity-calculations.htm)

18*1200/3600 + 0.5(2400)/3600 = 6.3 amps average current. 6.3AH During busy times.

18*600/3600 + 0.5(3000)/3600 = 3.4 amps average current. 3.4AH During slow times.

But that seems really low.

I did notice that AGM batteries are rated at 20 hours. So a 400 AH AGM is rated to have that 400 AH drawn over the course of 20 hours. But they also shouldn't go below 25-30%. So 

400(ah) * 70% = 280 AH over 20 hours. Or 14 AH per hour.

So if I'm busy for 4 hours a day and slow for the other 4, that's (6.3 * 4) + (3.4 * 4) = 38.8 total AH drawn over 8 hours. Well under the 280 AH rating. And under the per hour draw.

---

Does that all seem correct so far? It's way off some other calculations I was doing. Probably the wrong way. Before I was going off kwh based off the wattage and probably messed up the volts.

---

So to power the same setup on lithium, I'd need a 40 AH battery correct? In a perfect world where usage is exactly what was stated above.

For a AGM battery, I'd probably need a 100 AH battery to get the same usage.

100(ah) * 70% = 70 AH over 20 hours. Or 3.5 AH per hour. So with the draw being higher (6.3 AH) in the busy hours, it will tax the battery more and cause the 70 AH rating to fall off.

---

Does this all add up? If so, it's really really good news because I'm way under what I was calculating before.

The setup I did before was use [this site](https://lazycackle.com/Convert-from-Ah-to-KWh-Online-Calculator.html).

I was trying to get the AH requirements for the machine. Based off 4 hours of 1/3 power, 1.2 kwh per hour. 4.8kwh. But I didn't know what volts to use so it was probably a useless calculation going off kwh.

Ah I think I figured my issue. I didn't sets the volts correctly. The machine is 220 volt. If I'm drawing 1.2kwh on average during rush, it's showing as around 5.5 AH.",AskEngineers,darrenphillipjones,/r/AskEngineers/comments/50tqup/trying_to_calculate_battery_requirements_for/

16,Discreet dash cam case to be mounted on the back of the rear view mirror,1472809956,"Here's my situation:

- I've bought a [Midland cam corder][1] (HxLxP = 53x59x32 mm);

- I want to create my own mounting system for it so that I can attach it directly to the rear view mirror (on the back of the mirror, obviously) - something similar to [this picture][2];

- I'd like to avoid any potential thieves (this is a common crime in my area) so I'm going to build a (plastic) case for the camera so that it will not be obvious that it's a actually camera. It should look just like a plastic bump on the back of the mirror;

- There should be some mechanical system that would allow me to slide the front side of the case so that the camera can record while driving;

- I have no prior knowledge on how to design cases or the tools that I would be needing for something like this.

Here's how I think I can do it:

- Buy a plastic rectangle; melt it somehow so that it will bend; make a cube out if it (probably apply some glue); make the front side detachable/slide-able somehow (maybe by making two small grooves on the sides); use some adhesive magnetic tape so that I attach it to the back of the rear view mirror.

And here are my questions:

- **What tools to I need to design this (plastic) case so that it will be as discreet as possible**? **How can it be done**? I've tried to customize some gadgets in the past but I never came up with a decent prototype (the design is always bulky and you can see that there are many manual adjustments there);

- I already have a 5V cable there; **is there any small electrical component that would be able to slide up/down the front panel of the case when it receives current**? (something like an electromagnetic lock, but, obviously, a lot smaller); this would be useful so that I don't have to remember to slide up the front side each time I go in to the car and slide it down each time I leave the car.

Without going into too much detail, quality concerns about the end product have led to me investigating a more effective way to determine if the foam will be up to scratch.

The product production process is as follows:

* raw ingredients are mixed in a extrusion process to produce the stock foam
* foam is extruded into large rolls 
* quality metrics are collected from extruded roll
* roll is left to degass for a set number of days
* foam is thermoformed into the product
* quality metrics collected from thermoformed product.

From what I have learnt so far in a simple damped system the time period or peak to peak time of the displacement is constant all the way until the mass comes to rest, with only the amplitude decaying.
And that makes sense as the natural frequency is a result of the mass and spring constant which don't change in the system.

My question is why does the time between bounces when the ball is dropped seem to shorten especially right before it is about to stop.

36,My company needs structure. Taking baby steps as an Independent Consultant and looking for some direction.,1472703157,"I haven't worked in months. I've been traveling around in Asia and riding my bike around the US.

Starting sending out resumes and got a gig in Colorado about a month ago - I've been working from home doing site planning, reports, and general consultant work. I'd like to turn this up a notch and I need help.

There's three (3!!) other companies I'm talking to about picking up work remotely (there is one job in the works that's a legitimate office position, I might do this and keep the current remote job too). Here's my thoughts:

1. what's a good method of keeping track of invoicing? I'd like to know how to keep tabs of my billable hours in a way to protect myself from any issues (besides the obvious basic spreadsheet, there has to be a preferred way!)

2. what are my limitations in terms of income? at which point does it make sense to find a tax-incentive type program, like a dba or LLC? what's my threshold for income before the IRS requires me to pay for health insurance? am I paying quarterly taxes??

3. what is your best forum/tool for complex Autocad questions? I am delving into the deep of corridors and underground piping and it's complex.. well to me it is

4. are there any pitfalls or things I should be weary of? This question is meant for someone with some experience, I'd be lucky if I got an answer here.

5. what are the basic do's and dont's of working full time while moonlighting on the side? obviously I will get employer permission on all sides, but what else??

I've always loved science and especially math and physics, the way physical objects interact fascinates me and I love to learn complex physical concepts and solve complex problems. I'm in construction management at the moment and CM jobs offer plenty of money, room for growth and a lot of ability to be on my feet and traveling around, which I like.

I'm trying to figure out if the switch to engineering is worth the extra student loan debt and stress to get to the other side, (and hopefully the grass is pretty green over there too).

This leads me to my question: I would much rather work in a more intellectual environment where I can solve problems with hardcore science and develop solutions. I am extremely handy and would also love to be able to build prototypes and test them. Are there engineering jobs where designing and prototyping are done frequently and you get to collaborate with team members about the design and development process, and get to shoot the shit about ""science stuff""???

So I work full time for the USAF. I work as a propulsion engineer for a launch vehicle. I've worked at the same place for almost three years now; I started as an intern. Since it's a government job, the work is pretty lax to say the least. I see my engineering friends and see them like do ""actual"" engineering work at their workplace.

My question is, because I'm in a government job, am I destroying my career? Like a part of me is longing to do ""actual"" engineering work so every now and then I browse through company websites like Northrop or Raytheon or Aerojet Rocketdyne. I feel like I'm behind compared to my friends since I don't, at least in my opinion, do ""real"" engineering work and I feel like the more I wait, then the more unqualified I would be if I ever decide to apply to industry jobs.

I'm confused. I love my job; it's allowed me to travel to Cape Canaveral and to sit on-console for rocket launches, but at the same time I don't like my job because it makes me feel like I'm wasting my engineering degree.

I am not doing this myself either, I just want to know about all of these things and get a good idea of what the system will be when it's done, and to make sure that when I hire someone to make it they aren't ripping me off or doing weird stuff.

Hi everyone!

I'm starting up a mobile espresso bar out of a Citroen HY! It's an old French van.

Anyway, I'm trying my damnedest to get this thing running without using a generator. So I've been looking into battery banks. Quite pricey, but should pay for itself vs. a generator all day, and they are so noisy it would likely ruin business anyway.

**Power Requirements**

*Based off 2 hours busy 4 hours slow [6HD]*

Product | Watts | Average Constant Draw Per Hour | ACDPH Off Peak | Daily kwh Used | Daily ah Used
---|---|----|----|----|----
Espresso Machine | 5000 | 1000 | 500 | 4.00 | 350

Extra | | | | | 
Totals | 7,100 | 2,125 | 700 | 6.90 | 587

I did a little bit of rounding, especially on the AH to simplify it. Tried to go over on some and under on others to balance it.

I could also be completely wrong on the espresso power requirements, but nobody, and I mean nobody will give me the average wattage usage of their machines during peak usage. Even spoke directly with espresso machine engineers. Their response was 'well, we really don't go out of our way to figure that stuff out? Nobody needs it so we don't do testing for it.' I will make sure to blast the info everywhere though.

There was one, and I mean one test I found online for a professional 2/3 group espresso machine with a 4000 watt boiler. It was taking about 800 watts per hour during peak. So I rounded up.

It would be nice to setup a system with LiFePO batteries for this so I don't have to use a generator. I was thinking about getting around 1000 AH worth of batteries to be on the safe side. Also set it up so I can expand. I really don't have the funds to do some crazy 4000 AH lithium bank for starters, so I'll be doing shorter days until then.

and I'm a little confused. 1300 for 1000 AH of LiFeYPO4 batteries seems too good to be true. Are these batteries not good for my application?

I also need to figure out the way to connect everything up. My espresso machine is probably going to be 220. Same with the coffee machine. The rest is 110.

Inverter/Charger

* Thinking 8000 total is what I need, but don't know if they can be ran as 2 4000 watt or has to be one.

* I found the AIMS power pure sine inverter charger, but it's ridiculously expensive. Is this my only option?

What else do I need? Battery monitors, dc-ac, shut off switch, charge controller... That's also something I'm trying to figure out too. Mainly so I can get a good idea of pricing for this whole thing.

66,"Brushless DC Motor question, about magnets and speed",1472596388,"Greetings,

I have been mulling over an idea I came up with, probably not an ""invention"" as I can't believe I am the first to think of it. This is in relation to ebike hub motors, big ones, 3000W and up.

It is my understanding that when you increase the number of turns of wire on the stator poles, you are in effect increasing the magnetic field produced by the stator poles, allowing for more torque, and decreasing the speed at which it will turn, correct? Less turns giving the opposite effect.

So people have to essentially balance their speed requirement and torque requirements when designing the stator.

Another thing people do is that when they want to get more ""power"", they increase the width of the rotor magnets, and the width of the stator to match.

=

So here is my idea. Instead of altering the number of turns on a stator in order to get a larger magnetic field, and thus increase magnetic force. Why not increase the surface area of the magnets and the stator pole face. 

Curve the magnets into a U shape, and have the face of the stator pass through that curved area. With a 180 degree arc, you will have 3.1415x the surface area. It should give approximately 2.4x more magnetic force.

The stator would probably have to be built in multiple pieces, I think 3 would work, or the magnets in 2 pieces, and sandwiched together, glued to the outer hub, which might be easier.

Is there any reason why this isn't done, is it simply that curved magnets aren't the easiest to make? Would having more magnet surface area, more magnetic force, decrease the speed like akin to having more turns on the stator poles?",AskEngineers,adaminc,/r/AskEngineers/comments/50dv0q/brushless_dc_motor_question_about_magnets_and/

68,Structural engineer question about wood,1472594106,"Recently I visited a home that was built around the 1900s that was for sale. I saw that in the basement they had two old logs that ran the length of the house. On one end of the house the logs were 12 inches in diameter, and on the other they were only 7. The house was about 30 feet in length and 25 feet in width, with a perpendicular support wall 12 feet in which the two wooden logs sat on. It is clear to me that they have moved these beams over the years and attempts have been made to prop up floor joists that rest on these beams. If someone wanted to replace these two wooden logs with beams built up from 2x12s, how many would you need? I'm more interested in how you come up with the answer, not what it is.

But I suppose these things normally contain a pressurized gas. I take it it's nothing too toxic, but what sort of pressure should I expect? The ones I'm looking at now are rated at 150N. So assuming the piston surface area is, say, 2 cm^2 , my brain says that works out to 15 atm of pressure, which *might* blow up if I just take a drill to the gas cylinder...? Or maybe it's only 150N when the gas is fully compressed? Dunno. I don't trust my brain.

This seems to go against my knowledge of suspension setups, which is mostly applied within the context of racing. In racing, rear camber is usually almost neutral to maximize rear traction, and front camber is more negative to aid in cornering performance. 

Why do road cars seem to be set up differently?

Edit: Thanks for all the great explanations of how camber works, but my question is specifically regarding why a car would be set up at the factory to have more negative camber in the rear than in the front.

If we want to make any design changes we have to crate a document detailing the issue and the changes we would like to make and send it to the parent company and they decide if the change is worthwhile or not (9 times out of 10 we are ignored and the other 1 time they try to pass off the idea as their own) I am not using my 3D CAD skills at all and I am very worried that I will loose all my knowledge if things keep going like this.

The issue I am having is the BSMET program at the university they would pay for is hardly superior to the ASMET program I graduated from prior. In fact, I had to take the all the math/physics requirements during the ASMET and the BSMET does not require further courses in those subjects.

Now, I looked up some programs where the BSME and BSMET programs are quite similar, except for some core courses. They both had to take Calc I, II, Multivariable, DiffyEQ, Physics I/II, Chemistry, Materials Science, and thermodynamics. The big differences from what I see are the BSME students take a class later to apply those courses and the BSMET students when on to practical design/manufacturing courses.

Looking at getting a balance charger for an RC plane ASAP (best solution I can find so far) but in the mean time, would the following work:

(TLDR START HERE)

So I have a battery, with a stated capacity of 1375mAh at 24v. That's 33Wh if you need that too.

I have a charger for the scooter, made for lead acid batteries, which outputs a regular charge and float charge mode, at 27.1v and I believe 25v outputs respectively. It's current is 1000mA. 

If I was to connect my battery to the charger, at 27.1v, and 1000mA would it explode the battery or charger?      I don't think so but I'd like to be sure before I do it.

Why I don't think so:

Li Battery packs are built of 3.7-4.2V cells in series. This lets me know I have to have 6 cells in series in my battery pack in order for it to acheive the desired 24v output rating. I've read online that Li-Ion batteries should be charged at 4.3-4.5V/cell. 

4.3-4.5V/cell   *    6    cells     =   25.8-27v charge.

As far as current goes, I've also read that you can safely recharge Li-Ion batteries at 50-70% of their rated Capacity (C rating). My battery pack has a C of 1375, so .5-.7C is 687.5mA-962mA.  1000mA is about 0.72727272727272(repeating)C.


Would using this be possible until I can source the appropriate charger? Is it a good charger to use at all?

I'm constructing a TV stand, which has a design element will have a horizontal pane of glass, supported on two sides by the wood supports which will hold shelves.

On top of the glass, centered over the wood posts holding the TV will be thinner wood posts, on which the television will sit.  So the weight of the TV will be directly over the supports for the glass - the ~55"" span won't need to support any weight.

[Here is a shitty paint diagram for your pleasure.](https://imgur.com/a/hUCgE) The diagram only shows the relevant bits, not the exact design of the stand, so please don't critique it from a design standpoint.

While the glass span won't be holding loads intentionally, I have a small kid, who will surely place objects and occasionally her own weight on the glass.  I would also not want the glass to sag over time.  Is there an online resource to calculate that sort of info, or could someone with access to solidworks and the necessary knowledge tell me how thick the glass should be.

16,How can I create a large-scale thermocouple and implement it in a house?,1472408595,"I've been trying to get an answer to this question through a Google search but I failed many times, so I figured people here might know. 

Thermocouple: From what I've heard it is to twist two dissimilar metals together. When you light a match at one end (say, bismuth), the other end (say, antimony) becomes ice cold. 

(EDIT: To anyone reading the post now, SaffellBot, and nirvanna94 have corrected me, this is a false definition of it. Thank you both. To those just reading the post, I recommend scrolling down for the actual word for what I'm looking for.)

^ That's the limit of my knowledge right there. I don't know how cold it gets, I don't know if different metals produce different temperatures, I have not tested it but I have seen it tested online. 

This is why I'd love some resources (I've looked online but the few I've found are terrible at explaining 1. how this works 2. how to do it) on how to simply test this with different metals and step-by-step ways of small thermocouples (simply for me to test it on my own with different metals - if that makes any difference. If not, I could simply pick the cheapest metals I could find.)

The plan is to put one end of the thermocouple on the rooftop (and the other type of metal facing down/inside the walls/inside the house) so that the heat from the sun hits it, and the hotter it gets outside, the colder it gets inside.

Why am I doing this? I want to make the inside of the house cool without air conditioning. Why? To lower cost, but still have it be as cool as it would be with an AC. 

My initial questions would be: 

- If I were to embed this within the walls, would that be an effective strategy to get the room to feel cool, or would it do nothing/little? Or is this question way too vague? Does it depend on the walls themselves and the material they're made of?
- Would the cool temperature be better distributed throughout rooms by having the rest of the metal go down into a vent with a fan to blow the air out like an AC? Or are there more efficient ways?
- What is the most cost-efficient, and also efficient way to distribute the temperature in the room?


Firstly, I want to learn how I can DIY this if possible. Everytime I enter a new project, I don't know how much I don't know, and it gets much larger and complex than I expected. So I'm kind of expecting this here. 

Can I just go to a store and buy enough material to build this on my own, or would that be too time-consuming/costly?

Has someone else done this before who can help me out?

Second, what are some easy ways of installing this in the house? I imagine embedding it in walls would be pretty difficult and costly if the house is already built (it is), so what would be the easiest way to install it while also not being exposed on the inside or outside?

20,How can I calculate the penetration depth of a projectile impact?,1472405636,"Hi there,

I'm just reading some texts regarding local impact effects from miscellaneous projectiles.

As a definition x is the penetration, e is the perforation limit and hs is the scabbing limit.

There are a lot of different formulas. But all of them are written as x/d or e/d or hs/d where d is the diameter of the projectile.

Can anyone explain why this is the case? I know it's the nondimensional deptht, because often left and right site of the equation don't have the same units.

So normaly I would multiply my results by d, but in some cases it doesn't make sens. 


I know it's probably a bit specific. But I don't need any values, I want to understand the ""science"" of the equations.

----
Extra:

To get even more specific. Have a look at problems calculating a penetration depht :-D

For example with the [""Kar Formula""](http://i.imgur.com/8GWzcMA.png).

d = diameter [meter], N* is Nose Shape Factor (0.72 flat - 1.14 sharp), M is Mass [kg] and fc is confined compressive strength of concrete (PA)

Please ignore the E/Es for now.

I get a quite small G. And the bigger your diameter gets, the deeper the penetration. although it should get smaller by logic, if you leave all the other parameters the same.

If you want to calculate it, I use d=2m, N*=0.72,M=2500kg,fc=25MPA

21,Building an Analog Electronic Organ. Need Advice on Key Contacts,1472404828,"I'm building an analog electronic organ similar to an old Vox continental. I have a set of 12 oscilators that feed into ripple counters which act as frequency dividers. By doing this I get the 12 highest notes, and subdivided octaves of each one. I have 12 different ""stops"" or drawbars, similar to a Hammond or a Vox, but with more. There is a pre-amp for each drawbar; the drawbar controls the output of the preamp.

When a key is pressed, say for example C3, I need to make contact with the output for the 3rd octave on the C tone generator, but also with the one for C2, G3, C4, G4, C5, E5, G5, A♯5, C6, D6, and E6. When the key isn't pressed, the contacts need to be grounded. So essentially what I need for each key is a 12 pole dual throw(12P2T) switch. They make push button switch like this but they're around $4.50/ea. and I need 122 of them.

This is how the Vox does it, albeit with only 4 drawbars: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUy3qFCZnu0

I'm leaning toward the busbar-whisker contact solution at this point because it's cheaper, nickle-silver wire and a harpsichord-like jack/plectrum arraignment. The only downside is that I'll need 24 wires in close proximity with fairly equal spacing in a space really can't be more than 3.5"" or so. 

Does anyone have any creative solutions?

25,Looking for Allies in the Quest to Build a Toilet Fit for the Gods (on a budget),1472385018,"Greetings and salutations fellow Redditors! I come to you seeking assistance on a project I have determined to take on, a project that will let the everyday man defecate like royalty. I aim to reproduce as many of the features of the infamous TOTO Neorest® 750H with Actilight™. Some of these features include an air purification system, an antibacterial UV light, automatic toilet cover raising/closing, automatic flushing, heated seats, and a toilet pre""mister"". So far arrived at several solutions for some of these features, by utilizing an IoT relay switch ($16.87) I can control several appliances whose functions would be needed via an internet enabled Raspberry Pi ($35.99). Some of the appliances I have determined are optimal for functionality and cost are a HEPA/UV air filter/purifier ($52.94) to sanitize and freshen the air post-flush, a 3 Watt germicidal light bulb ($8.99) to sanitize when the lid is closed, a force sensing resistor ($14.95) to sense when you are seated, an analog pH sensor designed for Arduino ($81.66) to analyze fluids for health tracking, and an infrared proximity switch ($7.99) to sense when you approach the toilet. Any information related to any potential ideas and/or execution of potential features along with alternative components would be greatly appreciated! Together Reddit Engineers, we can change the way the everyday man defecates forever! One small step for the excrement of mine, one giant leap for the excrement of mankind!

Note: If anyone ends up building something similar or relevant let me know! I'd love to discuss some specifications. This post will be updated as I expand and refine this project. Once I build it I will try to get a video guide to build your own uploaded, along with pictures of the final product.

P.S. For the most recent update on the component list, go to: http://smile.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/18DLG39CO62UD . There you can see my Amazon shopping list for the project!

Update I: It turns out that the IoT Relay Switch I found only operates off of one bit, and as such will only allow for control of appliances that are operating simultaneously. As result, the options are as such: it is either necessary to purchase several of these, which would not be cost effective; the better option being that an alternative relay must be found, that can allow for individual control over appliances.

Update II: From further analysis of this design schema, the number of components, and wires that will be required to operate this toilet could be considered an eyesore, which gave me the idea to house all of these components inside a desktop case. Allowing for good airflow to the electronics, and hiding the components in a stylish housing, all while keeping them accessible enough to be easily worked on/troubleshooted.

Update III: Due to sanitary concerns I determined that the PC case would pose more problems than solutions, as such that has been scrapped, and I am working on coming up with an alternative solution to house the electronics. I am intrigued by the idea of converting the toilet to a tankless flush and using the tank to house the electronics, however this would involve some plumbing work which I am not very familiar with.

3. Does it matter which school you go to? I currently go to CSUS and could get a masters there for relatively cheap, but I've heard that when it comes to being a professor the school really matters. If I go the community college route does it matter less which school/major I get a masters at/in?

Are there any of you out there working management/sales/business roles after an engineering degree?
If so, do you think there is a difference in the job you do/the pay/the way you're treated if you're working in sales/management as an engineering graduate rather than a business graduate?

I need to figure out how to move fuel from the day tank system to the forward tanks. 
I have successfully moved fuel aft from the bellies to the day tank, but cannot for the life of me figure out how to go the other way with it.

I successfully moved fuel back and filled the day tank system with the following procedure:
Close bottom two inch headed north from cross tank supply. Open tank valve you want to pull from. Put electric pump/hand pump selector valve inline with the manifold. 

I have more pictures and information if needed.

61,Career Advice - Take mechanical engineer role over industrial engineer role?,1472219187,"I am an industrial engineering student set to graduate in December from a solid state school in Texas.

**Job A**

I have just completed an interview as an **Automation Engineer** in a manufacturing facility. 

* The products are not engineering intensive (Styrofoam plates and such), but the process and details are.
* The technical staffing at this facility is severely lacking, and the organization of technical documents and resources is also pretty bad. 
* The role would be 75% management, 25% engineering, coordinating technicians and mechanics to resolving issues on the floor (which are constant due to old machinery). 
* I would push for improvement projects, but as I understand, they are pretty much constantly putting out fires (figurative and literally).
* I am working as an intern for this company (7 months in December), and they have given me nothing but good reviews. 
* The manufacturing aspect of this role ties directly into what I have studied in industrial engineering.
* Compensation is expected to be average.

**Job B**

I also just applied to a **Test and Evaluation Engineer** role with another company I did a co-op with (in the same role, 8 months).

* The products are engineer products (valves/regulators), and have to adhere to international engineering standards. 
* The organization is stellar, the resources are there (training, safety gear, gym, its a corporate office and a test facility)
* I would work with a team of engineers under a engineer/technical manager. 
* My exit interview went well, I met their expectations for everything and exceeded some.
* I did have to work a decent bit harder to understand the processes and metrics as compared to the mechanical engineering co-ops I worked with.
* Compensation may be below average due to layoffs and other recent downsizing.

**Other Important Details**

* I am currently studying to take the FE (Industrial DS afternoon).
* I work in a machine shop, technically inclined and familiar with manual machining processes and tooling, CNC routing, set ups for CNC mills (Hass VF-2)
* Applied to be mechanical engineer, didn't get accepted, did industrial engineering instead
* want to eventually get masters in mechanical engineering

**Key Concerns**

* Am I going to shoot myself in the foot if I take Job B over Job A? I'm not really keen on managing people at this point in my life, I'd rather be managed for a while and garner as much technical engineering expertise as possible and be running tests and scrutinizing the nitty gritty details.
* However, If I leave the Job B role, I don't want to be stuck in limbo applying for mechanical engineering roles since I don't have a mechanical engineering degree, and industrial engineering roles will say I don't have enough experience as an industrial engineer.

**TLDR**

13,What's the deal with Computer Engineering responsibilities/jobs? And 'software engineer'?,1471997183,"So I recently found out that the term 'software engineer' is pretty meaningless from scoping around other sub's and research. Since it can almost mean any set of duties, and the requirements of what *can* make you one are very non-specific. Doesn't take much for anyone to technically qualify as a 'software engineer'. And now I see why.


However, Computer Engineering (or even any engineering)--when searching for jobs are often grouped in with 'Software Engineer' or 'Software Development'. Now I know Software Development can be what a Computer Engineer does, like testing out hardware with new software. But when I look at the job description and what they want it's usually all software/ Comp Sci stuff. Like HTML, C++, UI dev etc... Doesn't say a **thing** about even designing or testing hardware. 


Long story short. It's frustrating actually looking for actual Computer Engineering jobs, for the sole fact it gets grouped in with Software Engineering, or Computer Science. Since most those jobs tag in computer engineering as well. So my question is: How the flip do you actually look for, and scope out jobs a actual Computer Engineer would be most prominent in? (I say prominent cause I now someone is gonna talk about how they are similar or one can do another's job etc. But I'm talking about if you gods forbid--actually wanna do what you mainly became a CPU Engineer for..)Such as CPU/GPU design. PCB development. VLSI design.... SOMETHING. 


Now when I actually looked up CPU/GPU/Hardware in the job search title I actually found hits that *GASP* actually said 'Computer Engineer' in the job description or actually mentioned skills a prospective comp engineer would study for/be prominent in. And yet still software/com sci stuffs is booked in. And I'm talking I'd find like 2 jobs per 5 pages for specifically Computer Engineering specific occupations... People always say for this field it's highly used in 'today's society' and with CPU's being in everything it's super versatile. But it's literally like I can barely find anything! Is all that just hype? What's the deal? 


By the time you cut out all the software stuff in the job search. You almost have less than, or equal at most jobs a Aerospace Engineer would find, looking for a job that actually deals in aeroplane design. And that's almost crazy to wrap my head around when you consider CPU's--*anything* CPU related and Aeroplane engineering aren't even close to as often developed and versatile in the tech industry....

17,How to interpret data results from Civil Enginneer for water flow?,1471992883,"Hello Engineers!

I've been in a long, drawn out, process with my home builder regarding the storm water runoff on my property. Short version is: anytime it rains hard, part of my lot washes away. I live in the south, it rains hard often. 

Anyway, we've gotten to a point where a civil engineer and site surveyor were hired to recommend a solution for the amount of water passing through my property, which includes storm water from 3-4 lots next to me. 

It's been about 2 months since they were out without much contact, and I received a ""Data only"" update regarding their survey. 

I was hoping someone could help me understand what the data meant, based on their current timeline, I don't expect to get a recommendation for a while. 

For reference, I am lot 275, located on a corner, and lot 276 is the neighbor behind me. 

""Presently our preliminary analysis indicates that the storm drainage from lots 272 through 275 were included in the drainage area calculations for drop inlet 1709 which is located on 276. Based upon NOAA rainfall intensity of 10 year, five minute duration for this specific area, along with the projected full development of the offsite drainage area, there is  6.28 cfs of storm water needs to be collected and emptied into drop inlet 1709. 


I received and reviewed the documents from the State. The difference in ours and their runoff is in the intensity and the runoff coefficients that were used. However, the fact remains that 6.28 cfs of storm drainage from lots 272 through 275 runs through the back yards and is supposed to be part of drainage basin for drop inlet 1709 which sits on lot 276. This completes the drainage study phase of the project.""

We were able to collect over 200 replies across 14 different engineering disciplines — something I haven't seen done anywhere else on the internet, which is amazing!

If you missed the initial posting, some of them haven't been archived yet and you can still add your comments to them for a while longer.

## Reports: how YOU can make AskEngineers way better!

Before I talk about anything else, I briefly want to mention the **report** function.

**Right now, almost nobody submits reports.** This is bad because it lets a lot of low-quality posts slip past the moderator queue (which we look at on a daily basis). I encourage everyone to start using reports — if you've judged that a post or comment doesn't belong in AskEngineers, report it. We'll evaluate them case-by-case.

**Note:** reports are not ""super downvotes"", so don't use them that way.

[**Here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/about/rules) are all the reasons you can report a post or comment, which are conveniently the same as the guidelines in the sidebar. If a post doesn't break one of these rules, consider whether your judgment is correct or not; we're always available by [mod mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers&amp;subject=Report) if you aren't sure.

### Lessons learned

The work experience threads were first started 2 years ago by nosjojo, and came out of the need to make the FAQ page able to answer common questions from the inevitable waves of engineering students and freshly graduated engineers every season; it's our [eternal September](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/September-that-never-ended.html) and something we have to deal with on a regular basis whether we like it or not.

When I decided to run the posts again, I organized them a little differently and shilled the post in other subreddits to gather outside interest. This worked well, but there were problems which became apparent after the first few. Originally each thread was supposed to last 2 weeks or if 20 responses were gathered (whichever came first), and the next thread would be posted. As I continued, I found that I would either forget to post them, or didn't have time to. This didn't end up being a huge deal, but it was a pain for the mods to keep on top of.

After this experience, we've pinned down how to make these threads consistently more organized simply by adding them to Automoderator's schedule. Moving forward, because reddit archives posts 6 months after posting, there will be several yearly posts on rotation:

Thread|Frequency
:--|:--:
Work experience threads|once per year
Engineers available for interview|once per year
Panel of Engineers (flair application)|twice per year

### Career threads

Some users have expressed that they really dislike seeing career-related questions on AskEngineers. Career questions have always been allowed, with a mixture of quality ranging from fantastic ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4fa4hn/im_a_junior_engineer_and_im_facing_an_ethical/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3pwc4w/dealing_with_a_toxic_employee_is_tough_how_do_you/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4rtxzx/engineering_managers_of_reddit_what_drove_you_to/)) to [annoying](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4z7ojj/how_to_get_a_google_software_engineering_job/). Many of you only want to see technical content. I get it.

This policy was inherited when I joined as moderator, and we haven't taken any huge measures to cut down on the number of them outside of having weekly threads and improving the FAQ. This is intentional, mainly because AskEngineers is one of the few places on the internet where you can get real information about a career in engineering, and have honest and valuable discussions on how to navigate the pitfalls. I think that's relevant and valuable to many of you, so career questions are here to stay.

However, we'll try to do a better job of cleaning up low-quality posts by locking them and warning users to read our Content Guidelines before posting. How well we do depends on you helping us out by reporting bad posts. Repeat offenders will be subject to temporary and/or permanent bans. I get the feeling that we're letting too many of the ""annoying"" threads have a free pass without any consequences, but I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this.

If you're looking for technical content, here are numerous forums that are strictly for this purpose, such as [engineering.StackExchange](http://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions), [eng-tips](http://www.eng-tips.com/), and various subreddits (listed in the sidebar).

20,What weight would be required to lower an elevated leg from a 60º angle to the floor over t time?,1471989140,"I'm looking to build a stretching tower that slowly lowers a given leg or legs from the 60º angle to the floor while someone is strapped into this thing and lying on the floor.

I'm also asking how much it would cost. It doesn't even have to look nice, honestly, I just want functionality.

My only concerns would be

A)How much of an engineering nightmare would it be to make it?

B)How hard would it be to have joysticks controlling the arms, Sure, you could hook up the parts to it, but how hard would it be to program the joysticks to control it, like you would say, a helicopter?

C) In what way could I have moving legs? And if too difficult, what alternatives are there? Tracks get stuck too easily on hills (I live in a very hilly area so if I wanted to do a field test, it would be difficult), so if possible I would rather not add tracks.

Finally,

D) How would I keep it powered? Assuming I'm using an engine, where would I put the panel to add gas, oil, etc? If battery, where would I charge it? I assume it would require a lot as I wish (if possible) to add A/C. Not required, but requested.

I have a question to ask.  I am working on a structural support plan and would like to run a support scenario by you.  I can't understand how a load will be distributed along the length of a beam with multiple connection in-between the loads.  

Loads are located on the outside of the beam and are distributed over an unsupported length. 

There are various connection points for the beam, which are in-between the loads.

Loads on outside of beam would be equal to each other.

[Load Diagram Here](http://imgur.com/a/mnkv2)

I can understand that if there were only two supports under the beam, the load would be directly applied to those supports, but what happens if you add supports under the beam and connect them via weld or bolts?

Would a portion of the load be applied to the two outside supports and exponentially be distributed to all other supports in-between?

Would the outside supports see a downward force and the center supports see an upward force?

What is the torque of each individual planet within an Epicyclic gear set? 

I have a thorough understanding of gear ratios but am unsure about this. Mostly because all information related to this is, conflicting.

I would assume that within an Epicyclic gear system (where the sun is the driver) that the planets would each experience an equal rotation speed and torque, that determined by the basic gear ratio concept. But I found this…

“The load in a planetary gear train is shared among multiple planets, therefore torque capability is greatly increased. The more planets in the system, the greater the load ability and the higher the torque density.”
 
Does this mean that each planet experiences the same rpm yet a torque of 1/n (where n is the number of planets), so that the total torque of the planets adds up to the torque determined by a 1planet to 1sun gear ratio.

Usually this is not very difficult to calculate the deformation along the beam.

54,Painting the underside of pans and pots black,1471869366,"Hey. I just bought a new frying pan. Upon using it the first time I thought it was terrible. It took forever to heat up and just didn't seem to ""take off"". The stove was searing hot though. 

I compared the pan to my older ones and noted one major difference. The new pan had almost a mirror shine on its bottom while my older pans were grayish and cruddy. Since I use a ceramic stove, the kind that heats through IR with a dull red glow, I thought maybe this is significant.

Black stuff is black because it absorbs more light/radiation. White absorbs less. Not a lot of things are ""white"" in the IR spectrum, but shiny metal sure is. That's why volcano guys have that shining suit of armor to not get cooked.

So that should mean I get a whole lot of more oomph if the bottom of the pan was black.

The question is, what is a good coating for this? I'll be cooking food with it, so nothing too toxic. It'll be hot too, so it's got to withstand that. It's gonna go through the dishwasher too.

I'm thinking bbq paint is good. It's supposedly good to 600 deg. C. I think at that point the aluminum in my pan has melted.

Especially because this question is in no way specific which I know can be frustrating. However, I'm looking for people's ideas they've been exposed to throughout life, and since knowledge is relative to your experience, someone might have a kernel of an idea.

I'm looking to eliminate dishwashing. I started with a few ideas, here they are:

1. Create Quadcopters that fly around picking up dishes, and putting them in the dishwasher (however to me, what's bad about this is that it puts a bandaid on the problem. I prefer solving the root cause. i.e. instead of cleaning clothes, make them super hydrophobic so that you don't need to clean them.)
2. Make the dishes super-hydrophobic. Scientists are already working on this, but it still means you have to wipe off the dishes and pick em up. I wanna get rid of both steps. This just makes it a lot easier to clean. (which is a step forward I suppose)
3. (a TVP supporter shared this idea with me) Make the utensils, and dish edible. The trick here is making them a delicacy of sorts - so make those resonate with the food in the dish, and as good as or better than the dish. 

I should note: I also want to eliminate the step of picking up a dish, not just the washing.

What I'm looking for is some type of thin layer I can install on the chilled plate that improves the flow of heat from the phone. My requirements (in order) are:

from what I've read of Kevin Hoag's Vehicular Engine Design book, there is a moment across the length of the crankshaft from the end cylinders moving in opposite directions, and another moment from the 4 middle cylinders moving in opposite directions 18° from the former's moment.

Apparently with large counterweights on the end of the crankshaft it cancels the rocking primary moment. Though, how can a non changing weight cancel the varying momentums of nonsinusoidal movement resulting from connecting rod length that can't be infinite?

Would the counterweights, which travel in opposite directions on opposode sides and weighing more than the opposing crankpins create their own rotational imbalance due to centrifugal force during every crank angle other than the points which a piston reaches tdc or bdc?

Can a 90° Crossplane v8 be balanced at all engine speeds? How come some performance crankshaft balancers which balance crankshafts for many racing firms like NASCAR use what is called overbalancing and underbalancing, where instead of using 50% of reciprocating weight on the counterweights, they use 47%-52% instead and claim  it creates less vibration at a certain rpm range but increases it at a different range.

Capacities sensors are too sensitive and will response to a thin layer that sticks to the container inner wall. Ultrasonic transmitter/receiver can measure the depth but the sensors are unprotected against the moist.

90,[Advice please] New job not quite what I expected,1471660504,"Hi guys, I recently graduated with a undergrad degree in electrical engineering, and I am currently around 6 months into my first engineering job out of school. Upon starting, I was given lots of documents to read (proposals, specs, and other documents of the type). After a couple of months, I realized that most of the work that I would be doing would be more in the field of systems engineering than electrical engineering. I wouldn't be doing calculations of things like electric fields, voltages, currents etc. for designs or tests like I imagined I would be doing in school, but rather I would be doing document reviews and specs with more of a higher level view.  During my time at school, I worked in the research lab, which I really enjoyed since I could apply the things that I learned in my classes. At my job, I feel I am not utilizing my degree to the fullest, and instead I feel that most of the job could be done by someone who hasn't studied in the field of electrical engineering. Regardless, I told myself before I even started my first job that I would stick it out for at least a year to learn the most that I could from the job before I consider changing jobs or going back to school. I've been thinking a lot about it lately, and I'd love to hear what your thoughts are, even if you haven't gone through the same thing as I am. I've written up some of my questions; hopefully some of you guys have been through the same thing and can give me some advice. 

* Did you stay at your job even though it wasn't what you thought it would be, and if so, did you gradually begin to love the new focus of your work, or did you gradually grow to resent it more and more over time? Are you still with the same company, or did you eventually leave?
* If you were one that hated your job and changed quickly, were you glad you did it, or did you regret not staying longer to find out? Did you end up liking your new job better?
* I have heard careers that heavily utilize theories and concepts learned in the classroom to discover new technology (I guess this might be considered more of a research type career) require more than an undergraduate degree (careers such as developing new technologies for Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works or designing new converters for Texas Instruments to name a few). Is this true? Will I have to go back to school to get a graduate degree if that is the path I want to take?
* How long can I stay in my current job before I will be stuck in this field and unable to pursue my aspirations in the more technical side, if there is even a time limit?
* Anything else related that you think might help would be greatly appreciated! 

I know this is quite a bit of reading, but thanks for taking your time to read it!

93,Is it possible to inject fluid in a pressurized (1500psi) line?,1471636335,"Hi

I was wondering if anyone can tell me if it's possible to inject fluid into a pressurized line after the pump? I'm not sure if this info will help but:

* The ID is 3/8""
* The outlet hole is 0.067""
* The pump is running at ~4.3 gpm
* All of the above translates to the line pressurized at 1500psi when the pump is operating

Or does anyone know who I would be able to ask for this kind of info?

EDIT:

I realize that my question is actually missing a lot of useful info! Thanks to /u/shortyjacobs and /u/titebotine, I'll just summarize here. The application is for a pressure washer system. I am currently employed at a facility that washes and disinfects agricultural equipment. The problem I'd like to try and resolve is to shorten the time it takes to deliver chemical to the outlet. 

Right now, the pump is 250ft away from the end of the hose and the chemical is introduced at the inlet of the pump. Because of this, when I change chemicals, I have to wait 30s for it to reach my end. There are some days where it's slow so I have been experimenting with venturi injectors but I have noticed a significant drop in pressure (I've noticed around 66% drop but that is with a venturi injector designed for a foam system).

I am writing here to see if there is an alternative to a venturi injector.

I was supposed to get accepted to an engineering program at my school and I didn't because they exceeded capacity (despite completing all the courses required with roughly A's and B's) and I couldn't transfer out because I had a full scholarship to that school so I resorted to getting a degree in an nontechnical field since my school was a jerk on changing majors.

If it is relevant, I have completed...
3 Semesters of Calculus 
1 Semester of Differential Equations
1 Semester of Vector Calculus
1 Semester of Matrix/Matricies/Linear Algebra
1 Semester of Programming in Mathlab
2 Semesters of Chemistry with lab
2 Semesters of Organic Chemistry with Lab
2 Semesters of Engineering Physics (Mechanics and Electricity)
1 Semester of Statics
1 Semester of Dynamics
1 Semester of Thermodynamics 
1 Semester of Geology

9,"At a crossroads, ME or EE?",1471546984,"Hey folks, I cannot make up my mind which of the two engineering fields I'm more interested in and will be more successful in, electrical or mechanical engineering.

I like almost any technology related topic, industrial technologies, and machinery. I see myself as a geek, and sometimes a gearhead. There's a common say; ""if you need to see or touch, pick ME and if you like the more abstract stuff, pick EE"". Well, I'm a bit afraid of abstract stuff (especially when I don't understand them well) the irony is I'm good at writing fictional essays and fantasizing.

The thing I like about ME the most is the ability to combine my art with design to form a visible physical object, a more hands-on experience with the ability to show my talent. Otherwise, watching a video course on stress and strain didn't seem all that exciting to me. I found that a typical mechanical engineering degree covers topics that are not my favorites, or at least to my knowledge (though I like them in general, maybe because of my curiosity and my inquisitive mind).

When I was a teenager, I was highly interested in how electronic circuits work and how to design them. I also loved designing cars and perspectives and my drawings of cars would wow everybody and that's where my parents recommend me ME because of my talent in drawing and because it has ""easier"" subjects than EE.
I used to dream of the day that I could be a geek and would be able to fully understand and to be able of doing anything tech related. I was a nerd as a kid and would read every scientific book that I could reach and understand it's content.

I read somewhere that EE's aren't worried about ""physical form"", which it's quite false for me. I'm very sensitive to physical form and design of any project given to me.

It seems that most of the topics in electrical engineering are closely related to mathematics. I'm not bad in Math based on my grades at school and I know the fact that calculus and complex numbers (and even more maths for EE's) are essential for engineers. Someone told me I need to be really comfortable with them to be good at electrical engineering. Well, I doubt if every engineer is ""comfortable"" with maths?! I remember I had frustrations with math especially when I couldn't solve them, possibly caused by bad teachers and misunderstanding they led us to.

So now, my greatest concern about EE is that I don't know if I could handle tough abstract topics in it or if my mind is made for tough electrical analysis (like how my parents are afraid of, because I hated math at school), otherwise I love every second of technical and practical hands-on work of EE.

I'm designing a mechanical part to be laser cut from acrylic - it's light, seems pretty strong to me, and is cheap and easy enough to work with that it makes sense for this project. It's going to form part of a load-bearing bracket, and I'm trying to understand how thick I should aim for each piece to be.

From Wikipedia, acrylic has a yield strength of 72MPa, and mild steel is 274MPa, so 3.8 times stronger. Does this mean that a 6mm thick piece of acrylic would more or less be able to hold the same weight as a metal plate in the same shape that is 1.5mm thick? If it's not that simple - how can I compare them, what generalisations would I be able to make?

Edit: As a bit of an example of what I'm dealing with, [here's a quick mockup](http://imgur.com/a/jwIpm). Say it's a plate that's 80mm across, 40mm wide, with four 4mm mounting holes in the corners.

We are doing some electrical checks tomorrow and if that's not the problem we're sending it to our supplier and they are taking it apart, hopefully with me present. I'd say we're 90% sure it is jammed up, especially as the rotor won't turn by hand like it normally should. The environment is extremely harsh so this isn't a shock, though it is quite a concern. Currently we are down to one pump and we are redesining the system for a quick pump change when this occurs again. 

EDIT2: I got to go to the shop last week where the repair these pumps and it was pretty neat. The pump was indeed jammed, probably due to a heavy slug of material hitting it in a bad way (maybe a piece of wood or something, we just got out of construction mode). The way this pumps works is there is a rotating piece mounted on a stationary piece acting almost exactly like a garbage disposal. It got misaligned and was unable to spin, drawing high amps and cutting on the breaker. We repaired it, cleaned it out, and put it back in our pit, where hopefully it will remain for a long time.

34,How much would it cost Realistically for a bare bones crew to get a B29 wreck out of greenland or alaska?,1471459023,"OK so Basically here's the gist of it, In 1950s a B-29 crash landed in Greenland after getting lost 250 miles north of Thule air force base, It sat there for 40ish years until a rescue crew tried to restore her and fly her out, but they ultimately failed when the fuselage caught fire burning the fuselage and the nose leaving it in the middle of a frozen lake.


My plan would be to Use a Crawler That team left behind, to pull it out in the summer when the lake is thawed, and to use air-floats to keep the wings and the rest of the wreckage on the surface.

once at the shore , the wings can then be either cut from the fuselage, and then airlifted out with a helicopter, as well with the remaining parts of the fuselage and the semi intact tail

I think this can all be done realistically for around maybe $100,000- $200,000, you just need a crew crazy enough to do it, I'm wondering as well, How much would it cost to rent a heavy lift helicopter? I mean I dont think I need a Mi-26 or anything super heavy, but I still need some way to get it off the Greenland  ice sheet to a place where it can be restored

35,MS Engineering Management Advice,1471458598,"Hi,

I've seen a few threads that seemed (generally) dismissive of such degrees for those without a lot of experience, but my situation is a bit different.

My undergrad is in math and I'd like to be able to break into an entry level systems, business analyst, project management, or IE-type role, but I've heard from friends (in government/government contractor jobs, which is where I'd like to work) that the lack of an engineering qualification would give my resume the old garbage toss.

I'm actually already enrolled in UW Platteville's program and actually like the courses for the EM emphasis, but I thought I'd see if:

a) Switching to an emphasis in control systems would make the degree more valuable. I know I said I'd rather do more systems-type stuff, but getting a job outweighs all that.

b) Anyone has or knows anyone or has a master's in EM without a an engineering BS and/or knows about UW Platteville's program

I hope I'll get answers related to the disciplines that make up these 2 fields, although any useful input is appreciated.

Academia vs Industry:

- Are Researchers more serious about their work and more productive than Engineers in industry since they are better educated?

- How does Research in academia differ from that in Industry? What liberties and constraints are there in both? Compare and constrast R&amp;D in big companies to Universities'.

- Is a job in Academia more stable? I'm asking since I'm assuming hirings and layoff are a lot less common than in Industry and there's a smaller job market.

- How is the position hierarchy in Academia different to the one in Industry?

The PhD itself :

- How specialized is a PhD compares to a Masters' if good part of a PhD is teaching you how to conduct research?

- I want to learn as much as possible as there is in a field as directly linked as possible to one of the many branches of Robotics and work with cutting-edge technology.  Is the obvious choice to go Academia? I can't say I care too much about pay.

- I have a feeling about teaching, I will either love it or hate it, depending on students and quality of Uni. Being an undergraduate atm, almost all lectures are boring and no one listens to the lecturer(I don't take part in discussions as much I'd like to, I'll admit that).

56,Having BIG problems at my new job. Is this my fault?,1471400156,"Sorry in advance if this is a bit /r/offmychest but I'm really frustrated right now I don't know how to move forward.

I just started working as an ""engineer"" at a *very* small company (owner, mechanic, me). The company produces very low volume niche electro-mechanical products to support commercial manufacturing businesses. Think approximately motorized carts for carrying materials.

I quote engineer because my degree is still in progress. However, this is not my first job serving this function as I was hired primarily based on work experience as a designer/draftsmen.

I've been working part time with this company about a month. aprox 60 hours so far. 

The last two times I've gone into work I've made my boss extremely frustrated and its beginning to frustrate me because I feel like his reaction is completely unfair.

It's difficult to concisely describe exactly what's happening but basically when he gives me directions or assignments, when he's finished speaking I repeat back to him what he said to make sure we're on the same page and he freaks out like I don't understand him.

Yesterday morning, the day began with us trying to locate a particular solidworks part revision and its corresponding drawing so I could make corrections that he redlined on a physical copy of the drawing. He keeps all his .prt, .pdfs, assemblies, etc in one giant folder so this kind of thing is pretty normal. We eventually found an older revision (part file). I asked him if the only difference between older and newest revision was a small change in the angle one of the pieces of sheet metal, he said yes so I said I could make the change to this file and create a new drawing of it. I eventually run into problems because that *wasn't* the only difference between the revisions and there are little changes everywhere that need to be made to the part. My boss is now upset because he thought this should have only taken me an hour tops and I'd been working on it 2 hours. Maybe as much as 2.5.

He says to forget it and just move onto another project. A client wanted to use one of our motorized carts to carry something different from usual and he wanted me to modify the existing attachment we produce. This attachment we already produce *used* the part that we couldn't find. After our discussion, I say to him ""Okay so I'm going to move onto this other project and I'm not going to finish making these corrections to the red line drawing"" He again gets frustrated like I misunderstood him and goes on about how he thought I should have only taken an hour to finish the drawing and in the future just start new part rather than try to make changes to an old part. I finally get him to say, yes, and move onto the new project and shelf the other task.

We had spoken previously though briefly about this other project and he was clear that he wanted to modify our existing design. Again though, our existing design is 90% the part which we do not have a current file for, only a pdf with the critical dimensions for how the attachment quick releases. 

So I go to work making use of what I have. Making changes to the parts we have to accommodate the new design goals. After I change the existing parts, I go to ask him if I need to make new drawings of the unchanged parts since although I don't have the .prt files, he technically still has the pdfs copies and can send those to the job shop for our prototype. Also since he clearly cares about every extra dollar he might have to pay me I feel like this might be a legitimate concern for him.

Well he freaks out again and starts acting like I don't understand what he's asking me. He keeps cutting me off and going ""Look I don't care what you do, just give me a drawing that I can send out to have made""

Now keep in mind, he wants me to model this prototype in solidworks and then create drawings of the assembly so he can have it sent out to a job shop to have them make it. In order for this prototype to work correctly, it has to integrate with our already existing quick release mechanism. The accuracy of all my drawings is completely suspect since so many of them conflict or just flat out are missing dimensions.

Again, My name and my name alone is all over this project so when this prototype comes back and something doesn't function correctly it's my fault and my fault alone. Also, he wanted it done by the end of the day(yesterday) and when that didn't happen he said he wanted it by the end of today. 

I know I'm not the best or fastest cad draftsmen out there and these aren't the most complicated parts but I really like his expectations are completely unreasonable and the fact that his goals shifted like 3 times before 1 pm on monday, he can't really get mad that I'm asking him clarifying questions. Also, it's not like he's paying me a Sr engineers salary or even a proper ""engineers"" salary at that tbh.

I honestly feel so lost about this right now. Almost like I'm just not seeing some huge error I'm making because he seems so cool and level headed otherwise but his reactions to me lately just make NO fucking sense.

68,Clamp-on Ultrasonic Flow Measurement?,1471367273,"Hello, I've searched the internet and the forums and I can't seem to find a lot of good information on this. I'm going to be purchasing a portable non-intrusive clamp-on flow meter for use in measuring water flow in chilled water and heating water hydronic systems.  I'm just looking for product recommendations and general experiences with this type of flow meter.

My application will ber analyzing existing hydronic systems used in HVAC applications, so chilled water temperatures will range from 40-54°F and heating water temperatures between 100 and 250°F. Water velocities should be below 10 fps in most applications, but I wouldn't be surprised if they exceed that in some circumstances. Pipe diameters should be under 10"" in most applications, but capability for larger pipes would be nice. This will be used for taking quick field measurements and for doing some temporary datalogging to determine existing flow conditions.

I'd just like to know if anyone has had any good or bad experiences with certain brands or if there are any solid industry standards out there I should be looking at. I'm currently looking at Onicon's F-4400, and hopefully will be receiving one to demo before purchasing soon. I'd also like to know if anyone has any general information on them based on experience.

Let me start by saying all the electronics I know and understand are from 1 year of physics back in college. I understand the basics so reaching out here for clarification and safety.

So I'm going to Yellowstone next week and camping. I have an extremepower 12v 7Ah battery that I will use to store power on via solar charge panel. I WILL be using a charge controller.  I will be using it mainly to charge our usb electronics and MS Surface tablet via a 12v socket charger attachment as well as my GoPro and Nikon camera batteries. 

Question 1:
My question is, if I mainly use the usb (5v - 2A max) charger, will the battery last longer because of the lower voltage use, or will that be irrelevant since I will be pulling 2 amps (max - assuming my devices will decide to pull the max) from my usb devices. My tablet requires 12v 2A btw. 

Question 2:
I have 2 usb and one 12v socket charger I will be hooking up to this 12v 7A battery. Is it safe to install all 3 socket chargers in parallel to the battery simultaneosly? If so, can I use all (2 usb and 1 12v) simultaneosly  and safely?

We have several machining and assembly lines whose AB PLCs rely on Profibus DP for connections to valvebanks, input blocks and HMIs.  We even have some old Steeplechase PC software that uses Profibus DP for communication for different nodes.  

Any time there is a profibus issue it's such a head ache.  When a node keeps dropping out that's not necessarily where the problem originates.  Our method generally revolves around checking connections, checking the final terminator and then flicking terminators to see when nodes stop or start dropping out to try and narrow down where the problem is.  Not a very refined process.

I've tried googling for solutions to this issue and there are plenty of people willing to sell me things, but I was wondering if anybody here with some more experience might be able to chime in with what works for them.  Right now I'm looking at the Profitrace 2 by Procentec

11,Can we have a serious discussion about the legalities of providing and taking engineering advice on an anonymous engineering forum?,1471174966,"Hey guys,

I'm not a mod here but I would like to have a discussion with you guys with regards to giving and receiving engineering advice on this forum and the risks that come with it.

Every country has its own laws with regards to engineering design and construction, and the statutorily bound accreditation you need, so I won't get into the nitty gritty here.

Be aware that when you design for a company, it will most likely be a collaborative exercise, with many processes and resources provided for sign-off and approval to protect you. The final product produced has very likely seen many eyes which in itself mitigates risk.

However, sometimes, your company may not necessarily provide you with the right resources to adequately design something that is hand-on-your-heart, safe. For example, you may not work with electrical engineers, and be forced to project manage the installation of a mains power system. Or your company doesn't see the benefit in getting a structural engineer in for a consult, and request that you get a contractor to install a load bearing beam that will hold up a roof.

This can cause us to turn to this forum for some quick advice. However, we sometimes may be blinded to all the risks that come with taking the advice, especially if it's not your primary discipline. (Sure the beam is adequate against buckling. But is the concrete underneath it strong enough? Are the anchors and bolts strong enough?)

I always live by the motto of CYA (Cover Your Ass). Make sure you leave a paperwork trail showing your due diligence and to prove you weren't negligent.

17,Recirculating air in apartment HVAC causing intentional inefficiency?,1471127545,"[Schematic and photos](https://imgur.com/a/s6Lhf)

I recently moved into a 800 sqft 1 bedroom apartment that finished construction in spring this year. It has central heating and air. Without getting into too much detail, the A/C has been shutting off before hitting it's target low temperature (I like it around 73F) with a ""power failure"" error. I've called in a maintenance request a few times, but after checking all the usual suspects (thermostat, refrigerant pressures (they claim), and circuit breaker), they gave up and said ""it's probably just getting tired and shutting off"" (direct quote).

With staff support looking like a dead end, I decided to get the ladder, open shit up, and just stare at it a while hoping that some facts would make themselves apparent to me. After a while I noticed that a 10""x10"" hole was cut into the bottom of the air distribution box (where heated or cooled air gets routed into the various ducts on its way to the vents in each room). The 10""x10"" hole lines up directly above the smaller access hatch [see photos](https://imgur.com/a/s6Lhf), so I assumed it was intentional at first. However, after thinking about how this whole air circulation contraption works, I realized that it's actually letting conditioned air get sucked back into the intake without ever being distributed to the vents. There is a 3"" gap between the small access panel and the hole in the distribution box, so closing the panel by no means seals the hole.

As a test, I cut a piece of cardboard and placed it in the distribution box above the hole. Any time the fan is on there is positive pressure in the distribution box, so the cardboard does a fine job sealing it. I tested with and without the cardboard in place and found a definite increase in airflow coming out of the vents when the hole is sealed.

So my question is this: Why would there be a hole in the distribution box that allows air to recirculate within the blower assembly? The small access hatch looks to be of intentional construction, which makes me think the hole was intentional, but I don't understand what purpose this serves. I suppose some recirculation would mean the air that does make it to the vents is colder when it gets there, but it reduces the total amount of air circulation throughout the house by essentially short-circuiting itself. My hypothesis is that this recirculation is causing the evaporator to get too cold, too fast, thereby tripping some pressure or temperature safety threshold and shutting itself off.

TL;DR - found a hole cut in air distribution box that allows cold air to recirculate without getting blown to the vents. It looks intentional, but I don't understand why.",AskEngineers,myriadofplethoras,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4xldgf/recirculating_air_in_apartment_hvac_causing/
18,I have a question on breaking strain of single cord vs specially knotted.,1471120495,"If you have some nice kevlar-style cord which is 200lb tensile strength, it would break if you dangle anything more than 200lb off it. But what if you, for example did some cobra stitch and dangled things from that? Is there a way you could calculate the breaking strain or tensile strength based on the design of the weaving/etc design? For example cobra stitch. Here is the simple instructions on how it is made. one layer at a time: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/2f/6a/7f/2f6a7fadf224bcccf9cdd43916b8f717.jpg

Then the final result looks like this: http://lcropes.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/2/1/17214162/1492065.jpg?279

So it is all one piece of cord, an inner double strand and then kind of a sandwich of two strands over the top of the 2 strand core.

So does that mean if you were to support weight on this final result, treating a length of this as a somewhat flat rope, would be be far far more strong than a single thread? Or would it not be much different due to interactions between threads so it would still break?

41,Is it feasible to use a non-Newtonian fluid as a photopolymer solvent in stereolithography?,1471022673,"Hi, my apologies if this question is out of place. I was attempting to consider ways in which additive manufacturing can be improved upon, with a focus on stereolithography. 

In particular, I was focusing on eliminating the waste (in terms of both time and photopolymer resin) incurred by the need to print support structures for certain parts that have solid or ""overhanging"" geometries.

I thought the necessity of support structures could be absolved if specific regions of a photopolymer solvent (as opposed to the fluid consisting solely of photopolymer resin) could have drastically increased viscosity via acoustic interference that induced shear thickening, allowing overhanging subsections of the printed component to be suspended or cradled in place during the printing process.

Would a shear-thickening (dilatant) non-Newtonian fluid (such as a corn starch and water mixture), coupled with the necessary equipment to focus and direct acoustic vibrations to certain regions in that fluid work to ""cradle"" components mid-fluid so that no support structures are needed? And if it is feasible, would that enable full assemblies with moving parts to be printable, since its subsystems could be cradled independently (without mutual contact) during the printing process?

There are many more details to be worked out for this, so I apologize for the poor description I have given. I just figured it would be neat to have any preliminary feedback. Thanks in advance for any insight.

8 Amps @ 208V (line-to-line) Phase A - Phase B  
10 Amps @ 208V (line-to-line) Phase B - Phase C  
12Amps @ 208V (line-to-line) Phase C - Phase A  
5 Amps @ 120V (line-to-neutral)Phase A - Neutral  
2 Amps @ 120V (line-to-neutral)Phase B - Neutral  
1 Amps @ 120V (line-to-neutral)Phase C - Neutral

62,Propore way of installing a knob,1470929360,"Hello fellow engineers,

At my place of employment, a machinist, an assembler, and myself (sounds like the beginning of a bad joke) are having a discussion about the proper way of installing a indication know for an adjustable light on a legacy machine we produce.  I bring this question here because I could not find ""the correct way"" of installing such a system. Installing a indication knob on a shaft was not really covered when I was in school.

Parts:
A indication knob-with set screw
the poteniameter with a flat on the shaft (plastic).

Due to how it the system is assembled the set screw on the knob not match up with the the flat on the pot.

Opinions:
The Machinist feels the knob needed to be drilled and taped so the set screw is on the flat

The assembler feels the knob does not need to be drilled (saving a step) and the set screw ""digs"" into the plastic shaft of the pot even though its on the round, and not on the flat.

Me: due to the forces that will be applied to the pot, I feel either option will work.

due to the set up of my company, the knowledge is made up and the prints don't matter.  (this is another discussion for another time)

So thoughts? concerns? something I missed? spelling mistakes?

I started a new job recently as a graduate engineer in a steel industry. I was given a project and where I have to increase the flow rate from a silo to a tanker. The material is a very thin coal (so thin that is almost like a fluid) and I have to increase the flow rate from 1 ton per minute up to 1.5 tons per minute.

My idea is to remove the rotary valve and the screw valve that are currently used (the two valves are used for controlling the flow of the material) and add two slide gates to control if the material is flowing or not. When the coal is allowed to flow it will be entering two mild steel tubes that will then entering the tanker.

It is a very simple design but I have two major problem. The first one is that a rubber seal for the slide gate won't last long because the material is very abrasive. So I was looking for a better seal or a different way to control the flow.
The second problem is the following. Because the material is very thin and the plant is build in a very windy area, the coal must be deposited directly into the tanker. And since the tankers move every 30 mins I have to come up with a way that would allow me to do that with a simple and fast way. For that I was thinking of a rubber tube that can get in the tanker and come out which is something similar to what is used right now.

I figured I'd try to calculate it before reaching out to the manufacturer but I'm getting an efficiency of about 100% - which can't be correct. Now I'm just curious where I've gone wrong. Here's what I've got:

    KW_in = 1.73*E*I*PF/1000

 where PF was calculated using [this online tool](http://www.rapidtables.com/calc/electric/power-factor-calculator.htm). 

E = 575 V

I=59.2 A

PF = 0.759 where, 

    Real power in KW = 60HP*.7457KW/HP = 44.742 KW
It's 3 phase, line to line voltage (voltage and current above) at 60Hz.

**Therefore, KW_in = 44.696 KW**

KW_out I just converted from the 60HP - perhaps this is my mistake as the 60HP isn't the shaft output? 

However using this, **KW_out = 44.742**

So,     
     
    Efficiency = P_out/P_in *100 = 100.1%

I'm told the efficiency should be somewhere around 85% and the PF should be a little higher, but I'm not sure what my mistake is.

I'm having a hard time grasping the possible failure modes I need to look for. I have confirmed all grounds, all the 3 phase lines, and all of the wiring shown in the simplified diagram. I am a mechanical engineer and I'm fairly comfortable with DC but I've never had to work with 3 phase power. Any direction and insight is greatly appreciated.

7,Engineering Explained video about not bringing car to operating temperature before driving it. Is this correct?,1470746400,"Typing on phone, I'm very sorry for formatting problems! 

So basically I'm curious about EEs video about waiting for the car to come to operating temperature before driving it. He says (and I understand this isn't for all cars) that you do not need to. 

Being a gear head, I usually do wait for operating temperature and at the very least wait for the fuel pump to prime before starting the car and for the oil to get around to various engine components when started. At least that I think everyone agrees with. 

Now my problem is that EE says that driving sensibly and not straining the engine till operating temperature is the best choice. This is due to the engine warming up quicker as a lot of strain is put on the engine at a cold start idle. Now I don't understand this. By this logic it would also make sense to Rev and hold the car at redline till it's at operating temperature as it 'warms up faster'. 

The only thing I can think of is that idling will put little strain over a very long period of time, accumulating how much wear the engine sees at cold start idle, while revving high will put a high amount of strain over a short amount of time. What I mean by this is that both would cause (let's say) 1000 units of wear on the engine, at different time intervals, while driving after 10 seconds for the oil to run around and not pushing the car will be the middle ground and only put 500 units of wear..

36,2 years experience - need help/advice?,1470648905,"Hello /r/AskEngineers I have worked in the industry for 2 years now. I'm 25 and kind of 'fell' into the world of engineering. 

When I was 18 I had to make a decision about which course I wanted to do at University. I chose Product Design because ever since I was a young kid, I'd made things and thought that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to show the world what I could do... However, I was hit with depression and anxiety and was kicked off the course, at 22, taking a HNC in Product Design away with me.

I've now at 25 just completed my HNC in Mechanical Engineering which I'm over the moon about. The company I work for paid for this equating to £4020 (£2k/year + £20 admin fees), which I now have to stay with them for 4 years otherwise I will have to pay a percentage of this amount back. 

I had an initial starting wage of £16k, this was for me to model their existing technical drawings into Solidworks (I have 10 years experience using this as I learnt at high school). Within 3 months of me being here, my manager said that he'd got me a pay rise up to £18k as I was doing very well. 

Eventually, people left and my workload increased. To the point of where I was doing more work than people on £25k+. So a year ago I decided to ask my second manager since working here for a pay review. Long story short, he said no by giving me loads of calculations (of which I still remember now) but that once I finish my college course I should be on around £25k.  He wasn't even willing to speak to the Financial Director whom told me I would receive a pay rise after the first year and didn't give me one. I just accepted this and continued on with my work.

He left last October and I have no record of the meeting, only the calculations he said. I now have another manager who I had a meeting with about my performance. In his words *""I thought you were more progressed than you are, you're good with this (Solidworks) but not the engineering yet.""* so he said in 3 months we'd have another meeting and see whether I deserve a pay rise of up to £20.5k. Which is essentially what they've been paying out for me up until now anyway since I started the course so they're not paying out any more which doesn't make me feel valued as an employee. Saying that, nobody has had a pay rise in our office in the last 2 years, but they should be asking for them too.

I have two things I need help/advice with;

1. The company is crazy, imagine an episode of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares where the manager thinks that everything is everyone elses fault and doesn't realise that shouting at people and having a high turnover of staff isn't good. And being told I have no engineering knowledge when there's very little engineering going on here. This makes me want to leave, but I can't due to owing them college fees. Is there any way out of this, I do have a contract I signed to say I would do this but the timescales are very loose.

2. How can I negotiate a pay rise? I have spurts of anxiety still and this doesn't help. I've calculated using my second managers calculations that I should be on £27.5k, I know they're not going to give me a £9k pay rise. But if I start out high and aim to get £25k I think I'll be happy. I just don't know what to say or how to get it.

I'd also like to go out into the world on my own, I'm designing things to be made for the /r/mechanicalkeyboards community at the moment. But obviously the money from this isn't going to go towards paying my rent and keeping my car on the road.

I can model, i just need a napkin design to work off of, because i have no idea how it would function even though it seems real easy... 
 
Anyhow, this mechanical contraption im trying to design is basically a tube with a rectangle cut out (a door). I need the door to lift out a few cm, just enough to clear the tube, and slide up its length, revealing the empty tube compartment.
Space is limited, as it needs to fit inside the tube and above the door. realistically  its got to be powered by a single motor (or none at all? Springs and pullys would be fantastic) because two defanately won't fit.

[Edit] Now that I'm home ill provide a little more detail! 

it's very small, like ~15 cm width, and 20cm long. so hydraulics probably isn't an option unless there are some insanely small ones?

I will be 3D modeling/printing the parts so size isn't really an issue concerning track/pin/socket/armature stuff.

Are there cables with multiple coaxial cables inside?  Can I use a quadax cable instead?  

It doesn't feel like quadax would work, because each signal wire would interfere with the other unless they were individually shielded from each other.

73,Delta Tau PMAC Universal Lite - Troubleshooting Help,1470438129,"Hello all!

I am working with a 4-axis filament winding machine at work that is controlled via a Delta Tau PMAC Universal Lite (602402-105 with built in DPRAM). The PMAC Card interprets a pattern program sent to it by the HOST computer it resides in, and then gives the machine the instructions.


The flow of data is like so:


HOST COMPUTER &gt; PMAC &gt; Machine &gt; PMAC &gt; HOST COMPUTER


The pattern program is cycled through the PMAC so many lines at a time through its DPRAM (dual port RAM), so as the lines are given to the machine new lines fill in the now empty space in the PMAC's DPRAM. This cycle continues until the pattern program is finished.


So, with that being said, let me explain the headache i've had for the past couple of weeks.


About 2 weeks ago, our tech turned on the machine to run a pattern program in order to wind a tank. Unfortunately, the machine encountered an error and would not proceed. It would almost complete 1 circuit around the vessel, but when it gets back near its starting point all 4 of the axes just stop and give us the following error codes:


ERROR: pattern: illegal command placement
ERROR: Estop ComputeRestart


Well, we took this information and called up the company that provided us with the machine. 2 weeks later, we are still trying to troubleshoot. However, we think we know what is going on - we just don't know how to test/remedy it!


**(This is where i'm hoping that someone who may have experienced the same problem, or is a PMAC-savant, appears out of thin air to save the day)**


We believe that there is something that is causing the PMACs rotary buffer not to cycle through the data (pattern program) being fed to it by the HOST computer. The buffer will fill up with the initial data (tank size, , but that's about it. When the machine gets to its last line of instruction, it has nothing else to do but stop. 


I have a massive amount of detail regarding how we've come to this conclusion, how we've tested our theory, as well as other things the machine is doing - but basically my question for /r/AskEngineers is 2 questions:

**
1. Is there anyone familiar with the PMAC Universal Lite / Related PMAC cards that would be willing to bounce ideas back and forth?
2. Can anyone familiar with the PMAC explain to me what may be causing the buffer not to operate correctly when running a pattern program?**


If anyone has PMAC experience, I'd love to pick your brain. I have poured over various manuals, references, and troubleshooting guides with no luck. I have spoken with Delta Tau, but apparently my card is ""obsolete"". While it may be old, it has worked for us for many years up until this point.

How do CSP plants deal with this? I'm guessing they try to point away from the tower, but there could be other issues with moving the mirrors. Do they just ""de focus"" the light off the tower up into the sky? I'm guessing this is an ""active"" trip system that requires power to work?

85,What is the best cavity shape to achieve even pressure across a flat filter surface under vacuum in a spray booth?,1470394788,"Hi guys,

I hope this is ok to post here and maybe someone can help me. I'm currently building a new workshop for my business, and part of it will be a spray room with an extraction system. There is a 600mm square air filter on one of the walls which will allow air to be drawn into the room, with an outlet on the other side of the room with an extractor fan. [Here's a rough diagram of how it's laid out.] (http://imgur.com/a/OIEhK) Connected to the fan inlet duct will be a spray booth I will be designing that has a large filter panel at the front, which will extract fumes from the room as well as small particles like atomised paint. 

What I'm trying to work out is how to spread out the suction across the booth's filter panel - I don't want suction concentrated near the outlet duct and with hardly any suction happening near the edges of the large filter panel. I build large scale models for a living, and I quite often have big objects like a model ship hull to paint, so I'm trying to ensure that the booth works properly and it safe to use.

The front panel of the booth with use a length of standard fiber glass or card spray booth filter as found in any spray shop, typically 1m high and I can fit a booth that's about 2 meters long max in the room, with the minimum I need about 1.5 meters long. The outlet for the booth can be located anywhere, whatever is needed to achieve even pressure across the panel.

Can someone help me work out what ~~cavity~~ plenum chamber shape behind the booth's panel filter would help me achieve as even a vacuum pressure as possible?

Thanks guys :).  

**EDIT:** Looking around, a common feature of free standing spray booths is that the ~~cavity~~ plenum chamber behind the panel filter tapers evenly toward the air outlet. This makes sense, but are there considerations of optimum volume for this plenum chamber, does how steep or shallow the taper is make a difference?

I'm living in a house that has a concrete patio, about 12cm thick (5""). There was once a room here that was demolished years ago. It rains about once a week throughout the year, so there's almost always a puddle present, and I'm looking for a way to provide drainage. 

Some friends tried to drill a hole through the slab, but the drill wasn't great and the bit kept coming loose. Still, in half a hour we only managed to get halfway through. The concrete seems pretty hard. But I since learned from a civil engineer that this might be a bad idea, to drain to under the slab. So now I'm thinking of cutting a groove to drain the puddle off the edge. It's about 2m (6') to the edge, and the puddle is about 2.5cm (1"") deep. Given the hardness of the concrete will it be possible to cut a groove with an angle-grinder, or are we going to go through several discs and hours of work and get nowhere? Is it worth trying?

You can see my response, and my train of thought on the process.

I can't for the life of me think of a reason why that specific situation can lead to structural failure unless it's due to the loss of attitude control. But can the change in load to a smaller loading condition itself causes failure of the structure? Quickly changing increasing the load definitely can cause issues, but not so sure the other way around.

The cylindrical member has a very large diameter compared to its length. Here's an [image](http://i.imgur.com/ryeN80k.png) of it. The considered loads for the deflection analysis include two point forces and its own weight.

Unlike standard beams, such as an I beam or a rectangular 2x4, there is an opportunity for this shape to locally deflect. Are there expressions for local deflection of cylinders (where a point force would alter the shape of the beam into an oval)? All equations I can find regarding cylinders and deflection are torsional.

If you're wondering why the linked shape is so thin, I am too. My model output this model as passing my deflection constraint in response to fairly high loads, which led to my skepticism.

I'm just trying to find out if I can get away with using a diesel v8 as a stressed component of the chassis comfortably when it will have such high cylinder pressures with torque valleys nearly reaching less than 10% of mean torque between each cylinder firing or will it be too harsh and I'd have to resort to the v12. 

Please answer this in depth as possible, thank you. 

V8 and V12 both use the same CC per cylinder (lets use 330cc) with a bore:stroke ratio of .85:1, both engines capped at 400 HP @ 500 less rpm than their respective rev limits

The v8 (2640cc) is 90 degree bank angle has properly counter weighted cross plane crankshaft to counter primary forces and moments.

It will use the GM LS/Ford Windsor firing order

(4500 max rpm) (couldn't edit out the title part)

V12 , (3960cc) 60 degree bank angle

standard firing order

(3500 max rpm)

From what I know, both engines are balanced in primary and secondary forces and moments, though the crankshaft of the V12's is longer and symmetrical. 
The v8 however has an asymmetrical crankshaft and has larger and heavier counterweights on both ends of the crankshaft which oppose directions, though the momentum being canceled out by each piston when at TDC or BDC on both banks on crank angle degrees 45,135, 225, and 315, would every other angle than these have the heavier opposing direction counterweights on each end rock the engine? What about the Unevenly timed combustion, intake, compression, exhaust on each individual bank of four cylinders, will that cause much vibration? The V12 will have more frequent combustion events and less pressure per cylinder than the V8,

17,Need some help determine the angle and break in a support for a folding workbench I am building.,1470269784,"Hello! Just found this sub and I hoping someone can help me out.

I am currently constructing a folding workbench in my garage out of 2x4s. I want the bench to be able to fold down when not in use. I am also trying to build folding supports that would hide within the table to keep the floor clear when in use. I am running into an issue as the supports are interfering with the closing action of the table. I believe this is due to my hinge needing to be offset to accommodate the supports when folded up. I was hoping someone might be able to point me to or help me with the math to determine the appropriate angle and break in the support to allow for full closure. 

I hope this is making sense, if not I can answer any questions to clarify. Here is an album or pics to hopefully add some context.

31,Designing a clamping mechanism for linear sliding stick,1470239009,"**the problem**

I'm prototyping for a musical instrument based on sliding sticks (see https://vimeo.com/170450482) but I'm struggling to make a robust, yet smooth clamping mechanism for the sticks. The challenge is to hold the (hard wood) sticks in such a way that they won't fall to the ground, yet are as easy and smooth as possible to move by hand. (And of course it needs to be cheap and easy to produce.) I have thought of and tried a number of solutions, but up until now none seem sufficient.

**insufficient solution one**

The solution used in [the first functional prototype][1] uses flat springs on each side of the board. While it keeps the stick in place, the springs are not easily adjustable, making the stick move not that smooth. Also they were  relatively difficult to manufacture consistently.
[1]:https://youtu.be/vHZtDkUsfNo?t=25s

image:  http://i.imgur.com/dTkim56.jpg


**insufficient solution two**

Trying to find a more adjustable solution, we make clamps with springs for
[the second functional prototype][2]. While this allowed for good adjustablilty, this solution had too much wiggle, still didn't *feel* smooth and was even more intensive to manufacture.
[2]:http://i.imgur.com/ikuPiNj.jpg

image: http://i.imgur.com/FjFjLM2.jpg

**insufficient solution three**

Seeing that things needed to get more smooth, we tried to use felt to slide the stick against. This worked yet it proved difficult to make the hole exactly the right size for the sticks plus felt. Above that there were concerns that the felt would get more and more compact over time, as such losing their clamping force.

image:  http://i.imgur.com/ZZgLw5R.jpg

**possible solutions 4?**

The ideal solution seems to be in the image below; to use felt, but being able to adjust it's position. Yet I have not been able to find an adjustable mechanism which stays in place and keeps consistent over time.

* The bearing won't ever be submerged but can come in contact honey so needs to be food-safe and can't create metal/plastic dust from friction (problem I have now). I've been using stainless for all metal components so far (honey will react with zinc plating over time).
* Just a hobby thing so low cost as possible. All the other parts add up to ~$80 so far.

The motor was part of a blower assembly with 5 operating/loading points controlling airflow. We started with a ribbon-type cage ball bearing at the non-driving end first. The following steps were taken by me:

1. Removing the grease from bearing using solvent.
2. breaking half the cage.
3. breaking the complete cage. allowing completely free movement of balls between the inner and outer rings(the balls used to align together)

My observations from the above experiments were that the noise and vibration increased drastically as expected. One observation i was not able to explain is that for the same loading my current is less than a healthy motor. 
Shouldn't the current go up as the frictional losses will be much higher. 
Rest of the parameters such as PF ,Voltage and loading are constant.

my idea is to create a government interstate system for water that would pump that liquid goodness from over saturated areas and send it to areas in drought.

id do this by first purchasing a network of pipelines. most likely they will be oil pipelines that would need to be flushed. it would be a tedious process done over years. problems like radiation will need a solution. once complete, you will have a segregated national pipeline network ready for use. we could connect it to already existing canals like the LA one and the Phoenix/Tuscon one. They both start at the Hoover Dam.  i know that oil pipelines are a huge complex network with varying pressures, companies, terrains etc., but i would think it would be possible to separate part of the network and convert / rebuild it for water.

then i would install giant vacuums in our major rivers. we are already doing this at Lake Mead for Las Vegas. Currently they are building a  [3rd lower straw] (http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9d27a8719b9e4c4c9588bf1469bb27c4/third-straw-uncapped-provide-lake-mead-water-vegas) now 

the vacuums would then suck water into the pipelines, most likely starting at places like the great lakes, Delaware river mouth, ohio, etc. These rivers pump out so much water its insane. . we don't even take 1% of the available water. its an absurdly low number,  in theory there is no reason we can't just tap into that water.

it would have so many benefits. it would pay for itself by allowing more farming and also no crop loss due to lack of water.  It would help areas that are flooded by alleviating some of the pressure.  it would allow rivers like the CO to return to its natural state b/c we won't need all its water for the SW.  The pumps can just source the damn river and boom we now can control droughts and lower/rise the flow to help the environment.

it would help bind the country together for our future. we would never be faced with a water-wars problem anytime soon. we would be building infrastructure to last a century or more. just think about a life with no water restraints anywhere in the continental united states

38,Question Regarding Jobs with Secret and Top Secret Clearances,1469809306,"First, I want to apologize for the obvious throwaway account. I didn't want to have this sort of post linked with me for reasons that will soon become obvious. 

The question I'm contemplating is whether I'm “too far gone” for a secret or top secret clearance one day. I'm an electrical engineering student at a school that has a very strong network of DoD contractors, especially in aerospace. I have a close family member who works on an aerospace project for NG, been with the company for years now. For quite a while, I've wanted to work in aerospace as an EE, with a dream of landing a job at one of the top contractors (NG, LM, SpaceX, BO, ULA, etc). I understand there are LOADS of jobs that do not require secret or TS clearances, even jobs with these companies. My question is specifically regarding those jobs that DO require clearances. 

Here's my problem. I was a daily Marijuana smoker for about four years. I've grown on a  small scale. I've been involved with people who grew on a very large scale. There was a summer where I sold (small scale, just a couple of oz to friends). I've also taken mushrooms and acid on multiple occasions and have been the “connect” (ie distributor) to friends for both drugs. Oh and I've taken mdma once.

I also have been involved with pirating/torrenting/p2p for years. Public and private trackers. I've uploaded original content as well (things I've personally taken the time to rip/fill requests). All of that activity is fairly well hidden, but friends are aware and I know I'd need to answer truthfully if ever asked/polygraphed. 

I quit smoking this summer as I have two years left in school. All the articles/research I've read regarding ts clearances state that if you were a “daily user” that you need to have been clear for AT LEAST 2 years.

Most of the personal accounts I've read about of engineers getting clearances though are along the lines of “I smoked a little in college” or “I smoked fairly regularly”. I definitely fall into the category of “heavy smoker” aka “stoner” (volume, not attitude, always maintained high grades, multiple jobs, etc). All of my friends and family smoke. While they support my decision to quit, many have made the comment they think I'm a lost cause when it comes to ever getting a clearance. 

I love smoking weed. I hate alcohol. It's my way of unwinding and relaxing. If I have to give it up to pursue the career of my dreams, I've got no issue with that and I'll do it willingly. I don't want to quit, stress myself out for the next two years, and come to the harsh reality that I wouldn't qualify for the clearances due to more than just my history of smoking. 

So my question is this: anyone out there think there's hope if I ever got to a job where I needed a secret/ts clearance? Any first hand accounts of coming through worse than me, and that I just need to maintain the straight and narrow nd I'll be alright? Or are those jobs, those clearances, just out of reach due to a list of life decisions rooted in questionable legality? 

Thank you for your time.

The [existing slab](http://imgur.com/a/83hJz) is in very poor/dangerous condition, the edge is beginning to deteriorate and has been a source of concern regarding safety. Fork lifts and trucks routinely travel over this only making the issue worse. My company is looking for a solution that will not require a replacement of the entire concrete pad, but will repair a portion of it.

My question is, where do I get started with this? Who would I need to contact to determine the extent of the damage to the current slab, and what are my options of repairing? I would assume once the extent of the damage is determined, I would need to recommend removal of a portion of the slab. We would then pour new concrete of certain material, and thickness (based on weather/soil/loading requirements). And separate the existing slab from the new with expansion joints.

And at what age / grade level could you have learned it or started learning it? Any ideas on how? Asking for an education podcast project I'm working on.,1469806190,"Hey there -- I'm looking for ideas to discuss with guests in a podcast that I'm working on, focused on K12 engineering education.  In case you didn't know (I didn't for a long time): schools from elementary to high school are teaching engineering more and more, beginning over the last decade or so.  In the US this is partly because of new education standards saying it should be taught, but also a lot of universities and industries support it.  But teachers don't always know exactly what ""should"" or could be taught at these levels, other than traditional math and science.  

Any thoughts from industry people on what things you think you should've started to learn at a younger age?  e.g. For me, I wish I practiced basics in design for manufacturing before college, because that skill/art seems like it totally could've started in high school at least, and would've helped me all through college and work in multiple fields.  I could imagine doing a high school project designing stuff using basic materials and tools, and having other people build the designs.

If this is the wrong place to post this I'll remove it.
If anyone has experience using a Nanoscope iii multimode AFM I'd love to pick your brains. I'm having an issue regarding the tuning of the cantilever. It says the drive amplitude is exceeding safe limits and to change the cantilever. I've done this, and the problem hasn't gone away. Bruker say this could be caused by a broken probe extender or NS3A problems. The former means it's completely dead, and the latter means shipping it to Germany for repair (which is extremely expensive). If anyone has any ideas on how this could be fixed or have had a similar experience in the past I'd love to hear from you.

(DIY project, suggestions appreciated)",1469784183,"I'm not very well educated but I'm building a DIY automated greenhouse and I figured I'd come ask the smart guys for help. The idea is that at 6PM, a motor attached to a swing arm will pull a black tarp over the hoop house. At 6AM, the swing arm will move in the opposite direction, ""opening"" the greenhouse and allowing sunlight to penetrate. The swing arm moves 180 degrees back and forth so I figured something like a garage door opener and gear system would be perfect. For the swing arm I used a caster wheel with a 10' arm that weighs about 10lbs welded to it. Then I welded a large sprocket to it that would be attached to the small sprocket on the garage door opener by chain. This has helped out the gearing a lot but theres still room for improvement. It powers through it easily but it still moves too fast. I'm sure if I tinker with it tomorrow I will figure out better gearing ratio so my main concern is whether or not I'll be able to set this thing on a timer that will not only close at a certain time, but open as well.

51,(Soon to be) Aeronautical Engineer: Need advice on career direction,1469755613,"Long post, sorry. Here's a TL;DR: Big vs small company. Big company offers career advancement and a chance at ""maybe"" getting amazing job after slogging through 3-5 years of an un-ideal position. Smaller company offers happiness and great career alignment, though it may result in me straying away from ""true"" structural/aero/manufacturing.


I'm currently finishing my final internship at a large aerospace company before I head off to finish my final year of university. I'll start my post by saying, I'm very fortunate to have the issue I'm having. However, it's been a large source of stress for me, as I have a very tough choice to make about my future career. To make this long post easy on the eyes, I'll explain the pros and cons of each option, and then my thoughts comparing the two.


**Company 1:**


Prior to starting at this big company, I worked at a small, albeit quite well known design company in the aerospace industry. Enjoying art and creative ""things"" outside of engineering, this was a really cool fit for me doing design prototyping and interfacing with industrial designers to make concepts real. I spent two summers with the company, and they have seemed very excited and open about the possibility of bringing me back full time. The pay is competitive, and personality wise, I fit in better with small companies. I know I would be (very) happy there.


Pros: 

* Proven to have talent and genuine interest in the work

* Heavy design focus

* Like the people, benefits and facilities

* Behind the scenes, but makes huge impact on aerospace, feels like work ""matters""

* Customer-facing though not so much as the second option

Cons:

* Small company, lack of possibilities for lateral moves, other career directions
* Rather specific role in industry, could see myself shoehorned into a corner career-wise


**Company 2:**


On the other hand, I have spent this summer in production engineering, just to get a taste of the industry from another light. Quite frankly, I was not enjoying it, and planned not to return post-graduation. However, I recently had the opportunity to shadow flight-line production engineers, where they prepare aircraft for test and then delivery. Being very interested in customer-facing jobs and fleet-side engineering/operations, it was an awesome experience. I love learning about aircraft routes, fleet operations and testing, and to literally be able to meet returning aircraft at the gate and address engineering problems on the spot was *amazing*. However, I was told it is rarely a first job for college-graduates. The advice I was given was to initially gain experience in factory-side production (maybe 3-5 years?) and then I might see the opportunity to come to the group arise. This is likely my only chance to get my foot in this door, as the only other place to really do this kind of work is in Toulouse.


Pros:
* Very unique line of work, genuine interest in flight ops/test
* Close to planes every day
* Opportunity for immense career growth, company name recognition
* Chance to work on new aircraft programs
* Customer-facing, cool opportunities for travel, networking

Cons

* More rigid company, not as enjoyable culture
* More stress, and mandatory overtime
* Must work a few years in an un-ideal job just to ""maybe"" get position I want
* Focus on paper-pushing rather than real engineering
* No design aspect (i.e. no CAD used at all)



When it comes down to it, I really don't know what to do. I have the chance to really boost my aerospace career by staying at the big company. I've been told that by staying there I essentially ""pay my dues"" and can find myself able to realistically go anywhere from there (including the smaller company). However, I know I will be the happiest at the smaller company in the long run. Pay and location are basically the same in both cases.


Thoughts, life advice, words of encouragement? I realize that it's very obvious which companies I'm talking about. So, if you have specific advice/notes about the companies in question, please PM me. I appreciate all the advice I can get.

56,[Civil Engineering] Been pouring over this beam for days; confused about methodology,1469741033,"Hi all,

I've been working on this problem for the past 2 weeks and it seems like every time I attempt to come to a solution, I find I'm not doing the correct methodology. I've tried to follow examples in two textbooks (Design of structural elements by Chanakya Arya &amp; another book I forgot the name of at the moment) but I get more confused especially when I attempt to cross reference to EC2 or BS8110. 

Here is the example I'm struggling with:

http://i.imgur.com/WvS9ZLq.jpg

2,000x2,000mm beam. Doubly reinforced in both compression and tensile zones. 9 bars in two rows in each zone; All bars are 40mm dia and each row is separated at a distance of 40mm from each other. 

Overall the beam is 7m long and the load, w= 359.1kN/m 

It is C32/40 concrete and the bars are grade 435N/mm2

I need to find out the maximum bending moment applied by the load and the moment capacity (i.e. the maximum moment the beam can withstand before failing).

I have attempted this a number of ways, but I don't think either way is correct. I want to know how others would do this as I am at a loss with the pages of working I have done! Please please show working as I've come across so many examples which seem to skip a few steps or look incomplete because they have not got any working!

57,Killing Ants with Compressed Gas,1469735370,"Greetings folks,

I recently went on a hike to a local nature area, it sits on lake Ontario between a marsh and a bay. It is infested with the invasive European Fire Ant. I'd like to take a stab and throw some ideas at the local conservancy organisations to see if we can't deal with this situation. 

Lets ignore pesticides for the time being.

I read a paper on using liquid nitrogen to kill the Red Imported Fire Ant, by some Taiwanese grad students/professors. It seems to work very well. Their initial testing shows that at -12.5C there is a 10% to 20% survival rate, but at -15C it drops to near 0%. So using LN works great, obviously.

But using LN like that doesn't seem feasible on such a huge area. So I was thinking, you can get 4500psi HPA tanks for paintball. If I was able to attach a regulator to it, to drop it down to say 50psi, and then with a long stainless steel nozzle, jam that into the ground and blast. Do you think it would freeze them? 

How would I go about calculating the temperature drop? Or would the temperature drop only happen in the regulator?

I'm wondering if I would just end up blasting ants all over the place. So any help would be appreciated. Even telling me the names of formulas to look for would be appreciated.",AskEngineers,adaminc,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4v2m8r/killing_ants_with_compressed_gas/
58,Can i do anything with a MET degree?,1469727869,"So basically i was ill advised and didn't do my homework in college,  and I went for a BSMET instead of going to a larger school and getting a BSME.

My current job,  the company is closing down in a few months.  Not a big deal i was planning on looking soon anyway.  I'm just getting a bit discouraged looking up jobs. Most listings mention only bsme and want a lot of experience i don't have,  either in fields i can't get into without the experience beforehand it seems,  or just with programs with which I only have a cursory knowledge.

So i push around the idea of getting a master's degree,  but I'm told by people often that it's a waste of time and money unless a job specifically wants it/will put me there,  or i want to do research. Also looking up schools several will flat out say that technology degrees don't meet their requirements.

Since launch is one of the most important aspects, I want to design a plane that has a very low stall speed, from that I can get a Cl value for the airfoil and work from there. Does this approach make sense? are there other parameters or things I should consider?

Making a plane that is compact and can lift a lot involves maximising these parameters:

My dad works at Trinity Western University, so I get tuition for free, but they only have 2 years of pre-engineering. Will this be helpful?

Also, I have a good work ethic, but I also do need a social life. Will studying for computer engineering take any chance of social life away from me? Or is the workload not as bad as other Engineering programs, that I hear have insane work load. 

As well, is a bachelors degree in computer Engineering all I need to find a job as a Computer Hardware Engineer? Or do I need a masters? Because more than four years would be very expensive And too much time for me I think.

84,The more I research and read about the Clathrate hypothesis the more convinced I become. I'm having some sort of existential reform. How do I deal with this?,1469607421,"Sorry for the rant but I'm experiencing some sort of existential confusion. (Might be a flawed description)

I'm a young student in the field of chemical engineering with my entire life ahead of me. For me it's important to recognise my bias and lack of perspective due to my small set of life experience and understanding. 

Considering the above there are still hard facts. Experienced climate scientists are depressed and methane release loops are basically proven to continue even if human CO2 emissions stoped today.

This feel like a paradigme shift. I was grown up with the mind set ""save the planet!"" ""Green energy!"" ""Prevent global warming"" Etc. I just recently discovered these more depressing theories and now it feels like my generation will be the one who builds the machines that saves human society - not the planet.

Usually there are two sides but I can only see the one. Scientists agree, data points to darker conclusions than previously estimated, deniers are criticised to be sugarcoating the data and lacks support.

I'm not saying humanity is doomed or anything, but there's no positive side to all of all this it seems. 

How should I relate to all this? What's your mindset?

I started working in a research lab about 6 months ago and right from the beginning I've had a heap of trouble nailing my supervisor down on exactly what is expected of me. Ive been working on getting a clear channel of communication on what has priority and the difference between shooting ideas around, and actual actionable tasks.

A little background on my supervisor. Hes a PHD student, really intelligent guy, lovely guy to hang out with, I enjoy his company greatly and we have a good rapport when work is not involved. But the guy is just far to busy to lead our team properly. Not only is he writing his PHD and doing research, but hes made a startup with his friend which is going well. That leaves very little time to lead a team of people in doing what we do at the university.

About a month back we were throwing some ideas around for a device we're working on, all hypotheticals, what might work, whats a good direction to take this thing, will this decrease error or increase the speed at which measurements can be taken, that sort of thing and we left the conversation with a ""lets keep it in mind and have a think about it"". Then I got an email earlier this week asking me if I'd implemented a number of these things we'd spoken about, with the expectation that they had been. Which of course, I hadn't, as it was never brought up as an actionable.

He'll also do things like put me on an ""urgent task"" making me pivot from what I'm currently working on, then ask why progress on the first has slowed down.

These couple of behaviors are ***incredibly*** frustrating, they make me look far more incompetent than I actually am. I'd love some input on how to get more defined leadership from this person or tools/documentation for this work flow.

In connection to this question that I asked previously:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3srbr3/to_phd_or_not_for_experienced_engineers_rev_1/

I have decided to do the PhD and I have just resigned from my current company in preparation for the transition and to go with the startup.  

As a courtesy to people who have helped me, I've scheduled various short meetings to tell them what's happening in person (rather than them finding out via an email) and to say thank you etc.  

As luck would have it, I scheduled a coffee with someone very high up (within two levels from CEO) and this person agreed.  We had a good chat and he knew me from a fairly big project delivery work I'm handling for the company.  I received stellar feedback from the client (a key client) and hence the news travelled to him.  

Instead of the PhD, he asked if I wanted to step into a project delivery role, and he offered to either set something up for me in my current company, or recommend me into one of his clients' company.  He made it clear he's not doing this for the company, but for me as an individual.

Of course I'm very flattered and expressed my gratitude.  At the moment I'm still leaning to do the PhD mainly because I can't see the more concrete alternative.  

Fellow experienced engineers, do you have any advice for this?

I'm a junior engineer myself as well as a car enthusiast so I am totally ashamed to not know this haha.

I understand the basic principles of the Otto cycle 4 stroke combustion engine. However, from what I've read on my own, it seems like the vacuum created by the piston is what draw air/fuel from the intake - and the combustion of the air/fuel is what applies force to the piston and torque to the crankshaft.

I feel like these are contradictory as the Intake step implies that the piston/crankshaft is driving the cycle (by pulling air/fuel) and the ignition step implies that the air/fuel combustion is driving the piston/crankshaft. So what drives what?

I understand that there is a flywheel involved that maintains the inertia energy to keep the crankshaft rotating, but at the very start of the first cycle, what drives the piston down the cylinder shaft to create that intake vacuum?

* Instead of denying my petition with manners I got an angry call from my director saying that it's unbelievable that I want to take so many holidays, also that the client's perception is that in the last months I haven't done much work (I have proof otherwise with my real client who is very happy with me)

* My colleagues all took days off during the year I took ZERO. 

* My colleagues also worked remotely for several weeks, even months, noone bats an eye... when I ask for 2 weeks it's way too much.

26,Call for Systems Engineers: talk about your work! (Q2 2016),1469470682,"This is the final thread of the AskEngineers series where people working in the industry can share their professional work experience, and is for all the Systems Engineers out there! Unfortunately ""Systems Engineer"" is one of those titles that's used across many industries and can mean a lot of different things, so to define it a little better I'm going to use the discussion from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2ctsqa/i_dont_think_business_insider_has_a_clue_what_a/) to refine what I mean.

&gt;The people you call ""systems engineers"" haven't gone to school to become systems engineers. They've gone to school for something like Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering, and then have spent years (possibly decades) working as one, gaining very valuable experience, building up engineering intuition. And at one point in their careers, their grasp of overall engineering design within their own product category has gotten complete enough that they have been put in charge of ""big picture decision-making"". At that point, they take on a job title of ""systems engineer"" but ultimately they're still aerospace or mechanical engineers by training. What NASA calls a ""systems engineer"" is often referred to as ""chief engineer"" at Boeing, and probably has half a dozen different names depending on the company you put under the microscope.

If you feel that you roughly fit the above description, then you're probably the kind of systems engineer we're looking for, and we'd love to hear about your professional experience.

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**

### Timeframe

This post will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted and stickied, and old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Once all the disciplines have been covered, a final thread will be posted with links to all of them to collect any more responses until archived. The current list of disciplines:

34,How to properly bind o-rings to aluminum?,1469455243,"Hi all,

First time posting on this subreddit. Hopefully I am in the right place, and if not, if you know where you could direct me I would appreciate it. 

I'm embarking on a small project to improve a critical piece to the work that the company I'm interning for does. It's a flapper valve that is made from a urethane mix, however there are often small imperfections that cause it to fail (it is meant to work as a seal underwater and subject to constant vibration). 

The way the valve works is simple, it must properly seal and be sturdy enough to undergo the vibration I previously mentioned. My idea was to, instead of using a urethane mix to create the seal, use o-rings as the material that seals. This would result in more consistency and less wasted material/time in the urethane mixing process. Although the o-rings may better bind to materials other than aluminum, aluminum is a sturdy material that will withstand vibrations over and over. 

I have attached some pictures of what I had in mind to create, but I don't know what process would be best for binding the plastic o-rings to the aluminum plate.

Instead of depressurising the whole system, would it be possible to create a ""rolling vacuum"" ahead of the train? Perhaps if you could create a low pressure region just in front of the train, you could use the air from behind to propel the carriage. I'm guessing you'd have to remove the air in front of the train at a rate close to the speed of sound to prevent the air further down the line from rushing in and ruining the temporary vacuum.

43,A question about cyclic graphs and modular synthesizers,1469415471,"Hey everyone, I'm trying to understand the difference between the way feedback loops (or more abstractly, cyclic graphs) work in the analog and digital world. 

This question comes up because I'm trying to emulate an analog modular synthesizer on the computer. An important part of using such a device is the ability to connect any component with any other component and have them modulate each other. 

Finally, within a huge network may have one or two outputs that actually produce sound. 

If I'm thinking about it in the digital world, each module can be thought of as a mathematical function that produces new numbers (audio samples) at regular instances of time. For the modules that are being modulated by other modules, it is a mathematical function with an input argument. 

I know that cyclic graphs have a problem of finding causality and hence it would be hard to evaluate a graph if it contains feedback loops. But I've made very very complex cyclic patches on modular synthesizers and they produce sound no problem.

I moved to a city a couple states away for a six month long internship. When that ended, the company didn't have any openings, so I've been job hunting since, for the last four-ish months. During that time, my savings have gotten low and recently decided I needed to get some sort of basic job just to pay the bills.  

With that in mind, while still applying to entry-level engineering jobs, I also started applying to slightly skilled labor positions. On the engineering side, earlier this week I had a phone screen for a Jr. engineering position that went well, and they said that they would let me know next week if I would be selected for an in-person interview. However, I'm not the most qualified for the position (they wanted 1-3 years of experience in that specific field, I have .5 years of experience in a similar but different field). A few days after that, I had an in-person interview for a technician position that paid slightly above minimum wage, but promised raises soon after starting. However, during the interview the interviewer mentioned my engineering degree on my resume, and said that while he couldn't give me an engineering position now, if I worked hard and did well on the production floor, really learned the product inside and out, I could move into an engineering position. And he assured me that the company was growing quickly, they recognize hard work, and that all departments would be increasing in size. And then at the end of the interview, he offered me the technician position. I thanked him, and let him know that I was waiting to hear back from another company, and asked if I could have a week to decide and get back to him. He agreed, and thanked me for coming. 

So here's my question: How should I handle this situation? As a recent graduate with not much experience, low on money and options, I really have to make a decision here. Obviously, the manufacturing position could chose to move forward with other candidates, which would make my choice easy. But if they do want to do an in person interview, what should I do? (Keeping in mind that according to Glassdoor the interview process with this company takes about 6 weeks, and I'm still in week 1). Do I; 

1) Tell the technician position that I'm moving forward with the manufacturing position, which will probably lose me the technician position? This path seems risky because obviously if the interview doesn't go well I would end up where I started, with nothing.

2) Just go with the technician position anyways and hope for the best? The pay isn't great, and while I was promised the possibility of promotion, that's a promise at best and I can't rely on that.

So please give me what advice you can, I'm really not enjoying being in this position. I think either way I go could lead to a great career, or to things just going poorly. In hindsight I wish I had pushed the technician interview back a week to buy myself some time with the other company, but of course I didn't know that there would be the engineering possibility or that I would be offered a job in the interview. And I don't mind hard work, I've had labor jobs before and honestly I enjoy it, but at the same time I would prefer to be making 2.5 times the money and growing my engineering career.",AskEngineers,blueskiddoo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4u9q3k/how_do_i_choose_between_an_assured_technician/

I'm looking to produce 6 different shapes in a white foam material. I need ~3000 of each shape. Shapes are body parts, 1-2 inches maximum dimension, low detail, no/low undercuts. Let's say generally packing peanut sized. Tolerances can be low. All shapes could be produced in a 2 part mold. Ideally surface finish could be similar to molded styrofoam packaging. Typically I would make this kind of product with a fast polyurethane resin and a lot of molds, but the client really insists on the surface finish and weight of foam. 

Previously these items were produced with a 2-part polyurethane foam, but the color, cell structure, and longevity are not to the clients' liking (polyurethane yellows too quickly). So far it looks like EPS injection molding would be the best solution. I looked a bit at Protomold and they don't seem to have any foam capabilities. Other posts on here lead me to believe that they only good for low volume anyway. 

Can anyone point me in a good direction or let me know whether I'm looking at a 20K, 50K, or 100K+ project? I figure going overseas from the USA is probably the only option.

I see a lot of positives to doing this. It would generate a ton of clean electricity, it would increase land area for Europe and Africa, it would protect coastal cities from rising sea levels, and it would create a bridge between Europe and Africa which you could use to truck goods back and forth.

For the downsides, I see that salty water flows out of the Mediterranean. Because the dam would stop that happening, would the Mediterranean become hypersaline and possible kill all life in it? For ships that cross the straight, I read some comments about they would have to use a complex system of locks to cross the straight and that it would be very time consuming.

  Recently I have been deciding if engineering is right for me. I'm going into my 3rd year of college and I'm studying naval architecture and marine engineering. My program is 5 years but sense I received a D in calc 1 in the fall I was pushed back to 6 years. I have been receiving bad grades. Grades I do not want. Idk if this is because I'm a horrible test taker or what not. Early on has a child I was diagnosed with executive function. Which makes school hard to come by for me. I am super into naval architecture and marine engineering(NAME) this has been a dream of mine ever sense my mother would dress me into nautical outfits. I breath, sleep, dream boats.

Ok, so there is flow separation caused by a shock wave forming, hence the drag. But **why** does the flow separation improve after the shock wave is formed?

I am currently working on a robotics project and have a problem that I can't seem to solve. Essentially, I have a component that must be kept in water (for either passive or active cooling, not sure yet, but I am certain about the water being necessary). This component is essentially a coiled up, conductive thread. This component needs to be kept in water, but I need to connect it to two parts outside: one is a copper wire (to transmit electricity), and the other a fishing line/string of sorts. I'm trying to find a way to lock the water into a tiny tube (so it doesn't contact any other parts of my robot), and leave two small holes to connect these components. Essentially, my question is:

Would it be possible to make small enough holes at the end of the tube so that I can fit in the fishing line/wire to clog the water so none leaks out? Is there a superior method?

61,Early Career Compensation Advice for an Electrical Engineer?,1468909278,"Hi guys,

So after I graduated, I took at job at $65k, where the average starting pay for an Electrical Engineer in my area is $67k (now $68k a year later). I am in an area with a lot of growth and thus Cost of Living is going up very fast. I took the job slightly below average because the work life balance is decent. However, I was told that I would not be receiving a raise my first year because I am new (otherwise my performance review was good), and that following years I can expect a raise of 1-3%, where 3% is if I'm absolutely stellar. This seems really low to me, as a 3.5% increase is what I would have needed this year just to keep up with inflation/ Cost of living. 1-3% raises would be unsustainable to my career, as I'd essentially be making less and less each year. My manager said I can speak with her boss about this.

What can be done about this? Is it typical once you move into a company to have such small raises? I have always been told that below 3% is abnormally low, 3% is the standard COL adjustment, and 3-5% is a normal raise, and 5%+ is usually related to a promotion. My boss said she doesn't know why I have such a different perception that what she's used to being a manager for 20+ years.

Is this how it is at every company? I like the company otherwise. Do I just need to get my raises by switching companies? Or are there companies out there that'll give you 3%+ raises consistently, and keep your salary at or above market value? What's the optimal way of increasing your compensation while also looking good to companies (ie not switching jobs every year)?

72,HVAC question: Why bother with pressure independent valves?,1468884284,"Hey folks, I'm having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around PICVs/PICCVs on AHUs. The issue I'm having is this: why the hell do they matter?

For this system, let's assume we have a Variable Volume chilled water loop feeding multiple variable speed AHUs feeding a bunch of VAVs. CHWPs are controlled on DP across the loop. Fan speed is controlled on static duct pressure. Supply air temp is constant, and VAV position is controlled on space temp.

The way I see it is this: The purpose of a pressure independent control valve is to set the exact flow rate regardless of fluctuations in delta-P, which at first sounds great, because then your AHU that's supposed to get 57 GPM will get 57 GPM whether all the other AHUs are on or not, and no matter what your pumps are doing (provided they're putting out above the minimum differential pressure). However, that AHU doesn't always need 57 GPM, and no matter what valve you put on it, it should only be running at 57 GPM when it needs maximum cooling to hit the supply temp setpoint. So, whatever valve you have, you need a PID loop (or at least PI) to modulate your valve to hit your desired supply air temp, correct? So, the beauty of a PID loop is you give it a target, set it's bounds, and turn it loose, and it will hit that target by modulating the parameter it's able to change. So, as far as I can tell, the only thing the PICCV can change is whether that PID is controlling flow directly, or simply controlling valve position, which in turn controls flow. Either way, for a given entering condition and chilled water temperature, a specific coil will require a specific CHW flow to hit the target leaving air conditions. The system will have to respond to changes in water pressure, entering conditions, or chilled water temperature no matter the valve, and the valve isn't going to change the heat transfer characteristics of the coil. So, I can actually take the exact same control loop, and apply it to a PICCV or a standard 2-way control valve and while the PID might need to be retuned, it should work with both valves to provide identical flows, hitting my supply air temp setpoint, right?

There must be something I'm missing, because the more I think about these PICCVs, the less they seem to matter when you already have to have a PID to control the valve anyway. They might make TAB a little easier, but is that it? What's the magic sauce?",AskEngineers,Fearlessleader85,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4ti112/hvac_question_why_bother_with_pressure/
73,Can you answer some electronics questions my professor won't answer?,1468882068,"/r/AskEngineers,

Electrical Engineering student going into his third year here. My Digital Systems professor over the summer has this odd thing where he refuses to answer my questions regarding electronics beyond the course material. He simply says I'll learn it in X course or just not this course. I just vastly prefer learning via discussion so I'm a little annoyed, but I understand he doesn't want to confuse me. Other faculty I've met are bored talking to me due to my relatively small sphere of knowledge. 

1. What are some common methods for preventing signal degradation in flip-flops? I've just been introduced to the logic gate layout. When S and R or J and K or what-have-you are zero, how do we keep the ""stored"" value of Q from being lost due to voltage drop over gates?

2. I don't quite understand how signals begin and end. I mean I get that it's the flow of current, but I don't see how feedback is possible. Consider an unstable feedback loop with a buffer (Like a ring oscillator, I believe). It doesn't make sense to me that current would flow, and stop, and flow, and stop. Clearly I don't have a solid understanding of what a signal *is*.

3. How do we dope materials to make transistors on such a small scale? 

4. How do you design a flip-flop to take input on both the rising and falling clock? Is this an expansion on the concept of ""holding"" the value in an intermediate latch and then passing it upon a change in clock?

5. Now my understanding of electricity from physics tells me we can't instantly go from 0 V to 5 V without some sort of delay, rather than a rectangle a square wave is surely more like a series of plateau-ing exponential growths, right? How do we prevent issues from these ""intermediary"" levels? Or do they not cause issues at all?

I know a lot of these questions come from me being introduced to the logic approach before any material on hardware, I apologize for the lengthy post.

I'm a recent BS BME grad and my career goal is to be a Design or Product Development Engineer. I'm not desperate for work at the moment (just eager), and I think I could get the goal job if I apply for a bit longer with my background. But I know that getting experience in positions that straddle these roles, particularly manufacturing, is very beneficial and that's why I'm considering this one:

I've recently been offered a 6-month contract position as a CAD Designer. The tasks sound interesting and challenging, would have me working with Manufacturing and Process Engineers, would teach me the regulations of my preferred industry, and I would learn GD&amp;T intensively. These skills seem useful for a future Design Engineer, and I'd develop connections in a large company which I would like to do Engineering work for.

There's one thing that has me worried about taking the job, however, and I hope you can alleviate or confirm it: The job wouldn't involve any true Engineering work -- no analysis, no testing, no design configuration selection, etc. I would hate for future hiring managers to see my resume and think, 'No Engineering work in the past 6 months' and auto-delete my application.

81,What is the best material to drive sound?,1468860388,"Hey Engineers

I'm working on a project and I have a small speaker  (http://www.tdt.com/electrostatic-speakers.html) that, for practical reasons, cannot be near the mouse I want to give the sounds to. So, I'm using PVC tubes to drive the sound near it. It's not working so great so any suggestions would be appreciated. The length of the tube is about 1m and the (intial) inner diameter of the tube is about 0,9 cm -  I need to taper it down to maybe 1-2mm for it to enter the mouse's ear.

83,What should I do with all of this paint?,1468847968,"Hello! I am going to be vague out of respect for my employer and to maintain some anonymity, but hopefully someone can help.

I am an engineer at a midsize factory in the Midwest, and part of our production process involves lacquer paint. Its composition includes nitrocellulose, and a number of solvents including acetone, toluene, xylene, and hexane. Since we cannot unmix paint (yet!), waste paint is sent out for incineration at cement kilns.

While burning the waste product is an approved disposal method (EPA code H040), I am interested in more environmentally-friendly alternatives, with the stipulation that it is taken care of off-site.

**Recycling**: I have talked to a few distillation companies about sending the waste to them for solvent recovery, and while they are interested in the high-dollar solvents included, the nitrocellulose has been a sticking point due to the flammability concerns. The thickness of the liquid and pigment content have also been brought up, but I believe it can be thinned out with a few small changes. 

**Reuse**: One of the EPA's recent pushes has been for ""continued use"" of materials, meaning that no treatment occurs, and that the waste product is used as-is for an alternate process. The waste composition varies, so any application would have to be indifferent to the color.

With this information, do you have any suggestions on how to better handle this waste? Any help is appreciated!

97,PLEASE HELP: Simple Car Pulley Project,1468732242,"Hello!


I am currently working on a project that should be simple enough, but I have absolutely NO idea what I’m doing and any assistance provided would be greatly appreciated, as I’m in dire need.

I’m small girl (4’11”, maybe  80 LBS. tops), who’s an incomplete quadriplegic. I have quite a lot of arm strength, but some limitations with trunk and dexterity. Most of all though, I’m built like a Dachshund (short limbs), so leverage is the main issue.

I’ve recently acquired a 2016 Honda Accord coupe, and the endeavor is to create a simple pulley system to get my lightweight carbon fiber (approx. 12 LBS.) folding, manual chair in/out through the front seat, passenger side more time/energy efficiently.

I spent extra on the vehicle’s “bonus conveniences” so that I wouldn’t have to pay more in modifications, because this CAN’T be that difficult or costly of an objective. At most, I’m thinking it couldn’t be more of a $200 max. budget in hardware. Perhaps the main obstacle is that I’d like to avoid permanent installments (drilling into the car’s body and the like), if possible.

I think I’m onto something, I just need designing refinement. I’m a visual person, so any draft-type illustrations would help. Additionally, maybe a product list? As it stands, I've rope, carabiners, and bungees galore. Oh, and a bicycle pulley-hoist I figured could be at the very LEAST good for parts.

Again, please – I’m in dire need! Is this plan not practically feasible? Any questions you might have to give you a better idea, I’m more than happy to comply. I’ve included a photo in the below link of what I have so far, for reference (I know it’s an abomination, bear with me).

Note this is different than static stress/strain.  E.g. Something pushing a box so that it's not moving on both sides with force P (on both sides) gives stress P/A.  Pushing a box on one side with force P and having it accelerate at P/m results in a linearly varying stress, P/A - P/A*x/L, where L is length of the box, A is surface area, and x is coordinate along the box.
