1,Software engineers,1518125985,"Hi! I’m a second semester ChemE student who is heavily considering switching to Software Engineering/CompSci with a software focus.
1. How often do you use math? I really enjoy math and the prospect of using it more has made me consider switching 
2. How exact is software? In other words, in ChemE processes your calculations are only a very good estimate as you have to take into account many outside factors. I.e. energy is never 100% conserved.
3. How much applied logic do you use on the job? Another major thing for me is logical analysis. I’m a very passionate debater. I love breaking things down to a very logical standpoint I.e. “you think x because y occurs in your brain which triggers z” 
4. Is your work challenging? I love being mentally challenged and having to think my way through something that isn’t always clear, this is what made me fall in love with Engineering in general.
5. Does coding remain fun even when you aren’t interested in what you’re coding?

I have two degrees in AE and I very much enjoy technical challenges and finding solutions and i consider myself a good leader but as a manager I'm still very green.

I'm frustrated. I'm working 60 hour weeks. My social/home life is being devoured. I don't feel like I'm developing technically or professionally and I'm pretty bored with the work. I've raised issue with my boss (my dad) but then tend to get downplayed.


I've seen some really interesting jobs for a company doing space engines which sounds amazing. The pay is similar and the benefits better.

14,Advice for potentially going into engineering managerial roles after university.,1518102717,"To preface, I'm studying mechanical engineering and I've just been offered student placement position as a programme manager at a well known motorsport company. Of course for many, including myself taking this offer from such a company is a no brainer. 

However at the end of the process the COO sat down with me and made the point that going into the management side of things is a role which isn't as technical as some engineering students may hope. He told me to go away and think about if going down this path is something I can give 100% to and is something I can give the best of myself to. 

I was wondering if anyone could offer advice in terms of an engineer heading down this path at an early stage. 

What is the difficulty of changeing paths back towards a technical side potentially?

Would an engineer who goes straight into managerial positions be stumped by a lack of technical experience?

Don't get me wrong, the role offered is something I will enjoy and believe I can excel in, just any anecdotes or advice concerning a path like this would be much appreciated.

23,Advice on Possible Engineering Career Path,1518064119,"Background:

I graduated with a BA in Electrical Engineering about 8 months ago. During that time, I was searching for a job in electrical engineering. Almost a year :(

However, about a month ago, I managed to get a decent job working as a contractor in field services local to my area. 

As a tech, I test high voltage systems, mostly substations, using a variety of instruments provided by the company. Most of the jobs are contracted out to the chemical plants. Additionally, the company provides a phone, laptop, and a personal vehicle fitted with tools.

However, there is an opportunity to work as an electrical engineer, but it will take about a year. It does not require an EIT certification for an entry-level position, but it will help in the long run.

After about a month, the Boeing Company offered me an entry-level position to work as an electronics engineer.

My ideal career path is to work in the aerospace industry and my end goal is to work for NASA. I want to be part of the space race :)

My concerns at the moment are job security, income, and (Rent, bills, and student loans)

Job Security: 

I will be guaranteed 40 hours working as a field service tech with the perks of a company vehicle, phone, tools, and laptop. Also, I get overtime, paid vacation, benefits. etc. The contract company has a steady stream of job availabilities and there have not been any massive layoffs since the contract company was founded. 

Boeing will grant me a yearly salary with benefits and opportunities for continued education. However, Boeing has been laying off engineers by the hundreds the past few years.

Income: 

The yearly salary for my current position as tech rivals the offer Boeing has given me. Give or take a few thousand.

(Rent, bills, and student loans):

As for my situation, the total cost of my student loans slightly exceeds the national average and I live with my parents effectively rent free, but I want to help out. 

The contract company is local to my area so I work close to home. Boeing wants to relocate me out of state and so I will have to rent an apartment out in an area where I will know no one.

If I were to stay at home then I will effectively have no bills to pay. That will grant me the opportunity to pay off my loans asap. 

If I were to go then I will pave the right path to a career in aviation, but I will be in debt for a long time.

Questions:

37,Looking for a cheap alternative to expanding shafts,1518034651,"Hello r/AskEngineers

I have a very unique problem that I could use some help locating a part for. 

I currently have a 16 ft long roll of tarp,
like this picture only much longer and a metal inner pipe not cardboard, ( https://imgur.com/a/ZgI6d) that I need to lift using two winches.  

Once it’s lifted I need the pipe to be able to spin freely so that the plastic can come off.  

I have come up with this design below. 
(https://imgur.com/a/q2W97)

When the roll of plastic is on the ground, I insert two plugs on each side that are slipfit into the inner pipe. They are able to rotate because the plugs are similar to conveyor rollers( https://imgur.com/a/w4rRb) , and can spin on flanged bearings. The roller plugs are attached to the winch cables that pull the plastic roll vertically. When the roll is lifted off the ground, it is supported my the plugs, and is able to spin as I had imagined. Once the all the plastic is used up, the roll is then dropped down, the plugs are removed, and placed into a new plastic roll to repeat the process. The great news, is that this solution works. 

The problem is the fit between the roller plug, and the pipe the plastic lays on. Small discrepancies in the pipe prevent the two from establishing a close/secure fit consistently . After researching online, I found a lot of plastic manufacturers use pneumatic expanding shafts to make sure the pipe and the spinning shaft have a tight fit. While this would be a perfect solution, it is out of my price range, and seems a little complex. 

Can anyone recommend a simpler way or mechanism to lock my plug/shaft to the pipe? A shaft clamp that could mechanically expand using springs would be ideal, but I’m not sure if that exists. 

Let me know what you guys think, or what other ideas I should try to pursue. Thanks for the help in advance.

49,How can we design quieter supersonic aircrafts?,1518012919,"From what I understand, the sonic boom is the result of sound waves being compressed  by the aircraft; there's nothing much we can do about it and that's why aircrafts like the Concorde couldn't fly above the speed of sound over land.

 However, I just read an article saying: ""the idea is to reflect and muffle the worst-offending waves. He would do this not by blending the engines into the fuselage, but rather by placing them well forward of the leading edge of the wing. That could be done either by mounting them on pylons extending from below the wing, or by attaching them to the fuselage. Both configurations would cause the engines’ exhaust plumes to reflect any shock wave forming in front of a wing upwards—ie, away from the ground.""

60,Dampening floor sounds from a timber floor.,1517978336,"Background: We own a block of flats In Brisbane Australia. The building was originally a timber house built in 1932 with verandahs on three sides, what is known as a Queenslander. In 1964 the owners raised it, cut off the front and extended it, and built in underneath with double brick, to turn it into flats. They had an architect to supervise this work and it looks like they must have spent quite a bit of money. We bought it 2001, the lady we bought it from had been here since 1935.

One ground floor flat on one side of the building always had a problem with noise from the flat above, mainly footfall impact, music and TV doesn't seem to go through as much. The noise seems to come from the part of the building that was the verandah, and this is over the bedroom. 

I haven't seen inside the ceiling of this flat but on the other side the ceiling has 60mm of fibreglass insulation, and the ceiling is fibrous plaster on battens attached to 6"" joists with hardwood floorboards above having carpet with underlay. 

The flat above is going to be vacant for a couple of weeks soon so I will have time to try to lessen this noise. 

I was thinking of taking up the carpet and putting down [19mm yellow tongue particle board flooring] (https://www.bunnings.com.au/structaflor-3600-x-900-x-19mm-yellow-tongue-particle-board-flooring_p0460721) on top of the existing floorboards. 

First option is to fasten it to the existing floor to increase the mass. 

Second is to lay it as a floating floor with a sound deadening layer below, probably similar to that used under laminate flooring, but maybe the existing carpet underlay.

71,Where to get dampers,1517963951,"Hi engineers!
I have a couple of things that are way over my head. I'm building a floor mounted hotas/cyclic. (Explanation at end)


1) I want a damper that ideally has at least 8cm of travel end to end, can work against (but isn't stronger than) an adult pulling on it with a 70cm lever but which will **not** re-centre itself. It should stay where it is moved to. 
Apparently radio controlled car shocks, with the spring removed,  do this, but i don't think they would be strong enough or have enough travel.  Where can i get such a thing - the cheaper the better? Would a shock off a mountain bike work like this if i took the spring off it?


2) i want a tension spring that is strong enough to overcome the damper in order to centre the stick , between 3 and 8cm unloaded  (i can change the design to fit) - any ideas? How do i know if it's strong enough? 

 I'm doing it this way so i can have a cam centring mechanism which is regarded as the best type,  but i can disable it by taking the springs off so i have a helicopter cyclic which is not self centring.

72,Understanding radiators/heat pipes in space,1517963822,"Hello 

I know that spacecraft use radiators because that is the only way they can disperse heat. I also learned that usually heat pipes will carry heat from electronics and transfer the heat to a radiator, where it can be dispersed. 

That said, how does a radiator and heat pipe ""know"" when to stop transferring heat. Let's say I have electronics I want to keep at 25ºC; how does a passive system like a heat pipe know to carry away X watts of heat to a radiator? 

Also, is the radiator hotter or colder than the spacecraft electronics? Heat has to move from high to low temperature, so does that mean the radiator is colder? How can this be if the outside temperature of the spacecraft is hotter than the electronics (hence why they're getting too hot)?

D is distance away from the pan in meters, and W is weight without the egg. The -(5 or 0) is incentivized “extra credit” if they use more than 4 parts for their design. Egg state is the state of the egg at the end, if it breaks it’s a coefficient of 0 and if it doesn’t break you get a coefficient of 1.

They arrived all slightly out of whack but I need them to be precise - one of them already managed to overcharge a battery once, which is a massive no-no when dealing with lithium-polymer.

I can kinda-sorta-more-or-less do it with any random battery and my multimeter, but that itself is not tremendously precise. It would at least let me standardise all of the chargers to the same reference and by setting them a few hundredths high I'd be safe at the cost of a couple percent points of total capacity, but - and as engineers I'm sure you can understand - I'd be happier if they were all calibrated properly.

I don't have a really precise voltage reference, though. I have enough surplus power bricks to power a small nation, but they're all consumer-grade from laptops, phones and other assorted gadgetry - nothing that can't handle some variation.

After I’ve been given very very difficult projects, that I even lead at some points, I went to other companies and was defending our solutions (we tell the operators what to do). Please note that was 2 months fresh out of uni, I have to go every single weekend to work, to achieve the standard, stay at work two extra hours 70% of the time and 1 hour 100%. I feel like I am being used, because I have extra knowledge, I can find solutions in English websites and articles that literally don’t exist in Russian. So many times I found an good solution just because of English etc.

Recently I’ve been taught how to model reservoirs, very few people in our company know how to do it properly, so I was literally thrown to study it myself. I stay after work to call technical service to guide me etc, make shit loads of mistakes, and being pushed further and further with it. Many people help me etc. but I have learnt SO MUCH in the past 2 months (been at work for 4 months), I can do things already that other modelers don’t, and literally because I can read the manual (it’s in English) much easier for me. 

Let me bring a question now before I go further. I get tired. I have no life (although my gf is in UK, no parents here, nothing) I ski and play pool etc in my little free time. So my bosses say: stay and learn, you are young, you have no life, no worries etc. learn!!! I agree with them, but sometimes I hate it so much, I see 80% people leaving at 6 on the dot, where I am jut starting to sort out the calls with Moscow etc (8 hours diff so they wake up). 

My knowledge is literally exponential, I’m learning outstanding stuff, people literally come to me for advice now. But to do that, I have to give my life away. No joke. I come every weekend, to build a model (takes hours) and to prepare other stuff. 

Now this leads to a next problem. And I really need experienced view on this. As I grow fast, I get bigger tasks, I get trusted more. BUT! My brain literally doesn’t have time to process it all, I need more time to think, projects run at me and I gotta solve them in short time, so sometimes I panic, and almost always feel under pressure now. My boss comes at me and says come on! You had so much time! Why are you still doing it!? 

My dad is an engineer himself (technical director) and he says, they see potential in me, and they are growing me. But is this really the way? Like idk how I made it sound, but honestly I feel like this is extreme hahah. Leaving work at 6 is wrong!! Extra hour minimum. My bosses are pushing very hard, although please note, they don’t press that hard on others, they give them normal tasks, and they just do them. I really appreciate massive responsibility, but a lot of times I feel like I’m not ready yet, although I end up doing it. Also I’m in the kind of scientific part of the company, there’s no bullshit. If I say the reservoir will produce 8 tons a day, I have to properly prove it, which takes a LOT of knowledge. And if you’re wrong, you’ll look dumb.

Sorry for the rant guys, but I am stuck between, complaining to them and saying wtf, I am not a
machine I can’t do everything you tell me, and between shutting the fuck up, dealing with it as I have an opportunity to smash all of this and become extremely smart and experienced and give my life away while I’m getting experience here (planning to stay 2-3 years).

P.S. my bosses presses extremely hard, but he is amazingly smart he literally knows it ALL! Be it geology, developments etc etc. and he always says “wtf why do you know it” or “you’re annoying me, this should have done it last week” and honestly the tasks are extreme, I learn from 0 to solve them, and it really demotivates me. While other people are doing simple tasks. 

P.S.S. I take rides to work and back pretty much everyday... where he is a really nice guy and all. So I am really confused, I don’t understand what’s going on. ",AskEngineers,mutar5,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7vmr2o/breaking_my_limits_or_living_comfortably/
92,Thermocouple extensions/long length wire for reading temperatures of several points. How can I create these thermocouples?,1517911614,"Hi, I have tried to find reliable information for creating K-type thermocouples with lengths of about 25 meters (~80 ft) for a farming application. Basically I have a 4-channel K-type thermo data logger that I want to attack four thermocouples to. The temperature reading will come from points that are far apart, thus the reason I need long lengths for my thermocouples.

So far I ordered a ""thermocouple"" extension wire, connectors and off the shelf therocouples. I make an long extension wire with the connectors and connected everything. However I go temeratures that were more than 5 degrees C (9 F) lower than what the actual temperatures are. I have no idea if I am doing anything wrong or there is something faulty with the wire or what?

I decided to make my own thermocouples. So my questions is, how can I make a thermocouple extension wire? Should I just make a whole new thermocouple at the length I need? What are the maximum lengths I can accurately measure at? What type of wire should I use that is reasonably affordable?

First: I posted this here because this is not a pure Arduino -related question as I'm not completely sure the Arduino would be the best solution for this job. I'm trying to design a machine with a linear actuator (lead screw or timing belt) powered by an electric motor. This linear actuator would have to accelerate, maintain constant speed, slow down, reverse the direction, accelerate, constant speed, slow down, reverse, etc. Load on the linear actuator would be pretty low and ""gentle"", EM should rotate at around 1400 rpm at full speed and 0,5kW motor would be ok. From my limited knowledge of electrics/electronics, I would need a VFD to control the speed and to switch the direction of the motor. Simple limit switched would be installed on the frame to control the start of the movement/acceleration, end of acceleration/start of constant speed etc. Do you think it is viable to use an Arduino or a similar low cost microcontroller (with a big online support/knowledgebase) to control the VFD or should I look at something else?",AskEngineers,svantevid99,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7vloqy/microcontroller_arduino_vfd_motor_control/

1,"As a sales manager that would like to get his product into a new food processing plant that is going to be built, how do I approach the engineering company that is building the plant?",1517871059,"(More specific questions at the end). My company manufactures components that are useful in aseptic food/bev processing. We fill most of our orders through distributors and re-sellers, but as a new sales team we are trying to get straight to end-users (brands) and the engineering companies that build plants for them. 

I found, in Food Engineering Mag, monthly lists of plant openings in various stages (plans approved, ground broken, just started production, etc.). I’ve narrowed my options down to some places that haven’t broken ground yet or have just been approved/finalized. 

It is at this point that I’m a bit rudderless. I’m new to the industry, but not sales. I have no problem calling a general phone number for a company and navigating my way through offices and administrators until I maybe find the correct person with whom to speak. That tactic, however, is time consuming, tedious, and rarely produces results. I feel like it might be even harder with an engineering company. I’m working on getting the right person at the brand who is commissioning the plant, but thought I’d try this angle as well.  

1. I don’t know, yet, which engineering company was given the contract. Any resources I could visit/research to find this out myself?
2. Is there typically an RFP process for something like this, or do engineering companies usually know what products they will be using?

But, recently it's gotten to the point when applying I make it abundantly clear that I'm aware of my shortcomings and am willing to learn myself brain-dead to compensate for that and take less pay over a trial period. Whenever I do hear back from my potential employer, it's always the same message: sorry, we're looking for people with 3-5 years of experience.

I'm in northeastern Ohio looking for Embedded Systems positions, if being more specific helps.

As an aside, I was pretty much promised a $60k/year position all throughout college. Can it be considered honest to do that anymore? Or am I an anomaly? I hardly believe it's the latter since many of my engineering friends have been searching far longer (upwards of 3 years) with no success.

She is a contract employee, and is probably working at least 60 hours a week. They don't have a union supervisor for whatever area she is responsible for currently, so they offered her a direct position in that role. She absolutely didn't want it, so she declined. They've been slowly giving her more responsibility, basically making her the defacto union supervisor. She's talking to her boss and her boss's boss tomorrow about the situation, basically saying that she is going to start looking for another job if nothing changes

She doesn't want to do process engineer work anymore since she is so stressed and working so many hours. However, it's basically the only experience she has (this job for about a year, and a previous job doing similar stuff at a different automotive supplier). She wants to get more into design work.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get a job that's different from what she is doing now? It seems that it would be difficult since all her experience is in process engineering. Thanks!",AskEngineers,Domodude17,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7vbor5/how_do_you_get_out_of_an_industry_and_job_that/

34,"Dealing with a team that ""rackets"" rather than does good work?",1517793633,"I'm a 29 year old engineer that works with a team that - for lack of a better word to describe it - typically ""racketeers"",  rather than learn new skills, or get their work done on time.  What I mean is, when confronted with a challenge, or a new project, they all ""gang up""  to make sure either the work gets done the way they all agree to - which is usually a slow and poor way.  If anyone tries to challenge them, they ""gang up"" on that person as well.  They all go out to lunch together, and most hang out after work.

Very simple projects can't get done (organizing cabinets and inventory, installing new lab benches), because nobody wants to do that kind of work, without a unanimous agreement.  Most complicated projects can't get gone (ones customers are paying for), because half the team doesn't have the skills to do the work, while the ones that do are dragging out the work for overtime.  One large project they are working on is two years behind schedule, with no exit in sight.  Many months are wasted on trying to make simple decisions, with those decisions tabled from status meeting to status meeting, all while deflecting actually issues with critical systems.  Work that should take 2-3 weeks end up taking 4-5 months.  Occasionally the customers are briefed on the current project status.  Again the team ""gangs up"" and trying to schmooze the customer, making them believe everything is fine, and that there was a reasonable excuse for the old schedule to be thrown out, and it's ok that the project needs to be re-baselined for the third time.

I have my own set of projects, where I do all of the work myself, and I deliver efficiently.  My manager is pushing me to delegate work to the others, but I really don't see the point.  With some simple automation and organization, I can do most of the myself much faster, and still have time to do my other tasks.  Additionally, every engineer requires an hourly rate of funding.  Unless I jack up my cost estimates (making the group un-competitive) I don't have the funding nor the schedule slack for one of the other engineers to take 5X as long as me, plus my funding for when I have to fix their mistakes.

While I get good reviews from my manager, he sometimes dings me for ""not acting a team player"".  I have told him time and again that this ""team"" really needs to get its act together, because the current customers will eventually figure out what's going on - as past customers have.  His group will get a reputation of being unable to deliver, which hurts everyone.  He just says ok, then later forgets about it, and diffuses this responsibility.  Note there was originally a middle-manager who schmoozed enough with the group, but kept this in check.  He left for greener pastures.

For me, I couldn't care what my coworkers are doing.  But what bugs me the most is having to sit in the same office as them.  I feel I should be working with colleagues who are good at what they do, whom I should be learning new things from.  Not colleagues who are more interested in ganging up as a team, so they can drag out simple work while posturing how difficult it is, then being dinged for not being a team player.

I guess my only option is to find another job?

This wasn't that unexpected as I find electronics development (and probably also software and hardware engineering in general) incredibly boring, almost as much boring as my study was. I fuc_in hated my studies and I was doing it just because of social status and money. If I'd have ability to go back in time and be able to pick my studies again and pick something that I *might like to do*, then I would maybe go with architecture or some multimedia stuff. Or maybe, but really maybe I might pick mechanical engineering. In any case, I would end with sth that deals with visuals and is more concrete. I was always more of artsty-fartsy guy, meaning that I liked to draw, do visual shit and visual design, while the hardware and software engineering is the opposite of that. It's abstract, it's all about problem solving and it's heavily based on mathematics, critical thinking and so on, and these are all the qualities which I heavily suck at. I can recall when some assistant on faculty told me: ""Dude, you in the system don't have the ability to deal with such stuff"". Eventually I've  obtained that damn masters degree, but with the shittiest grades ever seen. The practical work was done by my colleges for me (we usually worked in pairs), while I passed exams with loads of luck. Most of time I didn't spend more than few days per exam (except for math exams) and I heavily, really heavily optimized the content that I had to learn. I predicted what it will be in exam based on the old exams and based on what I was I thought it's very important. Everything else was discarded. I neither had the will nor the ability to understand all that of shit, especially in a timeframe of few days, so I had to do some twisting. Also, when I was in first few months of study I almost quit it, but some inner voice saying ""don't be a cunt and if you quit it'll anywhere else the same"" prevented me from doing that. If i didn't listen it, maybe I would be much happier today.

Back to employers. They've asked me if I even like the stuff that I'm doing, they've said that I'm not a single bit of proactive and I've been told to dodge the development.

71,Active Suspension,1517638661,"A little background- I am learning controls from this page http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Suspension&amp;section=SystemModeling and came across active suspension (quarter car model). 

This page provides the diagram and equations of the system. The condition that it presents is that the vehicle has encountered a bump and a certain control force is applied to the wheel to adjust for the bump. It states that this control force (u) pushes the wheel down (and by newton's 3rd law, it pushes the car up) (check out the direction of u in the diagram). Is the direction correct?

I fell the direction should be reversed. The way I see it, a perfect suspension system should ""let the wheels do the movement"" and keep the car from moving vertically. And hence, when a bump is encountered, the control force should pull the wheels up instead of pushing them down. I fell pushing the wheel would ""amplify"" the effect of the bump on the car.

Another way to look at it, is that during a bump, the relative distance between the car and the road decreases. To accommodate that, the control force has to be of pulling nature.

94,How do I calculate gas flow after a valve?,1517571398,"Hi there,

I'm trying to figure out what the effect is of a control valve in a simple gas burner setup.

Current setup is gas bottle, pressure regular, hose, valve, hose, burner.

Our idea was to make a two way system. One restricted gas pipe to deliver a low flame and one valve controlled by pass delivering full power.

Our valve has 2mm orifice. It is a propane bottle regulated at 30mbar. The gas consumption is rated at 470 g of gas per hour at 30mbar.

The valve seems to diminish the full power output. How do I calculate the effect of a restriction on gas flow and thus power output?

95,"Would this invention be useful? A 6-foot wide radar measurement system with ultra short throw projector, to show you what's behind a section of wall.",1517569645,"I imagine there are people who are constantly dealing with the interior of walls, where there are electrical, data, water, etc. lines running throughout.  

If a device had approx. dimension of 1' x 1' x 6' wide, and it was on two motorized legs moving the whole box up and down, a contractor could place the device against a wall and press a button.  The motors would raise the device above the telescoping support legs from the floor to the ceiling, and a scanning radar would take measurements all the way up.  Once it reaches the ceiling (or the max height of the device anyway) it lowers again and projects a virtual image onto the wall, detailing what is inside the wall.  

This would allow someone to surgically alter walls with no manual scanning or guessing.  

A GPS unit could be fitted to the device too, so you could scan all of your walls, then move the unit back to the first position you scanned, and since it has scanned that section and has the data already, it will simply project without scanning again.

A 360-degree (spinning) laser projector could be temporarily mounted to the ceiling, in place of a central light, which would use data from the scanner, to illuminate (in a lower resolution, I'd imagine) all of the walls in a room at a time.

11,Should I Use a Lithium-Ion Battery in a Medical Device? (xpost - /r/batteries),1517529881,"Hi all,

I recently graduated from university, but I'm still helping out with some of the clubs that I was involved with while I was there. One of the clubs is centered around building low cost assistive medical devices, mainly prosthetic hands, for children. Up until now, they were entirely mechanical; however, this year they are looking to add servos and other electronics to them to make them a bit more versatile.

I am currently tasked with designing the power system for the hands. The hands will have 3 servos and a supporting microcontroller. The total worst case (all servos stalled) current draw would be 5a at 5v, for a total of 25W. The problem I am having, and the reason why I ask, is that I am unsure of what would be a good solution. My first thought was to use lithium ion cells, as I'm familiar with lipo's from my experiences with rc aircraft, as I know that lipo's can be very small, give out a ton of current, and can have a usable voltage with just two cells, or a single cell with a booster circuit. However, as these batteries are likely going to be internal to the hand, lipo's don't seem like a good idea due to their propensity to be... unstable... if not treated well, which children tend to not do. I also am familiar with the more traditional lithium cells as 18650's, which I know can do similar things. However, while these have a hard outer casing, and seem to be more tolerant to abuse, they also can catch fire just the same. I know that there are more lithium-ion chemistries out there, but haven't used any of them personally.

Would using a LiFe battery or Lithium IMR battery be a better choice?

Additionally, in regards to charging the cells, we are likely going to try and make the hands chargeable without having to remove the batteries, which would then involve building a charging circuit, or using a module. This is tricky for me, since I haven't really seen an off the shelf charging module that can charge 2 cells in series (aside from stand alone balance chargers), but plenty of single cell charging modules. Texas Instruments makes a nice set of IC's that can handle multiple cells, but that would involve having to build our own PCB, which while not off the table, is not as desirable.

Sorry this is a bit long. But any thoughts, opinions? Does this sound roughly like a good idea or should I be thinking about something different?",AskEngineers,Redditor1000239,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7un9wl/should_i_use_a_lithiumion_battery_in_a_medical/

The approach of this research involves both qualitative and quantitative method in proving that the application of this design is effective.

The qualitative approach includes the sufficient understanding of the characteristics and properties of blast waves and distinguish its behavior under different conditions of the environment influenced by weather, or where the blast can occur, strategic location of the building, etc. And to determine the components that should be used and added to a concrete in order for a constructed building to effectively resist blast.

It's not severe or even painful, and doesn't happen often if you aren't manhandling the desk a lot, but it is... well, *shocking* when it does happen.

What I would like to know is if there is any reason I should not add such a wire, or might not want to.

There is no separation between the metal audio jacks and the case, so I imagine that the shock may be coming from the audio cables, rather than a fault connecting the case to the power supply. Could adding a ground wire interfere with the signals from the microphones?

As a Norwegian I'm forced to move out of the country to get my degree and most likely pursuit a career (unless I want to develop missiles for [Kongsberg](https://www.kongsberg.com)). I'd really like to work for startups during the early phases of my career.

Im trying to weight to pros and cons of both countries and Id like some input on the engineering side of things:



**The US:**

I know that the immigration policy in the US is a bitch (And not to mention ITAR regulations), but I'm wondering if I graduate as an Aerospace Engineer (B.S), is it possible for me to work as a software engineer while I pursue permanent residency?

Possible universities: *California State at Long Beach, University of Central Florida, Kent State, CU Boulder (Crazy expensive tho)*

**Canada:**

What I've read about Canada it seems extremely immigrant friendly (at least to international students), but I'm wondering what kind of Aerospace sector they have there?  
Possible universities: *Ryerson University, University of Toronto, University of Windsor*

**Europe:**

This is a hard one for me because I'd really like to move out of Europe, sure it's great to grow up here, but I seek something different than the ""Work 8 hours, sleep 8 hours, free 8 hours"" mentality (correct me if this is just some stupid prejudice I have). 
I know about Arianespace, Airbus, ESA etc but that would probably require me to learn French (judging by my ability to learn German that's a no-go). Also, I got this preconception that working in Europe as an engineer doesn't get you as high wages and in the US, is this correct?

Universities looked at: *University of Linköping University, Sweden*

55,Making sense of DIY Analog Noise Cancelling Headphones Tutorial,1517418774,"So I'm interested in doing this, however, the author of this guide leaves out a crucial step. He caculates the RC values needed to optimise noise cancelling between 60 and 1000Hz using an all pass filter. However, he fails to mention how he got to those values in the section titled "" Step 5: All-Pass Filter Design""

 "" From here we needed to decide what range of frequencies we wanted to cancel out. We chose 1 kHz as the max and calculated what the lag needs to be for two points:
     @60Hz : phase lag = 1.3 degrees
     @1 kHz : phase lag = 21.6 degrees
From here, we tweaked the value of R4 and C3+C4 to get the phase shift to be at our desired values. ""

66,Is anyone here a second career engineer?,1517374902,"Hi all!

I have been a critical care nurse for the past 3 years, after graduating with my BSN. I'm not satisfied with my work. I haven't been the whole time, and I've been working notoriously ""cool"" nursing jobs that I know many people would kill to have.  I don't feel challenged or appreciated.  I could go on about why I want to leave nursing, but it's not important.

As a kid I always LOVED space, and in high school my favorite class was physics.  I've always liked the STEM fields, and was good at them (I took calc 1 &amp; 2 in HS, etc).  I ended up in nursing because quite frankly, it was the path of least resistance.  Nursing school came easy to me, my mom is a nurse, and nursing is a profession that will always exist and pay pretty well.

I'm NOT happy as a nurse though.  I always thought I would go back to school for my Nurse Practitioner very quickly, but I haven't.  I've realized I haven't because I don't WANT to be an NP.  I want to be an aerospace engineer.  I want to be involved in man's exploration of space.  I think coming from a nursing background could be particularly useful in the human factors of engineering, and/or creating things that will sustain life off Earth.

Anyways, I'm not trying to make this about my attributes as a possible engineer.  My question is: has anyone on this sub gone back for a second career in engineering?  Are you happy that you did?  Did you find any prejudice against you as an older student?  I'm 25, so I'll be 29 when I graduate with a bachelors in engineering.

77,What should I learn to switch from Electrical Engineering to Software Engineering?,1517341538,"I wasn't sure if this is considered ""could be easily answered by searching the internet."", because a lot of the questioned people asked about this topic didn't necessarily apply to me or my case.

Quick Background:
I got my BSEE (Actually, it's a BSE with an electrical emphasis, thanks to my school's rivalry with Purdue). The electrical engineering had more of a computer emphasis, covering digital electronics, machine code/assembly, and embedded systems which focused on low-level C programming. I also added a minor in Mathematics doing Linear Algebra and a second semester of differential equations. I have experience in C, C++, C#, and had a bit of Java in there as well.

Situation:
I'm currently an electronics engineer at a small company getting into IoT products. I love my work. I could both design schematics and boards, and program them, for ages. I don't want to settle in my hometown, though. I'm looking to move to Indianapolis. But jobs in Electronics Engineering are few and far between. (Job outlook for EE is 0% vs 17% for Software, and software engineers make 20K more than I am making now.)

It seems like everyone I know recommends I get into Software Engineering, saying that ""you just need to know how to code"", but any positions in software engineering say things like ""absolutely must have 10 years of experience using specifically SQL through Java on Knoppix systems and have exactly 2.68 pets.""  Exaggerated, yes. But they do seem to have specific demands for extended experience on particular platforms/languages that I wouldn't think people would learn unless it was taught by the job.

So if I was to try to jump over into software engineering, what would be some good topics to cover? I'm not experienced in much that is web-based, I don't actually have experience working with SQL databases, though it seems easy enough to learn. I could probably use some soft skills, like my boss complains that I don't make flowcharts for all my software. Is there anything else that could help out?

81,Supporting a Cantilevered beam,1517333799,"Hello r/AskEngineers. Have appreciated help in the past, so I thought I’d ask again.

I am working on a project where I need to support a cantilevered beam with cable. For the sake of the problem, it has a uniformly distributed load. My design constraint is the height I can go above the aforementioned beam (marked L in the picture below) 

https://imgur.com/gallery/7VLyg


Originally, I had planned to support the beam by option A. The cable would be attached to the fully constrained “wall” at the maximum height, then connected to the end. 

After searching the internet and talking to a friend engineer, Option B was recommended: adding a vertical strut somewhere along the beam to increase the cable angle, which in return would add more of a vertical support component.  Apparently they use this technique in some suspension-type bridges, but I would like to find more information on it. 

Which brings me to my question. Given that B provides more support given the height constraint(does it?), where should the truss be mounted along the beam? My guy tells me in the middle because it is uniformly distributed. Is this correct?

Also, what type of hardware should be used on the truss for re-directing the cable to the end? Would just a simple pulley work?

86,Checking bolt-nut tightness without torque wrench/gauge,1517324989,"One small but unexpectedly important part of my project has come to involve fastener tightness; unfortunately, I am not majoring in mechanical engineering!

I have essentially a bolt-nut pair that I tighten/loosen several thousands of times using a motor, each time ending with a measurement (unrelated to the bolt-nut fastening).

However... within my assembly, there's not much space to fit something like a torque wrench to ensure precise tightness.

So time for a closed-loop feedback system. Based on my research, off-the-shelf measuring devices are too big, therefore I'm trying to put together a bespoke sensor.

MY QUESTION: What measurement would most accurately and repeatably indicate a set tightness/torque each time I do a tighten-after-loosen cycle? I don't need a constant correlation, just an indication when it hits the required setpoint.

I was planning to use motor current as a measurement but I'm not very confident about this since it appears to vary quite a bit based on my test data over several thousands of cycles; either this is related to variable internal losses, or I'm doing something wrong there.

* I should still have my old textbooks from college, and even some of my old notes, if any of you think that just cracking them open again is the best refresher I can get.

* I will need to be familiar with HVAC equipment, such as heat exchangers (which we went over in class), dampers (which we went over if you count valves), and VFDs (which we didn't really go over in my HVAC-related classes, but I may have some understanding of depending on the overlap with my mechatronics concentration

* The company uses Delta Controls, which I know nothing about, but I have programmed an Allen Bradley PLC using ladder logic in RSLogix, and I have done controls in Simulink. If anyone knows if there is any overlap, and how I can learn Delta Controls, please let me know.

**TL;DR:** I have to learn or relearn thermo, fluids, heat transfer, controls, HVAC equipment, and Delta Controls. Please recommend methods or resources for studying. ",AskEngineers,Kaiapuni,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7tyy1x/how_can_i_best_reacquaint_myself_with_engineering/

I've only ever done one thermal simulation before on ANSYS, and that was a 2D simulation from an online tutorial. So fundamentally, I don't have a great background for this. I haven't taken heat transfer, and the only heat I've dealt with is from Thermo, where that was always given or assumed to be 0, and in circuits, where resistive heating was modeled as P=I^2 *R. I also know a bit about Fourier's Law. 

Intuitively, I was thinking that heat transfer would only occur through convection from the air, and conduction through the nickel strip. Do I need to take anything else into account? I would think the body of the cells would also create heat, but I'm not sure how to model that. Maybe as a heat flux? I was also planning on using the Thermal-Electric Analysis on ANSYS for this.

10,Importance of Degree Focus,1517279997,"Hi, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from Arizona State University. Our aerospace program has 3 focus areas, Aeronautics (what I'm in), Astronautics, and Autonomous Vehicle Systems. As far as the advisors have told me, I can get any job in any of those areas regardless of focus (for example my degree focus in aeronautics is sufficient for a career path in astronautical stuff). 

How important is the ""focus"" part of it? It's all the same degree, with a slightly tuned major map for each one. I was considering changing into Autonomous Vehicles since I still take the courses I was most interested in (rocket and jet propulsion) but take a lot more courses in controls and coding. By my quick look of the major maps, it seems that Autonomous Vehicles has a more well rounded course layout, and focuses a bit more on controls and coding. Of course, I'm still considering it but was wondering if anyone had any insight.

11,Which is stronger? A + shaped reinforcement or an X shaped reinforcement?,1517279724,"Hey! I am a student on a robotics team and have a question regarding steel and aluminum reinforcement. Essentially, our robot deploys a ramp and platform that will (hopefully) support one 150 lb robot each at a height of &gt;12in off the ground. Robots must be able to drive up the ramp at an angle of 18 degrees and park on the platform. Knowing this, my team and I came up with an idea to set up a layered platform/ramp. On the bottom would be an Aluminum reinforcement panel that would either be in an X shape or a ""+"" shape (or something else! We're open to ideas!). Then, there would be a sheet of polycarbonate in the middle and a grated steel sheet on top to add texture and more support. Our only requirements are that it must fit in 27 x 33 inch dimensions and that we must maintain 80% visibility through the platforms due to their starting position being vertical before being deployed (hence the hole-y grated steel and the clear polycarbonate layer). 

TL;DR: Which is stronger, ""+"" shaped reinforcement or x-shaped reinforcement? Something else? How do we maintain 80% visibility while optimizing the strength of the platforms?

I'm 28, in the USA, graduating with a chemical engineering undergrad degree in May. 3.2 GPA. I don't have a job lined up yet. No internship/co-op experience. I have 3-4 years of management experience in a textile manufacturing environment. 

I've had one job interview so far, and during the interview I was asked the question ""What do you want to do?"". It occurred to me that I don't really have a preference, all of the work I've done while getting my degree has been enjoyable and I didn't really prefer one specific thing over anything else.

59,Smoothest linear bearings for optical platform; can't use air bearings,1517153575,"A colleague of mine is building a two-axis positioning stage for use in wafer inspection in a cleanroom environment, which needs to produce very high-precision  motion.

Unlike typical stages in ultra high precision applications, he cannot use linear air bearings because this unit  is being operated in a tightly controlled, variable atmosphere; he can't have air from the bearings venting into the enclosure because it will disturb the experiment conditions, and because of the variable atmosphere, he can't just pull from a compressed tank of the same mixture as the environment.

Besides your typical profile rails, are there any linear motion bearings that you'd recommend instead? We are closing the motion loop with a pair of inferometers, but the system will need to hold a repeatability of 0.5 - 1 micron. Encoders give us position to a resolution of a few dozen nanometers, but my worry is focused on stick-slip in the rails. 

Easy to hit this tolerance with air bearings where there isn't any stick-slip, which is why it's frustrating that we can't use those. I imagine that after the stage on contact bearings has come to a stop e.g. 2 microns from target, you can't nudge it over without it stick-slipping a couple microns too far the other way.

73,My initial design on mitigating the heat output of a 'Co2 generator'/butane burner from my greenhouse - advice badly needed,1517086409,"Hello everyone, I am currently in the process of building a large commercial (non-marijuana) greenhouse and have some questions regarding how to mitigate the heat output from my Co2 generators:

A very brief introduction on Co2 and greenhouses: Co2 is a key element of photosynthesis, as I'm certain you all know. Co2 is what is converted into sugars, which ultimately end up making up the plant fibers (all of them: roots, shoots and fruits). The normal atmospheric Co2 concentration is about 400 ppm, but increasing it to 1500 ppm will heavily accelerate the photosynthetic rate and thus result in faster growth and denser fruits/more foliage. This has been used for quite some time in advanced greenhouses all over the world. A few links on this: Here and another here

There are basically three ways of increasing the Co2 concentration of the air of your greenhouse. Two of them are viable, the other (DIY) one is just nonsense.

    Using bottled, high pressure Co2. The benefits of this are: It won't add any heat nor humidity to your greenhouse. The downside is: It is three times more expensive than using butane.

    Burning butane/propane/natural gas: It's scales cheaper than bottled Co2, however the problem with it is obvious: As you need to burn said butane to create Co2, you will be adding water vapor + heat (a lot) into your greenhouse.

(3. This one is just not practical: You can obtain Co2 from throwing baking soda into vinegar and such, but it's just not feasible for a large greenhouse.)

To this day the most economical way of increasing Co2 concentrations in your greenhouse is burning butane/propane. Plants can only use additional Co2 during daytime (when there's already heat) but not during nighttime, so increasing Co2 is always going to mean an additional amount of heat being thrown into your greenhouse while the sun is already warming it. Sometimes this heat can be detrimental to your plants (in my case, arugula).

The most straight-forward way of taking this heat out would be to just use normal air conditioners, but this is extremely expensive considering the low price farmers are paid for their produce. I would like to go about extracting said heat directly from the source - right above my Co2 generator.

I have made a very crude MS Paint drawing of what my design would be like, which you can see here: https://imgur.com/a/avyOt Forgive my lack of photoshop skills.

The idea is very clear: I have a water tank outdoors, which will be (relatively) cooled by outdoor temperatures during the winter (not so much in summer...). Directly above the Co2 generator, where heat is flying up, I have some copper piping: Namely 4 heights of a 'copper pipe maze' (sorry I don't know the correct word for this) which is heated up by the butane burner, transferring this heat to the water that is flowing inside of it. As the warmed water exits the greenhouse, it falls back into the water tank and is then constantly being recirculated inside. As such, some of the heat from the butane flame is thus vented outside, away from the plants, while all the Co2 stays inside

My question is a simple one:

What kind of additions could I make to this system to make it more efficient?

The first possible change is an obvious one: Instead of constantly recirculating the water, I could just always use cool tap water and discard the warmed water straight out the gutter: Unfortunately this option doesn't agree with my ideas on water efficiency in agriculture (hydroponics) as it would mean thousands upon thousands of gallons being stupidly thrown away every month.

Another possibility I contemplate would be a water chiller in the outdoors tank: Would the cost of electricity being used on this (plus the initial cost of purchase) be economically logical? Or would natural loss of heat in an opened water tank be enough? Or is it a matter of ""no water chiller in the winter/water chillers turned on in the summer""?

My question to you fine learned folks is: What can I do to make my natural water cooling system more efficient? I'm sure there's a lot I'm missing in my plan.

74,Can I get some feedback on my model for lithium-ion storage losses?,1517085920,"Hello all,

I have been working on an algorithm to compute the most cost-effective configuration of solar photovoltaic (PV) and lithium-ion energy storage for Sustainable Energy Generation Systems (SEGSs). SEGSs are stand-alone (off-grid) electric power systems that provide electricity to end-users independently from renewable energy. Renewable energy resources and energy storage systems (ESSs) are the main components of SEGSs, and the main challenge is figuring out how much renewable energy and how much energy storage are required to supply power year-round. 

By considering oversized PV, the algorithm approximates the energy storage requirements for increasingly oversized PV. The result is a graph showing [all possible configurations]( https://i.imgur.com/kbjhurC.png) of PV and energy storage; here is an [animation](https://imgur.com/OTyTMvb) of what this looks like.

The previous graph shows an inverse relationship between PV and energy storage; this property is important to optimize for the cheapest system. Since PV and energy storage have different costs, the algorithm computes the [price of each configuration]( https://i.imgur.com/WPBwQlc.png) and determines the most cost-effective system shown by the red “x”.

The algorithm I developed requires the expected hourly time-series power supply of the PVs and the expected hourly time-series power demand data of the electric grid for the entire year. The algorithm iterates through this data to compute the time-series stored energy of the ESS. Starting at the first hour the algorithm compares the generation and consumption. If generation exceeds consumption, the extra energy is stored. If consumption exceeds generation, the ESS supplies the missing power. The algorithm continues this process taking into account efficiency, efficiency degradation, and self-discharge. In my model, the initial efficiency is 90%, and the default efficiency degradation rate is 1% per year, so after 5 years, the efficiency decreases to 85%. In addition, the default self-discharge rate is 5% per month which equates to 0.00007% per hour; every hour the algorithm decreases the stored energy by this percentage. 

Here is a link to the [algorithm](https://github.com/OffGridEnergy/offgrid-solar-power-system), and here is the [technical document](http://docdro.id/gwUIVP7) I have been working on. Section V describes more information about the algorithm. 

I have been researching this topic but it's been challenging so I’m asking for help. How can I improve my model to make it more realistic? I can measure the cylce count and the SOC of the ESS, but I'm not sure how these parameters affect the ESS. Are there other assumptions that I need to make and are there any other storage losses that I need to account for (e.g. SOC self-discharge)?

Thanks in advance for the help!

Sorry for the provocative title, just wanted to grab some attention.

I was just wondering, do engineers working in the US, or for American companies, use Imperial units? And if so, is it for all calculations or just a conversion from metric to imperial once a final answer has been calculated?

For context, I am a UK based mechanical engineer. I understand that you get a ‘feel’ for the units you are raised with. In the UK we still cling on to Imperial in some instances, such as miles for driving distance and pints for cooking. But in an academic/educational context always SI.

The only evidence I have that imperial is still in use is from papers I read from US authors, and popular science programmes; although these must be made to be understandable by a wider audience.

Although the head on this unit can be removed to leave you with a female M6 threading, that would remove an axis of motion as well as the fine position adjustment, so it might be best to work with the standard head instead.

Before I design something from scratch, I wanted to ask if anyone already makes a more universal clamp designed to be used for this purpose (i.e. one that can be used to hold a hand tool, scope probe, etc...).  Or alternately, are there stock parts that are easily repurposed for this goal?

Assistant process engineer 
Pros: Good working location, it’s about an hour drive from where I live. Salary as compare to 2nd option will be much higher as I will doing shift work with payable overtime. Reputable MNC. 

Cons: Long working hour, require me to work 5 to 6 days of 12 hours shift per week (that explains why the salary is much higher than the 2nd option). 

Field Service Engineer:
Pros: The main company building is near the place I stay as well, just an hour drive too. Lesser work hours as compared to first option, just that they have told me occasionally I will need to work at odd hours/irregular timing as they may never know when will clients want things to be done. Get to travel occasionally as well! 

Cons: I believe I won’t be Station at my company everyday and will have to drive around to different clients’ sites and company to serve their needs and requests.

I'm not a top tier student; I guess I'm not competitive enough compared to some of my peers, academics wise. So I've been looking at the transfers by Major for UC's and it's a little scary. UCLA admissions especially. It's going to be really tough and I'm a little discouraged by it. I am a average student heading to a community college,  and I have to maintain over a 3.7, and honestly I am going to try my best but not sure if I will be able to make it.

I am designing a pneumatic assembly for my side project. As I am not engineer, I would greatly appreciate any help I could get.

Now what I wanna do is to regulate pressure and flow rate down to values I need using this attachment without modifying the compressor settings. My questions are:  1. Is it possible to regulate pressure and flow rate independently without affecting each other? By looking at Bernoulli equation, it looks like changing flow velocity would affect the air pressure.So I don't know if and in-line pressure and flow regulators would do the job. 2. Is there any pneumatic device to stabilize air flow and get rid of ripples (sort of like a capacitor for air line)?

24,From MD to FEA?,1516901307,"Hey everyone,

I'm a senior in Materials Science and Engineering. I have focused on continuum mechanics and computation. I'm looking at a couple of projects for Senior Design, and I'm worried about one thing.

One of the projects is with my current research professor in Materials Characterization where I would be modifying and updating existing FORTRAN code for certain molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that they would be running, as well as updating and rewriting large parts of a code that would be used for image alignment of a sample to minimize the effects of electron drift when analyzing the sample.

I point this out because I would really like to do a project in FEA and the mechanical/math side, and I am a bit wary of doing something in MD for fear of what potential employers might think (atomistic/MD simulations are definitely more popular in the academic field). However, modifying the above codes would be a great experience for me, and there is a chance that I would have a couple publications from the work that I would be doing/have done so far with my current team.

Do you think then, with the math and simulation background that I would have, that I would have a chance at talking to people about FEA and securing a position in that?

25,How to handle a negligent engineer / company?,1516898332,"This is in Ontario, Canada, and PEO. Not sure if this should be in /r/askengineers, /r/engineering, or /r/legaladvice.

Disclaimer: Throwaway. I was recently let go from a company, so this might seem like a scorned worker exacting revenge. To be fully honest, there is a bit of that in this. But I'm more concerned about the impact this has, and I'm unsure of what to do. I'm not an engineer, but I've studied engineering, and worked in engineering for a decade. I'm a project manager.

The company I worked for used an outside engineer to stamp their drawings. This engineer would routinely not review drawings / perform calculations, and in fact gave the company a digital copy of his stamp so we could use it as necessary. I raised my concerns with the company and they said it was OK, and the engineer said it was OK as well. I was never comfortable with it, and I'm still uncomfortable with it.

The last project I worked on was a large one with public impact (a school). Drawings are still being reviewed by the client, after having been detailed by an outside company and stamped by this outside engineer. The engineer and detailer do not work together. Luckily, the client's engineer is doing his due diligence and is fully reviewing the drawings and has caught some issues, sending them back to us to be revised.

The company itself has worked with this engineer for years, if not decades. The amount of work performed by the engineer on this project is not out of the norm - this routinely happens on other projects. When I've been able to spot it, I interjected and said ""this should be like that"", and fortunately it was fixed (sometimes after a nice argument with a superior and a lesson about engineering).

I'm not sure what to do. PEO has a reporting system for negligence, but I don't have enough information about this outside engineer. His stamp number, his full name (last name is difficult to spell), company he works for (Lastname Engineering), address, phone number, etc. PEO has no governing authority over the company I worked for, but I know they've cut corners with engineering, fabrication, and installation of engineered items. I know they've used this engineer's stamp when they shouldn't have.

Fortunately, I can get a hold of the engineer from my most recent project. I don't know how I should tell them that they should review all drawings / connections / engineering without this burning me, or looking like I'm wanting to burn the company. Although, the bridge between this company and I is already torched, so my name to them means nothing to me (and their name to me was torched long ago anyway).

35,Internship at large defense contractor vs hands-on co-op at small company,1516852844,"I am a junior in engineering and I have an offer from a Large Defense Contractor (Lockheed Martin), and will probably get a co-op offer for a smaller company (700 employees). This will be my first internship and I am having trouble deciding. My main priorities: I want my work to be a very good learning experience and want to least at least slightly challenged. I want to enjoy it and get some some hands on experience. Company culture is also a big thing to me. -Note: I understand how most internships at big companies out start slow with not much to do, so I am prepared for that. 

Large Defense Contractor:

Pros: Offering very flexible hours. I can work during school semesters. I can come in and work whenever I want and however many hours I want. My internship starts this spring and I can stay with them for as long as I want and probably get a job offer after graduation. I would be getting to do some work that I am interested in. Looks good on resume and will help me with future jobs in the future if I decide not to go full time with lockheed. I can apply for a security clearance and would have one by graduation. I am also interested in working for NASA so I think this would help me.

cons: Less hands on work. Will take a while before I get more involved with hands on work. These first 2 semesters will be pretty slow and I won't have a whole lot to do until next Fall/Spring. I have read about how many people hate their jobs working for large defense contractors. 




Smaller company: 

pros: Very hands on work environment. Very interesting projects. I would learn a TON. Fits exactly with my interests. Smaller company so more personal experience. 

Cons: Co-op so I will have to work a semester. May be harder to find a different job later down the road. I'm worried by some reviews on glass door. Many people say this about the company on glassdoor: the environment can be really stressful, lacking leadership, and company declining 



I'm thinking about considering the large defense contractor for a safe choice.

I am a graduating senior (graduate in August this year) in Bachelor's of Computer Engineering from the University of Arizona.  My GPA is a 3.4 and I have a math minor.  I have two 7 month co-op experiences: one with a major semiconductor company in AZ (2015) doing RTL validation and computer architecture related work, and another with the same company in CA (2016) doing more of a software/scripting validation role.  These two co-ops delayed my graduation by a year or so. 

&amp;nbsp;


I also had an internship experience with a strong tech company in Austin (2017) for 4 months, learning about Python, automation, benchmarking and such.  My team was impressed with my work and put in a request for a full time offer starting in 2018 for me.  Unfortunately, they weren't granted any openings and could only offer me a spring 2018 internship.  I've accepted this internship, thus my final graduation date is now August 2018.  I accepted it because I fell in love with Austin and the industry in that area (many different tech companies).  This is where things get rough.

&amp;nbsp;

In the weeks leading to my internship start in the end of January, I applied to full time positions in that company and a few others.  Anything specifying Software Engineering in Austin I applied for.  However, one of these was a software position in Boston with the same company (I applied because I really like the company anyway and was getting desperate).  The interview process went well but I found myself conflicted about if I could bring myself to imagine living someplace that wasn't Austin.  When the offer came I was both happy and sad that I would have to make a decision to potentially leave an area that suited me so well.  Things only got worse when I went looking for apartments and housing close to the office area (west of Boston) and found they were at least 60% more per month for anything remotely equivalent to what I would get in Austin, with not enough of a salary difference to really accommodate this (rent for a 1 bedroom apartment could take up to 30-60+% of my base salary in Boston).  The company offers transfers but it appears that is only possible after 3 years.  And is it really good for me to go into a location fully expecting I might leave as soon as I could?  I'm not sure if the Boston area will agree with me like Austin's does (side note: I don't care about the weather stuff, it's more the feel of the city and culture).

&amp;nbsp;

Do I turn down the offer and keep looking?  At this point I'm worried if I even have the skills to make other companies without an internship with them (I'm missing frontend web development stuff like NodeJs, javascript, HTML5...).  I haven't heard from any other companies I applied to, is it too late in the year for an entry level like me to be hired?  Will I have to wait until next year if I don't accept this position?  I'm struggling because I've been told that my experience on my resume is highly appealing, and I've had very positive performance reviews with the companies I've worked with so far, yet I haven't gotten anything interview wise with any other companies.

Current OTEC technology however is only practical where there a suitable enough temperature difference between warm seawater on the surface and cold seawater deep below the surface; seawater with this sort of suitable temperature difference is only found close to the equator.

However, I'm wondering if there could exist a slightly modified shore-based OTEC plant that substitutes warm seawater on the surface with water that's heated geothermically underground - and I don't mean heated with a Natural Hydrothermal Resource, I mean heated by circulating water underground like how geothermal home heating works. Cold water found deep below the surface would still be used on the cold side.

55,Famous shoe rack mechanism,1516817964,"Hi,
 I was wondering if anyone could shed some light into the possible internal workings of the famous rotating shoe rack in [Overboard](https://youtu.be/RHxab43c4rY)

I presume they're attached to two belts/chains side by side, linked by three cogs to keep them in sync.... 

Basically []xXx[]
Where [] are the two rotating sides and xXx are the three gears (to sync and move the two sides)

With the X causing the movement when turned... by hand or motor... Making the left one turn clockwise and right abticlockwise if X is turned clockwise. I'm not sure this would actually work for square tracks.
Obviously it's considerably more complex since it seems to delay movement until other parts are in place.
I'd really like to understand how this it's done.

What is actually used and how would you attach the shoe racks to the belt/chain if that's used? The chain would have to go round pulleys somehow in the corners I presume.
How does it turn so smoothly at the corners? Would it be mounted on casters or something else?

Thanks for any help, or pointers, I have no engineering background/experience. Not sure if this was just people in the background moving it, but I've always wondered how this could be done.",AskEngineers,societeduspectacle,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7sp3xh/famous_shoe_rack_mechanism/

I've compiled a list of books I've read and organized them by subject matter.

I am a recent Mech Engr grad (Dec 2017). I worked pretty hard to ensure I would have a shot at a job working in the US space industry-- I have internship experience from NASA and an aeronautics company. I also have a good GPA and I took useful electives in college (compressible flow, FEA, thermal design, mechatronics, MATLAB, etc.). 

However, I am really struggling with the online application game. I have applied to easily 100+ jobs since graduating but have had little luck. I made sure to have keywords in my resume (my resume I have been told is good by many people who have mentored me). 

I got three interviews: the first one went very well and they told me I was their top candidate, but they hired someone internally instead. The second, the posiiton got cancelled. The third, I just didn't get it. I was pretty bummed about that last one because it was my dream job and I thought the interview went extremely well. 

Should I just keep moving forward with applying to space-sector jobs? It is my absolute goal. It's the only thing I feel I can get excited about. I always pictured my career as an important and major part of my life.

67,"How does compensation work in an early-stage startup, and what are things to watch out for?",1516766446,"I'm looking to change careers from my secure government engineering job of the last 7 years, to join the hardware start up community in my nearby big city.  However, I'm not too sure how compensation (salary+equity) really works.  I've done some research, and it seems like there's a lot to look out for.

Right now, my compensation is very simple : Salary+Benefits+401k matching.  I have 1-2% cost of living adjustments every year, step increases (2-3% usually) every few years, and my career progresses by rising in grades.  If I stick with my job for another 10 years, I could retire pretty comfortably (~$1-1.2MM in assets).  Boring, not mega-rich, but comfortable.

From what I've read, if I get involved in a startup, there are two situations:

**Become a Founder:**

This is where you can make the big bucks.  Me, along with a group of colleagues become founders of a business.  We initially take no salary, but we own substantial equity in the company (20-30%).  We then seek funding from investors, either institutional or high-net worth individuals.  We work on our product or service for a number of years, while growing the company.  We seek larger amounts of funding and hire employees.  Maybe in the future we start receiving cash flow from operation, maybe even turn a profit.  But ultimately we seek to ""exit"", through acquisition or IPO.  Then the equity becomes worth $MM if all is successful.  This is very rare.

**Become an Early-Stage Employee:**

I join a startup as an employee, become Employee Number #(1-30). I take a salary, but it will be a pay cut (70-80%) of that of a large-company.  I will be offered equity, I will have to negotiate hard for it, and I will end up owning low-single digits percentage of the company (1%-4%).  I work for a number of years, negotiating pay raises every 6 months (not sure, 1-5%?).  If I stick with it, and the company is successful and exits (5-8 years), I'll receive a nice cash bonus ($50k-$200k) from my equity, while the founders and investors make the big bucks.  Only if the company sells for &gt;$100MM will my equity be life-changing.   

However, I have to watch out for all sorts of fine print involved (equity dilution, vesting, market-rate buybacks, vampire clauses) where the founders might try to screw me over.  Or salary cuts.  Or most likely, the company just goes out of business.

If I don't stick with the company, I can (and will probably have to) hop from company to company every 2 years..

Is this all the case?

As a mid-career professional, is it even worth it to be involved in a startup if you're not a founder?  I guess that's my other concern.  The single-digit ownership (if that's correct), and fine-print don't seem worth it.  I can understand for the experience, or if you like the lifestyle.

**Background:** I'm working on a school project, where am building a 15cm^3 box that must maintain a temperature 10 degrees Celsius above room temperature. The walls are only 5cm thick. I must also ventilate air reasonably well (10ml of ethanol will be evaporated in the box, only 50% can remain after 5 minutes) so I can't just heat stagnant air. My budget is $100

I have a good grasp on the structural aspect. I plan to create a wood/ insulator sandwich and use those panels to construct the sides. I will research what the best insulator I can afford it. I plan to line the interior with tinfoil and paint the outside matte black to reduce heat loss. My plan is to overly engineer the structure because 15W is very little to work with. I plan to use computer fans as the intake/ exhaust, and they will be as far apart as possible. As an aside; do I need an exhaust fan? Can I just use the positive pressure inside the box provided by the intake to exhaust air? 

**Problem:** I have 5V, 3A, DC power supply and we need to warm a 15cm^3 area. I would like to design a heat recovery system so not all the heat is exhausted, but I have not figured out how to build such a system yet.

69,Poor Start to Career,1516759385,"TL;DR: 1.5 years after graduating, ambition and mental endurance hindered due to unprecedented personal issues, but ambition and direction being regained. Have desire to be in a more interesting field (something that requires programming, analysis and an interesting product), but resume does not reflect this. Only $4000 in debt. What are the paths that I can take from here?


Hello. I am going to be 24 in a few months. I completed my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at Arizona State in May 2016.

Since then I have done:
1) 2d and 3d modeling (using AutoCAD and Revit) for a company that scans and models existing buildings
2) Estimating for the same company
2.5) Sales Estimating at a bathroom partition construction/installation company
3) CAD Detailing for a company that builds and installs building enclosures 

I was not proactive enough in college to get any internships or co-ops at actual engineering firms or to join any engineering clubs, but I did work as basic tech support for the business school and worked as a construction laborer over two years (primarily over two summers).

Due to an overwhelming number of negative events that have occurred in my family, social, and love life since May 2016 (yes, the month of my graduation), I have suffered from a significant (but not permanent) loss of direction, mental endurance, and knowledge gained during college. I was a straight-A student in high school, captain of the baseball and football team, earned a 3.2 GPA in Mechanical Engineering in college. After heartbreak (ex and lifelong brother/best friend got together a month after she and I broke up) and becoming about 20% financially responsible for three younger sisters, life is no longer the game of Sims that I used to treat it as.

Let's say there were small stints during college when I experienced mental ""flow"" (the state of performing a challenging and interesting task very well) in quite a few classes (control systems, Computational Fluid Dynamics, and statistics), and I have experienced this state about 5 days tops since graduating about 550 days ago.

With that being said, my question to you all is:
If you had my resume, and wanted to obtain a job that is more mentally engaging and purposeful (involves more programming, analysis, and has an interesting product) (and you had only $4000 left in debt), would you pursue a masters in a TBD field, or would you simply refresh your programming skills at home and hope that your regained mental acuity can get you something closer to a ""dream job""?

76,Improving shock resistance of cast metal components using the lostPLA 3d print to investment casting method?,1516738603,"Howdy! I'm a bladesmith looking to expand my abilities beyond the (now) standard set of forging and forgewelding steel. I picked up a 3d printer with the intention of using the lostPLA method of investment casting to produce high quality metal components for knives and swords. I'm currently using zinc based alloys like Zamak 2 for testing purposes as they are simple to gravity cast and are of comparable strength to yellow brass but somewhat lighter.

My question is this: What is the ideal procedure for casting a component to emphasize shock resistance above all else? Is it possible to heat treat cast non-ferrous metals to reduce grain size and reduce brittleness and tendency to fracture? After hitting some test pieces with a hammer I've noticed that the cast metal is much more brittle than the equivalent if it was forged. This is not surprising as casting produces random and irregular grain boundaries, but I wanted to know if there was any (practical) way to alleviate this to some extent.

77,Structural Engineer Seeking Some Career Advice,1516737995,"TL:DR: young professional needing some insight whether to chase an MBA or specialize. 

Hi all,

A bit of background: I graduated college about 2 years ago and have been working an entry level Structural Engineer. Though my degree was in Mechanical, Structural had been my second choice. I've got my FE and am looking to go back to school.  This is where the road splits. On one hand, I could specialize in a discipline. On the other, I could go the MBA route and have a dynamic set of degrees. I'm leaning towards the MBA at this point, and have been studying for the GMAT. I'd like for the MBA to pay dividends, and I'm not entirely sure which school to go to yet. Which leads me to my next question. 

Has anyone ever heard of an engineer going to an Ivy League school? My buddy brought up the idea and I have to say, it does seem enticing. Granted the schools are very expensive, I would think an MBA from an Ivy League school would be lucrative. However, I'm not too sure how to use it with an engineering degree.

80,"Finishing up a mechanical technologist program, not sure what to do next...",1516735263,"I'm in my final semester of a Mechanical Engineering Technology program in Ontario. I had initially planned on transferring to university and getting a full mechanical engineering degree (another ~2.5 to 3 years).

After doing a variety of courses in college I'm not really sure if I enjoy the math and physics all that much, or if I could even make it through a university level course. (from what I've heard it's quite a jump from college).

What I enjoy most about my program is the designing, cad, and hands on work. I understand that with my diploma I could probably land a decent job doing something similar to at least some those things.

Lately I've become interested in Industrial Design, and it seems right up my alley. However, it would mean another 4 year program and I'm not really sure if it's worth it. Can anyone comment on the differences of work I might do as a mechanical technologist, versus an industrial designer? Could I do an 'industrial design' job with a mechanical technologist diploma?

82,Question about derivative of D term in PID (you read that right),1516731547,"My intuitive understanding of PID is that the P term looks at the instantaneous error, the integral at past error, and the derivative at the future error. The derivative term is large when the difference of the previous error and the current error is large, so either when there is a sudden large disturbance or a rapid change of setpoint. The D term thus has a dampening effect.

So, say my system is at constant error because of something like wind, and the integral term has not yet built up to the point where it can compensate for the constant offset. Then, the 'wind' stops and the system attempts to jump back to the setpoint with a rather large correction, because previously the P term was counteracting the 'wind'. But now, the D term kicks in because the rate of change of error is large!

So, the D term reacts in both directions - when error is minimized or maximized quickly. Would it make sense to only count the D term when it is positive, that is, when the error is rapidly growing? And when the error is rapidly decreasing, ignore the D term? If there is overshoot, the error is growing again, leaving the D term to act again.

Is this idea stupid or workable? I will implement it on my flight controller over the weekend and if there is interest, I will post the results.",AskEngineers,rafaelement,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7sgf2a/question_about_derivative_of_d_term_in_pid_you/

89,"Why aren't (big) ships constructed with strong, lightweight materials like carbon fiber instead of steel?",1516720400,"I can think of a few reasons, but I lack the knowledge to confirm my theories.

Below I have listed a few of my questions and thoughts on the matter. 


1) Price (material): steel is relatively cheap. But steel has to be so much thicker than carbon fiber, which makes me question if it really is cheaper pet square meter. 


2) Price (construction): It must be much easier to work with steal because of welding. I can imagine that it would be quite complicated to make a floating ship out if carbon fiber plates. 
Would they have to be glued together? 

A big ship made out of one piece is of course out of the question, because it would be really inconvenient for maintenance (repairs would become complicated and overly expensive) and it would simply be too big to produce. 


3) Durability: how well does carbon fiber hold up over time, say 30-50 years? How does it react to (salt) water? It probably needs some kind of (expensive) coating, but then again, so does steel (in the form of paint). 


4) Are there any specific fields where carbon fiber actually would have the advantage? 
I assume a carbon fiber ship would be lighter and therefore have a smaller water displacement. 
For military use a higher price seems to be acceptable, so it could be reasonable to build a submarine out of carbon fiber? 


Do any of these thoughts and questions make sense? I would love to hear if and why they do (not).

2,Medical question. Not wrong sub,1516675162,"Hello engineers. I have a strange question but one that is important to me. I have been admitted to the ER 5 times in the last week with symptoms that keep disappearing by the time they can run any tests. Nausea, shortness of breath, diarrhea, problems with my memory, headache, all pretty basic stuff. 

I know what you're all thinking: carbon monoxide poisoning, right? That was what I was thinking too. I came out of my regular visit today feeling a little angry with myself for not thinking of it before. I came home and called the sherriff's dept, they got out the fire squad who checked in my place. When they were done and called me in they showed me a crack in my furnace flue that I had not noticed because I've never looked for one. Miraculously, they switched on their meter and even though the furnace was on it was not allowing CO into my house, it was still funneling upward probably because the crack is on the underside of the flue and it is hot air. They stuck the nozzle inside the crack and the number started climbing until it got over 100 and then they switched it off. They told me that if the wind changed direction or some garbage it could push it back into my house.

After they left I checked the dryer vent outside that pipes from the same room and it was clogged. I cleaned it out with my hand and switched the dryer on and almost immediately could tell something was wrong so I turned the dryer off. I am assuming that even though it is an electric dryer, since the exhaust is blocked it creates a pressure difference that pulls the CO through the crack in the flue and into my house.

My questions:

First, am I right about my assumption? 

Second, as long as I don't run the dryer, should I be ok to sleep in my house tonight? The fire persons/mayos detected no CO in here right now.

Third, the furnace has 3 gas burners. Let's assume that the dryer always runs for 60 minutes, the vent is 100 percent blocked, and the hole is 1 inch by 2 inches. How much has been getting into my house when I run the dryer[edit:2,200 sq foot house, 3 levels, furnace and dryer are in a room in the basement in the center of the house]? Of this amount that's been getting into my house, how much has been getting into my body?

This fourth may be a stretch for this sub. Any idea how fucked I am? Based on the amount of lint stuck in that vent it's clear it has been plugged a while, probably this whole cold season[mn]. I have only been feeling these symptoms a couple weeks so hopefully not too bad? I also doubt the combination of that crack in the flue and the blocked vent existed last year...hopefully.

Thanks for your time and responses my dudes/mayos. 

edit: I cleaned out and reattached that vent which left me quite windy. The 4"" piping was not securely attached to the ceiling and I found out that once it could no longer let the lint out of the house, it was forcing what could not exit through a big gap back into the house. The positive pressure created by the dryer to suck the lint off of clothing and pipe it outside was just siphoning it from the crack in the flue through the dryer and back into the same room and throughout the house. Coupled with whatever wind resistance would cause fumes to not leave the chimney, that seems what caused my problem.",AskEngineers,AmishBodyguard,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7sb9b6/medical_question_not_wrong_sub/

Could I assume impact is slow enough to be considered static; use a Roark calculation for flat plate but using the ultimate strength instead of yield as it fails in brittle fracture; or is that reckless oversimplification?",AskEngineers,biggsandwedge,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7s6xt1/strength_of_glass_under_impact/
20,Question on calling out a zone on a technical drawing.,1516632862,"We were having a discussion at work on how to call out a feature for the guys in the shop. We have a very busy drawing that has 2 concentric, close tolerance holes right smack dab in the middle of the drawing. Due to it being so busy the dimensions for the two holes are not in the same zone as the hole.

So the question came up, do we reference the zone that the actual feature is in or do we reference the zone that the dimension for the feature is in?

Obviously either should get the job done but once I asked the question people started second guessing what they have been doing in the past. (I'm the new guy at work.) Which was calling out the dimension for the feature. We've made good arguments for both sides and can't seem to find anything on google.

21,What make the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement dome so expensive?,1516625208,"Don't get me wrong, it is an immensly impressive engineering feat and truly something to be proud of. I'm not asking this because I'm against the project or anything, just out of pure curiosity.

The [new safe confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_New_Safe_Confinement) is 92.5 metres high, 150 metres long and has an external span of 270 metres. Apart from the demolition equipment, it's hollow inside (right?).

The [mercedez-Benz superdome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Superdome) as a comparison is 77.1 metres high, about 300 metres long and has a dome span of 210m. It has a lot of infrastructure, luxury rooms, seats, bars... inside.

The Benz arena cost about 610 million dollars to make, the nsc 1.6 billion! More than 2.5 times as much! The confinement was constructed far enough from the danger zones to be hazardous, but even if workers received serious hazard pay, is the difference really THAT big?

I'm genuinly curious if I missed something, why was that thing so incredibly expensive? We're in the cost area of dams and large powerstations here.

22,Hypothesis for improved EGS Power Plant,1516620850,"I've read about both ""Enhanced Geothermal System"" (EGS) and ""Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion"" (OTEC) - two revolutionary concepts in renewable energy production - and I have this hypothesis that combines the two together.

As you may or may not know, an EGS power plant generates energy by pumping a working fluid deep underground to heat it up and then using it to spin a turbine; but an EGS plant needs hot enough underground temperatures in order to work - underground temperatures that are only found at reasonable depths in certain areas of the world (such as the western United States). And an OTEC plant generates energy by using the temperature difference between hot surface seawater and colder deep seawater to power a heat engine.

But, I'm wondering if it's possible to design an improved EGS plant that could operate with lower underground temperatures by taking advantage of freezing air temperatures in winter - making EGS suitable for areas such as the Northeast. My idea is basically the same as that for the OTEC plant, except that a heat engine is powered by the temperature difference between a hot working fluid that's heated deep underground and a cold working fluid that's chilled with freezing winter air.

## Wiki &amp; FAQ additions

The FAQ is long overdue for some content updates, which we'll be working on over the course of the year. In general we get a lot of questions that either a) should be answered exclusively by the wiki, meaning new discussions are disallowed, or b) have a wiki entry but new discussions are desirable. Stuff like *""What major should I pick?""* will continue to be removed, but we plan to expand the content that addresses it so that it can help the people who ask them more.

If you have any suggestions for new wiki content or improvements to existing articles, please leave a comment.

## Sunsetting ""Career Wednesday""

After some discussions last year with the mods of /r/engineering, we came to a consensus that that it would be better for both communities to combine our career discussion threads into one. This would put all of the discussion in one place at /r/engineering, which has a lot more activity in general and also more job postings. People looking for new opportunities and feedback on their resume/CV would get a lot more exposure.

Starting on **April 4, 2018,** Career Wednesday threads will redirect to the weekly career discussion thread on /r/engineering.

## Flair Applications

Our biggest challenge last year was getting flair applications processed. I'll be honest: this is entirely on me, and I don't prioritize enough of my personal time to get to all of them. I'm going to try and be better about not letting applications languish, but I can't promise a turnaround faster than 2 weeks.

Adding new moderators will help, that way I wouldn't have to split my time between regular mod duties and applications. If you're interested in becoming a mod for AskEngineers, please [**message us.**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers&amp;subject=Mod%20application) You can also view the requirements to become moderator [**here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/79lzz7/askengineers_is_looking_for_new_moderators_apply/)

## Miscellaneous

Some other things we're looking to improve this year are Automoderator responses and fixing CSS bugs. We don't have a CSS expert on our team, so if you have experience and would be interested in helping us (even if it's only temporarily), we would greatly appreciate it.

31,Retrieving a Piece of Paper,1516574689,"I've dropped a piece of paper behind some shelving, and need ideas for retrieving it.

We have this built-in cabinet mounted against the wall, 4ft high and 3ft wide, mounted into the corner of a room on the floor.. There is a 1/4 in gap along the top between the solid back of the cabinet and the wall.

A piece of 8.5x11 paper had fallen into this gap, between the solid back and the wall. It isn't near the edge where I might be able to fish it out using a flat tool like a ruler. It seems to be further towards the corner, but I can't see it.

So the extreme solution is to detach the cabinet from the wall to retrieve the paper, but I would obviously like to avoid that.  What other techniques might I use to get the paper out of this 1/4 in gap?

The long term solution is to caulk the top seam to avoid objects falling in, which will happen.

42,Panel/ Body Assembly (Cars),1516526841,"So I’m under the assumption that aero design is one of the beginning steps in designing a car. 

So under a “puzzle” analogy, where the final car body (&amp; possibly chassis) design is the completed “puzzle,” and the various panels (interior and exterior) are the puzzle pieces.

Who is in charge of dividing up the body into the different panels and body parts, and who is in charge of coming up with a plan to bolt &amp; clip all of these different parts together. (Who is in charge of making the puzzle pieces fit together?)

I’m curious for when taking apart cars (panels, bumpers, doors, etc.) Although many follow a similar “method” or idea to disassemble, some are totally different. 

While I expect this, sometimes I’m just blown away at how much stuff one must go through to just reach one bolt sometimes.

While for the same car manufacture, one car the bolt placement might be in plain site and easily accessible.  On another you have to spend an hour digging through a dozen other bolts, parts and covers just to get to the one you want. And when you find it it requires some special tool, or is in some ridiculous angle or placement.

So I’m curious who actually has the job of designing all this stuff and prepping it for assembly. There’s probably so many things one must consider just to design a door panel considering all the wires, bolts, room for the window frame, stereo, door handle etc.

The premise of my project is that Cape Town is in the home stretch of extreme water rationing, and I am looking at a way to suplement our water supply with a homemade condenser.

Here where we stay (Gordon's Bay) the wind is very extreme, so any normal condensation setups that utilize overnight dew or any external passive water condensors.

(To give you an idea, we have winds of 50kph and higher for more than 100 days a year. Neighbors have measured upwards of 100kph sustained winds and gusts over 160kph.)

I have looked and researched various options, and settled on a fridge or freezer, some computer fans and some pipe.

I went ahead and built a prototype (my wife needed to defrost our large freezer and this was a good opportunity to prototype before I buy a second hand fridge.)

Equipment I used besides the fridge:

* Three 12v server fans in series running at 24v to up the speed.
* Computer PSU to run the fans, I can add fans to hearts content.
* Water bottles to form rudimentary pipe around fans.
* Duct tape (prototypers dream utility).
* 15mm hosepipe (three pipes combined) of 5 meter lengths (This morning cut down to 1.5meters.)
* Single sided sealing tape (for plugging the gap with the freezer door slightly ajar to accomodate the 15mm pipe.
* 5Litre plastic ice cream container.
* CPU Heatsink to serve as rudimentary condenser.

*Air temperature*: High of 32celsius to a low of 28celsius at 10pm

With the long pipes coiled down the inside of the freezer any condensation would group in the low ends of each coil and then freeze and not run into the 5liter ice-cream container that I put in the bottom. Even when I thawed them out I collected less than 25ml water.

This morning I cut the pipes down to 1.5m each, allowing them to run straight down the inside of the freezer and drip straight into the ice cream tin.

Today I collected less than 70ml, even when I added a condenser (the CPU heatsink). Truth is that by the time the air hits the condenser it is cooled down, so water drips down the pipes into the ice-cream container.

Now I have read online that this type of system are able to collect 30liters of water in about 12 hours, but I am more than 24 hours in and have basically nothing to show. Frankly I suspect that a good part of the water I have collected is from melting ice in the freezer.

Do any of you have suggestions? Here are my thoughts:

* The rubber hosepipe is not optimal. Well I know it isn't but the air coming out the bottom is ice cold, so the air gets cooled effectively.
* I need to up my airflow. I know the three hosepipes are restricting my airflow, but I expected at least _something_ of a result.

What I plan to do is to buy a second hand chest freezer and then drilling a 100mil hole in it for proper sized pipe from my fans. The server fans I have are 80mm so 100mm is about what I will need.

I could put the fans on the roof of the house to get sun and heat the air before it reaches the freezer, I'll have to tie it down against the wind though.

I don't believe heating the air would increase my collection since I am not compressing it nor adding moisture, I am assuming the effectiveness won't really be that much better, the dew point will rise a few degrees and that's it.

When we hit day zero and the taps are shut down (slated for end Feb 2018) each household will be allocated 25liters drinking water per day, my aim is to make at least as much every 20hours with a setup like described above.

[Edit for better formatting]

[EDIT TO ADD]

My fans according to specification moves about 50cubic meters of air per hour when unrestricted. I am definitely not getting anywhere near that.

Given the humidity and temperature I have at best case (78% humidity at 30celcius) the following:

* 54m^^3 h
* 61kg air per hour
* 21grams of moisture per KG

I should then get 0.021kg x 61kg == 1.2liters per hour, I get less than one ml per hour.

I wonder if upping the air throughput won't drastically increase my return.

I am going to remove the hosepipes and then see if I can get more air in the frigde without resorting to drilling a hole in it, thus upsetting my wife...",AskEngineers,quintinza,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7rs0ge/struggling_with_condensing_water_from_atmosphere/

62,"I am useless, depressed and I am thinking about taking a gap year ?",1516455334,"Hello
I hope you are all fine :)
I came here for some advice 
I am a 21 years old second year computer science student - I will be 25 when I graduate - and I am thinking of taking a gap year during university to solve some of my
problems that made me depressed to a scary point that it effected my life  a lot
so here's my backgrounf story :
I used to be a good student in school and I was always told that school is the best way to secure a good life so I counted on that and never bothered to learn ||
anything in the summer or on my free time to get some money , and years passed on to the point when I finished high school when I figured I made a huge mistake doing 
that, and not just that , I also found out I don't know a lot of the basic stuff like driving that I don't now a thing about it , so here I am with no skills or 
anything that can make me some money
Maybe some of you find this a bit absurd or not a problem at all but it made a big problem to me , I  am just sick of this situation where I see my mom that I can give
her what she gave and feel useless to her.
This is why I choose to take a gap year during university to figure my life out , learn some stuff to make money on the side while learning all about some programming 
field - web development for exemple - to freelance 
I have a huge list of things to do that I really want to do but the university time is holding me and it's making things worse since the things we learn are old and 
not worth the time at all
That is my solution but I have my concerns about it because if  I take a year off then I will be 26 when I graduate and it feels to late to start, with some other 
things to consider 

what I want to ask is :
What is your opinion on my take ? 
have ever been in my situation and did the same how did it turn out ?

PS : the university is free in my country .

63,Graduate engineering performance reviews and negotiations etiquette. I'd really appreciate some advice.,1516454051,"Hi,

Last June I took a job as a Design Engineer at a mechanical engineering company. They were initially looking for someone with 2-3 years experience and the salary reflected that however as I was a graduate I accepted an offer slightly below the lower end of the original advert. Note: still a solid graduate salary and benefits. 

In 3 months I have a yearly performance review and in the last 3-4 months I've been feeling underpaid/valued. Across all of the engineers my quantifiable output is one of the highest, I have one of the more broad skill sets and I'm regularly getting pulled into senior projects to assist over other engineers and I consistently get praise from other departments about my work ethic, efficiency and general attitude over the rest of the engineering team who seem to be more complacent and less driven, always having excuses to get out of extra work and business trips etc. The frustrating part is that I'm by far the lowest paid of all the technical team, regardless of my higher output/drive/enthusiasm. 

I'm wondering what the etiquette with asking for a raise is, money always seems like a taboo subject. My feeling is that I will ask and will get shot down fairly abruptly. My plan is to potentially start to look for new work at 12-18 months into this job as it's a very niche engineering sector and I would like some broader experience, but I do enjoy the job and people I work with so would definitely stay but only if I get paid what I'm worth.

I've had some observations but I don't know if these are always true. Are the following generalizations correct?:

1. For simply supported beams, maximum positive moment always occurs when centerline (CL) is between the **maximum load** and the resultant, regardless of the number of loads passing through the beam and the order of loads.

2. For simply supported beams, maximum shear occurs when maximum load is at the support, regardless of the number of loads passing through the beam and the order of loads.

3. For simply supported beams with overhang on one side, maximum positive moment occurs when **all** loads are inside the supported span and what generalization #1 states.

4. For simply supported beams with overhang on one side, maximum negative moment occurs when **all except the greater load at the end** is at the edge of the overhang. 

I have noted these to save time during exams. I don't want to always try finding the maximum moment of each load at different locations. Thank you!

0,"Request For Opinion On WikiHow Article On ""How To Make Your Own Gasoline""",1516361632,"Hi.

There's an article on WikiHow that instructs you on how to build an apparatus that produces synthetic gasoline using gasification and the Fischer Tropsch process. I've known about this article for about a decade, give or take; but it wasn't until very recently that it included visual aids (pictures). Here is a link to the article: https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Own-Gasoline

While I know that gasification and the Fischer Tropsch process have been used to produce synthetic fuel since before the second world war; I'm not certain if anyone has ever built a successful working apparatus exactly as described on WikiHow.

If this apparatus does in-fact work, I'd love to have one built for demonstration; but I'm not an engineer and I would thus like a professional opinion.

So, if any of you qualified engineers (e.g. chemical engineers, mechanical engineers) have some free time, could you look over the WikiHow article in detail and give me your honest opinion on whether the apparatus will work or not?

Note that I'm not too worried about the economics of producing synthetic gasoline with a machine like this; I'm just concerned as to whether it would work or not.",AskEngineers,sparky77734,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7rhqhe/request_for_opinion_on_wikihow_article_on_how_to/

2,How to succeed in image processing contract role?,1516351536,"I've been working on image processing for several months as a contractor. I have minimal work experience, but I have an advanced degree so maybe that's why I got hired for the R&amp;D team. I like the job because it is challenging, I am constantly busy, and I get to work from home. 

I am just concerned by some things. I originally had a phone interview for this company a few months before I actually started. Then out of the blue, while I was living abroad, I got an email about this contractor opportunity. After some discussion, they decided to hire me despite not having an on-site interview

Another concern is that I've gotten less training/hand-holding than I expected. Although I have math background with programming experience, I had nearly zero knowledge of image processing before I was hired. I've been expected to learn most of what I need for the job on my own. I mostly only collaborate with my boss through emails and Skype, as the other team members work on other projects

This has been somewhat of a problem. For example, for one of my latest tasks, I tried coming up with my own code to solve it. I spent lots of time googling and such, but couldn't find a clear solution to it. It seems that either manager didn't know how to solve it either or he just wanted to see how well I can work independently. I finally was able to solve it after posting a question about it on Stack Overflow, as it turned out there were a few simple Matlab commands that could handle it

Is this a concern? Is this not the right role for me and I shouldn't count on being given a full-time offer afterwards?

4,Recent ME grad job advice?,1516348298,"Hello engineers,  

I am a recently graduated engineer with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from an ABET accredited University here in California. I've started my job search for a mechanical engineer position right after Christmas and have applied to various positions with 'mechanical engineer', 'engineering technician', 'CAD drafter' as the position titles on a assortment of the applications. However I have only heard back from the engineering technician and CAD drafter positions. And I may have a position lined up with the title of 'Mechanical Lab Testing Technician'. 

I am aware of the stigma of starting as a Technician in the Engineering world but I want to get my foot in the door of the industry and was wondering if this is a good start. 

What leads me to this technician role and discouraged to finding an ""Engineer"" title position is the fact that I have no internships/Co-op experience. On the other hand I have a semester (~6 months) worth of experience working as a Student Machinist at my schools machine shop and another semester (~6 months) as a Student advisor for a major wine manufacturer in California for my senior capstone project. I have bills to pay but I don’t want to sell myself short for what I am worth with a degree. With that said, I’m not sure if I should take this role on or just to keep looking. 

Cheers

Edit 1: Side note, I’m also open to finding new positions maybe after a year if I were to take the technician position.

5,Can anyone recommend good programs for a second degree (Masters or 2nd Bachelors) in Engineering? Specifically for an attorney looking to get licensed by the US Patent Bar.,1516342841,"TLDR 1: **Looking to get a second bachelor's in Engineering so I can take the Patent Bar.**

-------

Hi all, and thanks for taking the time to read. I know a few people have posted about second careers, but this path is a little uncommon. Of the patent attorneys I know, most got their undergraduate degree in an engineering field, then went to law school. I got a liberal arts degree, went to law school, learned about patent law, and decided I want to be a patent attorney.

To be a patent attorney in the US, you need a  ***Bachelor's Degree in a Recognized Technical Subject.*** ([List of subjects here, page 4.](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/OED_GRB.pdf)) Suffice to say, liberal arts is not one of them.

There are other avenues. Category B: Bachelors in another field plus 24+ semester hours of physics, etc.; and Category C: Practical experience. (I have none.)

I think it would benefit me most to go with Category A--a second bachelor's in a field of engineering.

------

TLDR 2: **Ideally Electrical Engineering, Local to Silicon Valley Area or Online Program**

------

My ultimate goal is to become a member of the patent bar. I find Electrical and Computer Engineering most appealing, and they seem to have the most opportunities in my field. The firm I work for focuses mostly on cloud technology and cybersecurity. But they do a little bit of everything.

I would consider another field like mechanical or generalized if it otherwise fits the bill.

A few limitations:

* I'm recently out of law school but older, married, and working, so going back to campus full time isn't really an option, at least not for an extended period. Community college in the evening and online would be best.
* I live and work just north of Palo Alto, CA. I can only do online or local, not looking to apply to Northwestern or anything.
* Costs: I'd like to keep them to a minimum, but I graduated with relatively little debt so it isn't a huge issue.
* Obviously the degree has to be from an accredited institution. I trust you guys know more about that than I do.

-----

Thanks for any help you can offer. Sorry if I sound like I'm talking out of my ass, I know engineering is a huge commitment. This has been a goal of mine for a long time and I really want to get going, but I don't see a clear path ahead, and any advice is appreciated.",AskEngineers,NeedYourAdvice989,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7rgfkt/can_anyone_recommend_good_programs_for_a_second/

13,New Refrigeration Cycle patent pending. Is it worth investing time and money to make a functioning prototype? More info inside.,1516310080,"**Brief Description**

I am a Millwright with experience in refrigeration. I have been over the years creating a new refrigeration system with the end goal of reducing as much complexity and moving parts as possible. I am finally was happy with my design after a review with some people I trust... So I did a professional patent search and found nothing. I did a utility patent (The cheapest) filing.

**The patent**

It's a refrigerant cycle that only moving part is a spring loaded check valve and flowing fluid. Exception to get it started it'll use a low quality vane pump. This pump will only need to run around 20 seconds to start the refrigeration cycle going.... and once going it is no longer needed. (Unless it needs to be restarted)

The only thing it needs to keep going is a heating elements. The nature of the design will allow to make use of almost 90%+ of the thermal energy (Depends on how good of piping insulation) to do work.

It is a tiny design using parts easily accessible today. All the parts used are extremely durable and cheap. It will not need a expansion valve nor a compressor. (Exception to starting the cycle)

 - Basically no moving parts

 - Practically requires no maintenance

 - Can be scaled up indefinitely

 - Efficient  

**The Issue**

I have low funding currently, and I am skeptical how willing companies are willing to jump at the opportunity regarding consumer grade fridges. Because they're already pretty efficient due to modern insulation. I don't know if they're willing to even take a look at the design because of the fact they already have got manufacturers to make what currently out...cheap.

I would've made that prototype out of my own pocket for nothing if they don't want to change.

Then I look at refrigeration applications in a industrial setting.... that's where it'll shine better.... the design I have is actually more reliable and efficient as you scale it up. However I don't know if they will care.... it's efficient but again it's different.... Why fix something that isn't broke?

It seems like in both instances there would be no reason to switch to a new design. I would be wasting money on a prototype. What I am asking is do you think industries need this right now? Why?

**Notes**

I have a working simulation of the design. With all the correct information for the fluids used. It appears it should work in real life as well.

Only minor modification is required for one piece of equipment for this patent. 

Sorry for being vague. It's still pretty early in the patent process lol.

Edit - I guess in theory this design could be used to run a generator if you had a heating source (Geo?). Provided you made slight modifications.

Edit - I have been taught in school and worked on the refrigeration cycle and I have worked on all the equipment in the past that is being used in this design.

**Important Edit** 

The reason I asked here and not investing is because I am not asking for financial help and such. I am asking if companies would be willing to pay for this design based of what I said. And why...

14,How much can I ask from a startup as a freshly minted PhD?

It seems to me that this figure includes a lot of people who are not working exactly on their research topic. The value seems to be being ""PhD smart"" rather than specific technical knowledge.

I think that with the knowledge I would bring in, and the responsibilities I would have to take, I could go ~25% than ""marker price"". Does 50k€/year seems reasonable? It doesn't sound outrageous but on the other hand I only have 3 years of experience in the domain.

21,"Is there a ""rechargeable"" way to absorb gaseous oxygen from a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen?",1516263125,"I'm looking at some options for controlling the ratio of a hydrogen oxygen mix from an electrolysis cell. One option is of course to never mix the gasses in the first place, but it carries some challenges in my case. What I wanted to investigate is whether one could instead just remove the gasses from the stream instead.

I know hydrogen can be easily removed from the mix through use of a catalytic converter, with only water as the byproduct, which can be easily removed with dessicant.

I also know oxygen can be removed with so called oxygen scavengers, of which there are a few different types. For what I'm doing to be practical though, it can't be a single use thing. I could use iron powder to absorb the oxygen, but I assume I would have to have a steady supply of iron powder then, since as far as I know, the iron oxide won't let itself be turned back into iron in any way other than smelting with catalysts etc at which point it would need to be ground back into a powder again, which isn't very practical.

Are there oxygen scavengers/absorbers that can be easily recharged? I'm thinking like dessicants like calcium chloride which you just heat up to drive out the moisture, and it's good to go again.

It would need to absorb quite a lot of oxygen, say a few liters in some minutes time maybe, so I'm not talking about trace amounts. Also, it'd have to happen at a low enough temperature to not ignite the hydrogen as well. Is this achievable with reasonable effort? What I'm looking to do is control the ratio of hydrogen and oxygen for welding/heating/combustion uses.

Unfortunately, bosses don't have a lot of patience with mistakes and I fear I am not good enough to continue as an intern. I frequently think of telling them I will step away and allow them to hire someone with more experience and skill.

I find that I don't struggle a whole lot with the design of the part itself, but mostly with assemblies and drawings. How do I know what is needed in a part or assembly drawing and what isn't ? (Other than the obvious dimensions). How can I become a faster and more efficient designer and drafter?
Unfortunately, my initial design course did not cover as much as I would have hoped and now I am struggling because of it.

So my question is, how did you become good at what you do? Did you learn the basics in school and then learn how to draft on the job? How can I deal with impatient engineers at a small company that are pressuring me consistently to complete designs?? I am the only intern at this company of 3 engineers and have difficulty keeping up with the amount of engineering work I am being given. This is my first internship and it is NOT a friendly learning environment. I am struggling, losing confidence, and tired of making mistakes because of things I simply haven't learned.

I am trying my hardest, but people have suggested changing majors because I am having difficulty functioning day to day.

33,Flowmeter affecting other airflow outlets?,1516230507,"This is a followup to another thread I posted. For air passing through a tube as the one shown below, if a flowmeter was mounted to measure the CFM at one port, would this measurement inaccurately measure the regular flow? Intuitively it seems like if you held a flow meter up to only one port for a measurement, this outlet would have greater resistance than the other ports and the air would just travel to the other 2 outlets.

37,Radiant vs Conductive vs Convective Energy. Is one of these worse than the other for heat exchangers?,1516218690,"We've got a big heat exchanger with stainless steel plates in it right now. We've got a burner firing from below at the heat exchanger plates (not touching the plates). The heat exchanger plates have a direct line of sight to the flame of the burner so they receive both convective heat transfer from the hot gasses and radiant energy transfer from the infrared radiation coming off the flame.

We've been told by our supplier that we now need to install a reflector plate between the flame and the heat exchanger because the radiant heat energy apparently damages the stainless steel plates.

Now the way I see it, heat exchange is like travelling from point A to point B. Point A is the temperature of your heat source and point B is the temperature of the heat exchanger plates. How you get from point A to point B doesn't matter because it all manifests itself as temperature in the end. 

We've got a thermocouple right below the ehat exchanger with a direct line of site to the flame as well. We run the system so the thermocouple doesn't reach a temperature above 1300 deg F. The way I see it, as long as the thermocouple stays at a safe temperature, the heat exchanger will too. It makes no difference if there's radiant energy being absorbed or not because only temperature matters. The only way I see radiative energy damaging stainless steel if the temperature is still safe is if it somehow turned into gamma radiation and started to actually radiate and degrade the stainless. The last time I checked, gas fired burners don't emit gamma radiation.

42,Is Manufacturing Engineering/Management really this stressful?,1516203496,"Throwaway because my job is clearly known on my main account. 

**TL;DR**:

Small company means multiple jobs (most not relating to engineering in the slightest) managed by people who know nothing and do even less and are paid EVEN less. This stresses me out to no end, and I have had enough. But, I want to make sure this isn't a ""grass is greener"" situation and all management positions are like this at other manufacturing companies and I would just be better off not being a manager.

So, should I look elsewhere or is this par for the course?

Also, Father in law owns the company. 


**Full Explanation**:

Background, I work at a small manufacturing facility of around 60 employees. I started hear about 3 years ago in a management position. Since then the job has developed into one of the most stressful single entities in my life. It has seeped into my private life, is affecting my marriage, has me depressed and miserable to be around and I can't seem to stop thinking about all of the issues and problems I am tasked with ""solving"". Since it is a small company, everyone has multiple duties and jobs but one issue with this is that I have no clear long term task or goals. Just the usual goals of any company (more parts for cheaper, faster). Many problems I face daily are ones I have no clear control over. 

For example, the training for employees is comically bad and results in new people making massive, costly mistakes on a regular basis until they learn. This is made worse by the fact that we are so busy and are working so much overtime (and paying so much less than the mega-corps nearby) that our turnover is sky high. This place is a revolving door. Now, I can't change the training because that's not my area and the manager in that area does nearly nothing. In fact, they are caught sleeping on the job almost daily. He says its meds. I say he a fat fuck that isn't doing anything. Whatever, tomato/tomahto.

This *does* affect me because I have to clean things up/try to engineer a solution to prevent this from ever happening again. Now, many solutions would be totally eliminated with proper training and lean. Oh, lean. Right. Everyone at this company is geriatric and so far behind the times they think their DOT matrix printer is ""modern"". Yes, really. And LEAN/5S/Six SIGMA? They don't think it works. At all, and wont even *try* to implement it. I worked with Boeing in college and was *astounded* by their 787 facility. Lean works. Clearly. Yet, here I am. And when I try to do things like suggest hiring a new HR manager, they don't because he is getting paid shit compared to what a real HR manager gets paid. 

This stresses me out to no end because I feel like everything I try to do to help means nothing. It frustrates the other managers (who are all stressed out) and that stress trickles down to the team leaders (who are all stressed out) who then trickled their frustrations down to the operators (who leave after a few weeks). But, I can't imagine why that would be the case. Anyway, my management philosophy is that upper management should do everything in it power (within costs/reason) to make the operators life and job as simple and painless as possible because that's how you get parts faster. Not packed with stress and frustrated that ""no one in upper management gives a shit"" and then they leave. I have been told by multiple long term operators and team leaders that I *have* made a difference and that I do help, and listen. But if I have, I honestly can not tell. 

Our machines are nearly 25 years old, and are constantly breaking down and I have no budget to repair or replace them, our scheduler has no concept of lead times or what it takes to make our products and then agrees (without VP approval) to ship thousands of a cable that week (a cable which takes anywhere between 2-6 weeks lead time) but we won't replace him because he is paid so much less than a normal logistics analyst that WOULD know these things. We won't stock our products that sell in high numbers and get pushed in on the schedule because apparently we would lose profit because they would sit (this proves, no one in this company understands profit, loss, or anything to do with simple economics and my attempts at stocking finished products has been resoundingly denied by F.I.L/VP/Accounting/literally the whole company so WHEN we get ""bomb-in's"" we yell and scream and stress out and do. nothing. IDK, maybe I am missing something but I see no reason we can't stock high selling products and ship when they need) Then they come to me asking me to make their process more efficient, then we get into a fight because I explain that Toyota developed an amazing process just for things like this! And they don't do it.  

But those aren't the only major issues. We have no 401K, the worst medical insurance money can buy (I looked), and pay our employees (including me) below market average. *Painfully* below what they are worth. For example, take me. My first job out of college was a systems engineer with the US dept. of Energy (I am a Mech. E, Btw). I was paid 67K per year, had great 401K and medical, and had a stress free job that I was quite happy at. A bit bored, but happy. When I moved to this job I was told (told, no email or written proof) that I would start at 60 and move to my original 67K in one year. But that was a down year and I took a 10% pay cut for ~10 months and was told the 10% bump was a raise and after another year I would get the bump. After another year, no raise. I was passed up because the labor rates were ""way too high already, and once they find a way to lower them, I'll get my raise"". WHAT?!? How does that affect ME?? Tell me I am shit at my job and need to work harder for a raise, that I would believe but passing me up because labor costs already being to high?? I was astounded and since then see no reason why I should not leave for a better job before my brain turns to mush. 

Well, except for one problem. My father in law owns the company. But lives 1200 miles away (for better weather) and leaves the management to a VP/Production Manager who is a raging asshole and uses fear and anger to scare people into ~~leaving~~ doing what he wants. I have been told that I will take over his job as production manager ""soon, after he retires"" but I am not sure I want it. I already can hardly sleep, I can't imagine what stresspot I would be if I were in his spot. Actually, I would probably be a raging asshole and use fear and anger to get people to do what I want....hold on a sec...

Anyway, I am posting this looking for help, or advice. Do I leave (as politely and friendly as possible, because this is family after all and the company will still be in my life one way or another) or do I suck it up and stay? Knowing I will be passed up for raises and will inherit this travesty of a company once my boss retires and father in law gives it to my wife?

53,Moving position from ME 2 to ME 3. How should I negotiate salary?,1516149508,"Hey all,
  
I've been with this company two years and six months as an intern. I had a stellar review my first year, coupled with a company average raise of only 2.8%. I'm high on the bell curve of salaries for ME 2 in my area, and we're going into another year of good performance from me.  
  
I've confirmed with my manager that I'm getting ME 3, but there's been indications that people see it more as a correction of title to suit my abilities than a raise-triggering promotion.  

Nobody's invaluable to a company, but I do have several skill sets that none of the other MEs have. These skills, along with my attitude, have been mentioned as being exactly the way they want the company to head. I know the salary of one of the principle engineers, and I know they have room to grow for me. It's a huge ways away for me, but I know the salary I'd like to be at is doable. I'm not overshooting our principle or anything.

My basic questions are:

* What is a common percentage bump in salary between title grades in engineering? I know there are a million variables that go into it. Should I compare median salaries of the two titles? That seems like bad math, as ME 3 likely covers a larger number of years than ME 2, so the median would skew high due to yearly raises and wouldn't reflect the data I want to capture. How can I find a percentage that's fair to my employer and me?  
  
* Am I right to go into this aggressively? We're short staffed as it is, and I work hard and that hard work is noticed and commented on by everyone I work with. It feels like my first year salary bump didn't reflect the review I received. 

*  What's a good way to approach it and properly phrase, ""You've said I'm invaluable to the company. Show me that in terms of compensation.""? 

I've updated my resume and had several bites just from Linked In and friends' referrals. I haven't taken any interviews because I'm very content with my day-to-day and my manager and director. I know I'm competitive in the marketplace though.

65,Digital forensic examiner / programmer / all around tech guy looking to change careers to electrical engineer. School questions (second bachelor's?) [X-post from /r/engineeringstudents],1516120928,"Hi /r/AskEngineers.  I posted this yesterday on /r/EngineeringStudents but didn't receive any responses so I was probably asking in the wrong place.  I hope this is an appropriate set of questions for you all.  I see that ""asking which undergraduate major to pick"" is a banned question here but hopefully my specific situation (nontraditional student / possible second bachelor's pursuer / overall confused weirdo) makes it different enough.  If not, sorry.

Anyway...

I'm a lifelong tech guy (29/M now) who has a bit of a varied background and I'm realizing that electrical engineering is where my heart is academically. I've been programming and tinkering since the fourth grade, and have worked as a digital forensic examiner and expert witness (usually private sector / corporate cases) in that area for the past seven years.

I've been realizing how much I would like to work in electrical engineering for a while now. My dream job (aside from being discovered as the next major worldwide pop sensation) would be applying an electrical engineering background with emerging prosthetic limb technology. I'm a big art person (sculpting, painting, music) and have always seen prosthetics as a fusion of art and science while making people's lives better, so it just hits all those buttons for me. I've considered biomechanical engineering as well, but EE just seems more broadly applicable.

My problem is that my bachelor's degree is in psychology, which I only obtained because after high school I didn't know what to do with myself and I had an offer of a full-tuition academic scholarship for a psych program, literally $0 out of pocket for a bachelor's degree. That was pretty difficult to pass up, so I did that while running a computer business, got a bunch of tech certifications that opened the door to my current forensic position, and the rest is history.

Right now, I don't know the first thing about where I should begin. I was blissfully unaware of any of the student loan process for my first bachelor's degree, but apparently I'm not elligible for any government grants, etc, because I'd be pursuing a second bachelor's degree. I also lost both of my parents recently so I don't have any financial (or emotional and/or mental) cushion to fall back on, or anybody to ask for advice on it since I really don't have any other family. Frankly I don't have much money, so I'd likely have to take student loans, but I don't know the first thing about them. Hence me turning to the wonderful world of the internet.

So, I guess a summary of my questions:

1.  What is the typical educational requirement to be ""an electrical engineer?"" Is it a bachelor's degree, a master's, or a PhD? What should I set my sights on?

2.  In terms of obtaining a second bachelor's degree given my circumstances, are there any scholarships, grants, or any other things of that nature that anybody has experience with / recommendations to alleviate the financial strain? Or just take student loans?

3.  Is this a field that a ""nontraditional student"" can still thrive in academically?

72,"I'm Offered an Internship as a Senior, The Pay Is Lower Than My Junior Year. Might Not Make Enough Money to Graduate. Is It Appropriate To Negotiate?",1516089585,"Sorry if the situation is confusing. I'm a senior in ME, our school has a program where we go on two 6-month internships during junior and senior year. I went to a company last year and got paid 22$/hr. This year's company just sent me the job offer letter and stated that my pay will be 20$/hr. Ordinarily I'd tell anyone in my position to just be grateful that they got a job. However, my circumstances are a bit different because of financial difficulties. I'm an international student which means no FAFSA, no real job during the school year, not a whole lot of scholarships etc. I make about 500-600$ a month as a research assistant and TA which is pennies compared to the $11,000 average I'm paying each term. I have decent grades (3.69/4.0) but have had zero luck with scholarships. My family has been my primary source for paying tuition but they're broke, in debt and can't support me for much longer. I have 6 classes left including my capstone classes, split into 2 terms which I will attend after the internship. My financial situation has always been a much, much bigger source of stress than school. At this point I'm pretty desperate. If they pay me 25$/hr I might have a chance to pay off the remaining terms by myself. But 20$/hr is not only too little, but also sort of a punch in the face -- I'm confident that I knowledgeable enough to be qualified for the job and be a valuable asset to the company, on top of having had experience in both real-world practice and research, but all of a sudden I'm getting a downgrade. And that's where my question comes in -- is it appropriate for me to ask them to raise my starting wages before I even start the hiring paperwork? The internship is set to start early April. 

**TL;DR:**





**Internship pay dropped as I went into senior year. I need the money. Can I ask for a raise before starting the job?**


**Bonus rant &amp; question**

While I bust my bottom teaching sophomore classes &amp; doing research for 10$/hr and desperately looking for scholarships, my peers who keep partying, complaining about not being interested in engineering and getting C's and B's are being offered part-time jobs during the school year and getting scholarships from their companies. They're either rich foreigners or domestic students who never will have to worry about running out of either their own or their family's money. I still have to learn what kind of mentality/opinion/view I have to adapt to not stress about this, because I'm feeling like I'm doing something wrong. I work hard for school and have always wanted to be an engineer. What am I doing wrong though? I've had no luck with scholarships, nor do I know where to look for them. I stopped trusting the internet for ""scholarships"" a while ago...most of the school's funds either go to grad students or domestic students. Maybe I'll have better luck this year (fingers crossed). Please do share your thoughts, I am never going to give up but could really use some advice so I don't self-destruct. Thank you for reading.

82,[Career Advice] Energy Efficiency Engineer Pathway,1516054676,"Hi there, 

I'm a 26 years old energy engineer, working in the energy efficiency/HVAC audit field for around 4 years + 2-3 years in internship exp. I still consider my a junior engineer, and have questions about 1) career path and 2) what skills to develop on. 


**My Background:**  
**Internships:**I started working out as interns in a county facilities management. Basically, as an intern, they let me look around at Building Automation System system trends, self-teaching myself some eQuest, and work with facilities technician to look at electrical panels. I became more interested in building energy usage and started working at another internship at a lab, looking at their energy usage and comes up with Energy Efficiency Measures (EEM) that are low cost and can be done in house. I have a B.S. in Environmental Engineering from a research university, but my school's curriculum is like mechanical engineering but focused on fluid dynamics. I didn't have much exposure to the traditional environmental engineering stuff or the HVAC engineering while I was in school (mostly theory principles, no application or practical courses). So most of the stuff I need to do my job is self-taught or learned on the job. 

**After Graduation** Anyway, after graduation, I got a job in a HVAC design firm, but under their energy group doing Recommissioning, Facilities Conditions Assessment, and Energy Audits for existing buildings. I learned along the way how do bin calcs and a lot of the HVAC controls system details. 

Stayed with them for a year before moving on to a consultant company, where I am mostly doing energy modeling for new buildings. There are a few occasions where I get to do some energy audit (ASHRAE level 1 stuff). Because it is a consultancy company, I work on a lot of different projects, including thermal comfort studies, natural ventilation studies, and reviewing whether a new building has better savings than code. My main role has becoming an energy modeler. My current company is pretty supportive of personal career development. I have considered grad school (i guess this is for the piece of paper or accreditation), taking a coding bootcamp (enhancing desirable skills), and/or just continue develop in my current role + some relationship building with customers.  

Technical-wise, I am more confident in my knowledge and skills, but obviously I had have struggle with this since I made a lot of mistakes learning mostly on the job. 

Soft-skills wise, I am on the shy introvert side. Ok communication in general. I can be long-winded. Sometimes people don't understand me very well. Overall, i'm more of a fly on the wall during conferences call even though I know I can answer some questions (just hard to chime in for me). 


**Questions:**

1) Because I had never have a design engineer role, I feel less competent on energy audit jobs. Someone mentioned ""you can't really do audit well if you haven't done design"". I like doing audit because I get me out of my desk and visit new buildings are fun. In my current company, to do this work, I need to step up and am not sure if I would have a senior technical person to carry the responsibility for. Do you think being a design engineer for a period of time is critical to become a senior energy engineer? How do I convince my boss to put me on audit jobs and develop these skills more if my main role has becoming more of an energy modeler? 

2) What areas should I focus on? 1) Getting a master? 2) Getting more useful skills like coding? 3) Building customer relationships. Work on soft skills stuff? 

3) I have struggle with customer service skill sets and creating / building healthy relationship. Do you have any advice on how to build this? Most of my clients are architects and energy program managers who need like feasibility studies, audits, energy models for code, or energy models for early design. 

4) Is getting a master useful? or even a MBA? or coding camp? My company would cover 75% of the tuition in exchange for staying with company for 2 years after. I want to take advantage of this, but lack a strong motivation whether this would be a good investment of time. 

I guess in general, I'm trying to formulate my short term goals. Frankly, energy efficiency is becoming harder since the low hanging fruits are integrated in the state's requirements more and more. Ultimately, I'd like to become a technical expert before being part of an energy management team for a large entity or corporate. Usually, corporate has industrial facilities, therefore I thought further energy auditing skills would be useful here. I just have a hard time committing what I should focus on improving at a time and increasing my value. 

Thank you. Appreciate your advice in advance.

95,Best method to prevent heat transfer between two parts?,1515994523,"So we have two parts. 

Part 1: 430 stainless steel, 0.80mm (0.030 inch) thick, that heats up to 110 Celsius (230 F).
Part 2: ABS mold injected plastic

Our goal is to mount the stainless steel part on top of the ABS mold injected part. The issue here is that when the stainless steel part heats up, it will transfer the heat to the ABS part and therefore melt it and cause it to collapse, fire,... you get the picture. The heat would transfer via the mounting screws/assembly.

What's the best solution to prevent heat transfer here? This is a heated bed for a 3D printer. The goal is to mount it 3-5mm off the ABS part. The space itself will be enough to prevent heat transfer, but the mounting screws/spacers will transfer heat and melt the plastic.

Since then, I have been employed by a construction company in their nuclear division working as part of a Project Management team. The construction company is contracted to the provincial government who operates nuclear power plants near the Toronto area.

Over the course of the past year, I have learned a lot about the nuclear industry and worked on a variety of projects. I feel that this experience has been useful and my current role has been a great way to start my career. However, this is not what I envisioned myself to be doing long-term.

I don't have much experience in the solar industry except for my thesis project which focused on a monitoring system for solar panels, even then that's not much. While working in the nuclear industry it has become very obvious that while I live in the Toronto area, no alternative form of energy will be considered viable as the provincial government is spending billions on these nuclear power plants.


So I'm looking to switch into the solar industry and work elsewhere while doing so (due to personal reasons, California would be preferred but I'm open to anywhere).

5,Sagging in the center of an exterior wall?,1515963528,"So, my kitchen is a big almost-square - 15'x16', and juts off the back of my house. So three of the walls are exterior. It sits over a crawl space, so there's actually foundation walls under all four sides.

The two walls to either side of the kitchen (perpendicular to where it attaches to the house, and also perpendicular to the floor joists) have a sag in the middle - approx. 7' from the corner is the low point. 

I'm not even sure what could cause this. I can't actually get a good view into the crawl space from the basement, but it doesn't look like the foundation wall beneath the sag is caving in, so I was thinking maybe an issue with the ground settling underneath it or something. I can see the foundation from the exterior on one of the two parallel walls that has a sag, and it appears to be level (at least to the eye, which the sag is noticeable by). The sag doesn't transfer to the room above, causing a dip in the floor there too.

So does anyone have any idea what *could* cause it? I completely understand that I won't know for sure unless I have a structural engineer come out and assess the situation, but I like to be prepared with ideas before getting the final judgement.

Thanks for any help! If it's relevant - house was built in 1859 and has a field stone foundation.

11,Steamy bathroom to minimise dust (e.g. screen protector installation) - wait until water vapour dispersed or not?,1515932139,"Hello, my first question here so hope this is OK. This is more if an ""everyday engineering"" question, rather than something engineers may have to deal with in a job. Let me know if this should be in /r/AskScience instead. Anyway, here goes:

When installing screen protectors onto mobile devices, it is important to not get dust between the screen and the protector, as dust will cause bubbles. Advice is often given to do the installation in the bathroom, after making it nice and steamy. The reason given is that the water vapour will make the dust heavy and cause it to drop to the floor.

My question is this: should you do the installation while the water vapour is still heavy in the air, or should you wait until the air is clear, i.e. when the air has cooled and the water vapour has dropped to the floor?

I've seen advice both ways and haven't managed to find a definitive answer.

The thing is, while the room is still steamy, is the dust still floating around in the air, even if the dust is now damp? In other words, does the dust fall to the floor as soon as it gets dampened with hot water vapour because it's heavy enough to do so, or would it continue to float around until the water vapour itself has cooled and dropped down?

Obviously I realise that the longer you leave it, the more likely that dust will enter the room, so you wouldn't want to wait too long anyway, but also advice I've read that you should get the room nice and steamy and do the installation straight away seems, to me, no better than doing it in a dusty room.

18,Am I Chasing A Unicorn? (Structural Engineering Job Hunt Question),1515909465,"Hi all,

I've had one job since college.  The position's official title is naval architect, but it's not really.  As far as design goes, I mainly design small metal foundations for various equipment that goes on naval warships.  It's a neat job.  I make models in AutoCAD 3D and analyze them for shock loads in our FEA software.  Sometimes I get to do hand calcs to prove a design's acceptability and it's awesome.

**I've been doing this job now for about 3 years.  I recently transferred to a different office (same job) and things are quite a bit different.**  I'm told this new office does about 90% installation drawing development.  I've been told that hand calcs are too inefficient and that they're effectively banned (save for a quick back of the envelope calc to get a general idea of a design starting point).  I was even told - joking, or maybe not - to take my engineering books home because ""you won't need them here.""  **Since I took this job a couple of months ago, I have done 100% AutoCAD drawing development.**  And I'm not happy doing this.

Let me just throw out here that I have the utmost respect for a good CAD technician.  I've seen some of the guys at my office chew through a 10 page drawing in a couple of days and it needs minimal corrections!  Very impressive.  But that's just not what I want to do every day.

**I've made the decision to switch jobs, but I'm not sure that what I want is even obtainable.**  Everything I read on these forums suggests that offices use RISA, FEA software, or some equivalent for everything.  I don't know if hand calcs are even done anymore.

**I kinda feel like everything I worked to learn in college is worthless because it can be done faster and easier by a computer.**

I'm not trying to find a job where I sit at my desk all day and ponder the minutiae detail of stresses in a complex shaped plate or something.  I know employers don't have time or money to pay me for that.  They want results.  But at the same time, I don't really see how an engineer is really *needed* to draw some boxes in RISA and pick beam sizes until they stop being colored red after you run the analysis.

I have a couple of job paths to choose from right now.  I mainly just don't want to end up sitting at my desk and hating my job again or feeling like everything I've learned is worthless in 3 years.  Maybe I'll try to switch over to project management or field engineering so I don't feel trapped in the office all day.

So, what do you think?   Am I chasing a unicorn here?  **Is there job where you actually get to apply engineering principles daily and use math to solve problems rather than just feeding inputs to software and analyzing results?**

* Bold comments are the TLDR/main points.
* Hand calcs here mean anything where you might use equations from the various college classes to solve a problem directly vs feeding inputs into a computer.  For example, using M/S to find bending stresses in a beam instead of drawing the beam in SkyCiv to just ""get the answer.""  Or maybe working on non-standard designs that aren't easily input into analysis software.
* I hope this doesn't sound condescending.  I reread this a couple of times and rewrote a few sentences just to avoid that.  I'm not trying to disparage anyone's career choice.  Everyone gets their satisfaction from different things.

34,Question about AC motor properties,1515855576,"Hello :)

I'm an electrical engineering student, and I have a subject where we focus on asynchronous and synchronous engines. I have a pretty decent understanding of how the motors work and all, but there is a part of the lecture that got me a little confused.

From what I remember from first three years of my education, low pass filters, in fact any filters are quadrapole systems (sorry if I'm using bad expressions here, I mean two inputs and two outputs as in +-) so this part of the lecture (mentioned below) got me a little confused.

We're talking about PWM and various ways to power a motor without it being directly connected to the power grid. (direct converters, indirect converters and all that)

Now for the quote: (sorry for any mistranslations)

- by increasing the number of pulses (of the converter) in the half period of the output voltage, we can significantly decrease, or even eliminate low level harmonics

- the machine itself, with its low-pass frequency characteristics filters high level harmonics

I tried doing a little research, and farthest I've got so far is a version of equivalent electrical scheme to AS motor shown in this [picture](http://prntscr.com/hzwj0u).

The problem is, the picture number 2 is (as far as I understood from the text) equivalent scheme of an engine with high magnetic reactance, and it's the one that reminds me of a low pass filter the most as we can simply add the reactances and it resembles a LP filter (without exit ports) pretty well, aside from the parallel at front. Picture number one doesn't seem as simple just to call it a low pass filter, maybe it is a more complex version I'm not familiar with.

Personally, it's really frustrating for me when we're given info without any backing or explanation. I try to memorize most of the content we learn by backing it up with something I learned previously, if possible, and I honestly feel ashamed and not deserving of my title when someone asks me something and I get lost in the middle realizing my theory is shitty on that part. I mean learning it just like it is isn't the problem, but two weeks after the test I'm simply going to forget it, I know that.
Most professors go into details, but this one in particular isn't the fan of the practice.

Anyway, this isn't the question for test or anything, I'm just genuinely interested, what makes a motor act as a low pass filter?

If the dimensions of the tube is 4"" x 4"" x 1/4"" thick x 12"" long, the math approach would be to take the outer volume [4"" x 4"" x 12""], then subtract the inner volume [3.5"" x 3.5"" x 12""], then multiply by the density of steel.

52,Question about a drone?,1515785108,"Hey everyone
I think I have an idea for drone that I pretty much know is wrong but can’t really understand why. Maybe you guys can help me out here.
 
So the basic design is have your standard quadcopter as is but to also place propellers that are like windmills under the main propellers. If you were to imagine that the main propellers used for thrust were positioned in a plane that is 180 degree position then these horizontal windmill style propellers would be perpendicular to them.  When the main propeller starts up some of the thrust generated could be used to move those propellers which would be connected to a motor to generate electricity effectivity charging the battery while in flight.

Just to clarify a bit more, I don’t plan on placing the windmill style directly under the main propeller as I understand that all if not most of the force generated would be impart on the propeller below and there would be no thrust and the drone won’t move upwards. Also the propellers would be fixated to only spin in one direction to ensure that they will always spin in the direction that will generate electricity. Other design considerations that I have noted is the increased payload, the difficulties in steering the drone and the battery overheating and slowly using capacity. Also I should note that I haven’t yet calculated how much power could be regenerated based on the thrust and propeller sizes and motors as I wanted to understand if this idea is possible from a fundamentals point of view.

I feel like the idea is violating some kind of energy principle that I can’t just seem to put my hand on. It is not meant to be a perpetual motion machine but the more I think about it the more it seems like it.

69,Upstream vs Downstream load on centrifugal pump,1515726054,"I've got a hobby project I'm working on.  It's a vegetable oil fueled burner consuming on the order of 3 gallons per hour.  To increase reliability of the system, I've added a 50 mesh tube filter to prevent small particles from clogging a 0.020in wide by 0.100 in diameter annular orifice.  To increase oil flow, I've added a centrifugal pump rated for 160 gph and a 10 foot head (rated for water).  Oil is flowing from a tank located about a foot above the pump.

The plumbing of the system flows from a tank out of a 3/8in I.D iron fitting, through a 90 degree elbow, into the filter which has a 1/2in ID inlet and outlet, then into the pump which uses 3/8in I.D vinyl tubing for the outlet which is what the pump is advertised to work with.  Not more than 5 feet of tube or pipe in the system.  

The pump is delivering much less oil than 160gph.  I know it will be substantially less due to the increased viscosity.  My question is whether or not the relative upstream or downstream position of the filter matters.  I have read that centrifugal pumps should only be throttled on the outlet side.

**POINTS**


 - A - It has the highest pressure of the 3, it will always maintain pressure. It's a (edit) gas/liquid tank

 - B - Slightly lower pressure than A, will always maintain pressure. Into a gas/liquid tank

 - C - The least pressure, however needs to monitor flow (A certain amount of fluid is removed at any given time) to control pressure. Hence the flow control control value. Into a gas/liquid tank

**QUESTIONS**

 - Question #1 - Would this in principle work provided a gas pressure valve automatically moved the flow control valve?

 - Question #2 - (Critical Question) While flow control valves are generally only for liquids.... would a flow control valve be able to handle a certain percentage of gas? (Like 20-50%) Are there flow control valves that are capable of that?

 - Question #3 - If this actually works. Will the pressure of each point affect the flow valve to perform its job? Providing that B + C is always lower than A.


**Notes And Edits**

If this fails, or I completely failed as explaining what I want. I'll reply and try to explain further what I am trying to achieve.

 - ignore how A or B is maintaining that pressure. It just is via separate system

One ""design"" that particularly interests me is the [""float belt"" design.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prepex2.svg) The physical problem is clear: pushing the float into the water at the bottom requires energy input. But aside from that I saw an obvious enignerring problem: *how the hell* would I make a valve that would allow the floats to pass into the bottom of the water tank?

11,What other industries can a Civil Engineer get into?,1515610609,"Hi everyone, thank you for taking the time to read this post. I come to you because I find myself at a crossroads, as I consider an alternative to Civil Engineering. I'd really appreciate your input on other industries that I could consider having the background that I describe below. Skip to the **[tl;dr]** if you get bored reading about my background.

While growing up, I was always the creative kid. I loved to draw, write stories about my favorite comic book heroes (The X-Men), play the piano, and design elaborate houses in The Sims. To this day, I find myself coming up with creative solutions to everyday problems. But since I lack the resources and work-space, I’ve never been able to bring any of them to fruition. Another thing I’ve always loved is cooking.

As I approached the end of my high school career, coming from a family that lacked any college graduates, I found myself lost when deciding on a career to pursue. I ultimately decided I was going to pursue culinary arts, being that it combined something I was passionate about and something I was good at. I took a year-long course in culinary arts which was leading me into a bachelor’s program at the Culinary Institute of America. I injured myself and couldn’t walk or work for 2 months. The prospect of losing my mobility and my job in the future, when I have a family to provide for, let me to decide against pursuing a career in culinary arts. I then enrolled in community college for liberal arts, then switched to engineering. 

The reason I went into civil engineering, despite not being technically inclined or particularly good with numbers, was because I incorrectly assumed it would be very similar to architecture. I struggled every semester, considered dropping out and pursuing another major, yet I kept passing my classes. My grades started out strong, but slowly declined as I went along. As I entered into my junior year of college and began taking civil engineering-specific classes, I was lost. I wasn’t passionate about any of the sub-disciplines, and I wasn’t firmly grasping any of the concepts. I figured this was temporary and I’d eventually land on something I liked after graduation, and I’d get good at it. For my senior capstone, I chose the Construction Management option. I knew it would be less technical and less math-intensive, more people oriented, and all of that appealed to me. I interviewed for a job late senior year, got hired on the spot, and started working two weeks after graduation.

I had this job lined up with a General Contractor as an Assistant Project Manager. While I found the job to be challenging and stimulating, there were extenuating circumstances which led me to leave that job 9 months later. This included a 90+ minute commute each way (nearly doubled during inclement weather) and only having one week off from work each year. At the time, my salary did not allow me to move out of my parents’ house and closer to work (my student loans and car payment were high).

At that point, I sought out a job closer to home that was in consulting engineering. I found a job 5 miles from where I lived with a medium-sized local company that dealt mostly with public works/transportation projects. I found the material interesting but, just 2 weeks before my 2-year anniversary, I was laid off due to the company lacking enough projects to keep everyone. I was the most recently hired engineer, so naturally I was told to go. 

It took me two months, but I found another position with a land development consulting firm also 5 miles from my home. Around the same time as I started working for them, I also entered a long-term relationship. This relationship evolved very quickly, and a few months later we decided to move in together. The problem was that the apartment I moved into was 70+ miles from my current job, so I had to leave. Once again, I spent two months looking for another job, and finally landed at my current job. I’ve been here for 6 months, but I’ve made some realizations this past year that have put me at a crossroads.

When it comes to civil engineering, there isn’t anything that I’m passionate about or particularly skilled at. I have failed the F.E. exam repeatedly, I’ve struggled to study the material because I don’t think I learned it well enough the first time around (college). Even if I had my EIT certification at this point, it wouldn’t change how I feel about the industry. I’ve been out of college for 5 years, and I think it’s time to make a change.

I’ve considered going back into construction management, since it’s something I have at least some exposure to. I think my varied engineering background makes me a good fit for that profession. I have also considered becoming a middle school science teacher. I am a very social person, I love dealing with kids, I really enjoy helping people and explaining concepts to them. Luckily, the state of New Jersey has an alternate route for attaining a teaching license. Back when I got laid off, I started the process to get my license and got as far as the certification exams. Just as I was looking for study materials for the exam, I found another job and put the teaching application on hold indefinitely. I am now considering working on that application again and preparing for the formal examination.

**[tl;dr] starts here:**

So, here’s where I am today: I graduated from college in 2013 with a degree in Civil Engineering, an industry I never loved or was good at. I’ve worked for the past 5 years in various civil engineering positions, but have failed to find one that was a good fit for me. I’ve considered pursuing Construction Management and teaching Middle School Science. I am creative, social, love giving presentations and speaking to people of different academic and professional backgrounds. I like explaining things, helping people, working indoors, as well as having a routine schedule every day. I don’t mind being on my feet for long periods of time, and I crave social interaction. I really dislike crunching numbers all day in a cubicle, and I have a hard time with calculation-intensive work. I’m not looking to go back to school for a Master’s or other certification (at least until I pay off my existing student loan debt).

With that said, what other career choices could I consider? I am open to starting at the bottom and taking an entry-level job, as long as I have the opportunity to work my way up into a stable career that I will enjoy and be good at. I am currently located in Monmouth County, New Jersey, and don’t have any plans of relocating in the foreseeable future.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

12,How do I overcome feelings of incompetency at a new job?,1515608884,"Hi,

I started a new job as a process engineer in injection molding about 3 months ago. I have no background in injection molding whatsoever, I only worked in extrusion before (3 years) which is an entirely different process. I know the materials side of things, understand equipment, etc, but other than that, I've pretty much started my career over and I'm just as good as a new grad. 

I think every engineer has felt this way at some point in their career - some more, some less. And I understand that feeling somewhat incompetent at an early stage of a new job is normal. 

My question is, how did you manage that feeling when you first started out? What can a new engineer do to not get discouraged by an expected amount of failure? My boss's expectations of me are very realistic (he says I will be fully trained in about 12 months). How do I manage my own expectations better and stop beating myself up over things I feel like ""I should already know?""

As per the title, I am currently working as a technician but I have the education qualification of Bachelors in Engineering majoring in Chemical Engineering.

I got into this job with my manager promising me that I will be trained up as a full fledged engineer and will be promoted “when the time comes”. My job scope includes the daily operation of machines and to assist the engineers in their projects.

So it has been one year, I don’t feel very satisfied with the career and I feel that I wasn’t given any opportunity to participate in any training that my fellow engineers took while I am certainly as capable and qualified as them (at least I think I am).

I discussed about my career progression with my manager and it seems to me that he intends for me to stay another year doing the same thing as a technician with the promise I will be able to be trained the same way as the engineers in the next coming year.

Should I stay? Will this be detrimental towards my working experience should I were to seek for an engineering job in the near future?

Or should I just look for another opportunity?

25,Something Like a Clicking Pen Mechanism?,1515584985,"Hey all,

So I'm trying to come up with a mechanism that is similar to a clicking pen in that when you press the button something actuates. The product I'm designing is something that will be on the end of a walking stick or trekking pole and when the button is pressed against the ground while walking, an actuator pushes in the nozzle of a spray paint can which leaves a small paint mark on the ground.

Currently my system just uses a spring to hold the can 'in tension' and the force from placing the stick on the ground activates the nozzle. What I need though is something where the nozzle doesn't activate upon every button press, but instead is kind of staggered so that it activates only every 3rd, 4th, or 5th etc. press.

Is there any kind of mechanism that anybody knows about that I might be able to 3D print or manufacture somehow?

26,"Thinking of switching from mechanical to mechatronics, have concerns...",1515584849,"I recently completed a programming module in the first semester of first year uni  (I had never been exposed to programming up until then). I have enjoyed this part of the course the most so far. It was both interesting and intuitive -considerably more so than the mechanical or electrical modules. It consisted of learning basics in the C language and applying this to an arduino microcontroller. I am now quite interested in exploring the option of transferring onto the mechatronics course (from mechanical) at the end of my first year. There wouldnt be any disadvantage accademically - as first year in both subjects consists of the same modules. I do however have concerns about what effect this might have on my future career opportunities. I have been told by a single individual that this might be a bad idea - and that I'd be better specialising later (during a masters) if that's the directuon i wish to take. 

Is it true that mechatronics would limit me in terms of job opportunities (both number of jobs and types of jobs that would accept me). Is mechatronics also seen as a 'lesser' degree in how difficult it is compared to mechanical engineering?

38,Conceptual idea for solar energy transportation,1515549184,"I've got an idea and I want a sanity check.

There was an article in Forbes that claimed: ""...1.2% of the Sahara desert is sufficient to cover all of the energy needs of the world in solar energy."" [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/09/22/we-could-power-the-entire-world-by-harnessing-solar-energy-from-1-of-the-sahara/#5590d74dd440) The problem is that if we generate this electricity in remote regions, we must transport it to the market where it will be used. Current efforts seem to focus on transmission lines. [One example.](http://www.zdnet.com/article/breakthrough-could-carry-solar-wind-power-long-distances/) Specifically, high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines that reduce losses over large distances. However, these systems are still being refined and remain costly.

My question is: Why not collect solar energy, wherever it's abundant, using large parabolic reflectors, transport it *as light* to its destination by reflecting a focused beam of light back into space to a network of geostationary satellites and back down to a location near its point of use, before finally converting the light into electricity?

As far as I can tell, and this is where I need the sanity check, we already have all the requisite technology. We have large area parabolic reflectors that can focus light. We have geostationary satellites and we are capable of pointing them accurately. We would need to equip them with planar mirrors which could be made of lightweight materials like those of solar sails. We also have various means of converting sunlight into electricity.

On a smaller scale, we have cities which don't receive direct sunlight and use giant mirrors to shine light into the city. [Rjukan.](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/the-giant-sun-mirrors-of-rjukan/3632/) Its seems that a proof of concept would not be too distant in the future.

The only drawback I see is the misuse of the technology as a giant death ray.

52,Is it too soon to ask for a promotion?,1515517452,"I've been working 3.5 years in my current position as a Project Engineer at a small mid-west company that supplies equipment and solutions to manufacturing plants in North America.

54,Issue with Flowmeter?,1515513523,"Hi Guys,

&amp;nbsp;

I am in need of some advice. Just recently I was calibrating the pumps in our factory and I got some odd results for one of our chemicals. This chemical is injected directly into the line through a gear pump and is controlled through a PID controller which adjust the pump speed.

&amp;nbsp;

So here are the calibration results I got. Each setpoint was done twice on each day. And the calibration was basically done by dispensing the chemical into a bucket over 2 minutes and weighing it out.

&amp;nbsp;


Yesterday:

Setpoint: 23 g/s ---- Actual: 16.5 g/s

&amp;nbsp;

Setpoint: 20 g/s ---- Actual: 15.4 g/s

&amp;nbsp;

Setpoint: 17 g/s ---- Actual: 13.0 g/s

&amp;nbsp;


Today:

Setpoint: 23 g/s ---- Actual: 20.6 g/s

&amp;nbsp;

Setpoint: 20 g/s ---- Actual: 19.8 g/s

&amp;nbsp;

Setpoint: 17 g/s ---- Actual: 13.5 g/s

&amp;nbsp;

The results between today and yesterday are quite inconsistent. I thought I would be able to get away with putting in an offset with the setpoint in order to get the actual I need but the inconsistency threw me off. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now the chemical that I am pumping is some sort of slurry and is a little aerated, could this maybe cause such inconsistency? Although the density reading coming off the flowmeter is consistent (Endress + Hauzer - Proline Promass 83F). Also having a look at the control graph I have here, the PID controller is supposedly controlling the setpoint with no issues (if I put it at 20g/s, I will see the graph stabilize around 20g/s +/- 0.5g/s). Could there be an issue with the flowmeter? Surely if it says that 20g/s is going through then 20g/s needs to come out?

But, would 3 or 4 pieces be enough? Would a simple 9' x 18"" torsion box, with wood members inside and plywood outside be strong enough? Would box aluminum inside the torsion box strengthen it?

I will be managing about 20 person organization with managers below me. I have about 11 years experience out of college, all with this mid size automotive component company bear Chicago.

My question relates to possible negociation on the raise. I make 111k now with 20% max bonus, and am aware that past directors made 165kish and usually are on a corporate bonus plan that can pay a lot more than 20%. This is also a pay level that lines up well with websites that give salary ranges.

I have been promoted a few times before and always seem to be at the bottom of the pay ranges they communicate in yearly reviews. I think it is likely they will offer 15-20% which I think will be somewhat low on a director range and even within the range of my current title.

85,I am thinking of building a DIY torque vectoring car using 4 electric motorcycle hub motor wheels. Does this sound like a good idea?,1515415379,"Hi, I am thinking about starting a project for myself to better understand electronic torque vectoring and control. But this is a new thing for me so I am hoping for feedback on how useful/interesting/doable it is.

I am a product designer and have been working for an electric vehicles company for about 2 years. Mostly building prototypes. I have only done very basic programming using Arduino. But I have always been interested in that side of things.

People have been talking about electric cars as ideally suited to computer controlled torque vectoring using 4 independent motors. One for each wheel.  But usually this is followed by them saying this is really hard to achieve good results. And even now few EVs seem to try.  Partly I think this must be a chicken and egg situation as unless you have a car to test your program on it is necessary easy to build the software needed. And unless you can be sure the software will improve performance you cannot justify the expense of using 4 independent motors when 1 or 2  will give you all the power needed.

What I am thinking about is, building a smallish space frame chassis and mounting electric motorcycle wheel hub motors from alibaba on it to create a test rig for designing the control system. I am thinking of possibly doing away with Ackerman steering altogether. And controlling  it completely through wheel torque, sort of like a 4wd version of an electric wheelchair with the 2 front wheels run as caterers  (but in this case, powered). 

To start I am thinking to set it up so power going to each wheel is in proportion to that wheels turning radius just to get things moving. Then add more sensors and feedback and work on implementing relative speed control rather than just adjusting the power as it is the wheel speed that I really want to control.  This is where things probably start to get complicated for me as I don't know how easy it is to get accurate speed from the Hall Effect sensors in the motors? Presumably they will need to be rotating a fair bit before the reading is accurate? 

I also need to work on controlling regenerative braking. As probably braking will often have a greater influence on the vectoring than acceleration. 

Does any of this make sense as a project? Can any of you spot obvious problems I have no idea about?  And if it seems possible and worthwhile, do any of you have advice on books and resources that will be useful? 

A thought I had is that I will open source any interesting parts of the design and post some info on how the project went so others who want a simple platform to experiment with torque vectoring or even converting to driverless can use it, so they have a head start. It would have the advantage for driverless car experimenting that there would be no need to implement any drive by wire or power steering onto a cheap chassis, as they are all controlled by the motor controller anyway.

One of their seniors pulled me to the side and pretty much said there's no chance in hell they will find someone as well suited to the job as me, and that the manager agrees with him but it would be unethical for him to offer me a position since they've hired me as a consultant. This is all very flattering of course, and I definitely think I would be happy to be employed there. I think I can keep getting assignments for this client indefinitely, so I don't think I need to factor in the practicality of the client being conveniently located for me.

I'm not sure how to handle this properly. If I ditch my current employer, which I also like, I'll feel like an ass for just hopping off like that, especially considering how new I am there. The politics and the ethics of it makes me feel very torn. I plan to at least ask the client what they would consider offering me, which is obviously a big deciding factor, but disregarding that, how would you guys handle a situation such as this?

My hypothesis is that the house probably requires more energy/unit of time to keep warm than the sun would provide the greenhouse, so you'd end up with a cold greenhouse and even worse efficiency because now your heatpump is in a cold room with a lot less air movement than if it were just outside.

95,An idea for wood powered Central Heating,1515348793,"I’ve dealt with a lot of headache with heating my home this year.. Someone recently gave me a wood stove and I’ve been thinking, “how could I heat the whole house with this wood stove?” I’ve seen some similar implantations to what I’m thinking but not exactly the same. I wanted to discuss it with you guys. From what I understand, wood stoves heat by convection and this is nearly useless for anything outside the room the stove resides. I’m no engineer and I will probably never try this idea, but I still want to get some input. It’s fun to think about. 

I generally understand the concepts of how a boiler heating system functions. Water is heated in order to transport and distribute the heat in other areas. What if I coiled copper pipe around the stoves pipe where water would circulate with a high temp pump. Then that heated water circulates to a secondary coil in the Central AC system to remove the heat and distribute it though out the house with the existing duct work and blower motor?  The coil in the AC would be just like a regular HVAC evaporator coil  or radiator  without the valves and such. 

I could coil the copper around a regular 6 inch diameter stove pipe for wood stoves, and then use an 8 inch diameter stove pipe jacketed over that and then filled with vermiculite to insulate and make sure as much heat as possible is absorbed into the fluid. Pressure relief valves like the ones on hot water heaters could be used for safety. 

Microcontrollers or arduinos with sensors and relays could be used to turn on the pump and control its speed when a certain water temp is reached and then control when the fan kicks on and off at  optimal temperature for maximum thermal exchange. They would control pump and fan speed so that everything stays as efficient as possible. This would automate everything so all that’s required is to build the fire and the system would turn off and on accordingly.  I assume I could log all kinds of data such as temps from several points and vectors with various variables to determine optimal on and off settings for each system to optimize it as much as possible. 

I’ve seen people on YouTube use  coiled copper on stoves pipes to simply produce hot water with thermal siphoning, and I’ve seen videos of wood stove systems outside doing similar things, so I assume it’s possible. I know that a simple wood stove isn’t going to effectively transfer the heat as well as an actual boiler but I assume this could be compensated with the size of the coils used.

I have a rect. tank designed and want to put it in RISA as a learning experience and to see how close my design is.  I generate one with intermediate stiffeners (4x4 angles).  Problem is that RISA puts the stiffeners in toe out (welding the angle leg to the tank instead of the toe).  By doing this you have moved the stiffener centroid closer to the tank (which is a stupid way to do it I think because you aren't using the stiffener very efficiently, *at least that is what I have been screaming at the program all morning but it isnt having any of it*).

How can I change it so the intermediate stiffeners are welded on the toe instead?

16,Employer wanting to move me to a management-ish role after less than 3 years of working there but I'm trying to get more technical experience.,1515176900,"I had a conversation with my boss that I knew was coming sooner or later. A previous client of my company has come back to us with a project that would likely last more than 2 years AKA the foreseeable future. I've previously worked with this customer and turned down an offer from them because I didn't like the work I was doing at the time. When I was debating between staying with my employer and taking the client's offer, my boss told me that I could get in on the ground floor of some new design work that they had in the pipeline. I was excited at the prospect of more technically challenging work so I turned down the client's (better) offer. This was a little less than a year ago. 

Since turning down that offer, our work with that client ended and I was moved elsewhere. Well the work that was supposedly in the pipeline never really showed up and I've jumped from mindless project to mindless project in the past 10 months. I've had multiple conversations with my manager about my desire for more technical work but, while seeming receptive and empathetic during those talks, he has yet actually do anything about it. I've grown increasingly frustrated with my work here to the point where I'm regularly talking to recruiters and am waiting on an expected interview soon. But there's no guarantees there. 

This old client has come back now and is requesting someone onsite again to act as a liason between my company and them. My boss thinks I'd be a good person for this seeing as I'm already familiar with the client. I understand this and think that I could do it but.....I have zero desire whatsoever to move even further from technical work. I don't want to become an email jockey so early on in my career (less than three years of experience). I'm very disappointed that my manager asked this of me in light of him respecting my wish for more technical work. This is the total opposite of what I wanted. 

But now I don't really know what to do. I told him I'd think about it but he wants an answer sooner than later. But I don't know if I actually have a choice. He tends to phrase things as a choice I have but he's already made up his mind. I don't really care if I end up without a job honestly. I have a very healthy financial safety net and would be fine without work for a while. I'm 100% willing to just walk if he tries to force me into this. Thats how badly I don't want to do this. 

&lt;Rant&gt; I can't believe how difficult it has been since I started working to find real, legitimate design work. I went into engineering because I was fascinated with how things are built and how they work. I really haven't seen much of that at all so far.

25,How Significant Is Bend Allowance On A Small Scale?,1515157708,"Hi all, I am currently working on a DIY project which requires bending sheet metal. I am very inexperienced in working with metals, and only a few days ago I came across the complexities of bend allowance. The parts I would like to bend are 4mm Hardox plate, only about 50cm wide x 12 cm tall, but as I'm reading up about bend allowance I see mentions of commercial aircraft parts etc. Obviously what I'm dealing with is much smaller than that. So I am wondering how significant bend allowance is on a small scale like this? Am I looking to account for 20mm? 0.5mm? I understand that there are many other factors required to determine bend allowance, but I am just interested to know what sort of ball park I am dealing with. I could just be completely overthinking things, and the potential range of bend allowance might not really affect a small personal project in a way I would deem 'significant'. 

I would ask the company which will be cutting/bending the parts, but, from past experience, when they see the size of the parts I would like + my newbie questions, they don't answer and stop responding to me.

I've been trying to look up concepts I can incorporate to prevent wobble, but I don't know the terms.

So I drew this up quickly in DraftSight (free), [frame](https://imgur.com/d1pgCoU), dimensions in inches. I hope its self explanatory. I was thinking of building 2 frames like the one on the left, placing one at the very top of the 4x4s, and the one at the bottom, say 2"" off the bottom, as you can see in the profile view on the right. Then building cross bracing supports on 3 sides.

The plywood would sit on top of the upper frame, it isn't in the diagram. Not sure if I would do anything for the bottom one, maybe more plywood to make a self.

I'm going to be buying all the wood at homedepot, and having them cut it up for me.

Anyways, I was wondering if you guys thing this will be enough to prevent it from wobbling as the print head moves left to right?

Should the cross bracing be going from a vertical leg to a horizontal? or should it go from vertical leg to vertical leg?

Are the H patterns in the horizontal part of the frame enough? Or should I use angled cross bracing instead?

Should I add another level/shelf in the middle? They will only hold paper and extra ink.

Edit: I should add that dimensions can change slightly, looking into prices, I've changed the 4x4 heights to 24"", so I only need to buy 1 piece.

Field Systems Engineer

Onsite repair of IC equipment at large manufacturing plants  

Salary 60k + paid $60/hr for any billable hours worked after 5pm. 
On Call rotation every 3 weeks, other than that semi-regular 8am-5pm
  
Small company, good people, company vehicle + benefits and annual incentive + profit sharing.   
20 min commute to office 

Job #2

Non-destructive test engineer in Navy Nuke support service

70k salary + regular hourly pay after 40hrs

Standard benefits package, security clearance, working on a military base. Large company, could be long hours, 10 minute commute.  Requires an 11 month training class a few states over, could be tough but there are things in place to make it doable. (paid travel home monthly + per-diem for the period)

I have a background as a military electronics tech + 5 years in the semiconductor field. I am not a degreed engineer, but I've worked in the field long enough to get a pass at these kinds of positions and have been steadily chipping away at an Abet BSEE. 
I'm currently making around 65k with OT at a large company that I'm starting to feel unhappy with. 

I'm having a hard time deciding. The 2nd job seems to pay more on paper, but requires more commitment. The first job looks to have a very lean staff, but they're really friendly. With my background job#1 would be a better fit, but job#2 could expand my experiences. 

Just looking for a 3rd party view, if have any insights, I'd love to hear them.

41,Mechanical Engineering Career Fear,1515111891,"Hi I know this topic has been discussed greatly on this subreddit + many others (I've spent the last few days pretty much searching up everything I could on reddit).

Im about to go into mechanical engineering at a school here in massachusetts, UMASS. However, discussing with my friends who are current ME and EE at the school, they both say that ME grads seem to just use CAD all day. I really don't want to sit at a desk all day and have no hands on work in a lab or something.

I wanted to go into biomedical engineering and get some hands on work, but my friend who's in a coop says that he just does CAD all day. On the other hand my EE friend gets to troubleshoot and design some circuits at workplace. He spends time debugging in his cubicle, but also a good amount of time in the lab.

I'm kind of better at mechanics than I am in circuits so I am leaning towards ME. However, browsing roles on the job market (Linkedin, glassdoor, etc), the available roles don't seem too interesting. I'm thinking of switching to EE and dealing with struggling to learn everything but having many interesting areas/projects to get into later in my career. The biggest difficulty and fear for me is just learning to be good at something that's abstract and something I can't visualize. Side question: anyone who did EE who had a really tough time with abstract concepts? I've always been kind of a visual learner where I have to draw things out to follow and understand what I'm looking at.

I guess my main question is how can I get a job that isn't about sitting at my desk all day on CAD if I do stick with ME. I want to design products, not optimize manufacturing processes or anything like that. I specifically want to work on products.

Options I've considered have been staying in ME and teaching myself circuit theory on a basic level and practicing programming, and making projects outside of class. Another is just going to EE and making projects outside of class. Last option is ME with a concentration in Robotics.

I'm interested in mechanical product design, especially in the prosthetic industry (since I was a former Premed student), but I would also love to work on new cutting edge technology and working with renewable energy, electric vehicles, GPS, and all aspects of robotics (mechanical + electrical + programming). Mechatronics is not an option at my school for a concentration though.

tldr: Going into ME and do not want to sit on a computer all day, I want hands on work with a company's products. How probable is this as a fresh grad?

50,Best program to use for rewriting code from Basic for analyzing forces on cofferdams and trusses,1515089765,"TL;DR  I have to translate code for a program analyzing forces on circular cofferdams, trusses, and several other scenarios written in Basic by my boss in the 1980s, from Basic into a more modern programming language. Not sure if I should choose Matlab (would need to purchase, not a problem), Python, Fortran (we have an older version (7.1) on an old XP laptop, could buy newer if needed), or some other program. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you. 

	Hello. I am an intern at a small civil engineering company specializing mainly in cofferdams, and I’ve been tasked with taking some proprietary code that the owner of the company wrote in Basic in the 1980s and bringing it into a more modern language. I don’t have an abundance of experience with coding or working with software like this because I am only a second year mechanical engineering student and I’m looking for some advice from engineers who have experience with things like this. 

	To give you a picture of the situation, the owner of the company, my boss, is ~75 years old and isn’t the most tech savvy (he still runs windows XP on his computers, doesn’t want to update), and he only really needs the software to rewrite the few programs that he wrote so that he can easily use them to quickly calculate the forces in his designs. He is a very smart man, and is a whiz with the calculations and ideas behind everything, but he needs help getting the program translated. My boss has entrusted this whole project to me, and given me a generous amount of time to complete it, but I want to make sure that I get this right. He knows very little about coding, having only used Fortran, and even that was many years ago for him. I ask him questions and for advice, but it’s almost like the blind leading the blind because he knows very little about the newer coding languages, and barely even remembers how to use Fortran because he hasn’t used it in so long. There is no one else to ask in the company because the only other employee does Autocad drawings and has no experience with coding. So I’m basically on my own to tackle this project, which I’m excited to do and learn from. 

	My boss understands that I know very little coding, and wants me to take my time and learn how to do this. I think he views it as a relatively cheap and easy way (for him) to get his very important code fixed up and modernized so that he’s good to go for years to come. I am happy to do this, I just want to make sure that I’m using the right program before I go and invest a bunch of time and money in a project, so that’s why I’m here. 

	I’ve done a lot of research, and to me it seems like the options are to use Fortran, Matlab, or Python, and right now, I’m leaning mostly towards Matlab. Paying for software is not a problem, I just want to make sure I’m doing what’s best for everyone here. We already have Fortran, buts it’s version 7.1 and its on a very old laptop that cant update past Windows XP. So, the way I see it right now, I could either spend a lot of time learning Fortran, either the old version that we have or a newer version, or I could or I could do the same thing with Matlab or Python. If you do recommend sticking with Fortran, am I alright to use the program on an old laptop running XP with a floppy disk drive, or should I get an updated version for a newer computer? Or should I just go with Python, which is free, but which my boss has reservations about because it is open source and not made by a “reputable company”?

	My boss has said that he would have no problem buying a new computer with Windows 10 on it and getting Matlab or some other program for it, but before I have him spend thousands of dollars, I want to make sure that I have as much information as possible. So, if for example, you people think I would be best off to just plug through our old version of Fortran on our XP laptop, I’ll gladly do that if that is what’s best. But if you all think that that would be a waste of time, upgrading is not a problem. 

	Also, I need to be able to make the calculated stress values at analyzed points print out into a clean data table with labeled and titled columns and rows. Additionally, my boss also wants to be able to loan or lease the software out in the future without letting the person have access to the source code, and I need to take this into consideration when deciding on a program. Would sharing like this be possible with Matlab? I read about P-code, but this just obfuscates, but doesn’t encrypt, the code. 

	Basically I’m not sure the best route to take. My boss is relying on me to come through for him, and so I’m reaching out to you folks for some advice. The simpler and cleaner the solution is, the better. I apologize if I come across as inept. Basically everything I know about Fortran, Basic, and Matlab I learned from Google in the past two days. Thank you.

There seems to be lots of information for high albedo roads to reduce the heat island effect in cities, but not much for low albedo assisting snow and ice melt.  It seems concrete could be easily stained a dark color and that would help evaporate snow melt and reduce the number of freeze thaw cycles per season as well as lower the use of salts, magnesium chlorides, etc.  If you spend much time driving in snowy areas it is easy to see this in action between older and therefore lighter and more reflective aslphalt and newer, darker asphalt.

I know this may be a little early to start looking at masters courses, but I'd much rather be over prepared than be left panicking last minute. 

Looking around on Google, taught courses seem to be similar to an undergrad, in that it is composed of lectures and assessments. Whereas research courses seem to be more independent work, where you attain the masters by teaching yourself and writing up a report. 

There seem to be many conflicting sources that I found, as some say that you can only attain a MSc through a taught program, and you will recieve a MPhil if you do a research program, however I found many courses from universities such as Bristol, Manchester and Swansea who offer a MSc through research.

Is one better than the other? Does it affect employability? Would I be restricted to certain fields of work depending on what I choose?

The repair guy has volunteered to permanently disable one of the heating elements as a ""cost-saving measure"" -- I can't figure out why this would have the desired effect.

to my understanding, the house is a system that is losing heat based on a differential temperature across the walls and windows and floors. This rate of loss is constant, assuming that I keep the interior a constant temperature, and the exterior is a constant temperature less than the interior temperature. To compensate for these losses, I inject watts into the closed-house system via an electrically resistive heater that adds watts under bang-bang control. If I decrease the number of elements, I will decrease the amount of control authority that the furnace exerts on the house... it will have to run for a longer duration to inject the same number of watts. -- I will increase the duty cycle, while increasing the duty frequency, it will run longer, and more often, but it will also introduce the same number of watts, because steady-state temperatures are contingent on the amount of injected watts being the same (over time) as the number of watts lost to the environment.

I can't understand why the guy would make the following claim: a heating system with 3 elements is more affordable than one with 4 elements. I have heard that electric is ""less efficient"" than some other heating methods, but the furnace is in the boundary of the house, so whatever additional inefficiencies still result in heating the house.

93,What made you get off your ass and start working towards getting where you are now?,1514944802,"Hello. I’m 14 years old and really hope to be an engineer at SpaceX when I get older, and am ready to give up a significant amount of my time and devote it to reach this absurdly difficult goal. The problem is I never end up doing the things I plan on doing (like learning python, getting into robotics, etc) so how exactly do I do it? Any advice on how to improve ones motivation? Also, a bit off topic, but how does one start getting into the basics of robotics? ",AskEngineers,Colepher,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7nrd8g/what_made_you_get_off_your_ass_and_start_working/
94,Salary negotiation after probationary period.,1514935654,"Hello, 

I will be completing probationary period (6 months) in couple of weeks. My very initial offer from CEO said 

""We would start you at $40k.  After six month probation advance to $50k and up  to $70 k in three years depending on your contribution to success of the company. ""

After negotiating he agreed to start with $50k. Here is the mistake I did, I never bothered to ask if there would be any raise after probationary period of 6 months. 

1. Should I negotiate ? 
1. How much should I ask for ?
1. What's the most polite yet effective way to handle this?

Edit- I'm a  Marine designer and my job involves designing aluminum boats. ",AskEngineers,fakeengg,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7nqdyp/salary_negotiation_after_probationary_period/
95,"Depressed Mechanical Engineer, Part 2!",1514928698,"Greetings, I posted about my struggle last month and the responses were very supportive and understanding. Thank you and happy new year!
I am a Masters Graduate in mechanical engineering (May 2017) from CU Boulder. I am an International student and a non-US citizen. The struggle has been very hard so far, I haven't got a single interview despite having good internship experience and some great projects from reputable institutions. I specialize in Design, Rapid prototyping and Machine Design. I have put a lot of what i Leaned into practice and have tangible results!

However I am struggling to find a job. It has been 7 months and I have nothing to show for despite applying to over 600 companies. (I lost count at 500). It is especially hard this season because I have not seen my family for over three years now!

Is there any way anyone can help me get better results at receiving callbacks for an interview? I have been working an unpaid internship at a design house where I manage a bank of 3d printers and make custom enclosures for electronics. I fill my time applying for jobs and studying the basics for interviews. Any help would be immensely appreciated and I promise to pay it forward as soon as I am able. 

Thank you

Edit 2: Thank you for the overwhelming response. I will process all the suggestions and try to make my resume better. One factor which really helped me was the unanimous response of the posters, which actually makes my work easier!
I am taking what all of you said and putting it into my resume right now.. (or rather taking it out!). A great thing about being rejected and dejected for so long is it removes any semblance of ego in me.!

Thank you and have a prosperous new year! ",AskEngineers,reedrick,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7npky7/depressed_mechanical_engineer_part_2/
96,crank/piston mechanism help,1514928652,"Is there a crank/piston mechanism where the piston's extended point can be varied *without* varying the retracted point?

Example:

* piston is moving between point 0 and point 1

* change something

* piston is now moving between point 0 and point 2 (&gt; 1)


The only ways I've come up with are basically recursive: a thing that does this to one of the links between the crank and the piston can basically accomplish this for the whole mechanism.

Is what I'm asking for practically possible?",AskEngineers,MattD,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7npkra/crankpiston_mechanism_help/
97,Can Fresnel Lens generate electricity?,1514923796,"Hi, I am a senior Electrical and Electronics engineer, and my senior design project barely touches upon my major (~~instant regret~~). So, it requires using spot Fresnel Lens to concentrate sunlight into copper tubes, which spiral at each focal point thereby causing the water to heat more. The output of the tube is expected to be super heated steam which then rotates turbine and with the use of a generator, electricity is expected to be produced.

I am wondering if it is even close to being possible? Our advisor strongly believes Fresnel Lens are more efficient than PV, what are your thoughts?",AskEngineers,32px,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7nozzl/can_fresnel_lens_generate_electricity/

99,Seeking advice on what brand of MCU to use for hobby semi-proffesional usage,1514919888,"Hi!
i have been using few brands of MCU brands mostly 32bit M/R arm cortex based (texas instruments, atmel, STMicroelectronics). Right now me and my friend we are doing some arduino projects (using arduino is just a very simple way how to start that) but we both know that some day we would like to move to making our own hardware with quality mcus.

basically my selection criteria are:

- cost efficiency
- broad support by community -&gt; a lot of available libraries for various sensors

What brand do you think is best suited for next step moving from arduino to something more serious?
