1,Source Follower Circuit to drive two motors?,1352427736,"I am in a mechatronics course, and will be building a battle robot in the last three weeks of class. We are using four AA batteries to power two small motors (Parallax Continuous Rotation Servo (#900-00008)). The object is to push the other robot out of the ring.

In class, our TA spoke to us about H-bridge designs. He briefly mentioned a source follower circuit, saying that it is far superior to our transistor h-bridges (looks a lot like [this](http://profmason.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hbridge.jpg)) but we should not try it unless we are senior ECEs (we are Junior MechEs).

He then went on to describe different MOSFET h-bridges and different BJT h-bridges, and their advantages and disadvantages. We are using ATmega32s.

I was looking for some advice. How difficult would it be to learn about source follower circuits, and where could I find a good, thorough tutorial?

Is there a good way to refine the mesh at the ends of a sphere? ""Local Mesh Control"" seemed promising, but you can only select faces or edges of the part, not the mesh. Since the shell has one spherical face, this doesn't help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The only problem right now though is I am not sure how to calculate the clamping force and stress in between the clamps and the sample. There are several screws and I guess the amount of torque applied on the screw will cause the clamps to move closer together. As the clamps are forced closer together there will be a higher normal force on the sample grips and the stress can be calculated by dividing the force by the area.

13,Harvesting Ethanol in Space.,1352409259,"I asked this question in /r/askscience, but the mods rejected it saying it was too speculative.  I disagree; it's simply a combination of a few engineering questions.

Regarding the link on the front page about an ethanol cloud in space, G34.3:

It is claimed to contain enough ethanol for 400 trillion trillion pints of beer. Assuming ""beer"" is 4% alcohol here, that's about 7.4 trillion trillion liters of ethanol.

The cloud is of low density, and contains around 30 different compounds, including ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, but ethanol is the largest constituent. This would appear to be a vast source of energy, if it could be harnessed (something like 173 x 10^24 MJ, or 700 quadrillion times more energy than Tsar Bomba).

**If we were on a spacecraft bound for the cloud, would it be possible to extract the ethanol for it's use as a fuel? Would there be challenges with the impurities and low density? Would it take more energy to harvest than the possible energy yield?**

I don't think figuring out if it's thermodynamically favorable to ""vacuum"" up a bunch of vapor and refine it is all that speculative.  Thoughts?

I am a mechanical engineer working on my capstone design project, and the last portion of it involves harnessing rotational motion to power an LED.

Using the coefficient of friction for Mild Steel and Cast Iron @ 0.4, I get 800lbs using the 2000lbs as the force.

Right now they simply operate on a ""fix it when it breaks"" procedure, but I'd like to come up with relatively simple procedure that would be able to be done by an unskilled person in a 3rd world country, so they can ensure a certain amount of safety.  

I've already covered visual things like rust and all that, but are there any tools/devices that are cheap and would be able assist in ensuring the bridge is still safe?  It steel suspension cables, with a wood deck.  The wood deck is attached with steel, with rope netting providing the ""fence"" to prevent people from falling off.  The towers are steel welded towers (welded by unskilled workers with pretty poor welding equipment), and cast into a concrete foundation.  

Is a visual check of the steel cable good enough?  Ensuring the wood planks are not rotted is relatively easy.  An easy way to check the foundation?  The concrete for the foundation is of ""ample"" quality, but I don't think it would pass in the states or elsewhere.

All the non-destructive testing stuff I've found is pretty pricey or requires a professional to run.  I'd like to be able to have a local townsperson be able to check the bridge every so often so it doesn't fall apart when someone is using it.

One thought i had for this would be to put some sort of small rings around the length tubing so that it would stop it from kinking but i would imagine this would add quite a bit of weight onto the tube as she pulls it around the house.

86,Considering switching to Mechanical Engineering from Electrical Engineering for Mechatronics,1352065896,"Hi,
I'm an undergrad majoring in ECE at Carnegie Mellon, I would be in my third year right now but I am taking the year off to work in a mechatronics lab at my university. 
I got into engineering with the aspiration of designing and engineering prosthetic devices and limbs, but recently after doing some research and reading up on mechatronics, I am considering changing my major to Mechanical Engineering. I am much more interested in dealing with the physical side of things as an engineer, while dabbling in electronics only as much as I'd need to for a project.

My university doesn't offer a straight Mechatronics major, and if I do switch to ME, I'll probably graduate in the next 3-4 years. Would it be wiser to stick it out with ECE, concentrate in embedded programming and controls, and then go to graduate school for ME?  If I did end up staying in undergrad for a total of 5+ years. would that hurt me on my resume or on a grad school app?

I'd appreciate any input, thanks!!

Test spec states states either a max displacement of 1 mm or an acceleration of 100,150,200,500 m/s2.

This is a part of a validation test for an item. The professional lab charges a lot (IMO) for this. Perhaps I'm naive to think a home brew rig can achieve this.

I got my mechanical BS back in 2010, and have been working since.  I did PM work at a construction company for a while, and didn't like that.  Since then I've been working for a non-profit and trying to figure out what I really want to be doing.

I know for sure I want something with more science related work.  I started looking at lot more research oriented jobs, but almost all of them are looking for at least a masters or 7 years experience.  So now I'm looking at grad school options.

Initially, I figured I would apply for mechanical programs, but none of the grad school specializations call out to me too much.  In the meantime, my mentor from an engineering organization I'm in has suggested I look at materials.  He did a mech bs then a mats phd, and loves his job.  He does army research, and his work sounds really interesting.  That said, I can't say that materials calls out to me anymore than mechanical.  I am interested in the tech hardware industry, so I'm thinking maybe materials would be better for that.

I guess my bottom line question is, how greatly will this decision pigeon hole me?  My gut feeling is since I already have one degree in mechanical, diversifying would help more than it could hurt.  Where as getting a further mech degree certainly doesn't hurt but also doesn't do me as much good since I'm not sure what I really like in mechanical.

Underground cable to a URD box taps off of a secondary overhead. The outter jacket is peeled back and the conductors are stripped to make the connection. These cables contain a black and red conductor (insulator color). It seems the red insulator is degraded and become brittle when exposed to UV radiation. The bare copper touched the neutral and arc'd. Underground cables are meant to stay undergoround...the issue only arises where there are risers and where the conduit doesn't protect the cable.

What is a economically viable solution for this. Splicing and shrink tubing 2500 risers is...unrealistic right?

Are there any good solutions to the protect the red conductor from UV. Is it even a UV issue?",AskEngineers,survalent,/r/AskEngineers/comments/12hc4t/electric_utility_question/

38,Airflow/wind dynamics question in regards to an intake fan in a compact area... ,1351739460,"I'm working on a custom computer that is being built inside of a cylindrical tube (the idea being to create a ""windtunnel"" computer).

The design is such that the power supply unit is mounted very close to the wall of the tube....

My worry is that the PSU may not receive enough cooling from its intake fan (and potentially overheat??), which faces the tube wall, because the open spaces allowing air in around the sides, bottom, and top of the PSU is rather small.

Here is a top-down sketch of how the PSU will be mounted:

http://i.imgur.com/VJERR.png

(you are looking at the EXHAUST grill; the intake fan is on the side of the PSU facing the tube) 

I calculated the total area of the circular intake fan to be about **23 sq. inches**.

The total area of the spaces (marked ""1"" and ""2"") is about **14.5 sq. inches**.

...so...do I need to be concerned?  Common sense says yes, but is there anything regarding wind dynamics or the influence of the fan itself ""pulling"" air that I'm not aware of?  Or is the 23 sq in vs 14 not worth fretting over?

So, I've had a few computers and I've always felt that they inexplicably slow down over time. Doing a few restorations and limiting running programs helps but I feel like I never really get an old computer quite to mint condition.

Is there any chance that a computer working slower has anything to do with the hardware physically deteriorating? Like oxidation or partial restructuring in semiconductors or something?

69,using a serial mux to switch audio signal,1351560785,"Hi /r/AskEngineers. i am trying to build a system to switch a helmet speaker between two cb radio outputs and would love a little feedback to whether my idea is possible or not as i have very little electronics background.

so the idea is to use [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8970) serial mux to do the switching. the set up would be to have the signal line from each radio go to 1s1 and 1s2, with the ground line from each radio going to 2s1 and 2s2. then the signal line from the speaker to in1 and the ground for the speaker to in2.

my thought would be to wire the 1s2 (the signal line from the radio i want to have priority) wired to 1d so that if there is a transmission on that radio it will switch to s2. is this possible? with the signal voltage be enough for the switch to work? or will i need a micro controller?

also on the break out board there are grounds for each input (under 1s4 and 2s4), do i need these wired up or will it be fine with out them, my circuitry knowledge is pretty poor so the run down of the wireing

Maybe it's not so bad right now because such a small percentage of people actually buy and drive EVs, but what would happen if the masses adopt these vehicles.

Professional plumbers know this - I have watched 2 to 6"" steel pipe put together and they don't care about tiny leaks. But I never got a good answer as to why they indeed stop. I don't believe there are enough solids in most water to do the job, although that's what I'm told does it.

My two theories are 1) cold-flow of the pipe material, relieving stress and one point to fill a void elsewhere 2) water pressure causing pipe dope / tape to migrate into the holes. 

Do I have this right, or what exactly is going on? And what makes those little compression fittings so bad at sealing if you don't get them right the first time? ",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/125gnc/what_exactly_happens_when_a_leaky_pipe_stops/

10,At what temperature is it no longer beneficial to keep the blinds open?,1351267627,"So conventional wisdom says that in the winter, you should open your blinds to let sunlight in during the day, and close them at night so that you create an insulative air pocket to prevent losing too much heat.

As an engineer, I have to question this.  There must be a point where the radiant flux from sunlight is less than the heat loss from convection-conduction through the pane.

**Heat flux:**

Assume Denver, south-facing window, on the winter solstice.  [This](http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1961-1990/redbook/atlas/) shows a south-facing vertical plate getting 4 - 5 kWh/mÂ² (with about a 9-hour day)...so it would seem a window could receive around .5 kW/mÂ².

I need to determine the equations for what magnitude of force is 'felt' by each support.

I'm building a simulation of this system, so that the user choses an x and y coordinate pair, and a magnitude.  The system then takes this information, calculates the location of the force, based on what the sensors located on each support detect, and outputs an x,y pair of where the system thinks the force was applied.  

I have no formal statics training, but I figured out a relationship if the plate was supported at the corners, and even if it was supported by four points on the **edge** of the plate.

The inner workings of a gearbox utilizing planetary gearheads essentially include a central ""sun"" gear, one or more outer ""planet"" gears and an outer ring gear which contains the planet and sun gears. The sun gear drives the planet gears at a different ratio, and they in turn act upon the outer ring gear. This system of gearheads is often integrated with a motor either externally or internally.

22,"Need advice on my ""engineering"" experiences thus far",1351188044,"Hey guys, this is my third time posting this exact topic.  Last time I posted this reddit went down for the day and I got ignored.  I guess I should give you a little background first. I was interning at my company, which is a structural engineering company, (I myself am an ME who just recently graduated from grad school with my masters this past may) since the end of 2007 up to the beginning of 2012.

I basically did very little actual engineering work. Most of the work I had done was coding, which was actually something I didn't know a damn thing about going into the job. The most engineering work I did was when I had to make a program that could do bending moment diagrams...keep in mind that I worked on this for about a month during my internship. The rest of the time I was coding and making a program run the way we wanted to (no engineering work here at all, just aesthetics). I stayed here because the money was really good and the schedule was anything I wanted it to be.

This January when I was going to start searching for a full time job, they actually gave me a job offer which I accepted. I was told that since our company is small, we could be flexible in the types of projects we get. In the offer sheet, I was told that my duties would involve mechanical engineering, mechanical design, software development support, and experimental research.

In theory this sounded great, but so far, all that I have done seems to be intern type work. I've had to buy stuff from online for projects, reserve cars, and manipulate a program to match some data. I'm still doing some coding, but we are almost done with the program that we've been working on. I've done very few engineering type things such as using Solidworks, LS-DYNA, and some other things that don't come to mind right now. Basically, if I had to turn it into a percentage, I'd say that 90% of my time is spent doing bitch work and 10% may be engineering related work. They also just got me to work on a final report for a project that I had absolutely nothing to do with which has really sucks.  The only positive that I am focusing on right now so I don't explode is that I have a job with decent pay and at least I don't work at McDonald's or some crap...

SO, with all that all being said, is it time for me to look for another job or is this just the process that all entry level engineers go through?

And because this post is so damn long... TL;DR-I am an ME that interned at a structural engineering company for 4 years doing non-engineering work, was finally given a full time job offer in January.

Hey so im trying to self teach myself about optical circuits, specifically one im looking at involves wavelength conversions using semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) in an asymmetric mach zehnder interferometer's (MZI). In the setup a continuous wave signal is injected into both arms of the MZI and the MZI is setup in a way that induces destructive interference when the waves in the 2 arms recombine. in order to induce constructive interference, a data signal is injected into one of the MZI arms (counter propagating the CW input).
 I understand this depletes the carriers in the active region of the SOA inducing a phase shift in the CW output of the SOA which causes constructive interference upon recombination. my question is why doesn't the data signal combine with the CW at some point and cause problems either before the data signal enters the SOA, while the data signal and CW are in the SOA, or after the data signal has left the SOA  (propagating towards the CW input)

wait...I think I have this (please tell me if im being stupid) but assuming this is all digital signal pulses (aka discreet short pulses) then the data signal would counter propagate and eventually die dam Ive been looking at this too long",AskEngineers,slam7211,/r/AskEngineers/comments/121gmc/counter_propagating_waves_in_a_semiconductor/

I'm part of a project which takes flue gas from a coal fired power plant to grow algae as a means of mitigating CO2. One major concern I have is how a slipstream removal of the flue gas could be performed without disrupting the flue gas going towards the stack.

I have gone through countless articles trying to find the answer but every article focuses on what to do with the flue gas after siphoning. After 6 months, I am at a loss. The slipstream removal needs to occur according to need, so it wouldn't run constantly. Additionally, the gas needs to reach a pressure around 25psi (pending) or about 6wg to meet the requirements of the algae culture vessel. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",AskEngineers,mellowconundrum,/r/AskEngineers/comments/120scd/most_likely_a_complicated_answer_involving_gas/
42,"Unusual mod for a car, need a special material",1351096567,"I have a friend who is trying to mod his car in a specific way.  He wants to put a heads up display on his windshield.  We've got everything down for a computer, software, and projector.  The problem we have run into is we need a material to place on the windshield to pick up the light that is projected from the projector, but still allow light coming through the window from outside the car to come through.

I know that there have been vehicles that have done this before with a few gauge displays, but we have found nothing that indicates what was special about the glass or material on the glass that allowed the projected light to be seen by the driver and still be transparent.  Neither of us are material engineers.

Basically, the material should reflect light projected onto it from the projector so the driver can see it.  The material should still be transparent and not block line of sight out of the window.  The material will go on the inside of the windshield of the car in question.  The material should not require a fixed reflection angle as the windshield isn't a flat surface.

Please help.

Is there a material that can do this?

To illustrate.. Imagine a poster that while rolled, acts sort of like a stiff bar that won't bend, but that can be unroll in one direction. Once it is flat, it will not invert.

I'm currently a safety engineer at a AC adapter / power supply company, underpaid, and not going anywhere.

52,"Math. After college, what math will I use every day in environmental engineering, and what were your studying techniques during school?",1351015667,"I have never been very good at math. Granted, I've never really tried hard to be good at it. I didn't pay much attention to anything in high school except trying to meet girls and getting high with my friends after class. 

I fucked around my first year of college, trying a few different things and switched majors a few times.

I like building things. I love nature and the environment. I did well in biology and decent in chemistry, both without doing much if any studying. I'm interested in electrical systems, and the overall process of designing a structure. This is what led me to environmental engineering.

Now it's my second year of college and I'm in the college level algebra class attempting to make my way though algebra and pre-calc before transferring to a 4 year school where Iâll begin calc and physics.

I never acquired an interest in math until the summer after my first year of college, where I realized that math is what makes the world orderly and manageable. Math is what people use to create and design buildings, roads, bridges, dams, machines, and really anything in between. And I want to be a part of it. 

I would rather struggle my way through college level math and get a good job doing something interesting and making a good salary with good job security than coast my way through what I think is easy and land a job sitting in front of a computer typing away at code for years. 
The subjects I did well in: English, history, Spanish, programming, were really the subjects that I just didn't need to study for to do well in. In short, Iâm lazy. I had, and probably still have, a minor case of ADD. I hate it and Iâm trying to get myself out of this groove where I put in the minimal amount of effort and get out the grades to match.

I'm by no means stupid, I got into some decent schools in my area: U of Delaware, Rowan U, Stockton, Rutgers, I just get bad luck with math teachers. I canât say Iâve ever had a math teacher that seemed like he was genuinely interested in math and wanted everyone to also feel the same way. My current teacher is Swedish. He has a thick accent and it's very hard to understand him. He doesn't explain things well, expects you to know things and decent bother to explain them if you donât, and he gets angry at you if you ask a question - which causes no one to ask questions in my class â which is why about 70% of us are failing. I've been trying to remedy this by watching videos on KhanAcademy.com , and Iâve scheduled to meet with a tutor. 

This is a start, but I want to know what got you through math in college, and what type of math I can expect to be asked to complete on a project by project basis in environmental engineering.

I was looking on [MatWeb.com](www.matweb.com) for material properties of ABS. However, there are more than 2400 results, most being different ABS based composite materials.

MakerBot 3D printers work much like a hot glue gun, but with ABS or PLA plastic; they force a cylindrical piece of plastic to a heated nozzle.  Therefore, I'm assuming that the plastics that it uses neither have a high melting point, nor are they very hard.

Based on my MatWeb search, the following materials seem to fit the properties of the ABS used by MakeBot machines:

1. Molded ABS

2. PTFE filled ABS (maybe they use PTFE to keep the nozzle lubricated)

3. Extruded ABS

4. Transparent Molded ABS

My question is which of the four types of ABS should I use in my strength calculation and FEA work for parts made that are printed on a MakerBot printer? 

I'm personally edging towards extruded ABS, seeing as the plastic will in fact be extruded through a nozzle. However it will also be melted, in the nozzle, which seems more similar to Molded ABS.

I particularly asked about theoretical physics, as I enjoy that the most, it is like a puzzle to me, fun t solve. He told me about how there are also different types of engineering, theoretical, physical, etc. He also told me that where I live there are a ton of engineers retiring and our state doesn't have enough people to replace them.

77,Best way to accurately read tank level in varying temperature tank? [Looking for options],1350799725,"At my work, we have 4 ~20k gallon tanks. These tanks are insulated, and heated from ambient to around 270F to dehydrate used oil. Due to the vapors that are released from boiling of water / contaminants in the oil, a float gauge is not applicable to these tanks. So we have D/P cells connected to a PLC that reads the level. The dry leg of the D/P is plumbed to the top vapor area of the tank and the wet leg is plumbed at around the 1000 gallon level.

We have been having problems lately with vapor condensate running down the dry leg of the D/P cell, and that causes erratic and erroneous readings. Im trying to think of solutions to cure this problem, but im not coming up with much. 

My ultimate goal is to have an accurate reading of the tank level regardless of temperature. 

Things that I have thought of - 

1. Creating a sort of trap for condensate by corkscrewing the dry leg line (1/4"" SS tubing) for about 1 foot or more. My thought was this will give the vapor time to cool and re-condense, then drain back into the tank.
2. Some sort of programming comparison (in the PLC) between the D/P connected to the heating tank, and another tank that stays at ambient temperature but is not connected to the heating tank.

At this point im hitting a wall. I dont understand why vapor is even condensing in these lines however. While they are open to the interior of the tank, all fittings are properly sealed and tight. Wouldnt there have to be a pressure release(leak in the line) for these vapors to even make it into the line? Or am I wrong on that? 

Anyone run into this before? Or have some solution? Ill provide more info as needed. I hope my description was clear enough.

So to recap, a very simple robot which points its arm to the hour on a paper clock in front of it.

It doesn't need a vision sensor to see the time on the clock, rather the position of each hour can be hard-coded into it. (e.g the hours will each be written exactly 5cm apart, so each hour, it moves its needle by 5cm and it'll be at the next hour).

So for this wind monitoring project I'm getting data from a couple of 3d sonic anemometers, specifically 2 R.M.Young 81000. The data output is made digitally with a sampling frequency of 10Hz for periods of 10min. After all the pre-processing (coordinate rotation, trend removal...) I get 3 orthogonal time series of the turbulent data. Right now I'm using the stationary data of 2 hours of measurements with windows of 4096 points and a 50% overlapping to obtain the frequency spectrums in all three directions. After obtaining the spectrum I apply a logarithmic frequency smoothing algorithm, which averages the obtained spectrum in logarithmic spaced intervals.

I have two questions:

1. The spectrums I obtain from the measured show a clear downward trend in the highest frequencies as seen in the attached figure. I wonder if this loss of energy can have anything to do with an internal filter from the sonic anemometer? Or what else? Is there a way to compensate this loss or better just to consider the spectrum until the ""break frequency""?

http://i.imgur.com/8gOHH.png

2. When applying the curve fitting algorithm to determine the integral length scales according to the von Karman equation what is the correct procedure: curve fitting the original data, which gives more weight to higher frequency data points? or using the logarithmic frequency smoothed data to approximate the von karman equation, giving an equal weight to data in the logarithmic scale? In some cases I obtain very different estimates for the integral length scales using both approaches (ex: Original -&gt; Lu=113.16 Lv=42.68 Lw=9.23; Freq. Smoothed -&gt; Lu=148.60 Lv=30.91 Lw=14.13).

I graduated from a good school with my BS in Aerospace Engineering back in 2011.  Also, I have no internship experiences and a sub par GPA of 2.7 (I was 2.7 told was average for my school).  Foolish me did not begin applying for aerospace jobs until the June *after* I graduated, so, I am assuming these companies thought something was wrong with me and did not want me.

After giving up hope for a while, I worked an odd job for about six months until I began working as a Quality Assurance Engineer in manufacturing.  I would like to note that I had no previous experience in QA or manufacturing, so I am no entirely sure why they hired me. 

About 95% of the factory workers, people I was required to interact with to do my duties, did not speak English.  I was hired under the pretense that I knew *some* Spanish, but I am quite confident that I made it clear that I was *close* to conversational.  Additionally, my boss was not an engineer and was extremely difficult to communicate with - she was irrational.  One of the top bosses would call me into his office and teach me manufacturing statistics and other similar stuff, but again, I had no experience with this and he was a pretty terrible teacher.  He would play a bongo drum - I kid you not - while asking me questions.  Who does that?!

After two months, I was called into a persons office whom I did not know and I was let go, them saying, ""it is not working out.""

It has been 6 months since this has happened and I am currently underemployed working another odd job to pay the bills.  So here comes the advice part:

* Should I include the QA job on my resume? I am worried employers will not like that I was ""fired"" even though it was in a field that I had no experience in.

* If I do not include it on my resume, will a potential employer somehow be able to find out I did in fact work the job I was let go from? Thus, making it even worse than not including it.

* Should I try to find internships instead of full time jobs?  The thing is, I need to pay bills and I can not really afford not being paid/I feel those are only for students, not graduates.

* Should I include my GPA on my resume?  I feel this is sort of holding me back in a way because they may think it is lower than it actually is.  I was told back in college not to include it unless it is above a 3.0.

* Anyone know of any good sites for entry level jobs in New York?

25,Looking for a lightweight filler that will make a piece of muffler pipe more rigid,1350484721,"I'm thinking about using muffler pipe as a component in a desk that I want to make, because it can be welded and mandrel-bent, and has the physical shape that I'm looking for.

I would simply buy metal tube with thicker walls if I thought I could get it formed easily; however my assumption is that my odds of getting a muffler shop to bend me a custom piece is higher than finding a machine shop that can deal with whatever McMaster-Carr sells.

* They do the same type of work (related to national security)

* They are located in the same area

* I don't want to choose based on money unless it's really dead even otherwise (company fit is more important.) That said, the large company (Company B) did offer about $6/hour more and a week of vacation.

For what it's worth, the small company (Company A) is ~30 people, has been very successful thus far, and is growing quickly. The large company is &gt;1000 people and is a subsidiary of a &gt;100,000 person company.

Other information influencing my decision:

* I visited Company A and it seemed like a great fit (but B could be as well for all I know - I interviewed with the guy I whose team I would join and he seemed like a good person to work for.)

* About 20 out of the 30 people from Company A came from Company B because they had issues with its growth and acquisition by the super large company. That said, most also joined when Company B was 100 people, so they are 'small-company people.'

* Company B could provide opportunity to move geographically in the future if I end up with them.

* Company A would provide stock options if I end up with them.

It's hard to ignore the money difference since it adds up to &gt;$2000 for the summer and I'm paying for school through scholarships, my own savings, and loans. However I don't want to decide based on that. Is it kosher to try to negotiate with Company A to see if they could raise their offer? Also, what else should I take into account while deciding?

29,New Methods? Ideas? Researching Bronze Warship Rams from the First Punic War (3rd Century BC) x-post from Archaeology,1350481087,"Calling all scientists, experimental archaeologists, engineers, bronze casters, ancient weapons specialists, naval architects, and anyone else who is interested!

I am an underwater archaeologist and PhD student researching a collection of bronze warship rams discovered over the last few years. This incredible discovery dates to the First Punic War (3rd century BC), the first major conflict between Rome and Carthage. The rams are from the decisive and final naval engagement of the war, the Battle of the Egadi Islands. A fleet of Carthaginian warships under Admiral Hanno was headed to Sicily to resupply general Hamilcar Barca, father of famous Second Punic War general Hannibal Barca, when a newly constructed Roman fleet ambushed them. Polybius described the ambush in this way: 
âHannoâ¦set sail and reached the so-called Holy Isle from whence he designed to cross as soon as possible to Eryx, unobserved by the enemy,â¦Lutatius, learning of Hanno's arrival and divining his intentions,â¦sailed to the island of Aegusa which lies off Lilybaeumâ¦In the morningâ¦he therefore decided not to let the opportunity slip.  When he saw the Carthaginian ships under full sail, he at once got under weighâ¦he soon brought his fleet into a single line with their prows to the enemy.  The Carthaginians, seeing that the Romans were intercepting their crossing, lowered their masts andâ¦closed with the enemyâ¦â
The Carthaginian fleet was crushed and Rome, not previously a naval power, was suddenly in control of a sizeable portion of the Mediterranean Sea. The battle was arguably the moment where Rome began the road to naval domination, the control of the coasts, and eventually Empire and Pax Romana.

Over the last several years, Drs Jeff Royal and Sebastiano Tusa have been searching off the west coast of Sicily for the battle site. And the results have been incredible. In around 100m (~300ft) of water, a great naval fleet lies broken on the seafloor. Prior to this project, only two waterline warship rams had ever been found, making them the rarest of artifacts from Antiquity. Now we have ten and more are found each year. Piles of amphoras (think big ceramic shipping crates) that were once filled with supplies and food for Hamilcar Barcaâs soldiers lie scatters over the bottom. Using robots (ROVs and AUVs) the seafloor is being meticulously mapped and artifacts are being raised for conservation and display in a new wing of the Favignana maritime museum so everyone can come and see.

Photographs: http://imgur.com/a/vokLH#0

My research is a subsection of this project. I am conducting 3D scanning and elemental analysis of the rams to then conducting engineering trials to see how the rams would have functioned. Using structured light scanning, we are creating 3D models accurate to 15 microns, or 0.0015cm. We hope to conduct micro-cores this summer to determine the precise elemental make up of the bronze; early results suggest they around 83-91% copper, 6-8% tin, and 2-10% lead.  Using this data I am conducting a finite element analysis (FEA) to determine how the impact load would be spread over the surface of the ram. Also, I hope to use a scale model to test the force of ram-to-hull and ram-to-ram impacts. The 3D models could be used on digital reconstructions, printed using a 3D printer, or used to make new bronze castings for testing. Beyond the FEA, I am still looking for way to test and quantify the functional characteristics of these rams.

For those interested in naval tactics of this period, William Murray just publish an excellent book on the topic titled âThe Age of Titans.â The title comes from Lionel Cassonâs books that remain excellent sources as well, âThe Ancient Marinersâ and âShips and Seamanship in the Ancient World.â If you are interested in the archaeological discoveries off Sicily, see Archaeology Magazineâs âThe Weapon that Changed Historyâ (http://www.archaeology.org/1201/features/sicily_rome_carthage_navy_rams.html) and peer-reviewed article is coming out in the next Journal of Roman Archaeology.  Also visit RPM Nautical Foundationâs website: http://www.rpmnautical.org/. As such rare artifacts, very little is known about them and there is a lot of room for research. However, the Athlit Ram found off Israel had some excellent research on casting and ramming done, which is published in âThe Athlit Ramâ by Casson and Richard Steffy.

The description has been generalized for the wide audience, anyone that would like specifics on the history, archaeology, publications, or methodology can ask!

I am looking for advice or suggestions on how to approach reconstructing the engineering of these rams. It is not that I am at square one, in fact I am certain I will get plenty of useable data from the FEA and impact tests, but Iâm sure there are some new ideas or techniques out there that might work. Iâm all about trying new methods and looking at data across disciplines or specialties. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome; I hope some of you will want to participate on this unique discovery. Reddit has been a benefit to archaeology in the past, connecting scientists and specialists of various backgrounds together to discover new things, so what do you think? Anyone have any ideas?

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/YQ2eY)
where the magnet would theoretically be able to move freely around either via little wooden wheels or spheres in a groove between the magnet and the interior of the belt, or somehow encasing the magnet in water inside the belt.

If the magent were able to always point North in this way, then it would remain to turn this into an haptic sensation, perhaps by wearing some kind of skin tight uniform magnet under the belt to produce a sensation of tugging in the north direction(would this interfere with the behaviour of the compass magnet?) or perhaps somehow the movement of the wooden beads could be translated into some kind of physical sensation?

My girlfriend is a civil engineer, just went from working at a municipal engineering consultant to working for our city's engineering department. She manages the inspection and maintenance of the water main network.

The question is: Should there be lock out/tag out procedures when inspection or maintenance is being done on an active but temporarily shut off water main? The way she explained it, one department controls the vales for the main and then another group goes in and does the maintenance. 

But if something similar were happening at my mine, I believe the person doing the work would need to have a lock and tag on the valve to prevent it from inadvertently being opened while they were inside the pipe. When I tried to explain it to her she didn't even think it was possible.

Anyone have experience with this kind of work?

50,What bearings for a pan/tilt head?,1350348082,"Hi and thank you.

Where I'm coming from:

I'm building a pan tilt head.  Maximum weight on the head will be 2kg.  I've got NEMA17s for motion.  I have access to metal folding, drilling, and tapping.  I have access to a small 3D printer.  I have solidworks 2011.  I'm only familiar with 608 bearings.  I want to maximize for accuracy and repeatability, minimize for price and custom pieces.

My plan so far: 

I'm thinking I'll could use two metal L brackets and a base plate.  The larger L will be attached to a base with printed gear/sprocket to make it pan left/right.  The smaller L will be attached to the larger, also with printed gearing, to make it tilt up/down.  In order to eliminate play I'm thinking I need a pair of needle thrust bearings.  For example, A bolt would pass through the large L, a 3d printed gear, bearing 1, the base plate, bearing 2, a lock washer, and finally a nut.

Am I overdoing it?  I'm know very little about bearings and what's best to source.  I'm told needle thrust is a lot cheaper than roller thrust.  Being in Canada it's tough to source McMaster Carr.  I've been looking at Koyo TPK bearings.  They're large enough that I suspect I'll need to print a bearing block, which gives me a new headache.

* How important is geometry? Can I make a long rectangular loop antenna?

61,"Removed TV antenna, reception improved. Why?",1350264634,"Living without cable is something I've been doing for over a year now.  I decided I can get by with just over the air or online for most stuff I watch anyways.  I picked up a relatively cheap RCA passive antenna when I first got this TV.  It was OK, but the short 4 foot cable limited the location I could place it.  I then added a length of coax with a connector so I could move it to the window.  This again helped, but I still suffered signal drop.  My next move was to add a amp (10db) in line right after the antenna and before the coax.  Again this seemed to help, but I would still get signal drop particularly on specific channels.

Here is were my real confusion comes in.  I was planning on moving the antenna to a few places and seeing if this would improve the reception.  As part of this I unhooked the antenna from the amp.  The TV still received signal.  I watched for a while and I have yet to see a signal drop.  I still have the amp and coax attached.

While writing this post I've gotten curious and detached the amp as i can't see how having it attached would help.  Still got signal.

Is my open ended 12 foot coax cable by itself a better receptor than the purpose made RCA antenna?  Was having the antenna attached just adding noise and interference or is there something else going on here?

[Short version]
Improved my TV reception by going from this design:

Because the stuff I need to heat up, should reach about 185Â° C, I wanted to have a plate which is about 170Â° C warm (to pre-heat the material and speed up the process), and has a hole in the middle, which should get heated up to approximately 500Â° C (I want to move the printhead over the to-be-heated-up-stuff in a certain speed).  
Now the difficult part: I want to heat the plate using a high-resistance wire (e.g. Constantan) and a certain voltage. Because I need to have a plain surface, I wanted to mill a deepening into the surface of the plate.  
I thought that milling the required shape out of aluminium(ceramic would be even better (because it's ""reflecting"" the heat and wouldn't need the following step))and anodize it might be a good idea, but I'm not aware if the anodized layer is still isolating the aluminium shape at high temperatures (like 500-600Â° C).

79,Best method to weld two really skinny wires together?,1350117008,"Background:  I have spools of metal threads (Stainless steel).  As I use a spool, I am ~~weld~~ induction heater-ing the end of that to the start of a new spool, so I get a really long thread.  These threads are thin and slightly vary (Ballpark of 0.03mm).  By vary I mean, I'll always weld 2 wires of the same thickness together, the thicknesses may vary a little.

Currently: We take the two threads, make a cross, do an electric weld at the cross, use hands to break off the 2 ends, and use a fine grinding wheel to trip off the excess to make it nice and flat.

Problems:  

* Quality of the weld sucks.  If you pull on the two ends, the break is essentially 100% at the weld point.  I know its going to be the weakest place, but I'd like to be at even 30% of the original strength (of an unbroken wire).

* Uniformity of the wire sucks.  Because of the nature of the process, always end up with either a wire that is slightly thick at the spot of the weld, or grinded down just a little too much.

90,"Should I be in an engineering curriculum, or should I be at a votech?",1350059425,"I've never functioned well in an academic environment. I've always been a somewhat smart cookie, at least by standardized test scores, but my grades have always been mediocre at best. By the end of just about every school semester, I'm doing grade triage.

I'm only two months into my freshman year, but it seems like this is going to go the same way high school did. This time around, though, I know passing my the skin of my ass isn't going to happen; I'm aware that this isn't a light thing anymore.

I meet with a counselor every week, and I'm working on getting good study habits going. Unfortunately, I need to be considering the alternatives if the study habits thing doesn't work out.

As far as the engineering curriculum goes, I'm starting to wonder if I'm chasing after the wrong job description. My Intro to CE teacher-not a professor, this guy has a day job at a consulting firm-is really driving engineering as a design-based career. I think what I'm actually looking for is *fabrication*. 

As far as I can tell, engineering is a day job in an office with air conditioning and a chair. I'm aware that a cushy desk job is far from what I'm looking for in a career. I want something dirty, in whatever environment nature, or the nature of the job itself, provides. I want mud, dirt, metal shavings, and burn marks on my clothes. I want to see something built at the end of the day, a project whose progress was something I had been directly involved in.

Are there any engineering careers like I'm seeking, or am I looking for a different career?

I know I'm a very hands-on type of person. I took welding in high school and loved every minute of that class. I loved being able to see the sun in the mornings and afternoons. I loved the immediate attention demanded by the electric arc creating a puddle of molten steel mere inches from my fingers as I joined two pieces of plate together. The results were immediately available. You could look and instantly tell if the weld was good (for the class, not by pro standards).

The problems with me just hopping over to a votech are that it seems like I wouldn't be fulfilling my potential and people don't have as much respect for trade skills. I produce good quality work when I actually complete an academic task, but I rarely initiate work on one. I should be fully capable of handling the coursework for a BE in Civil Engineering, yet I'm bombing this semester. If I talk to some people about switching over to a votech, they act like I'm talking about throwing my life away. People ask if I'm interested in doing mindless manual labor.

My Question for you out there is what should i build? I couldn't think of anything today that got me exited about building. If nothing else just to help me get ideas flowing this would help.

What we have as restraints:
- I don't know much programming, i do have some time to learn though before the 4 weeks start.

- 4 weeks with 90min block scheduling, so about 20 classes and that means a maximum of 30 hours with access to the shop.

- Materials can't be too expensive, i'm in highschool, so no ridiculous sharks with lasers attached to their heads

What we do have:
- CNC machine 

- Lathe
- Mill

- Drill press

- ban saw, table saw, jigsaw, circular saw. 

- Autodesk Inventor

- Soldering equipment and wire, tons of wire.

- A local RC hobby store (hobby hanger) which has a ton of materials, and just other basic home improvement stores.

The locations were staked using gps technology. I do not believe the issue to be Builder damage because of the trend of all faulty location occurring at street radii.

I spend ~90% of my day working, properly, on my assignments, attending lectures and labs, reading through my books and understanding the material that I learn in lecture. By properly, I mean that I start all my assignments ahead of time so that I am not just copying the solution manuals the night before they are due to get a proper mark. The rest of my time is allotted to getting at least 7- 8 hours of sleep and my personal hygiene. 

I attend every lecture and listen closely with out distraction so that I can take in every piece of information. I am very proactive with the material and often am meeting with other classmates to review material and help others understand theorems, concepts, and difficult problems. I am very organized. Everything has it's own spot. I mean EVERYTHING. It's borderline OCD. 

In light of these things, I can firmly say that I know the material very well. Everyone always expects me to produce great marks. Yet, I don't.

 I really have no clue how I can be more efficient with my preparation, yet still, the marks come in and I am below average. So I am coming to you with these questions: 

* To those of you who are now successful engineers, how did you make it through university with gold stars? 

* What was your system for exam preparation that got you the marks that properly reflected the work you put in? 

* Often the exam questions are very similar to ones that I have done out of the book. But the way they are presented make it very difficult to interpret and complete within the given time. How did you prepare for these kinds of twists?

What minimum amount of resources would you need to eventually develop an industrial society?,1349891574,"I've always been curious about how much we depend on existing infrastructure to perpetuate an industrial / post-industrial society. The idea isn't all that original either - think Robinson Crusoe, Swiss Family Robinson, and countless other fictional accounts. Perhaps it's something deep in our nomadic psyche that compels us to long for new lands. Perhaps it's just mere curiosity. Either way, it's the ultimate disaster recovery engineering challenge.. how could you rebuild everything we have now if it were all destroyed without, well, taking 100,000 years or however long it took our species to do it naturally?

If we were to strip away all our infrastructure and all we had were our brains and plenty of hands, could we rebuild it quick enough to prevent slipping back into the stone age? What sorts of limitations would you run into?

Let's say you and a small population were transported to an earth-like planet (for the sake of simplicity, let's try to eliminate as many weird variables as possible.. for all intensive purposes, let's just assume this other place is basically planet earth minus all human influence). What could you do with little more than the knowledge that you have? If it makes a difference, suppose you have a couple trinkets from earth. Maybe a laptop that has an archive of wikipedia and a handful of engineering / science textbooks? 

Unless hunting &amp; gathering seemed to be an easier solution for the medium term, my first goal would be 1. start farming, and 2. animal husbandry. Once food / shelter are figured out, I'd try and build some sort of [bloomery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomery), and attempt to smelt iron ore or whatever types of metallic ore I can find. (I suspect iron ore looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0NTLo.png) so I'll know how to identify it in the wild.) Then I'd try to figure out a way to turn that smelted metal into wire. Then I'd try and find a magnetic rock (which for all I know would be as difficult as finding a gold nugget in the woods). Then I'd try to use my wire and magnetic rock to build an electric generator, and build a water wheel or something to power it. Not quite sure what i'd do from there, but hopefully from there I can at least figure out a way to charge the laptop without blowing it up.

Pretty sure I'm not capable of doing all that with what I know right now, but hopefully I'm not the smartest one in the colony.. and hopefully the area we're transported to is rich with natural resources! At any rate, if I could accomplish all that, I suspect that could at least get us to the 15th century or so. Maybe my next goal would be to try and build a transistor, although I suspect that would take considerable more infrastructure to create [after looking at a picture of the first transistor built](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg).

22,Design Engineer vs Site Engineer/Project Management career advice,1349881305,"Hi,

Just looking to hear a few opinions. Here is my situation: I'm currently in Queensland Australia finishing my final year of a Civil Engineering degree. Up until a few days ago I had planned for next year to take up a graduate structural design role with a small consultancy firm. 

This was however until another possible opportunity was presented to me (through a friends dad), which I don't know too much about just yet, but is what is thought to be a Site Engineer/Project Management role on a large gas pipeline installation project. It is thought it would be a Fly in Fly out job with long working days. Whilst I am still learning about this new role, the stated starting salary is 1.8 times that of the consulting role.

So basically it has got me thinking about what sort of engineer I want to be. I've always enjoyed calculating things, which is why a design role has been my main interest. However on the other hand, the money in the project management type roles often seems to be superior, and I do enjoy being outdoors slightly more then behind a desk. I'm pretty good with people as well.

What do you feel is better when thinking long term? Should I take the money now while I'm young and have no commitments? Or should I reinforce what I have learnt by working in design.  

Thanks

TLDR - Design role in the office (less money) or Onsite project management (more money)

3) The change in angle of the ""axel"" from its previous position

I'm using two encoders, one on each wheel. Here's a picture of what I'm trying to do: http://i.imgur.com/T0dAn.png

The bottom shows the initial position of the axel and wheels. The encoders can tell me the distance they travel because I know the gear ratio, wheel diameter, etc.

The top axel is its position after moving. Here's where I'm having trouble. Trying to use trig to find the lengths of the red lines (x and y displacement of the center). What's the best way to do this?

I *think* (pretty sure I'm wrong) that the green line would always be equal to the total left distance minus total right distance. This makes an isosceles triangle with one side equal to this difference and two sides equal to ""width"" (which is distance between wheels). So law of cosines finds the angle theta.

34,Low cost break-away fluid coupling,1349766141,"Hi all,

I'm looking for a bit of guidance in designing a low-cost break-away fitting for a fluid dispensing device. In short, we have a injection molded plastic bottle that must interface through the bottom surface with an instrument. I need a fluidic fitting on the bottom of the bottle that will remain nominally closed (under 1ft head pressure), will open upon being pushed onto the mating fitting, and will close upon straight removal. Here's a few of my functional requirements:


1) low cost

2) bottle side fitting resists ~1psi in nominal closed position

3) instrument side fitting may be nominally open

4) fluid connection engages/disengages with simple push/pull action - no secondary action needed (button release, etc)

5) both fitting should be capable of being installed in injection molded components

6) Relatively easy cleaning/servicing is a big plus.

I'm learning a lot and having a good experience at GE.

I'm hoping that when things reach a bit of a lull I can convince him to start teaching me more about what the project manager job entails. This is great for getting practical experience and learning how to keep things going while balancing budgets, but I really want to see the other side of the coin though.

I want to get some experience in what it takes to start with an idea, analyze the feasibility of it, prototype it, bring together specialists who can make the individual plans work as good as or better than the design, and get something put together to show the world (and investors) that it is possible.

In a sense, that's what I've been doing at GE, but it's always a redesign or a subtle change to something that already exists and it's all been done before. I want to know what it's like to break new ground and develop technologies that have haven't been fully explored before.

I don't know how far my Co-op and previous work/research experience will get me considering that my ~3.0 GPA is an auto-bounce for a lot of big R&amp;D outfits and defense/aerospace companies. It seems like any type of smaller startup that would get me the experience I'm looking for is really only interested in picking up people who have a Masters or higher as they can't really waste time on growing someone who they don't think can contribute at that level. I get along well with people and can interview like a beast, but knowing what niche to look in for that opportunity is where I'm kind of lost.

I'm in the planning stages, and could use your input.",1349658619,"The goal is to create a lightweight, powered accessory system for safety. It would be great to be able to build an Android app that can act as the control interface, but I want to get the basics down first.

Power: I was thinking of building or buying a dynamo. I need something that can power 3-4 USB devices with minimal drain on the bike's momentum. Cheap, wheel mounted dynamos create a lot of drag, but I don't know the first thing about the expensive hub-mounted dynamos. It would be fun to build one myself, but I'm sure it would be less reliable, and not as good as the hub dynamos, so I'll shove that onto the backburner for now.


    Does anybody have a better suggestion for power generation, or a particular dynamo to use/avoid?

    If I had to use a 12v dynamo, would I be able to use a 12v usb car charger to convert the power? 

    Would I first need to store the power in a battery to get a constant supply? 

    Would a cellphone battery be sufficient to prevent power fluctuations?

    What kind of circuitry would I need to build this system properly?



Accessories: I want to mount an HTC Inspire 4g (this will change as I change phones), LED visibility lights, and a helmet or handlebar mounted camera. 

    I need suggestions for a camera that is powerful enough to read license plates at night, 
    while still being as small as possible.

    The headlight drain is negligible. I currently have solar powered lights with NiMH battery 
    backup. I would replace the battery backup with the charging system, but could I harvest 
    power from the solar cells to assist the dynamo providing power to the system? Is that 
    overly complicated?

I'll edit this main post as needed for clarification, and add information as it's requested.

58,Are internships at DOD labs considered more or less valuable than internships at normal electronics companies?,1349634050,"Sorry for the career-based question -  I know many of you are not thrilled with these, but this isn't something I can ask other students...

From the perspective of hiring managers, which is more valued - internships at industry-known electronics companies (e.g.  TI, IBM, NI, etc...), or internships at DOD labs?

Is it perceived as a bonus that a person was even able to be accepted to a DOD lab (and obtain an interim security clearance)?  Or is that not worth anything?  Obviously, there's a pretty good chance you wouldn't be able to talk in any detail about projects you were involved in - so I don't know if that makes it harder for DOD internships to be beneficial for future job interviews/searches.  Is a normal electronics firm considered more valuable experience?

89,What's the difference between added weight and drag force that is directed to push a vehicle downward?,1349446471,"To clarify what I mean, if I design a vehicle (let's call it vehicle 1) with a shape that directs the air so that the drag force pushes the vehicle towards the ground, is that the same as adding a little more weight to the vehicle (vehicle 2)? In this situation, the vehicle is going downhill. 

Let's make the x axis parallel to the slope of the hill. If the horizontal force of drag is the same for both the vehicles, but the only difference is that vehicle 1 is experiencing another force in the y-axis pushing it down, wouldn't that be like adding more weight to the vehicle? 

More weight would have more rolling friction starting out, but the higher weight also adds a higher force down the hill.

Vehicle 1 would have a smaller rolling friction starting out, but also a smaller force pushing it down the hill. 

Because of those conditions, lets say both these vehicles reach the same velocity at the same point down the hill. Then the only difference in the end is that the drag force is also pushing vehicle 1 down. This in turn increases the rolling friction, but does not aid in pushing the vehicle down the hill. So am I wrong about my previous statement and that vehicle 1 would end up being slower? So there actually is a difference?",AskEngineers,gradschoolquestions,/r/AskEngineers/comments/10zr50/whats_the_difference_between_added_weight_and/

92,Need help finding a material,1349424401,"Okay, so I'm looking for a material with a certain set of properties that I'm pretty sure don't exist, but I figured this would be the place to ask. 

So I need a material with a low thermal conductivity, high stiffness, and good machinability. The part I'm going to be making is also very small (1/16"" diameter rod, &lt;1/2"" long, with some smaller features). I mention that because it makes the machining more difficult and because if it was bigger I could try to make a mold for it or something. The reason it needs to be so small is that it's going in a custom nanoindenter. 

I've ordered a thin rod of garrolite and of carbon fiber, but the garrolite is way too compliant and the carbon fiber isn't machinable enough at these dimensions. The only material that kind of fits those criteria right now is stainless steel, and at this point it looks like it's what I'll be going with unless something else comes along. 

So, does anyone have any experience with novel materials that have this odd combination of properties? I'm basically looking for a material with the conductivity of a polymer and the stiffness of a metal, but it needs to be machinable so I can't use ceramic. I'm stuck, so any advice would be great.

96,cannot find special bolt size? M4x85mm allen head,1349371700,"Hi fellow engineers.

i made a mistake when designing a part for my internship, i took priority of part simplicity vs availability of mounting screws.

Long story short i was making several aluminum spacers for firror mounts for my job/internship at my CSU's research project on atmospheric lidar.

i designed the spacer to be able to be fabricated with ease. the spacer has 2 through holes that a bolt goes through and screws into the mirror on the other side. unfortunately this requires a fairly long bolt that i cannot really find exactly. 

the bolt needs to screw into an M4 size thread and needs to be 85mm long. i found some that were 80mm but that only leaves 1 or 2 mm worth of threads on the end to bolt on, definitely not prime. i was not able to find anything quite that long online.

where would i be able to find these bolts (M4x85mm with socket wrench heads)? i need at minimum 4. only the end 1-1.5 cm needs to be threaded, but if the whole thing was threaded thatd be fine too. the parts are already off to anodizing so i need to find the 85 before i order the 80 to ensure it all works.

0,Slip in asynchronous electrical machines,1349363310,"How on earth do they work?

I mean, I know there is a rotating magnetic field generated by the stator, which in turn causes the rotor to have current flow in it, so that it will then rotate along with the magnetic field.

What I don't get is slip.  The rotor will spin at a slower speed than the stator's magnetic field!  Surely this means that the rotor will spend equal time being pushed forward and pulled backward by the field, as it (relatively) rotates through it?

How on earth does it have torque when the field is on either side of it equal amounts of time?

I had a thought that the magnetic field generated by the stator in the rotor would be synchronous with the magnetic field generated by the stator and asynchronous with the rotor, but apparently this is not the case.

36,Chemical Engineering needs urgent career advice (x-post),1349199296,"Hey everyone, so basically as the title says I need some serious advice. Right now I am in my first semester of a PhD program and I seriously think I made a huge mistake by deciding to continue school in pursuit of a PhD, and I need to decide within the next week or so what I'm going to do.
A bit of background, I graduated Fall 2011 with dual degrees in Chemical Engineering and Chemistry from a top 10 engineering university (this may be relevant because my graduate university is much lower ranked so Id figure i would just mention it, but I really have no idea). At the time I was doing research as an undergrad and enjoyed it so I figured I would apply to PhD programs. Anyway I ended up getting fully funded (along with a fellowship) at a moderately ranked university (within the top 50 or so).
I graduated a semester late (Fall 2011) and I am now in my first semester of graduate school so I am essentially a year behind. After being on break for essentially 9 months (I worked part time as a research assistant at my undergrad uni) I have come to the conclusion that I really DONT want to spend the next 5 years in school. So right now I am in a program that I honestly am not happy being in. I posted a similar thread in /r/gradschool but there are mostly hard science people over there and very few engineers. So basically I would be much, much more happy if I switched into a terminal masters. I think I should probably do this before my advisor selection which occurs in the next couple of weeks.
If I do this there are a few possible outcomes: 1. I lose all funding and have to pay this current semester as well as the rest of my semesters and possibly all the money they have given me so far 2. I get to keep my tuition waiver for this semester but lose all funding 3. I somehow amazingly get to keep my fellowship as long as I do masters level research
What should I do? Is a masters degree worth pursuing at this point? Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: Applied to chemical engineering PhD program and I think i made a big mistake. Want to switch to masters so i can get out faster and get on with my professional career (actually make money). I just want to salvage my career as best as i can. I think if I stick it out and stay here for the PhD i will be miserable.",AskEngineers,gradthrowaway12,/r/AskEngineers/comments/10tr2n/chemical_engineering_needs_urgent_career_advice/

Reading through the [bunker buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_buster) Wikipedia page you can see some facts about these beasts. 

&gt; Post-war tests demonstrated the bombs were able to penetrate a 14-foot-8-inch (4.47 m) thick concrete roof, with the predicted (but untested) ability to penetrate 16 feet 8 inches (5.08 m) of concrete. 

&gt;It is stated to be able to penetrate 10-20 m of earth or 2 m of reinforced concrete.


I understand the way it works is by concentrating it's explosive force to blowing up deep in the ground thus moving massive amounts of earth. Instead of most of the forces dissipating in the air above ground.

But I read about bombs that are able to penetrate massive amounts of steel and reinforced concrete. As well as bombs able to dig themselves deep into the earth's crust.

I have thought about many ways. Under water instead of earth. But I can see issues here. Putting a hollowed space in the earth and then another reinforced wall. Such as a 50ft. space underground all around a reinforced structure.

EDIT: I have also thought about how modern day tanks defend against RPGs by exploding them before they touch the tank. But such defenses would require a lot of explosives and would need to be replenished. Which would require the client to be exposed for a given amount of time. Not to mention exposed to other bombs while the defenses where spent. ",AskEngineers,Javlin,/r/AskEngineers/comments/10tf5e/how_do_they_build_impenetrable_bunkers/

45,"RF Engineers, Why 50 Ohms?",1349149781,"I've always wondered why just about everything in RF engineering (and thus high-speed interconnects as well) is impedance-matched to 50 ohms. Who came up with 50 as being the standard impedance? Why not 100, or 500, 1000, or 10k ohms? Why not 377 ohms (the impedance of air if I recall correctly)?

Is 50 ohms really the ""best"" impedance to use assuming RF components could be matched to whatever value we specified?

Bonus question: When amplifying an incoming RF signal (say a -120 to -90dBm 2.4GHz radar signal) up to an ADC that has a 1V full-scale, how do you amplify the signal and match the ADC's high input impedance to get the most out of your power (i.e. instead of amplifying to a higher 50-ohm signal, amplify it at a 10k ohm impedance with fewer stages)...

EDIT: For clarification for the bonus question, [here's what I had in mind:](http://i.imgur.com/3Pk5X.png)

Can anyone offer advice on how to secure an internship for the summer when I don't meet most of the GPA cutoffs?",1349115821,"My major is actually Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering but that was a little long to put in the title. I go to one of the top engineering schools in the country (top 15).

I have a 2.3 cumulative GPA. I did poorly my freshman year and only a little better my sophomore year. I kind of got ripped off (even though I know it is all my fault) because all of my bad grades (about 4 D's) were in 3-4 credit courses and I missed a C by ~1% for each course. 

I desperately need an internship this Summer and am worried because it seems that most companies will not even take a glance at your resume unless you meet a certain GPA. Besides my GPA I have relevant work experience and have many good leadership roles in various clubs. My school is one of the most recruited engineering schools in the country and has a career system where you upload your resume/transcripts and companies list what they are looking for. However, they won't even allow you to apply unless you meet their cutoff.

So, my questions:

1. Are there any other good websites/resources that list companies looking for petroleum engineers that let you apply on their website?

2. Now that I am a junior I am finally in the courses within my major. I am working very very hard this semester and hopefully will get ~3 GPA for this semester. Is it considered lying/bad to apply to companies using my GPA within my major as my GPA when I apply to companies in the Spring? I was thinking on my resume I'd put ""GPA Within Major: X"" and leaving out the cumulative GPA.

3. When I apply now, should I still include my 2.3 GPA on my resume or just wait until they ask for it? I read that if you have a bad GPA it is optional to put it on (as of now it is not on my resume), but I feel like it is different for engineers.

4. I know that most internships are given in the Fall, and I have also heard that once you apply to companies, if they do not accept you, you have to wait a year to apply again. Is this true? And if so, should I just wait until the Spring to apply to the companies I really want to work for (assuming I get a good GPA this semester)?

5. I talked to multiple engineering companies that seemed interested in me, however they were not petroleum related. I really want an internship in a petroleum company, but should I still apply to all of these general-engineering internships? Would it be better for my future career to have an internship at a respected company that is not focused on petroleum engineering, or to intern at a small, more unknown oil company?

6. Anyone need a hard-working petroleum engineer? (Joking, but not really)..

50,Help me harness the wind.  Electrical question about my wind turbine project.,1349101967,"Dear Physics-Savvy Redditors,

I am in the process of building my own small wind turbine for a proof-of-concept generator.  Ideally, in its finished form, this wind turbine will have the ability to charge a cell phone and keep an LED bulb on for several hours. I already have designs for a rig and the blades for the turbine, itâs the electrical component of this project that has me confused. Essentially, I can get the blades to spin at a good speed and give me an inconsistent output.  Please let me know how to harness this output, store it, and convert it into steady, useable electricity.  

Here is what I have so far:

I have 3 motors to choose from: 

       -Motor from a room fan (it reads A.C 120V 60Hz) http://imgur.com/AUCzQ,pxjdB,LkKpB,zQ2iy,DctM2,DQSMH#2

       -Standard computer motor

       -Motor from an old coffee grinder (it reads 120V/60Hz)
http://imgur.com/AUCzQ,pxjdB,LkKpB,zQ2iy,DctM2,DQSMH#1

-Lithium Ion rechargeable battery (it reads 7.4V 2200mAh). I am also interested in buying a rechargeable 12V battery once I learn what size Iâll need) http://imgur.com/AUCzQ,pxjdB,LkKpB,zQ2iy,DctM2,DQSMH#4

-Standard 9V battery

-LED bulb(s)

-Old cell phone (doesnât matter if I overload it or anything) and two chargers (these can be cut) 
http://imgur.com/AUCzQ,pxjdB,LkKpB,zQ2iy,DctM2,DQSMH#5

-Multimeter (I know how to measure the DCV, but thatâs about it) http://imgur.com/AUCzQ,pxjdB,LkKpB,zQ2iy,DctM2,DQSMH

-Wires (thin gauge, not sure about the number but I put them in the 22/20 hole in the wire stripper)


Things I think I will need:

-12V rechargeable battery, as mentioned before

-Voltage rectifier (to make sure the power only moves in one direction, from the turbine to the battery and not the other way around)

-Some type of inverter to make sure I get the type of current I need at a steady and consistent output (Iâm not sure what that is)

I appreciate your help. The world of electricity has eluded me for some time, but I would love to be able to understand and build this sort of thing.  Please assume I am new to all these concepts and include links if there is a buyable device that I need.  Thanks again.

66,I've got a business degree but want to go into engineering. What are my options?,1348985286,"I started undergrad in aerospace engineering but switched to international business after the first 2 years. After working for a couple years, I did my MBA and have been working for about 4 years in business intelligence and sales analysis.

I'm now 32 and not really enjoying the level of work I'm doing. Simply, I know I can do more interesting technical work and it still bugs me I didn't finish an engineering degree.

Right now I'm looking at going back to school and one of the ideas is to do something around the area of mechatronics, autonomous vehicles, etc. Basically, I want to play with the kind of stuff they do at [Stanford CARS](http://me.stanford.edu/groups/design/automotive/)

It's likely I would aim at getting a masters or doctorate in the field.

My main questions are:

- What's the best option for going from a non science background to being accepted at a graduate engineering program?
- What would the job options look like once I finish? Would I have to start at the bottom of the ladder?
- Do you know anyone that has taken this kind of path and would they have any advice?

Any other random advice would be great too.

Details inside.",1348952602,"Let's say I use 304 SS to make certain parts of a telescope. Such an instrument is typically used at night. Dew formation on the metal and glass parts is pretty normal, but it depends on location, season and weather. Some times you get plenty of dew, other times it's dry.

Grime and dirt should not occur. The instrument is expected to stay fairly clean most of the time. It's high precision optics, so cleaning is part of regular maintenance.

Rain should not be a problem, but perhaps once in a few years, Mother Nature may ""gift"" me a surprise shower before I can reach shelter. Otherwise the instrument should not be exposed to rain.

Another factor: airborne salt from the ocean, if used in a coastal area. This is known to astronomers to shorten the lifetime of the ultra-thin reflective aluminum coating on the mirror. However, it is not a problem inland.

Finally, pollution from any industrial entities nearby. This varies a lot with location.

The surface of the metal may be mirror-polished, regular polished, or ""brushed metal"". Not sure yet.

When two metal items (including fasteners) touch each other, they are both 304 SS. There is no contact with a different metal anywhere. Some SS items may be MIG welded with SS filler.

The usage pattern may vary between a few nights each month, to 1 day out of 2. The duration of each session is between 30 min and several hours.

When not used, the instrument is sitting in a garage.

I know it's not much as far as the engineering industry goes, but I am not willing to accept a life doing anything else for a living aside from being part of a design team and would rather starve than do anything else.

I have several questions if anyone is willing to take the time to answer them,

1. Will a portfolio of designs and completed projects be worth the effort?  I've used what I've learned in my courses for my own projects and have actually constructed them, I like to think that I am creative and think outside the box, but part of me is guessing that an entry-level CAD user is not supposed to ""think outsode of the box"" or be creative.  Am I wrong in thinking that?

2.  I'm getting nearly perfect scores, is that important?  I know a certificate isn't much, but I'd rather not sit on my butt and wait another year before thinking I can apply somewhere.  Is there some way I can use my dedication and drive to show that I am not just ""passing the time""?  I can present many aspects of my courses, but am not sure which ones to include.  

3.  I've heard stories of people creating unique presentations and getting jobs that they may not have otherwise.  I've considered creating a hardcover ""book"" outlining my work, but at $20 a pop it's quite a gamble for someone who is delivering pizzas while focusing on getting a certificate and building a portfolio.  I have no trouble gambling on it if the hive mind thinks it would be worth a shot.  I also would not mind creating a video, but I would prefer to do something new I can add to my list of skills and something physical and tangible would seem better than a simple online portfolio.

4.  What types of projects get the attention of those who make decisons?  Although I prefer to work on ""architecture"" type projects, I feel just as comfortable creating mechanical models, hand sketching in 2D and 3D, and adding artistic features to ""plain"" CAD drawings for emphasis.

5.  Anything I might have missed?  My long term goal is to be part of a team that creates landscapes and buildings that are artistic, unique, and functional.

There are two pieces, concentric tubes, with threading between them to hold them together (like the lid on a bottle cap). The internal piece that is attached to a water supply and the external piece has a stopper gasket that turns the valve on and off. When you turn external piece a gasket presses against an opening to stop the water flow, kind of like a hose nozzle. Screwing and unscrewing the two pieces lets you adjust the volume of water, but the two pieces can be unscrewed completely apart for cleaning purposes. 

Here's my problem: I want to add a break/stop/catch so you can unscrew the valve to maximum water flow, but you have a moment of resistance before the two pieces come completely apart.

I've been considering grooves in the tread or snaps, but all of these options would require undercuts in the external piece, making it more expensive and difficult to mold. 

I don't really know where to begin researching (apart from looking at existing products at my local hardware store or Target) because I don't know what I should search for. What is this feature called? What are other products do this well? Where should I begin my online search?

_________________________________________________________

Dear Hiring Manager:

I saw the job posting for Civil and Railroad Engineers in Chicago on Careerbuilder.com and immediately took a strong interest. As a graduate from Bradley Universityâs civil engineering program and an active volunteer with Engineers Without Borders, I have developed the necessary skills to excel as an engineer at Quandel Consultants. 

For my senior design project I worked with a small group to design the remediation and redevelopment of a contaminated steel mill site, all under the guidance of the contracted engineering firm, Elm Consulting LLC. AutoCAD drawings were created to accurately portray site conditions and clearly organize data. Adhering to project specifications and EPA codes was crucial. The project also featured extensive report writing in accordance with Illinois EPA standards, as well as heavy use of spreadsheets to collect and analyze data. The final cost estimate was a fraction of the competitor's and was greatly praised. This experience improved my skills in project management and teamwork. Additionally, I have completed many courses that thoroughly developed the required skills such as drafting (both by hand and with AutoCAD), interpreting schematics and blueprints, abiding by specifications and codes, and estimating costs. 

I obtained leadership experience during my two year stint as the Head of Photography for the Bradley Scout. I managed a large and dynamic staff. Since the locations, times, and types of local events were different from week to week, I developed strong project management and problem solving skills to ensure deadlines were met and quality results were produced. Similarly my work experience in developing/maintaining an effective and user friendly retail website demanded problem solving ability.

Additionally, since graduating I have become involved in Engineers Without Borders. This volunteer organization provides engineering solutions to poor communities outside of the United States. During my time with the organization I have worked side by side with engineering professionals to research technology alternatives during the design phase of projects and am currently a member of the Communications Committee to improve coordination.  

As a frequent travel on Chicago's Metra, CTA, and Amtrak train lines, I have a strong interest in working for Quandel Consultants. I firmly believe that the convenience, efficiency, and status as a primary means of reducing environmental damage makes railroads one of the best ways to travel. As such, I'm particularly excited about the involvement of Quandel Consultants in Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. I have attached a copy of my resume and look forward to scheduling an interview with you to further discuss my qualifications.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

The tool grips the pipe and applies torque which is measured by a load cell attached to the back. The load cell is tied off to a wire rope at 90 degrees...or at least it's supposed to be.

I know the guage on the load cell will read differently than the actual torque to applied to the pipe as the angle on the wire rope changes on a horizontal plane.

Will the load reading vary from actual torque applied when the angle of the wire rope changes vertically? 

Does this make sense? What else can I add to help?

Edit 1: Here is a youtube video showing the setup in action. Sorry for the long links, I suck at Reddit.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq0cM53mndo&amp;feature=related

The torque applied to this pipe is probably around 7,000+ ft. lbs.

Edit 2: The load cell is attached 30"" from the fulcrum (center of the pipe). Moment arm? The distance between the pipe and where the wire rope ties off can't change. The variable is in the length of the wire rope they use and the height of the tool from the floor. 

Let's say the wire rope is 5 ft. long and it is rigged up squarely. In this case everythng is in spec and reads flawlessly. Lift the tool 3 ft. and now the radius of the wire rope throws off all that perfect geometry...

However, pretty much everyone else says that objectives are a waste of space, that the person reviewing your resume knows what job you are looking for from either an online application or from your cover letter.

0,How can I sell my atypical engineering experience?,1348778935,"Hello AskEngineers,


I am currently halfway through my masters degree in manufacturing engineering.  I've just come from my schools career fair a bit ago with some mixed signals.  I am convinced that I have had some good experiences working with industry, but that I may not have conveyed it very well, so I'd like to ask how I might be able to spruce up my presentation a bit.


As for some background, I have B.S. degrees in Environmental Science and Sociology with an additional A.A.S. in Computer Aided Design.  I became interested in manufacturing when I found that my areas of environmental interest and design can fit into the manufacturing theme/mentality.  


I work for my schools manufacturing engineering department, in which I teach solids modeling and advanced product design.  I've lead facility optimization projects, energy and material optimization projects, zero waste to landfill initiatives, and been involved with assessing products for their environmental impact. 


I would introduce myself to the companies at the fair, express my interest in working with lean/green manufacturing and/or design (I'm also not opposed to process control and engineering either).  Tell them about some of my experiences and where I would like to go, and from there, most would seem to give me the ""apply online"" or ""we're not sure you're a good fit for us.""  Maybe they're being completely honest, but I can't shake the impression that the companies aren't impressed or convinced that I can do the job.  I've been fighting somewhat of an uphill battle since joining the program (as my undergraduate is not engineering). 


Although, as I said, I think I have some good applied experience, it might seem as though people look at my academic background and are immediately a bit put off, as typical manufacturing *seems* to revolve around process control and engineering.  Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.  ",AskEngineers,daywalkin_ginge,/r/AskEngineers/comments/10kz5n/how_can_i_sell_my_atypical_engineering_experience/
1,I Need a SciFi Plotfix: How would a Brain-to-Brain Communication Technology work?,1348773732,"**TL;DR:** How would you explain the engineering of it in a SciFi Novel?

I'm writing a novel on the development and research (and later publicity and controversy) of a Brain-to-Brain communication technology (in the novel called ConM), and what I'm missing now is the engineering side of the development and research / conceptualization. 

                                                  ***
[...]
**TL;DR:** First Draft of a Process: recognise Brain Patterns and then recreate them on an implant on another brain chemically or electrically.


                                                  ***

So here are my questions to anybody willing to answer:

* **What research do we need / have we done** (in Electrical Engineering / Bioengineering) to make this possible?

* **How would one recreate emotions in another's brain?** What stimuli would one use to incite common feelings (feelings of love / happiness)? (In the case of happiness) Dopamine right? (And drugs generally.) So is there a way to have the brain make it mechanically--of course, barring the relevant innovations/research and nanotechnology--or on command? And would electricity carry out the same? (Electrical stimuli of brain regions to recreate the sensations of another person through one's own connections/associations in place. After all the brain is fired up electrically if what I'm led to believe is correct.)

* **Could nanotechnology carry out such a goal** (in any defined time)? And if so, what level do you think it could be carried out to? Up to sending words? Thoughts? Emotions?

* **What specific technology would be required?**

* If you were trying to explain the technology **how would you explain it?**

* Are there any toxicity concerns to be had? (Assuming the technology is implemented as a nanotechnology.)

* **How would we know what a brain is expressing in language?** Do we just zoom in (mechanically) closer to the neurons? Scan more closely? What other ways of scanning thoughts do you suppose apart from my generalised explain-away (brain pattern recognition), and is bpr the best way to scan for emerging thoughts?

Anyway I think this is an interesting topic and would love to discuss this more with other engineers. 

My current ability lies far out from Electrical Engineering, Bioengineering (I'm just the start of my biomedical course), and nanotechnology however. Which I think you can tell.

                                                   ***

Sidenote: This all reminds me of Carl Sagan's coming to an Astrophysicist(?) to ask for the jargon to allow his protagonist to fall in and out of something. The engineer came up with the word wormhole and later expanded on it as something that might really happen. At least that's an example of 'Life imitating Art*. At least that's the anecdote I remember from my Astrophysics class.

In addition: I don't want to explain away the nanotechnology in the novel, which is why I ask many questions, as this is a big part of the book and a major part of my procrastination (my lack of nanotechnology/bioengineering knowledge that is), and the books format revolves around getting into the issues, people and explanation of the fields. Specifically academic/funding issues, tesla/Edison people, and layman explanations. So far I've only been able to do this on the computer science / academia behind the technology and it's publicity and controversy. To say nothing of the nitty gritty engineering behind such a technology.

So logically, I need my own internet connection. But the research I have done has only made me more confused because I don't know how much speed I *need* and the internet companies do not seem to like being straightforward with their pricing.

9,Metallurgical question regarding 6000 series aluminium,1348731706,"Hello engineers, 

Had a questions regarding heat treating/artificial aging of aluminium alloys, more specifically 6000 series.

When the alloy arrives from the factory it's in a T6 tempering, which if i recall is solution heat treated(800F or 426 celcius for few hours) and then artificially aged(180-190 celcius for 4-6 hours).

When the parts are welded, the area that is near the weld loses about 80% of it's strength(i can confirm, i was the aluminium).

After finishing the product, can i simply put the product into an oven at 180-190 celcius, bake it for 4-6 hours and it will return to a T6 tempering state, or do I have to first solution heat treat it(~426 celcius) and then artificially age it?

Second question is regarding parts machined from round billets(lathe work) - does the material lose some of it's properties after being machined?
The problem I have is that a competitor is manufacturing from the same material(same alloy), but their alloy's hardness is much greater - can it be achieved by over-aging the material?

I have started a project at home, generating electricity from a car alternator. Looking at the data sheets from alternators I found that they can supply a large amount of power. 

My current set up is:

I have removed the rear tube and tyre from the rear of a push bike and with some frames I have attached a belt to the alternator, however the biggest problem is that the speed is not consistent. (after a period of time I start to peddle irregularly which is a problem for power generation and just the general life of the alternator)

So the solution is a flywheel. (I think) I don't have the money to buy a giant lump of steel to provide the storage of energy, so my idea was that I create a hollow cylinder with paddles on the inside and fill the cylinder with water.

The idea is that the water resists any change dynamically so I don't damage the belt when I'm trying to start the flywheel. I'm wondering how feasible would this be and what are some recommendations  that you ME's (or others) have.

33,Questions about devices with fingerprint sensors?,1348598218," Hi engineers,

 I have a motorola Atrix which has some kind of fingerprint sensor that allows me to swipe my finger to unlock it. After about a year of use it still seems to be working fine, so I have a couple questions:

1. How much does it cost to add a fingerprint sensor to a device? I mean, ignoring the cost of programming a device to read the sensor, how much does it actually cost for a reliable sensor? (I'm assuming there's a range based on how good you want it to be. Let's say I'm looking for one that's 3-5+ years durable under proper care, but with no particular limits on how precise or imprecise it is. One as precise as is on the Motorola Atrix would be plenty.)

2. A question for Linux developers: Is it possible (and feasible) to set up a privileges system such that a device equipped with a fingerprint sensor will typically run under a lowest privilege, but when someone swipes their finger, it will automatically (if it recognizes them) unlock privileges equal to the level of their login for a set period of time? Sorry if it's a silly question, I'm not really a linux expert.

39,Low Pass Filter is just not working - details inside,1348555888,"Hi all,
I am stuck on a low pass filter. I have designed a few before but something is messed up with this one, despite its simplicity. I simulated the results I wanted, and went straight into a PCB version of it, populated it, tested it and my results were off. I re-populated the circuit in hopes it was a population error with the same results. I also used a continuity check across every resistor/cap/IC pin in case I made a solder bridge underneath and it all checks out. I am totally stuck and it actually became a huge development block for me so I am hoping that by reaching out, I can learn what went wrong. Here's the dirt:


The math: 
Texas Instruments Guide I followed: 
http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa049b/sloa049b.pdf
Section 6 Low-Pass Sallen-Key Architecture

Using the filter tables (I needed a 4th order filter to reduce complexity and sufficient filtering)
(s^2+0.76537s+1)(s^2+1.84776s+1)

and knowing that

H(s) = K / (s^2+(1/Q)s+1)
for stage 1, I wanted a gain (K) of 1, Q then ended up as 1.3066
for Stage 2, I needed a gain of 4.443 (for the particular application) so Q became 0.5411


Component Values &amp; Circuit:
4.443V Gain 11840 kHz cutoff frequency (thats basically what I needed)

Simulation:

I have the LTSpice sim file if anyone wants it but it's essentially identical to what you see. 

Actual:
http://i.imgur.com/hzV6c.jpg

Now when I tested it in the lab, my gain fell much too early. Around 1kHz it was about 0.4 V/V. 

Is there something I'm missing??

41,Question about a semi ethical dilemma.,1348534767,"I received a call from a previous coworker who was fired a few months ago with a weird request. He said that he was studying for a certification exam and that he is looking for some excel calculation sheets that he created while he was working for the company to help him study. I told him I can help with that and that I would send them over. However, as we were talking, he told me he had started a new job and was also looking for some other reference book he might have left at the office.

This got me thinking; he wouldn't really need to use these calc sheets to study for this certification exam. In fact, this got me suspicious that all he wanted was to get these sheets to use at his new job. 

Even though he was the one doing most of the work on these sheets, they are part of specific project folders, are located on the network and, I assume, belong to the company.

My question is, if I suspect that these sheets will only be used at this new company, which isn't necessarily a competitor, should I just renege on the promise and just tell him I'm uncomfortable getting him these sheets? Or does he, in any way, have a right to have these sheets since he pretty much created them? Or what if, as unlikely as I think it might be, he actually just wants them to study for that exam?

Case in point.  During final assembly of the product, a certain critical dimension is checked using a special gauge that was developed, but never implemented, by engineers in our parent company.  Well, during assembly, they cant get accurate and repeatable readings from the gauge.  The boss, an MBA, calls me out to the floor, explains to me the problem, and asks me to figure out whats going on.  

I start by looking at the design specifications (drawings, material specs, etc.) of the gauge.  I noticed that the tolerance stack-ups on the gauge design meant that the uncertainty in the measurements taken from the gauge are actually greater than the tolerance band of the critical feature being measured. 

I bring this up to my manager.  It's a design flaw in the gauge.  First off, I had to spend 20 minutes explaining what tolerances were.  After that, another 30 minutes explaining what tolerance stack ups were.

Sadly, at 18 years old I bought the lies of how good engineers are treated and how well paid they are, it made sense too, the hardest work gets good pay. What a joke, the reality is engineers are treated like dirt in this country, if you arenât now you will be soon enough. Engineering is just viewed as an expense to be minimized. I would NEVER, EVER recommend someone to become an engineer, even if it really appealed to you, as it did me.

There is no doubt the school work is much, much harder, and requires much more time. In my first weed out class the prof said you can forget about having a life for four yearsâand those left that graduated could confirm that. Taking five years is common.

Doing a business major is so much easier in relation, and you can end up with much higher pay, easy work with low stress, in relation. In most fields you can hide or blame shift mistakes, but  in engineering  the smallest mistake in a system with a million connecting complex items can not be escaped and will cause a problem that you may work round the clock to fix.

I have dozens of US patents and have helped designed multi-billion dollar sale products, but I always hear about how much better some MBA is making it, often twice my pay for work that is really easy in relation.

I got so tired of hearing about flunkies in the oil business making huge salaries that I bought a Prius. A nice piece of engineeringâ¦ the Japanese and Germans beat us hands down in making quality products and donât expect that to change with the culture ingrained in corporate American.

Engineers were almost in high demand in the early 90's, and would have then been treated well, but corporate America avoided paying market rates by bringing floods of low paying H1B visas in from overseas who had to be slaves to the company, or have to leave the country.  This kept wages flat. Scams were used to work around H1B limitations, on youtube watch video ID TCbFEgFajGU called âPERM Fake Job Ads defraud Americansâ, itâs sickening.

Now, every developing country has invested heavily in producing engineers who will work long and hard for little pay, India, China, and on... So just like all the manufacturing jobs left the US for low paying Chinese factories, engineers will be gone too. Itâs just a matter of time. Some of my co-workers have visited some up and coming Chinese engineering firms, they were blown away by the scale of the operation. Estimates were theyâll have 20 Chinese engineers to compete against one American one.

Yes, itâs really that badâ¦ and why would you want to get into engineering?

The reality is now there is a lot of great engineering talent in the world where one foreign engineer can be paid less than what it would cost one American to pay property tax, income tax, sales tax, unemployment tax, social security and other taxes. So long term it will be impossible to compete in the global market due to the high taxes in this country.  Got that? Itâs about the taxes.

So, in order to practice engineering design, I have to design and build some sort of device that will wake up my roommate with minimal effort on my part. There are certain restrictions however:

* $25 budget
* No Injury or damage to property
* Noise/sound cannot be the waking mechanism
* No direct reaching devices (i.e. a pole)
* Pulling a string is too boring, not allowed

I am having trouble thinking of things I can design to wake someone up without using sound, and I would really appreciate any ideas or brainstorms you guys have.

67,Is it possible to cover the propellers of a quadcopter for protection?,1348434229,"My background is in electronics and computer science and I've worked on some robot projects before using Arduino and BeagleBoard.  I want to have a go at building a quadcopter next (big project, I know!) but I have absolutely no experience in aeronautics.

My question is to do with the propellers of the quadcopter. Obviously these can be dangerous as they are spinning at a really high RPM and it's common to experiment from behind a net.  What I want to know is whether it would be possible to surround the propellers with some sort of strong but lightweight mesh as this would still allow airflow but reduce the danger.

I am currently in my 3rd year of college working as an undergrad research assistant at my university's wind tunnel lab. I am trying to conduct an experiment that requires me to mount a 'double cone' like object into the wind tunnel to observe specific effects at super sonic conditions. It is essential that the double cone is axis symmetric and secured firmly when it is mounted into the wind tunnel. After talking it over with my professor we concluded that the mount (which is secured to the roof of the wind tunnel) needs to be adjustable in the x and y direction in case there are any sleight deviations. I've been researching different kind of joints to use. The basic knuckle joint caught my eye, but I am afraid that under the high wind speeds with the weight of the double cone part the fastened area will become loose. 

This sort of fixture also caught my eye (link below), but once again I'm not sure if the screw will hold tightly enough under the high speeds.

Thank you in advance for your help. I also apologize in advance for any typos or errors, I'm attempting to type this on my phone.


A little background first. I am in my junior year and this paper is for my engineering communications class. It is a paper regarding the aspect of writing involved an engineers job.


I don't need any identifying information, just your field or industry and general position.


I need three interviews from people at three different positions in their career. One from and entry-level engineer, one from a mid-level engineer (several years of experience), and lastly one from a high-level engineer (someone with a considerable amount of responsibility).


The questions are:

-What type of writing do you do for your job?

-What is the most common type of writing?

-What is the amount of time involved in your writing? (Daily or weekly)

-Is the writing easy or difficult?

-Is there any connection between promotion and writing skills?

-Did you expect writing to be an important aspect of your job?

-Were you prepared for the writing required of you?



I was hoping to get the perspective of engineers possibly in the automotive or manufacturing process industries. That is the avenue I personally hope to go down. Though anyone who is willing to complete in the survey is greatly appreciated, I always want to learn more about mechanical engineering and any insight into a new field I haven't considered is appreciated and interesting to me.



Also if anybody wants to answer my own personal questions it would be appreciated as well. I haven't completely settled on the field I would like to go into. I said automotive because I am from the Detroit area and I have been a bit of a hobbyist and tinkerer when it comes to cars. My personal preference in a job is something hands on and possibly with an outside and doing aspect. That comes from my experience in the military (tactical satellite communications), I had a very hands on technical job.

14,Is a solar/heat-powered Brayton cycle turbine feasible with improved heat exchangers like the ones in the SABRE engine?,1348087164,"I'm thinking of high temperature molten salt, like 1300 kelvin, at a large scale like 500 MW.  Since gas turbines are more efficient than steam turbines, it seems there would be a motivation to do this (and a lot of research already done on this question).

I researched this before and concluded that the big problem is making a heat exchanger able to heat the massive amounts of air required  The guys doing the SABRE engine seem to have a way to cool massive amounts of air using lots of very small tubes.

I was thinking that one could start with a really efficient gas turbine and replace the gas combustion chambers with super efficient heat exchangers.

Perhaps this is prohibitively expensive?  This sort of heat exchanger seems to be new technology, and maybe not so reliable since there are so many little tubes that could break.  Since these turbines operate continuously for months at a time, I can see any reliability issue being a huge deal.

20,I'm an Engineer currently working for a mid-sized firm and I'm thinking about going out on my own. Does anyone who's done this have stories or advice about your decision and journey to independence. [Side debate: am I crazy for not wanting to be part of company growth],1348062657,"
I started working at my current employer right out of school 11 years ago; I had done several work placements in different sectors that lead me to consulting and specifically this firm. Back then it was a small office of 15 - a branch of a much larger firm with the head office in another city. I did a wide range of work from residential retaining walls, to industrial retrofits and upgrades, to shoring design for contractors at the local mall. Most of these were smaller projects from, say, $1500 to $50,000 in fees.

Since then, we have grown to 50 and I have shifted into a strictly commercial design role, managing a small team and working in a multi-discipline setting to put up some fairly large commercial/institutional/government buildings (our last building was around $20M in construction costs). 
What's the problem?

I'm not happy. I like the challenges of coordinating between disciplines and I especially like working with an architect on little design details. The things I like, though, are outweighed by the things I hate: compressed schedules, overtaxed team members (me especially), multiple projects spreading creativity thin. Most of all I loathe office politics. We have grown to the point where the company has decided we won't do residential or insurance work on any level, nor will we work for contractors unless we have a previous relationship with them â the jobs I loved doing.

I chose to work for this company specifically because it was small and did the wide range of work. My love for my work is slowly being eroded away by growth of the company.

So, I am thinking about going of on my own. First as a sole practitioner, without any staff, basically doing the types of small jobs that my current company won't do anymore, mostly working with contractors.

As far as the amount of work out there, from my understanding the market where I am is really hurting for engineers doing that kind of work. This comes from comments from many of the contractors I currently work with that there's not enough engineers out there to help them, smaller building/property owners calling us and getting rejected and then calling back a week later telling us they've tried everybody else and they're starting the second round of calls, comments from building officials in some of the smaller towns surrounding us that no one will service their area, etc. Also, I believe that I could end it well with my firm such that they would pass on work to me they won't do, possibly bringing me on under contract for over flow during high demand periods.

**This leads me to my actual questions:**

* can anyone shed some light on how they went about getting out on their own?
* how were you able to leave it with your former company?
* how can I quantify anecdotal market information (the last paragraph above)?
* better yet is there a way to predict revenue at all?

Bottom line: **can an engineer make a living working by himself**

I have to design and make a [Rube Goldberg type of machine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=qybUFnY7Y8w#t=5s) implementing Chemical, Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, and Geomatics. (Bonus: Software, Computer, Geological). 

Specifics:

* Max 4m^2 base
* 1 unique piece (not the base; I'll be able to do this myself)
* No external power source (I.e. I can't plug it into and electrical outlet nearby)

I.e. I could do a chemical reaction where two chemicals react and makes a gas expand creating a balloon to inflate, and yadda yadda yadda.

2: Apply to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, which only requires 2 years of foreign language for guaranteed admission. Take German and a math class or two, apply for intra-university transfer.

It is a fairly crude method of investigating but it is cheap and easy.
A typical growing room would have a large air handling unit at one end that sucks air up through a return opening at the bottom and blows it into one or more ducts, which distribute air throughout the room.


The fans are speed controlled and when they run anything above 30/40% they make quite a load noise. *However*, if I shoot a jet of smoke into the return opening of the air handling unit, as soon as the smoke reaches the fan, it goes almost completely silent. Then as soon as the smoke has cleared the fan, the same roar from the fan comes back. The more smoke I use, the longer the silence. 

It does not seem like the fans slow down by any significant amount. The smoke is generated by burning vegetable oil.

**TL;DR:** Loud fan goes silent when flooded with smoke. Why?


*The smoke is killing the sound of the fan but how?

My question is should I push to advance and learn how they work? I'll have to miss some school and it may make my already twenty hour day even longer.

* How to calculate the types of forces involved, and how to determine the length/weight of ship based on how stable you need it to be? Would an even longer/heavier ship be more stable? Is the size based on technical specs, or cost effectiveness?

* What other types of ships used similar buoyancy techniques, if any?

* Could similar techniques be applied to something smaller, like a houseboat? 

* If I welded something like this (similar in scale) to the bottom of a houseboat, would it be more stable in storms and rough waves/weather?

* What calculations could i use to determine how long/heavy a much larger ship's submerged area would require to be just as stable? If a ship was twice as long, would the weight double too?

Also, I really wasn't able to find too much information about this at all, so if you have links to resources I can check out, that'd be great.

This kept happening every couple minutes the entire time I was in the store.

I'm guessing the rubber wheels were building up static against the floor and somehow the charge was getting up into the cart and getting stored around the large wire frame.

So a reasonable question for an engineer might be, how do I eliminate this problem? But I don't care about that.

I would like to know if it is possible to design a tiny Van de Graff like mechanism that would clamp onto the cart near the wheel and actively generate static by brushing against the turning wheel then transferring the static onto the body of the cart.

The wheels spin at a decent velocity, and are likely made of some kind of hard rubber or Polyurethane, you rub wool, fur, or even glass against the moving wheel and you might generate a good amount of charge.  The question is how to collect and concentrate that charge instead of letting it all run into the ground.

Basically, I need an 8ish foot pole, one end of which will rest on the ground. The other end will be pulled downward-ish with a load of around 70-100 lbs. Obviously, this will cause the pole to bend outwards.

I have been told (by a CF tube seller)  to size the pole much like I would with an aluminum one.

57,Buoyancy and viscous fluids (x-post r/engineering),1347003177,"Hey guys

I am a structural engineer in Sydney with 4 years out of uni. I had what I thought would be a fairly simple task today that raised some questions for me.

I was asked simply to review some hold down design for some very deep (1.7m, 5.5ft) polystyrene void formers. The task was from the builder who wanted to pour the full thing in one go (it's a prestressed bridge girder).

Anyway I did the uplift calculations and the results I was getting didn't seem to match up with empirically sized hold down I had seen previously. Even allowing for the time of pouring I was getting massive pressures at the base. I had two thoughts. 

Firstly I thought concrete, even wet, is not a great fluid. There's a reason we have to vibrate it - it doesn't flow perfectly. There is going to be a component that will support itself and therefore not contribute to the buoyancy (think about what water would do in a slump test and you will see what I mean about this not really being fluid, or rather being a very viscous fluid i.e. internal shear capacity). I tried a lot of searching online and found many forum posts with similar discussions but apparently no one ever considers this.

Next I thought - the concrete is pushing on the base, sure, but it's pushing on the sides too. Again, the mix is fairly viscous (especially if we use low slump concrete) and it's going to have friction with the polysterene void former. That void former cannot move up without rubbing against the wet concrete. I know the shear capacity of the sand/cement paste would not be large but it seems like something worthy of thinking about. Again this does not seem to be allowed for consideration in most texts I've found.

Basically just asking for discussion. Am I missing something about why these are not considered? If I'm correct about either then the extra resistance could be considerable..

Currently, I am a sophomore at my liberal arts school and was just curious how it turned out for those who have obtained their degree this way. Also, were you able to go to a school that was not already giving you a guaranteed spot? For example, as long as I meet specific requirements, both Columbia and Washington University in St. Louis will accept me no questions asked--however, Stanford and Berkeley really interest me.
For those of you who don't know what this is, a duel-degree program allows students to spend  four years at a liberal arts school, then go to an engineering school affiliated with the liberal arts school--earning a degree from both colleges.

59,"Ignoring illegal substances, how could we enhance a sprinter's time in track and field? ",1346989740,"So you have a world class runner who wants to improve his time. He hires you, an engineer, to engineer a full body suit, and anything you would like to add to lower his timing. He  refuses to take any illegal substances or undergo any type of surgery. This guy really is a world class runner, he is competing in all major races, both long and short - but he needs help getting there. Remember, you cannot cheat, the runner still has to run with all regulations in place, Don't do anything that would get him Disqualified, or else you lose this contract as well as any in the future. 

A recap of what are the rules: 
-No illegal substances.
-Components cannot be permanent and can be taken off at the runner's command. (i.e. You cannot 'build' a runner to run, he cannot be a cyborg)
-Must comply with current regulations. 
-Given that long distances might be easier, you can submit for long distances. For those who are not familiar with track and field, races are 100, 200, 400, 4x400,100,200; 800, 1600, 3200, and 5000m.

Segments AB and BC of the beam ABC are pin connected a small distance to the right of joint B. Axial loads act at A and at the midspan of AB. A concentrated moment is applied at joint B. Find the reaction at A, B, and C.

I split the bar at joint B and drew two separate free-body diagrams. For the right side of the bar, I have Cy and Cx at C, Bx from the pin, and the moment about B (100 ft-lb).

I solved:
Æ©Mb=10Cy-100 Cy=10

From there I took the moment of the entire bar about point A, and found By=-20 lb, which I don't think is correct.

72,"This may be the wrong place to post, but I have a question relating to balancing.",1346950715,"So this might totally be the wrong place to ask but I figured I'd give it a shot.  So basically the conundrum is this: Say you have a 155cm x 30cm x 2.5-3.8cm object made of wood.  My thought is to make this wooden object self balancing.  So say the 155cm side is perpendicular to your line of sight, and the left hand side were to dip to an angle of about -10 degrees.  My goal is to have the object, with no outside force on the object, bring itself back to 0 degrees, or flat.  My thoughts so far were to hollow out an interior section of the object, and fill about 50-66.7% of this hollowed out section with a type of fluid material.  I would also insert an object which would need to float, and which would need to outweigh the fluid material, with the thought process being that when the board tilts -10 degrees to the left, the fluid will rush to the left hand side of the board, forcing the heavier, floating object to the right hand side causing the board to start to tilt back to center, and once it is centered, the fluid material would be evenly spread out throughout the hollowed section and the floating object would float somewhat close to center, or close enough that outside force on the wooden object would negate any effect varying position of the floating object would have.  (I'm terrible at explaining myself so if you need a clarification with any of this just ask.)  That was my first idea, and so my question for that would be do you see this idea having the intended effect, and if so which materials would be best to use for the floating object and for the fluid material?  

My second idea for the same problem, was to use a weighted magnet(s).  So the magnets would be pulled to one side of the board to even out the tilt.  However I don't know how I could ensure that the magnet(s) only moved when there was a tilt, and would move to the correct side to offset the tilt.  I haven't really thought this one through but I thought I'd throw it in anyway.

73,How many of you use a department Wiki for knowledge capture and sharing?,1346945817,"Hey all, I'm working on a process and design cycle improvement project. I work in digital design (FPGA's) at a company that's a bit slow to update the way they do things. Most in the company are boomers, and millenials (and Gen X'ers, even) are a minority.

One of our goals is to maximize design and tool flow re-use across projects. When a new project starts, though, you can imagine I find myself amused and bemused when my senior engineers need to ramp up the next guy to their previous work. Because no ""wrap-up"" documentation was taken at the time of release, they have to fumble through their notebooks from 6-12 months ago, perform long Outlook e-mail searches, et al. It costs everyone time, and the next guy gets an incomplete, sub-optimal ""starter kit"".

My previous job (at a young company) made great use of internal wikis for knowledge-sharing. I'm hoping to create an internal wiki to mitigate these effects, and in the coming years, retain knowledge that may be otherwise lost due to a mass retirement exodus. I'm hoping many will create wikis for tool flows, starter guides to common IP, other useful processes.

If you already use or are adopting an internal wiki for similar purposes, I was curious of the following:
 
* How do you maximize buy-in, adoption, and contribution from co-workers, esp. the old guard?
* What overall pros/cons and lessons learned has your dept. realized from using one?
* To attempt to quantify the cost savings of an internal wiki, what sort of questions (say, by survey) are good to ask senior engineers, program architects, and the like? (e.g., ""How many hours are lost instead of gained when attempting design re-use?"")
* The current consensus is to use the Wiki features of SharePoint so that it's integrated into our intranet and all that. I know of other programs like MediaWiki...any opinions, preferences for SharePoint, MediaWiki, other?

For those that are curious, food isn't cooked directly by the fuel in these ovens.  Rather, the fuel heats up a huge amount of insulated thermal mass (usually firebrick), which then cooks food primarily via infra-red radiation.  So I've been daydreaming about interesting ways to heat up an oven.   

I read about how solar power plants will transport energy by melting salt.  Assuming this salt is sodium chloride, maybe it would work on the small scale.  Off the top of my head, an attempt to do this would involve the following steps:

* Build a small blast furnace, buried in the ground.  This can be a firebrick-lined pit with an inlet at the bottom for a leaf blower (positioned to create circular flow inside the chamber).  Construct some way to inject and ignite fuel inside the vortex.

* Obtain a heat resistant ceramic crucible with capacity for X Kilograms of salt.  Make sure the crucible can be securely carried with long tools.  May need to fabricate tools.

* Heat salt in furnace until liquid.  Carry crucible of molten salt into oven by hand, and wait until oven is at desired temperature.  Will need to install thermocouple or similar in oven to do this.

I want one, but they're expensive and I don't *need* one right now but I've been toying with the notion of building one myself, just for giggles basically.

On the face of it the problem seems reasonably simple to me, so obviously I'm an idiot.

For the monitors/speakers/other output devices you'd want to DEMUX the signals, on the individual pins, from the multiple sources and output them on one line for each device. I'm making the childish assumption that there wouldn't be any signal attenuation/degradation from passing through the DEMUX but I don't have any resources available to gicve me an idea the kind of impact that the DEMUX might have on the signals.

Really it's just the reverse process for the inputs, MUX them to wherever they need to go at the time. Then it's a case of linking the selection mechanism together so that the outputs and input are sync'd in where they're sending/receiving signals.

1) So as a basic idea how does that sound?

2) Any resources on the response times for MUX/DEMUX chips and how they effect signal strength and quality?

Obviously, you would want to turn off the main breaker so that if power was suddenly restored, fireworks wouldn't ensue.

Some people tell me that the way is to go aerospace since, after all, that is the whole point of aero; others tell me to go mechanical in order to get a broader background and to then do an aerospace masters.  If I did aerospace now, I would certainly get a masters in it as well.

34,How do you model an involute gear that has a root diameter that is bigger than the base diameter?,1346491374,"When using the equations for a standard gear design, the root diameter is larger than the base diameter. Would you still design the gear with these specifications and have the inner limit at the root circle (with the involute starting at the base circle)?

The requirements are:

* module = 15mm

* pressure angle = 20 degrees

* tooth thickness = tooth space - 0.5

* teeth on pinion = 25

* teeth on gear = 55

I've got the specifications for the pinion quite easily:

* pitch diameter = 375

* base diameter = 352.385

* outside diameter = 405

* root diameter = 337.5

And so obviously this is quite easily to model since the base &gt; root diameter.

For the gear, I get:

* pitch diameter = 825

* base diameter = 775.246

* outside diameter = 855

* root diameter = 787.5

Here, the root is bigger than the base diameter.

35,Speaking of silly ideas for power generation:  why wouldn't this work?,1346453421,"I was thinking about hydroelectric power, and this general design plan occurred to me (please forgive the crudeness of my sketch):

http://i.imgur.com/uLIyX.png

Why couldn't we built a hydroelectric power plant that essentially consisted of a large tubular structure in the ocean (near the coast), regulated the flow of water into the tube near the top, and filled it lengthwise with turbines to take advantage of the falling water?  

As the water collected in the bottom, we could boil it away with heating coils (or whatever method might be most efficient).  The resultant water vapor could also, I presume, be use as a ancillary power source as it rose through a central duct, like a giant steam engine.

To me, the only obvious hurdle is whether or not the plant would produce more power than necessary to keep the water boiling away fast enough.  I fail to see why it wouldn't, because the amount of turbines could be increased simply by making the structure taller (and deeper in the ocean), and/or limiting the flow of water to correspond with the rate of evaporation. 

So....why wouldn't this work?  I understand that there would be technical and engineering problems, such as maybe massive amounts of salt left over in the bottom, or the increasing water pressure from the outside the deeper you built the structure, etc....but what are the *theoretical* deal breakers here, i.e. what fundamental laws of energy conservation and thermodynamics am I stupidly overlooking?

Does anyone have any knowledge or outlook on that? The other companies I am looking at the possibility of working for in the future is Boeing, GE, and Lockheed Martin. Basically, I am a mechanically inclined person, and I love to fix and build things. I was a great mechanic and think I would do well in an engineering field.


Also, what is a good Engineering School I can look towards (mainly California). I have currently a 4.0 after 44 completed Semester Units (16 units being remedial courses). I have been researching that the Cal Poly schools are good, and have been told UCI is pretty good as well. I was told if I have an opportunity to getting into USC to take it. Does anyone know anything on these schools, and the different program pro's and con's? Would it really matter which school I go to as long as a get a Bachelors in Engineering?


Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",AskEngineers,meeshkyle,/r/AskEngineers/comments/z2h96/prior_jet_mechanic_in_the_military_what_would_be/

I'm a senior in high school thinking about my major. I know I want to be an engineer, I have wanted to be one for a few years now. I am really considering software and electrical engineering. I am very interested in the electrical areas like energy and much more. I also recently started learning java and I enjoy that a lot. I start and have to force myself to stop moving on to learning the next thing when I have to go somewhere. I have only scratched the surface of java and I'm having a great time. My question is which one should I go into? Where can I work with either one?

64,I need advice on how to remove material from a hardened spring steel tool,1346268738,"So I have this problem.  Skip the first paragraph to get right to it, otherwise, here is the background:

I'm installing flooring in my basement.  The type of flooring I am installing calls for a brand-specific adhesive (Karndean K91-A), and very specific trowel to apply it.  The trowel called for has U-shaped teeth that are 1/16"" deep, 1/32"" wide, and 1/16"" apart.  The first problem I have encountered is that nobody, anywhere, makes this trowel.  The adhesive is very sensitive to trowel dimensions-- I already tried a test patch with a 1/16""x1/16""x1/16"" trowel, and it took 5+ hours to set (nominal 30 minutes).  The second problem is that I really need to do this job this weekend, and the place that was supposed to order me a trowel that was close enough (minimum spread rate of ~150 ft^2, as opposed to required spread rate of 180 ft^2  -- The difference can be made up by canting the trowel 35 degrees during use) fell through.   

I need to somehow make an adhesive-compliant trowel by this weekend.  The required spread rate I need is 180 ft^2.  The spread rate of my 1/16""x1/16""x1/16"" trowel is 51.3 ft^2.  It is made of hardened spring steel, and has square notches.  The square notches mean that if I take material off the blade edge, the spread rate should increase linearly.  I figure I need to reduce the depth of the teeth to 0.285 of its current depth to achieve the required spread rate, giving me a depth of 0.0178"".

I have access to a very basic machine shop.  There is a Sherline (read: small, low speed, aluminum) mill, a shear that is probably not rated for hardened steel, a bench-top grinder, and a couple other common power tools.

Any advice on how I could do this modification accurately?  Maybe I could purchase a toothless version of the tool and mill the teeth myself?  The mill probably can't take hardened spring steel in a general sense, but 0.0178"" depth is pretty minor.

65,Any Computer Engineers have advice for me?,1346268460,"I really enjoy computers, so I'm trying to decide if I want to do Computer Engineering or Computer Science. I think I would prefer Computer Engineering, because I think it would be really cool to learn about, but I'm not too sure if I was born with intuitive math skills.

I've only gotten up to pre-calculus done, and I have gotten an A in it, as well as College Algebra, but I'm not sure how much I actually retained, and I imagine that the math classes that I've taken are nothing compared to what I will have to take in the future. 

So because of this, I'm not sure of myself. I don't know anything about electricity, heat, wires, circuits, robotics, hardware, or any type of measurements or conversions (These are things I imagine engineers would know) and of course I don't know anything about physics yet. Sure I could learn these things, but by now should I already have some kind of knowledge in these categories if I wanted to continue down this path? 

Knowing only basic college math, would I be setting myself up for failure if I tried to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering? (Oh and I'm terrible at word problems...) I wouldn't consider myself ""gifted"" in any field, so I was wondering if such a technical field is only for those who are naturally great at this kind of stuff. 

Because of this doubt, I was considering Computer Science instead, because I do enjoy programming, though I'm still a newbie at it too. I also don't have a very specific interest, I just think about computer hardware and how everything works together (the circuits and stuff) and I think it's fascinating. I guess I just feel overwhelmed with the breadth of Engineering in general, and I feel like I'm a little late in sparking interest, which makes me wish I would have learned more about this when I was younger. 

I'm 21 now and I just haven't done much besides general classes at my CC, but I'm determined to pick my major now and Computer Engineering or Computer science will be it. So, based on what I've written, any advice or opinions? 

Also, does anyone recommend any good books that might be useful to my curiosity in the field of Computer Engineering/Science?

I have a 'little' project, that I have a feeling will bloat unbelievably by the time I am done.

I use [these phones](http://www.esterline.com/communicationsystems/PersonalCommsProtection/HandsetsMicrophones/RA2000FieldTelephone.aspx) on a regular basis in the field. It is a pain in the butt to run telephone wires all over the place, burying it to avoid tripping over it, then removing it all and respooling it every time we move to a new location.

I am looking to accomplish this with off-the-shelf parts (digikey being my favourite).

Can someone give me a brief tutorial of the steps involved in this process and the resources I need to use. I expect a lot of reading on background principles would be involved, but fortunately I have a degree in Physics, and some experience in instrumentation design, so that's a somewhat solid base to build on.

When running a direct shear test, I find the top platen tilting while running. This, of course, reduces the amount of force applied downward onto the sample. This can't be accounted for by our data logger.  
  

It happens on both out small scale machines and is especially frequent on out large scale machine.

I need to know if it is worth my time and effort to study to join your exalted brotherhood. I'm thirty five and I'm married with children so I'm not a typical student that comes on here asking for advice. I have some college behind me, but no degree, when I was in school fifteen years ago my real major area of interest was getting laid. So I was a pre-law student and as such not required to take as much math as you would think a lawyer may need. I'm guessing it's going to take four and a half to five years to earn my degree, because I can't double up much of the math I have to take. 

Why am I doing this?  Because I have to do something and whatever I train to do now is what I'm going to have to do for the rest of my working life. I have been a very successful locksmith for quite a few years. I have even worked closely with various engineers over the years designing custom locking systems for various things.

In a normal locksmiths progression you will always eventually work for yourself, it's the only way to earn in the eighty to one-hundred thousand a year range in that industry. Unfortunately for me about ten years ago I was diagnosed with RA, and it has progressed to the point that the fine motor skills I need to do the work is failing. So I know I have to retrain myself to do something else, and I have to do it now. It was like being twenty years old again, coming to that realization, when I was twenty I had been in college for two years and was absolutely sure I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore. I was able to get my first locksmithing job and just shelved school until I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. So here and now, I want to be an engineer, but I'm not sure if I should  follow this dream or not. I guess you could say my health and my looming failings in my long time profession have created something of a mid-life crisis for me, so rather than seek advice from a doctor I've decided to ask you engineers of reddit your opinions. I like how engineers get to the heart of the matter, rather than giving someone a bullshit boost of confidence. I'll list some bullet points to help break all this down.

So here are my questions:

1). At 35 years old estimating it's going to take 4 to 5 years to finish a BS degree in engineering and expecting to work until 65 or 70 years old is it worth it?
     A&gt; I will have to use student loans, I'm guessing at the end of this time I will have             between 40K and 60K in loans.
     B&gt; I do live in an area with a strong job market for engineers, specific disciplines asked for often are mechanical, aerospace, electrical, some but less civil and always software engineers. 
     C&gt; 'Worth' in this context means is the income to investment sound considering age, length of time expected to be in the field, and expected debt accrued to reach goal.

2). Given point B above I have looked at what ""kind"" of engineer I'd want to be. I have to enter into this with a plan. I've looked over the university web-sites and while their overviews are ""nice"" they aren't really informative. In fact going by them I would expect to work in groups of attractive and diverse smiling people who like to gather around tables. From what I've read most of the disciplines overlap and a mechanical engineer is considered a ""jack of all trades"" engineer?  So here is the actual question:* What discipline would you most want to do from mechanical, aerospace, electrical or software?* If you work in a different field that you would like to tell me about and why it's worth the extra effort to get into it please do.


I know this is a long post for an engineering subreddit but I saw it as needed to consider the variables of the problem I'm living and asking for your advice with.[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/T78a3.jpg) Here is a picture of a cat as a token of my esteem.

91,Entry Level offshore oil rig positions for recent B.S. in EE,1346097814,"Hello /r/askEngineers,

I will be graduating from a top 20 EE program in the U.S. in June 2013 with a B.S.  I currently work as an intern writing code for image processing applications.  It is in an office type setting and is your typical 9-5 job.  I enjoy what I do, but I don't see myself in a setting like this long term.

My focus will be control systems and robotics.  I enjoy the outdoors and doing more ""in the field"" kind of engineering.  I also like the whole x weeks on/ y weeks off deal that offshore jobs have so I can travel more. I have been researching offshore jobs for a couple of weeks and have been interested in stuff like subsea control systems.  However, most of these jobs require years of experience, which I have yet to have.  How does a recent graduate in EE get an entry level job on an offshore rig? I am open to living in other countries for some time.

TLDR: I will be graduating next year, have 10+ months internship experience in an EE field unrelated to what one would do on a rig, and would like to know what type of entry level positions a person in my situation would apply for.

Thanks for the help engineers.",AskEngineers,kyledood,/r/AskEngineers/comments/yx5ar/entry_level_offshore_oil_rig_positions_for_recent/

93,"""tunnel"" tolerance for fastener?",1346087291,"I have an assembly consisting of a block between two plates. All 3 are clamped together (with gaskets) by a few long screws that pass through all 3. The center block has a hole for each screw - essentially a tunnel. It's designed so there's lots of clearance, but as the block is cast it may have some warping. How do I call-out that I need a space for this screw? The axis of the fabricated hole can warp, the diameter can be incorrect, so long as they leave me a hollow tunnel slightly larger than the screw I'm using.",AskEngineers,jesseaknight,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ywttl/tunnel_tolerance_for_fastener/

95,Senior Design Project Ideas,1346078354,"I'm a senior pursuing a mechanical engineering degree at a small college. I was hoping Reddit would have some ideas regarding a design project for us.

Any ideas or examples of previous projects to get us off the ground would be greatly appreciated.",AskEngineers,dingermv09,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ywl09/senior_design_project_ideas/
96,I want to re-do my custom beer pong table to make it better. I need some technical and creative advice...,1346069574,"My friends and I built a beer pong table in High School. We just did a basic circuit using series and parallel circuits for the various lights as you can see in the pictures.

I am now in the process of restoring it from years of spilled beer and usage. I want to up the ante though. I have a few ideas but not sure the best way to go about them.

1. The logo that was then painted on, I want to be a homemade backlit sign but I am unsure how well light will shine through primed and latex painted Plexiglas. Will this be fine/do you have any other ideas?

2. I want some of the lights to pulse to the music using LED's and a transistor. I saw [suggestions](http://www.instructables.com/id/Music-LED-Light-Box/?&amp;sort=ACTIVE&amp;limit=40&amp;offset=120) on this site, but I want to wire in like 200 LED's or so. This would be easy if the colours were all the same, but some will be blue and some red. Any wiring advice that would save me hours of trial and error?

3. As I mentioned before, I plan to separate the pulsing LED's into the blue and the red end. Any suggestions on separating the light or blocking part of it off so it doesn't interfere with each other? Same goes for the logo, since it is multi-coloured and so close together. I was thinking white/clear LED's for the center and paint it. Or a way to separate the colours and leave the plexiglas frosted. Should I just put wooden boards across the inside to separate the three types of light?

4. Any suggestions to make it better?

97,Is it worth to defer for 6-12 months for an internship?,1346063106,"IBM have some internships that I'm interested in but they're not just summer internships. According to their job description: ""Be prepared to defer your study and be available to work full time during your internship"".

I'm currently a second year, second semester student (we finish up the school year in November here) so I'm not in a particular hurry to find a internship- even though it is a requirement to get my degree.

My thoughts are:
1. Applying for this will mean that I'll be a semester/year behind my peers (and for all the thesis and group work that'll come in third and fourth year, I know that I want to be with these guys).
2. It sounds really cool, and I'm sure it'll help me in my career down the line.

IBM isn't the only choice, but they seem to be one out of a very few companies that accept 2nd year students.",AskEngineers,Soragon,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ywbr6/is_it_worth_to_defer_for_612_months_for_an/
98,Questions about changing jobs,1346049105,"I've been working in my current job for just a little under a year (~10 months) and for reasons I'd rather not get into, would like to look for a new job. My concerns are the proper/professional etiquette that should be followed as a professional.

* If I've been assigned a long term project (ongoing for several months now), would I be obligated to complete the project or at the very least bring someone up to speed on what is going on with the project?
* I realize that typically a 2 weeks notice is given to allow the current employer some time to figure things out but if the new job would like me to start sooner, how should I approach this without burning bridges with the current employer while ensuring I start off on the right foot with the new one?
* If I have vacation hours remaining at my current job, would it be wrong to use up those hours on my final days and expect to be paid? Example: 24 hours (3 days) of vacation time remaining. Noticed of departure give on Monday and would like to take the following Wednesday-Friday off.
* If I need to take days off to interview, how far in advance should I inform my current employer of my absence for that day? If the interview was scheduled for sooner (ex. the next day), should I just call in sick? I am concerned that if there were several days in a row I would have to leave or not show up for work and how that would look.
* For those that are licensed PE (civil) in California, would I be required to letter/stamp from any of the PEs at my current job to qualify for the exam after the minimum years of experience? I realize they may need proof of this to sit in on the exam so if proof is required for previous employers, how should I approach them prior and/or after my departure to ask for a letter?


I had a few more questions but can't remember at the moment. I realize the thing I need to do right now is actively look (on my personal time away from work of course) and land a new job before informing anyone at my current job about the move. Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated.",AskEngineers,bonzaibanana,/r/AskEngineers/comments/yw5k8/questions_about_changing_jobs/
99,[Mechanical Engineering] DIY project stalled on confusing mechanism,1346040863,"Hopefully this is the intention of this subreddit, because I need some help. I'm looking to make a movable shelf that can be adjusted in two different ways. If you'll excuse the simplicity of these drawings, here are the two movements I need. [Diagrams (sort of)](http://i.imgur.com/VtIUZ.png)

The rounded rectangles in the diagram represent the ""arm"" of the mechanism, which pivots about the small circle on the right. At the other end, the shelf itself pivots on its own point. What I need is for the shelf to pivot when the arm pivots, and at the same rate. That way no matter how the arm is oriented, the shelf is always parallel to the ground. This wasn't a challenge to figure out until I introduced the second movement.

I also want the arm to change length, which screws up my original mechanism for the rotation of the shelf. I was going to use twine to create something like a bike gear, but I'm not sure how to incorporate this into an arm that can vary in length.

Anyway, I've been thinking about this for a while and I just can't seem to figure out a simple way to do it (although I've had elaborate ideas). If anyone here knows of a way that these two movements can be accommodated, I would be very grateful.
