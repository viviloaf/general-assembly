0,Thank you,1383532327,"About a month or two ago I asked you guys if I should take an undergrad research project. I took the advice given here and accepted my professors offer. Because of your advice I am designing filters for EMGs so the signals given by muscles can be used in the control of Robotics. On top of that I was awarded funding for the project in the form of a scholarship. I mentioned in an interview for an internship, that I believe went very well, that I was doing undergrad research and what i was doing and the company I was interviewing for told me they have a sister company that deals with robotics. The cherry on top is I now get my own desk and equipment at my school to work on this project. So thank you guys for all your help in directing my final year of school to being an awesome one.

5,"20 story condo complex, build defect, need an advice (repost from /r/RealEstate)",1383510710,"*Hi, I originally posted this on /r/RealEstate but I guess what I'm really looking for is answer from engineers, whether it is something to be concerned about. If this is not the right place to ask this question please let me know. Thanks.*

I'm currently planning on purchasing a condo in California. It is a 20 story building. I learned that there is a pending litigation there, in which the HOA is suing developer (and I believe the investor from which the building was purchased from).

I'm being told that it is minor issue, also lenders are aware of it and are willing to finance as long as I'll have minimum of 20% down payment on it. A friend of mine is already owning condo there and she is in finance committee and I'm being told that the lawyer fees are already included in HOA (the litigation seems to be already lasting 2 years) so I don't expect HOA fees jumping up because of that.

What I'm worried is how serious it is and how hard would be for them to fix it? It seems like there are multiple issues listed (all seem minor) in the suit, but the most serious one is that on 3rd floor at one place the floor is not even. As you walk in the hall you feel going down and then up. When you kneel on the floor and look at it you can see it is uneven. The unevenness is also limited to one side of the path (i.e. depending from which direction you are walking it is on left (or right) the other side looks ok. Lastly there is a visible crack on the wall next to that area.

The condo that I'm interested in is not in the area where the fault is, so it should not affect me directly. I'm more concerned about the structural integrity of the building. Is this something to be worry about? What are chances that the building might be deemed not livable in the future?

Please note this complex is located in California, so there is a possibility of Earthquake (the HOA fee includes earthquake insurance). There was not any major earthquake since the building was built.

6,"High hardness, highish temperature structural materials",1383509390,"Hey everyone,

I had a quick question concerning materials for a testing setup I'm going to make (which implies machinability to some degree as well).  The requirements are that it has to be a good structural material at high temperatures (max temps around 500-600C) and I'm trying to maximize the hardness.  I'm looking at 17-7PH steel, and possibly an inconel alloy (625).  Part of my worry concerns the fact that I can't quite find comparable hardness measurements (HRB vs HRC vs Brinell) for different systems and so don't have a great way to compare them.  From what I gather from the [handy page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness_comparison) on wiki my best bet may be the 17-7 steel, but given that they're different systems I don't know how well the conversions work.  I also am hoping that if I'm potentially missing something obvious people could help point me in the right direction.

7,ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,1383507651,"Hi all,

I am not sure if this should be posted here or on engineeringstudents but I think I will get a better response here.

I am doing my final year MEng project with a placement company.  My project is to design a pressure vessel which will go into production next summer.  I am to design it to ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII Division 2.  

Having read through the design code I have started doing some of the design calculations and I am trying to understand where the equations come from.

I understand where the equations for the membrane stress come from but I am stumped with the equations for minimum thickness.  The equation is t=(D/2)((exp(P/SE))-1) where d is the internal diameter, P the internal pressure, E the joint factor and S the allowable stress.  The exponential is confusing me.

I have asked around at work and also at university but no one seems to know where this equation would have originated from.

Does anyone know where this equation could be derived from? 

I have tried to get a copy of the companion guide by K R Rao but neither the university library or the library in my town can get access to it.  Being in Scotland, I also can't seem to purchase it online either.

8,I am blowing some engineering job interviews: Could I have some critique please?,1383507381,"I've been in the workforce now for about 5 years since I left college.  I've haven't interviewed for a new position in a long time.  I feel now that I'm ready to leave my current company, but this is my first time interviewing since the recession hit.

I've interviewed with two places.  Each time, I noticed something particular happened.  At first, both interviewers acted all excited to talk to me.  They asked about my background, and I told them the type of work that I've done.  They said that I have very good experience, etc etc.

Then they tried to stump me: they asked me some technical questions related to the work I've done (what type of equipment did I use, what type of parameters was I looking for, etc).  I answered these very well, and they were happy and impressed. Both asked me why I wanted to work for them.  I said I am looking for a change of pace and more advanced work, and I saw their ad and felt I had the right experience.  This they accepted.  

Then both asked me a question I didn't know.  One interviewer asked me a technical question, and I gave the honest answer, saying that I didn't know.  They seemed disappointed. The other interviewer did something similar, but the question was about the products the company makes and if I liked them.  I said I have never bought anything from the company.  They acted all disappointed.

I did my homework about both companies prior to interviewing. however, the interviews were for product lines that were just starting up by both companies.  I only had what was available on their public websites, and on their posted job descriptions to go off of.

What am I doing wrong here?  Should I just assume that I wouldn't want to work at these companies, since they weren't honest upfront about what they wanted, or that they are unwilling to train?  Or am I answering these questions the wrong way?

9,How can I use Bernoulli's equation when dealing with two spots that have different gage pressures (I do NOT know the density of the fluid)?,1383507215,"I have a contraction where I'm dealing with two different gage pressures. I do not know what the density is so I need to calculate the density for the fluid first.

My only problem is that, when calculating the density using the ideal gas law, I need to use the absolute pressure. However the absolute pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the gage pressure.

So since my gage pressure is different at the two spots that I want to use Bernoulli's equation on, it means that the density is different at those two spots, which would mean that my flow is not incompressible. However my assignment says that I should be able to use Bernoulli's equation to solve my problem.

12,Transitioning from IT to Engineering?,1383449927,"Hello /r/askengineers,

Some background info:

I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering Technology degree, and after searching for an engineering job for about 5 months with no luck, I got a job offer for working as a database developer (SQL). I have some experience working with MS SQL server for some hobby projects and managed to get the offer through a consulting firm.

Now, my passion has always been engineering, but I really need to pay off my loans and take care of other liabilities. The way I see it, it's better to work a professional job in an unrelated field for a while than sit around waiting for the right opportunity to come by.

I plan on staying with this company for about 2 years, save up enough cash and get my masters in MSME or something related. Is this a sound idea? I have absolutely no interest in database development and my heart has always been in engineering. I somehow managed to go through my college career without making any contacts whatsoever and my GPA is pretty bad due to some poor personal life choices, so I don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of employment.

I would be very grateful for some advice from someone who successfully transitioned into engineering from IT.

15,"I'm trying to design a car, and I want to know if the rotary engine I've designed is a good alternative to the wankel engine or traditional 4-cycles.",1383438814,"~~The idea is fairly simple. Each piston is a flywheel, I'm picturing around a foot in diameter and 4"" thick. A tooth (or possibly multiple) sticks out of the flywheel, but curved smoothly rather than having corners or a square shape. Outside is a piece that presses against the outside edge of the flywheel, forming a seal for a cavity inside of itself, which is the combustion chamber. As the tooth moves past this piece, they come closer and closer to connecting, making the chamber smaller and compressing the fuel/air mixture before combustion. The explosion pushes against the tooth and sends the flywheel spinning, eventually pulling the tooth away from the chamber-piece and allowing exhaust to escape. Obviously walls are necessary around the outside to keep the seal.~~

These diagrams are very rough approximations, not to scale or quite functional:

[Stage 1](http://i.imgur.com/xKiwO3R.png) - The piece on top injects fuel and air into the space between itself and the tooth sticking out of the flywheel.

[Stage 2](http://i.imgur.com/nLEqQLZ.png) - The tooth rotates forward and the space between itself and the injector block thing on top gets smaller, compressing the fuel/air mixture.

[Stage 3](http://i.imgur.com/a2UGsvN.png) - Combustion launches the tooth forward, spinning the engine.

[Stage 4](http://i.imgur.com/bbraCNT.png) - A gap opens in the chamber, allowing exhaust to escape. The engine spins back to stage 1.

The movement of the top piece which injects fuel and makes up one wall of the chamber would be timed by threads rather than being hit into place. ~~In the actual to-scale geometry, it shouldn't have to raise and lower, simply rotate. Probably the front side of the tooth will be a smooth taper down to the flywheel rather than a cornered edge.~~

Would this be viable? I'm planning to use it with a CVT, so you can keep it spinning at a high RPM where the flywheels will store as much energy as they can without becoming dangerous, and just change gear ratios constantly as you change speed. The CVT will be chain-driven and have redundancy splitting the load across as many chains as necessary, so it should be able to handle the power. As I understand it, this will produce a very fuel-efficient engine, since very little power is wasted with each cycle, and it should be capable of very rapid acceleration, as you can get the flywheels spinning quickly and have them storing a lot of excess energy before you let up the clutch. Am I wrong on this? Would it in fact perform poorly or waste energy in a way I'm not aware of?

18,Possible Function generator fuse issues,1383425108,"I am a 2nd year student of electronic engineering in Ireland and I recently bought an ATTEN ATF20B function generator online so that I could do some of my lab experiments from home.

As I opened the box to read the instruction manual to check if there was anything in particular I had to do before turning it on I soon found that the instruction manual was entirely in Chinese with no pictures or alternate language sections so I decided to just plug it in and figure it out. 

Upon plugging it in I could swear that I saw the tiniest flicker on the screen but there after I could not get it to turn on no matter what I did. 

I then thought that I had maybe blown a fuse in the plug so I checked the 3 pin plug to find that it was rated at 250V and 3A. Seeing as Irelands mains Voltage is 220V at 50HZ, it didn't seem likely. 

When I reexamined the back of the unit I found that there was a small red switch just above the power input that had 2 states

* AC 110 100-120V 60Hz Fuse 2A
* AC 220 200-240V 50Hz Fuse 1A

The switch was pre set to the 110 setting when I plugged it in.

Is there a high likelihood that I have blown the fuse in it and if so is it just a simple matter of unscrewing the back and replacing it ? 

Would a replacement fuse be available from a local electronics shop or would I have to order from the manufacturer ?

19,Are Voltage Optimisers useful for energy conservation?,1383422846,"I've recently landed an entirely non-technical role in property management in the UK and contractors have repeatedly recommended voltage optimisation as an energy conservation measure on properties with a supply voltage of 240V or so.

The units already installed seem to be in series with the supply and seem to be essentially step-down transformers dropping the voltage down to 220V.

Presumably due to a massive failure to do a proper site survey before installation, some devices like hand driers and lifts have stopped working properly and needed step-up transformers or replacing, but I digress.

Excuse my extremely poor electrical knowledge here, but am I correct in assuming that lowering the voltage is the primary purpose of these units?

I worked very hard applying to places and going to career fairs, interviews, etc. and it ended up with me getting two job offers. Im having trouble deciding which to take because Job A pays incredible for someone fresh out of college, and Job B is more inline with the aspects of engineering that I enjoy.

So for Job A, I would be working as a maintenance engineer at a refinery. Essentially I would make sure everything was running correctly and work with contractors to replace worn out refining equipment. I like that I would be able to be in the ""field"" about 50% of the time because I don't really enjoy sitting at a desk for 8 hours straight. On the other had I wouldn't really be doing a ton of engineering, but more project management. I feel that I just don't find pumps and piping all that interesting. Another thing is that besides going on the refinery tour I have never worked at one so I don't really know what to expect. The pay at this company would be 78k with a 5k bonus along with a 401k, pension, and really great benefits. I also believe I would be able to move up faster at this company than at company B because the refinery is growing like crazy.(they are doubling the size of their engineering staff this year) This job is also located near where I currently live so I wouldn't need to relocate.

For engineering job B, I would be working as a design engineer at a medium sized heavy manufacturing company. I would get to do design work with CAD which I enjoy and get to work with some pretty cool equipment. I worked an internship at a manufacturing company for about 2 years so I know more what its like and enjoy the atmosphere. This job is also in a very small town that would require me to move about an hour away. This isn't a huge deal to me but my long time girlfriend still has a year of school left. For this job I have been able to negotiate with them up to 64k a year with a 5k signing bonus. As for the 401k they only match half of what company A does, there is no pension, and their health benefits cost much more.

Both companies have about the same vacation package, but at the refinery they work a 9/80 policy so you get every other friday off. 

The stability of company A is also much greater, during the past few years of the recession company A continued to grow while company B had to downsize. 

I know most people reading this would say job A is a no brainer, which I can't argue with as far as pay and benefits, I just feel like I would like job B better.

If anyone has worked in either of these fields or has any insight that would help me decide that would be great. I have to decide by Monday!

Specifically, consistently drinking warm liquids and lowering your external temperature from the normal ambient comfortable 70-something can work wonders in helping people with narcolepsy to stay awake!

The customer has come back asking about modifying the analysis. He said that at times in the past, a water mist could be sprayed onto areas of the valve away from the preheat zone to help reduce temperatures throughout the valve body. This complicates the problem as we're moving away from ambient air natural convection to multiphase forced convection.

35,Just thought I'd share,1383299432,"All through my 20s I worked in customer service and support in a call center. The pay was OK, but after getting married and having a few kids, it started to seem impossible to keep up without some sort of welfare assistance. At 27 me and my wife were talking and we decided to pay our cars off (cheap ones) and make a go at it to get a degree. I quit my job, moved our family into a tiny place for cheap, and with student aid I was able to pay bills every semester for six months at a time. 


  I live in an area with quite a bit of industrial jobs available, so I made a go at an AAS in electrical engineering with a strong focus in automated control systems. I never before have found a field I was passionate about and to say the least, I loved it. Big machines and robots, whats not to love right?? 

Fast forward to now, I'm 30 and I'm working in an industial maintenance position. It's a dream of mine to go on and finish my degree and become an engineer but I am happy with my work. I enjoy the projects, the problem solving and the fact no two days ever present themselves similarly. 

Here's the exciting part... A few months ago we got a new plant manager and for reasons I'm unaware of, the GM and our plant engineer decided they could not work together and the engineer quit. I figured what the hell, and when they posted the job opening, I put in my resume and honestly didn't expect to hear much more from it. The GM approached me for an interview and yesterday morning I went to it. We spent about two hours talking about job responsibilities, expectations, family life, and generally getting to know each other. I was asked if I was offered the position, and one of the requirements of accepting would be to continue my schooling... It would be a dream come true for me.

I'm currently working on a project in which I wish to send a simple ""trigger"" signal from a RC plane to a device on the ground, and optionally get a confirming signal back. The problem for me is that i have very strict specifications on weight and size for both the transmitter in the plane (obviously) and also for the receiver on the ground because I want to be able to carry it in the plane and drop it out. The weight maximum on either side is something like 20 g. I can probably fit an antenna on both sides as long as it is shorter than 10 cm and light weight. 

So what I am looking for is a pair of devices that are easy to set up, light weight, small, low power while still being able to transmit over 1 km or preferably much more. Remember that I only need to send this signal once and it only needs to be one bit, basically like a trigger. Are there any obvious candidates? Is it even possible? I have looked at using something like an RC controller and receiver pair, but most of the transmitters I find are huge and not really fitted to my project. 

For the receiver I'm thinking about something along these lines: http://www.microflight.com/Online-Catalog/Receivers/Micro9-4-Channel-PlugnPlay-0-95g-Receiver

I've got a Reverse Osmosis filter system that I use to produce nice clean water for my fish tanks, however I find it a PITA to get out and set up every time that I want to produce a batch of clean water (25L at a time). 

Eventually I'll finish at Uni, and will want a more permanent setup: 

[The design.](http://i.imgur.com/EudrouG.jpg)

My current setup is much the same as per the PFD above, just sans solenoid valves and storage tank.. at the moment I chuck the product hose directly into a 25L container.

So the idea is that the solenoid valves and booster pump are hooked up to some sort of controller. Controller has a turn switch to be in ""Auto"" or ""Manual"" modes, and a couple of buttons on the front for specific operations. 

I've hashed out a *very* basic flowchart of the kind of automation/sequence I'd be wanting:

[Flowchart 1](http://i.imgur.com/WgLvTgJ.jpg)

[Flowchart 2](http://i.imgur.com/kDeoFJ2.jpg)

The idea being that I leave the key-switch in the ""Auto"" position, and when the large volume storage tank gets too low the ""auto-fill"" sequence kicks in of it's own accord, fills the tank, flushes the membrane, boxes all the valves back up, and resumes it's wait for the next time the water level drops low. 

I'm a process/chemical engineer by training, and have a bit of working control knowledge.. But no idea of how to actually implement this... Arduino seems an obvious choice, but feels a tad overpowered for something so simple.. PICAxe microcontroller base maybe?

Like I said I'm a few years away from putting it into place, but I'd like to make a start on it now.. Maybe get an Arduino/PIC project board with a breakout/breadboard full of LEDs and switches to start testing things out.. I like to tinker! Also taking suggestions of any good freeware I can use to design the software? Is there something as simple as dragging and dropping flowchart items and the software fill in the gaps?

So yea.. Can anyone help a brother out here?

I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student. Today in my Statics class we began covering the topic of static friction. I asked my instructor a question that I have often wondered, and he seemed a bit stumped as to the answer so I was hoping I could get an answer from someone who may be more versed in this particular question:

If the amount of static friction generated is the same regardless of area (because Fs=coefficient of friction*normal force) then what is the point of adding wider tires to a car to increase traction? Is traction not simply another term for friction? A fellow student suggested that maybe the rubber compound made the difference; I can buy that to an extent, but if that were 100% true then all cars would ride on Honda Civic width tires. My anecdotal experience is that wider tires certainly increase traction, but a few examples are hardly enough to prove my point.

Alternatively,I purchased a [hot-fix gun](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/946/450/301/301450946_247.jpg) although that takes a lot more time and effort to produce, not to mention it is quite inaccurate.

I will be completing my M.S in Aerospace Engineering this coming May. I am in the process of applying to Ph.D programs, but those are anything but a sure thing. As such, I'm trying to think ahead to make sure I don't have too many troubles should I need to go on the job hunt. I've got several years of undergrad and graduate research experience on various projects in a few labs. As a student, I'm not bad, but I'm nothing special (~3.5 GPA undergrad, and about the same during my M.S).


I _really_ want to get out of the current state I'm in - both because I don't care for it here physically, and there doesn't seem to be a lot going on in terms of what I want to do. Apparently, however, I'm told that it can be awful hard to get a company to consider someone from far away without something to give them a good reason, and I don't relish the idea of staying here another 1-3 years to get that. I can stay with my parents who live elsewhere in the state once I graduate while I find a job, so I do have some time past graduation if I need it, but I'd rather not impose on them for too long - so I also need to know if it's a total long shot, too.


So, that leads to the question - Is it unrealistic to try to find a job out-of-state? (I live in Arizona, looking northeast/mid-atlantic ideally) If it is, what can one do to be more attractive in that respect? I've heard that the advanced degree can be a pretty strong chip when searching for a job and attracting interest from companies, but I'm not sure how true that is. I'd also be willing to consider moving on my own to somewhere I'd like to be and working any job while looking for an engineering position nearby - but I don't know how realistic that really is since ""any job"" isn't likely to be engineering related, and that might look bad on a resume.


So - any advice advice for someone who is starting their job search and would like to move out of state?

I plugged it in and, while the remote still did not work, the touch panel did. I plugged it back into the bedroom and it stopped working again. I tried another power point in our bedroom but the touch panel refused to work. Took it back out into the lounge and all was fine. 

Finally, I decided I'd swap it with another TV we have upstairs. Plugged the Samsung in upstairs and it failed to work. I thought maybe the problem was earth related (not sure why I thought this) and touched one of the screws on the back of the TV. I felt nothing but suddenly the touch panel starting working again. Very strange.

The socket I used upstairs is on the same side of the house as our bedroom (downstairs). The lounge is on the other side. I have studied some AC and DC theory but am not an electrician nor an engineer.

My main concern is, is the TV safe to use? It seems ok now but I have children and they use the TV upstairs sometimes. The TV housing is all plastic and the only metal I can find are the screws on the back holding it together. I have not, nor do I plan to, taken it apart.

15,My boss demands 3 months notice prior to quitting,1382905450,"No lie. 

I work for a small company. I am one of two engineers (my boss is also an engineer, so that's technically three). I was in my yearly review 6 months ago and the topic of the secretary/accountant leaving came up. I mentioned that it could have been prevented (she was harassed by the service manager who happens to be the boss's brother). My boss got visibly butthurt about the situation and said that the way she did it was messed up. This was referring to the fact that she ""only"" gave 2 weeks notice before leaving.

We ALL have at-will employment contracts which require no notice to terminate us or for us to leave. The manual asks for 2 weeks notice, which is COMPLETELY reasonable. I pointed that out and my boss said that was irrelevant and that since she was in a ""key role"" (her job amounted to answering the telephone and emailing people to ask for money) she should have given more notice. I asked how much notice was appropriate and he said:

**THREE (3) months**

I nearly lost my shit. I kept my mouth shut by some miracle of self control that was very uncharacteristic of me. Luckily he changed the topic pretty quickly after that.

Now, I'm thinking that I'm an engineer who is actually in a key position. How much notice do I need to give? 3 months? 6 months? A year?

Here's my problem: I want to leave. I understand that it's best to have job lined up before I boogie. It's completely unreasonable to tell a potential employer that I can start in 3 months. No one would look at me (I'm 27 years old) and think that was reasonable.

What do I do? 

* Put in 3 months notice and hope for the best?
* Find a job and give 2 weeks notice therefore pissing off my petty, immature boss who lives in lala-land?

I feel like I'm in a situation where I cannot win. I sure as hell can't give 2 weeks notice and just leave, he'd be sitting at his desk WAITING for the opportunity to mouth off if a prospective employer tries to verify my work history.

So far I have integrated different modules and compiled embedded code written by a team mate to ensure functionality (a prototype if you will) before requesting mass production. All this requires is understanding the signal flow of the system, familiarity with PCB's and  how MCU's control inputs/outputs. 

I have also replaced and tested board components per the suggestion of the board manufacturer. Essentially the manufacturer gave me a potential solution and all I had to do was make the suggested changes and report the result. They did not give a complete schematic design so I did not fully understand how that circuit worked.

Are tasks like that typical for a new engineer? I expected more of a thinking and brainstorming period, running simulations, designing and troubleshooting the system then consult with the team members. I just want make sure I'm not undercutting myself of pursuing a more involved position in the future.

My response is that brick houses wouldn't survive the strong tornadoes and hurricanes either, and if you have to rebuild anyways, wood is cheaper and easier. Besides, wood is a huge natural resource we have in the States.

Another note, there are basically no threat of natural disasters in Germany and it is the temperature never gets that hot.  So when you build a house, you can expect it to be there in a hundred years.

Investment casting is an option I've considered, though I think the unit cost is going to kill us.  

One crazy idea I had is to design the part so that the parting line is at the top edge of the outer diameter. The bottom would be a simple straight pull, and then (here's the crazy part) the top would get unscrewed from the tool. Obviously the threaded half of the tool would be a challenging (maybe impossible) to machine, though maybe it could be DMLS? Anyone ever done anything like this?

61,Looking for advice on battery usage for renewable energy.,1382564330,"Hi,

I sent this list of questions to Rolls and Trojan battery companies, but I also know there is some experience in this sub, so I wanted to ask here as well.

I'm an electrical engineer, working in Haiti primarily on inverter-based power systems. I am tired of seeing people's battery banks fail prematurely, so I want to make sure I can provide the best information and service possible.

(1) I found your recommended settings for Abs, Float, and Equalize voltage settings. Since it is also a programmable option on most systems, can you also recommend a duration for these charging stages?
Also, Outback systems include a ""refloat"" setting as well, and I was wondering if you had an advised setting for this?

(2) Should I change these settings for a temperature compensation right from the start. Typically, I read manuals printed for a 25 degrees Celsius average, but we tend to stay closer to 35 degrees C.

(3) Can you give me a recommended period for how often to run an equalization cycle? I have read conflicting information on this topic from various sources. The most common answer is to do this monthly, but I figured I would ask the source.

(4) Do you have a recommendation for a standalone battery charger? I have had good experiences with Iota, but they do not offer an equalize cycle and claim they don't feel it is neccesary.

(5) When dealing with parallel strings of batteries, I have heard that going more than 3 wide is bad for the batteries.
I was just curious if there was any pros/cons from changing the battery wiring. I have only ever seen systems run where you stack each series string of batteries, then tie them in parallel.
Would there be any benefit from haing a parallel connection at each voltage level (6V, 12V, 18V) across the battery banks? To me, it just seems that it MAY help to keep charging more equal across the strings?

(6) Is higher ambient temperature a serious problem? If so, could I ""water-cool"" the batteries by partially submerging them in a tub of circulating water?

(7) I know it is considered irrecoverable to have someone dump the acid in the batteries and start fresh without absolutely no controls in place.
However, IF I know the specific gravity accurately, and can refill with an exact matched solution, would it be beneficial if I think the battery has been contaminated with dirt, grease, or minerals?
I know that one is a long shot, but I just cleaned some batteries for an organization down here that had the worst corrosion I have dealt with, and I noticed that the inside of the filler caps all had a black, greasy film on them which seemed quite abnormal.

I think that is all my questions for now, and I would appreciate any insight you can give me.

63,Autonomous Formation Flight of Satellites - Is it plausible?,1382558345,"I apologize for the length, but please bear with me.

I'm an Aerospace Engineering student currently working on my senior design project. My team and I have decided to tackle a small sat project involving the autonomous formation flight of three small units. After a month of research and discussion, we've decided to focus our project on optimizing the metrology system. In other words: **how the satellites will keep track of their distance relative to each other, and maintain that distance while traversing through space.**

We've come up with two possible solutions:

1) Use 3 quad rotors to simulate 3-dimensional formation flight of 3 satellites. By utilizing a compact RADAR unit on each quad rotor unit, we imagine each unit will be able to keep track of the positions and velocities of the other two units relative to itself. 

However, my question is: 

**will there be any radio frequency interference between each unit if all 3 quad rotors are utilizing RADAR? Also, in order to maintain formation flight we would need a large field of view. Is RADAR able to send and receive signals omnidirectionally? If not, how big should we expect our blind spots to be?**
-
-
-
2) Use 3 neutrally buoyant vessels submerged in a tank of water to simulate 3-dimensional formation flight in a weightless environment. We plant to use a compact LIDAR unit (as in laser mapping technology, possibly similar to those used on Neato robotic vacuums) for each vessel.

However, my question is: 

**will LIDAR (which I believe uses infrared lasers) be able to penetrate the water freely, or will the lasers be refracted when traveling through water? Our concern with this is how much accuracy do we lose by testing in an underwater setting.**


I welcome any other suggestions or advice, or if you find any flaws in our approach. Is this project too ambitious for a two semester project? Should we limit our tests to a 2-dimensional space?

Why don't they turn the chassis of the car the other way to counteract this?(I think it's called [banked turns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banked_turn), closest I could find on Wikipedia)"". Then I thought to myself, maybe it has something to do with safety? Maybe doing this makes it easier for the car to roll over or skid off the road? So my question here is this:

I'm a student in a high school engineering class that spends the year designing, building, and eventually presenting a product to professionals. This is why I said iffy in the title, technically I am student, but this is a project that seems bigger than what (from my brief, 1 minute scroll through of the rules) seems to be on /r/EngineeringStudents. So if I am in the wrong posting here, please tell me and where I should post. If not, then let's get started. 

My two partners and I are focusing on solving the never-ending problem of wires getting tangled. As of now, we have yet to finish the research phase (though we are almost there) and have not officially formed any ideas, though we have some in mind. However, we would love some preliminary advice, and anyone who happens to be an expert in anything relating to this subject, we would also love to come in contact with that person, as our other ""experts"" (I use that term very loosely) have failed to respond to our emails. Another reason for this post is to stick our foot into Reddit, building a foundation for us to return to if we have further questions.

I'll go ahead and post a link to our survey and a brochure for our project.

And for those deadly curious, we are taking part in Project Lead The Way's Engineering Development and Design course.

EDIT: I apologize for not being descriptive. Our group is designing a product that prevents tangles from occurring. While many devices are out there, most of them focus on ear buds, so we are trying to design something that is not specifically for headphones but could work well with all wires.

11,E.I.T. looking to start an engineering business,1382330634,"Hello Engineers of Reddit,

A bit of a background. I graduated materials engineering this May, and have been working right off of university. As such I am an E.I.T (Engineer in Training), and am currently gaining experience with a hot tapping company. I have had leadership experience at my University, where I managed a budget of $17,000 and showed results at the end. We won 3rd place in the Micro-Assembly competition hosted by MNRA ICRA. My family is a family of engineers. My dad is geotechnical engineer, my brother is a materials engineer (in his 5th and last year), and all my uncles are engineers. I guess you could say engineering runs in our family. I also happen to live at a place where the oil sands exist. Maybe you guys know some fabrication ideas for the oil sands.


Down the road (within 6 months), I want to be able to start my own fabrication company, i.e. fabricating traps for receivers and launchers, and any other fabrication needs. I say traps for launchers and receiver, because that's what I have seen my company fabricate. (Note, that we are not a fabrication company). I do have a little startup money (Around 25k). That should not be a problem. However, what I am lacking right now is a general know-how of how to gain customers, and getting the contract.


I currently work at a hot tapping company, and am gaining experience in project coordination, project management, and dealing with clients. I have also been improving my technical knowledge. I am aware of how hydro-tests are performed, welding procedures, and have written up a few PQR's myself. I am aware of provincial regulations, ASTM, and ASME standards, etc.


I am a highly motivated person, and am really enthusiastic about having my own business. I believe I can get the job done faster, and more efficiently than lots of big companies. But, given my inexperience (at least in the initial stages of the business), I understand that not many clients will look at me favorably.


My question is as follows:

1) How should I be finding my clients? How do I go about it? Should I just be networking more?

2) For engineers that have their own business, how did you first start off your company? Any thing I need to keep in mind to start off my own company?

3) Right off the bat, what ideas for fabrication can you give me that will allow me to start small? Something that doesn't require much capital, and can be done part time (note: I still work full time)

Thanks for reading Reddit. I appreciate your time.

13,Cheap flight: viable?,1382321146,"So a while ago Elon Musk yammered about something called Hyperloop, which was very complicated. Nobody really understood how to do it.

I have had an idea which is so uncomplicated it must be a bad idea, but I do not know why it is so. Specifically: air travel is too expensive and underutilized. But it doesn't have to be this way (ATCs heart rates just collectively jumped). It is expensive for two reasons: planes are hard to build, and fuel is expensive. It is underutilized for one reason: it currently only makes sense to go very long distances, but if it were less of a pain it could be used to go shorter distances, cf LGA-IAD.

These problems may be solved in the lamest way imaginable: fly smaller planes slower. The power dissipated by drag is proportional to v^3 . This means that the amount of heat that must be dissipated by the skin is proportional to v^3, which places demands on the skin. It means that the amount of power generated by the turbine is proportional to v^3, which places demands on the construction of the engine. It means that the energy required to go a certain distance is proportional to v^2 , which increases fuel costs. A plane flying at 550 mph has a metal (titanium iirc) skin and a nickel superalloy turbine. A plane flying at 250 mph might as well have a skin made of FR-4 with an aluminium engine. It's even conceivable that over a short distance you could run one on a [Li-S battery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-sulfur_battery), though this is definitely not the point of the post. What is the point of the post is that going silly fast is really hard, and it isn't necessary.

Whenever the idea of supersonic air travel is brought up people always point out that the amount of time spent at the gate, checking bags and going through security makes faster planes irrelevant. This is true. But a slower, smaller plane can't ~~be flown into~~ destroy the World Trade Center. With 30 passengers it wouldn't take too long for people to put their own damn luggage on the plane. Runways that are built for 250 mph planes don't need to be as long as those built for 550 mph planes. This means that they can be shorter, it's easier to put them in more places, and there are in fact many such airports already -- general aviation!

There are some problems. Lift, like drag, is proportional to v^2 , which means that the size of the plane must not be so large. Modern planes carry ~200 people, so I cut this to 30 which seemed to make sense when I typed it, but really I'm just making shit up as I go along. Also, it's hard to coordinate air traffic already; if more people started doing it *and* you needed seven times as many planes per person ATC becomes a huge nightmare. It's just painful for me to believe that this would work for every reason but ATC, there's gotta be some sort of alternative there.

One thing this would obviously require is a regulatory framework to handle it. Runways at commercial airports aren't built for small craft, commercial airlines can't sell flights at general aviation airports, which in general aren't staffed for heavy traffic. Politics is pliable these days, though.

It seems like the trend of modern air travel -- bigger, faster, more luxurious -- is totally backwards. So have I lost my mind? ",AskEngineers,lua_x_ia,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ovhfd/cheap_flight_viable/

16,Pole Placement design question ... I'm missing something,1382302278,"I'm not really sure where to put this question... it's related to Control systems theory but is math... so...  

I've been given an unstable system, which just means that there are places that the system is ""undefined""... ie a division by zero.  Since this is a very bad thing, I'm supposed to adjust the system so that it's stable.  One way to do this is by adjusting where the system is undefined.  This is a process called ""pole placement"" (a ""pole"" is the place where a system could have a division by zero... consider 1/(x-1)... this system's pole is at 1).  

I have a system that looks like this:

H(s)=  
                    Kp + Kd  
          -----------------------------------  
           s^3 + 3s^2 -16s +12 + Kp + Kd

(for those familiar with control systems, this is supposed to be a closed loop system using a PD controller... with the PD controller block (Kp+Kd) in the feedforward section of the system)

Now, if I'm to find the gains necessary (the values of Kp and Kd) which move the poles to all be equal to -1, then I can... (and this is where I'm having trouble), I *should* be able to do this:

(s+1)^3 = s^3 + 3s^2 + 3s + 1    (where this is the desired denominator of the system, including the gains, Kp and Kd)

s^3 + 3s^2 -16s +12 + Kp + Kd = s^3 + 3s^2 + 3s + 1 (set the desired denominator equal to the current denominator with gains)

and then set the coefficients equal to each other... except that the coefficients *aren't* equal to each other...

Most energy expended from most electrical usage is going to wind up as thermal energy retained in the home: the universal breakdown- entropy- tells us this. But some energy does escape, and I want help learning and imagining what types of energy will escape the home without turning into heat first.

Hereabouts weather is getting a little cold, and everyone is wondering why we have to use high efficiency lighting. We're wondering if baseboard heaters are going to make any more useful heat than computers left running, or whether we're truly ""getting to use the energy twice"" when we run a computer, once to process some bits and then use 100% of that work again for resultant heat.

What is inefficient usage of electricity in winter? Light might escape out the windows, for example: it's energy lost to the home, *before it has the chance to breakdown.* For the computer example, there'll be some loss from radio emissions, which don't get captured by the home: that's inefficient use of power too. If your device has a non-ideal power-factor, how does that inefficiency manifest? I believe the electrical meter won't register this loss, but the power company will have a loss. What is the site where power factor losses happen and how is that power-factor loss energy radiated?

At the time I didn't argue about it, but it didn't sit quite right with me.  As time as gone on I've become more convinced that I don't agree with this statement at all.

In a manufacturing setting, it seems to me that testing is a critical component in the feedback loop that monitors your process control.  Good process control is arguably value-add, since it decreases waste and improves product quality.

In situations outside of mass production, such as transitioning a new product into production from development, I think the case for testing adding value is even stronger.  It helps you diagnose areas with high variability and/or weak process control, areas where you can relax your process control without adverse effects, etc.  In some cases it can help improve your manufacturing workflow.

The thing is that we are running out of time and we dont know how to distribute our money in ways that we can get things for a good price and make our car efficient. 
Should we get like better solar cells for their huge price? (the ones we have right now are mono-crystalline, 14.2% efficient) or get a better motor that we have right now which is a DC Permanent Magnet Motor (Brushed) to a brushless motor?
keep in mind that im only in high school, and our team does not get support from the school and we have to be careful with our budget.

My plan was to add a solenoid to throttle the flow of NOX into the combustion chamber. I was going to try and put it after the actuator so it doesn't need to inhibit such incredibly high pressures.

39,Can't decide between Arduino vs. Raspberry Pi for instrumentation project,1382123955,"My senior design project is basically a set of sensors used to measure properties of solutions, where the data will be sent to a processing unit, which will then wirelessly transmit the processed information to an iPad app. The processor will also be used to control an automatic system to add chemicals/drain solution to maintain a precise stoichiometric mixture. Unfortunately I cannot get much more specific than that because I signed a couple of NDAs.

I'm pretty proficient in programming so I'm not too worried about that. I can't decide between using an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi as the processing unit. The Pi is a little bit more robust and has more power, but it seems like there are Arduino models with more I/O pins than the Pi (unless I haven't looked hard enough).

What the issue comes down to is that I need the excess water to lubricate my device, but I only want so much of it, and then I want  the excess to drain back into my tank.  I can't think of a way to make this happen that wouldn't also be a leak.  As it is I'm already above the desired budget, and so I was hoping some of you may have an idea for a simple passive solution.  

I've considered putting some sort of collection area behind the O-ring, but then I'd need a way to drain that back into my mix tank, that wouldn't be a leak when the nozzles are spraying.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  As I've had my head in this problem for a few months, please let me know if I haven't fully described the operation.  

**EDIT:  Thanks for all the replies everyone.  A year ago I went from working with 4 other engineer/designers to being the only guy, and you have no idea how valuable these kinds of discussions can be.  I think I have a solution. I wish I had my work laptop to show you what I'm thinking of. If you're interested, read on.**


Basically, as I've been thinking and many here reinforced, some kind of drain area should help, somewhere for the water that gets past the O-ring to collect that I can control.  My first thought was a check valve here to keep the water I want kept out...out, and also allow the ""drain water"" to leave. I'm worried about this clogging in the size it would have to be, and if it clogged open, it could be a major leak.  What I'll do instead is put the largest diameter drain tube I can fit and run it to the base of the whirley nozzle (I think I know of a path that will keep this tube completely within the lid of the tank).  That should prevent it from having direct spray under any circumstances, and any that does make it inside, will have to bounce at least once to make it there, and should lose all of its velocity before it got into my slide gate assembly.  I can even .  This design change should also dramatically reduce the area where the gate and the plate it slides on are in contact, which I think may be helping to draw the the water along to where it puddles.  The only issue is that now the leakage of the system will rely on the system being perfectly level.  It has scales supporting the bins, so leveling the machine should help, though we're able to hit the accuracy that we need as it it is.  I can't think of a cheaper way to do this, so unless anyone can poke a hole in that idea, I think that's what I'll try next.

I don't really have time to machine a bunch of one-off clamps and supports, and I'd rather just find a good one-size-fits-all kit to mount everything. I would appreciate any suggestions.

[At my last co-op we used a lot of block clamps (at least that's what we called them in-house iirc) to mount objects to round bar (that could be readily bent at varying angles to reach desired angles), kind of like this.](http://i.imgur.com/zFJYh1U.png?1) It made it very easy to reliably position large objects with a very minimal material investment.

I don't really have time to do a lot of that myself now (spending more time on the business development side of things) so I'm looking for a good pre-existing kit that I can just buy that will let me start slapping parts together.

81,"Damariscotta, ME drops pumpkins on cars during their Columbus Day pumpkin festival. They need some help designing their pumpkin release mechanism.",1381822089,"2010 drop: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vsAGUajID8

2012 drop: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_33HmkvgyU

The videos show what appear to be perfect releases.  That is not the case.  I witnessed the 2013 drop and it did not release after 4 men pulled on the release rope at the same time.  They ended up tying it to the car and letting the crane pull the rope.  That's not good since they sell raffle tickets for (local) people to pull the rope.  Also, this caused people to be near/under the 1000 lb (hearsay: water-filled) pumpkin while it was lowered so they could figure out the problem.

Locals tell me that this is common and that they put out a notice for engineering help the year before (2012).

So here is what I think engineers can solve.  I think there should be a safety which holds the load until pulled.  After the safety is pulled, the load either transfers to a trigger or the trigger fails and the pumpkin drops.

Here is how they have it set up.  There is a crane hook through a ring.   The ring has 8-16 vertical straps that have rings at the bottom.  They wrap the straps down over the pumpkin at equal increments.  Right now they seem loop a rope or something through the bottom rings with a trigger that lets the loop go loose.

I do not know the release mechanism for the bottom loop.  I would guess that it is a sailor's knot type of thing given the proximity of the town to the Maine shore.

What is your best design or off-the-shelf solution?  

It will need to be made by a local person with a welder, torch, and commonly-used stock.  The simpler the better.  If you can do it with a rope (only) and the existing metal rings that would be better.

Basic drawings (or a link) would be helpful!  I mean Microsoft Paint or better.

86,How does a single-pivot side-pull caliper brake work?,1381795264,"http://imgur.com/a/JfON8

(Not on the diagram) - The cable pulls one one lever, which creates a moment of force about the pivot (O), and then the pad exerts a force on the wheel. It is the other lever (the one I drew) that bothers me...

What is causing it to push against the wheel? It has no link to the cable, it is connected to the sheath. And when I analyse the sheath, no forces are acting upon it.

Could anyone enlighten me?


When analysing a v-brake:
http://i.imgur.com/zWzBj9P.jpg

I see that the lever acts as a pulley for the cable, and so the tension in the cable is equal on both sides of the pulley, so there is a resulting force that can create a moment about the pivot. But I can't find this pulley mechanism in the single-pivot side-pull caliper brake.

36,Solar/Battery powered pump questions.,1381403922,"As a personal project I'm taking part in the [Greenpeace rEvolution Project](http://greenpeacechallenge.jovoto.com/briefing) and, as basically anything electrical may aswell the devil's trickery to me, I was wondering whether the fine people of /r/AskEngineers may be able to lend me some assistance.

This is day one of my work on the project, so as you can see it's already off to a good start as I'm having to ask for help, and these are currently very 'back of the fag packet' ideas as I've not yet sat down and done a proper analysis yet; But here is my current rough plan:

With Bihar province recieving an average of around 5kWh/m^2/day of solar radiation but an average of less than 3m/s windspeed a solar powered solution seems the most sensible.

Furthering from this I was thinking that to increase portability some kind of centralised power distribution and the use of batteries to run the irrigation pump would be helpful as it would save lugging around a load of solar panels. And here's the first problem: running time. I've calculated that to achieve a volumetric entitlement of 0.1m/Ha/day would involve a total discharge of 1000m^3 of water at 100m^3/hr over a 10hr work day. But a battery arrangement of 2 x 2 12v car batteries  first in parallel then series would provide 24v at 140Ah (again, back of the fag packet, I'm looking a feasability here) which would run a 0.75kW/1hp pump for only around 4.5hrs (and thats not taking in to account discharge problems).

So, my first question to you good people is regarding inverters and their use. Would using a 0.75kW Inverter at 220v 50Hz give any better longevity? And, possibly more importantly, allow me to drop a cell or two?  As, looking at it just the components alone (pump, batteries) are going to come in at a provisional weight of 125Kg. Not exactly ideal. Or is it, as I suspect, just going to induce further losses in the circuit and thereby reducing longevity?

Now, for my second question. Looking at the pump rating (0.75kW/1hp), and not taking in to account losses in the inverter, I would need a minimum of a 0.75kW panel correct? If I were to add just one SINGLE battery as some kind of back-up should the sun decide it wants to go hide behind a cloud for an hour or so I would need some way of maintaining a charge. 

Now looking at a standard car battery charger; they output at around 12v at 8A. P=IV (about all I remember about this stuff from uni) says that's another 96W required to run that. So bringing our all up total power requirement from the panel at at LEAST 0.85kW or there abouts. Correct?

So, in regards to my last, if I have to scrap the 'centralised power distrobution with battery packs' idea (which looks likely) how portable is is a panel (or series of panels) for a 0.85kW system?


Thank you,

Monty

41,Dealing with Managers/Empire Builders in a Large Company,1381373348,"I've got a bit of an issue with the politics at work.  I work for a big R&amp;D company, and generally people work in units, under divisions.  The units are drawn up based on things like competency (i.e. some groups perform optics, others perform mechanical work, etc).  I get along with most people, and when I need equipment and whatnot, people are usually helpful.

With managers it suddenly becomes a different story.  Suddenly when I need to use a piece of test equipment, it becomes incredibly political.  80% of the time, it's no issue.  However sometimes, the unit manager want to be paid (groups swap money in this company), or I'm given some bullshit reason why I'm not allowed to use it.  It seems like a winning strategy to just hoard all of the spectrum analyzers in the company, and become the King of Frequency Measurements.

Additionally, I find it very impossible to rotate to other groups, and learn new technical skills.   People are weary of sharing with others, for fear that they will muscle in on their racket.  There's no rotation program, you're pretty much stuck with the group you were hired with.  It's impossible to transfer, you can only go on temporary detail.  If for some reason the current King, I mean, unit manager, doesn't like you, you're gone after a few months.  So forget about learning optics, because it doesn't fit the King of Optics political plans for his branch.

Sorry about the rant, but.....how do I deal with this?  I need to work in a lab environment, with hands on work, but with a healthy collaborative team, and varied technical environment.  But I find each manager is more interested in building his empire and defending their lab &amp; office space, and perceived competency within the company, than in delivering on products.

I have seven strands of LED christmas lights, 50 bulbs each. Each string is rated 4.8 Watts (0.04 Amps). For use with 120V, 60 Hz AC power source.

Now, to make it portable, I've purchased a 500 Watt, black and decker inverter, to convert a 12V DC battery to 120 V AC. I then bought 8 'D' batters and using a battery pack holder, linked them up to for a bigger 12V battery. (Each D batter is rated 1.5 V).

Okay great, how the issue.

When I hook up the battery to the inverter, everything is fine. When I plug in the 7 strands of christmas lights into the inverter, the inverter starts flickering the lights and indicating that the power source is too low.

Why is it too low if it's a 12V currents?

What can I do to remedy the situation? I've started looking at different 12V batteries, and it seems that I may need a battery with more Amp Hours. How many Amp hours would be supplied the by the 8 'D' batteries I have wired together at 12 volts?

Lets say I want to run the christmas lights for 5 hours, how many Amp hours would I need?

This could also prove that spending money to help mitigate heat loss wouldn't be worth the money due to a ROI being too far out.

67,Need ideas for sub-millimeter 2-D position measurement,1381263218,"So these [MIT guys invented a means of doing position correction](http://www.alecrivers.com/positioncorrectingtools/) on a 2-D surface for carving out shapes with a router.  So they are using a camera and some sophisticated image processing to figure out where on the work surface the tool is, and to run the stepper motors to carve out the intricate shapes automatically.  If you watch the video, basically you just have to keep the router within the circle, and it does the rest, guiding you in the rough movements needed.

Basically, I want to be able to download designs, such as the [DIY Book Scanner](http://www.diybookscanner.org/), set up a 4ftx8ft sheet of plywood, and just start cutting it out.  This is a lot faster than laboriously measuring out the parts to be cut by hand.  The position-correction tool seems perfect for this kind thing.  Alec has allegedly left MIT and is now with a company that is commercializing this technology.

But I am impatient, and I want something now.  And I don't have the money and garage space for one of those Blackfoot CNC machines either.  The Shopbot Handibot looks awesome too, but is also expensive, and also not available yet.

I've been thinking about alternative approaches that would also take up much less space.

One idea was to use something like a small laser projector (or possibly a re-purposed bar code scanner) to show where exactly on the surface I need to cut.  However, for that to work, I need some means of 2-D position measurement, preferably at the sub 1-mm accuracy.

I don't think I'd go the image processing route, as the MIT guys, so I'm casting about for other ideas.

One idea I had was to have a long (lightweight) beam that can slide in and out from a vertical axis hinge.  With an appropriately geared-down encoder on the hinge, you can then get the polar coordinates of the end of the beam.  If you do a bit of calibration at the start of the job (getting the corners of the board), it should be fairly accurate, but I don't know for sure.

I've mulled other position technologies like ultrasound, but I don't think I'd get the required accuracy.

My last, very low-tech approach would be to just print out the plans on large sheets of paper and just glue it to the sheet of plywood, and start cutting and drilling based on that.  Assuming it can actually print 1:1 accurately.  This is not a terribly expensive option, Fedex has 36in wide rolls of paper, and the cost is $.75 per square foot, so like $24 USD for one sheet of plywood.

I have a product idea I would like to get a functional 3D rendering of. Its a mechanical product (a bike lock design) that I have visualized and drawn incredibly basic versions of, but don't have the engineering skills required to design the technical features of. I would ultimately like to be able to use these drawings/functional renderings to create a CNC prototype of of the product, and then start some sort of crowd-fund project for.

Anyway, this is my first venture in the mechanical product/engineering world. My budget for the creative design input and final drawings is a flexible $1000 dollars. More could be allotted, but from my research this *seems* like its a reasonable range.  My questions are,

Should I be looking for a freelance engineer who works in a specific program? From my research it seems this engineer would need either CAD skills or Solidworks skills...

I built this dual crankshaft to move everything - http://imgur.com/a/HZPJ9. There will be off-set washers giving the up and down movement. There will be two different sized gears connect to each shaft so as the motor spins the crankshafts will move at different speeds giving it ship semi-random movement.

Some Background on me:

I am Canadian. I graduated this year with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering. When I first started down this career path I wasn't sure if this was what I wanted so I decided to go for a Technologist Diploma first and then bridge into 3rd year at a university afterwords if I liked it. Unfortunately since I was a bridge student I was not able to use the universitys co-op program while I was in school. I graduated with distinction from university and was a perpetual staple on the dean's list at my technical college. I have interviewed for two positions and was told that I was passed over for someone with more experience

12,What do you guys think about the topic of economomic equality ?,1380969238,"Economic Inequality might be one of, if not the, most pressing issues of our time, and as it looks light the gap will just grow larger and larger.

I am asking this here, because in my worldview engineers and in general the ""STEM masterrace"" are the field where its really hard to deny that your 6 figure salaries are a result of a certain meritocracy.


Yet when I talked to people in the field I found that a lot of them where surprisingly left-leaning (which I found highly admirable).


Of course there are also a lot of ""learn to code or starve, plep, not my problem"" people, especially here on reddit.


So I thought it might be interesting to ask this question here.


Some thoughts of my own on the issue (just me ranting, you dont have to necessarily read this):


- As I see it, the skill bar needed to earn a living, will just rise higher and higher in the coming years, even people who now make a good living now, as say a webdesigner will become obselete, when you can click together a good looking website, in some lego-manner.
How should society deal with this ?


- Being so lucrative can also be a downside to a field that you are interested in.

 For example, personally I think I would have been a good lawyer, having a thing for precise language, but the over-saturation, as well huge amount of people that treat this like some hyper-competetive game of football, really turned me away from the field.

This might be different in STEM now, due to a large portion of the population having some sort of math-phobia, but this might change over the next years.
Shouldnt the field be left to the people who really *like* math and engineering, instead of people who are just in it for the money ruining it for everybody ?

- I hear a lot of people complain that they have to sacrifice some of the best years of their lifes with ridiculous workloads, while other degress have time to party and enjoy life, and should be compensated for that. I think this is a very valid concern.


Would you say it might be a good alternative to make these studies more attractive by say, lengthening the time to 5 or 6 years and offering free rides and scholarships, so these times can be more relaxed and enjoyable, and later make that up by higher taxes ?

We're dealing with a materials issue on a tool we're designing.

It's okay in a lot of situations, but downhole for years, in a pressure containing service, against H2S, it's just not rated high enough. It's no where close to things like Inconel, which is the direction we'd take if FeNiCr alloys were in any way significantly magnetic, but they're not.

I have a question regarding dimensioning in drawings. Usually in part design and drawings, you try to pick one system or another and stick with it. However, occasionally you need to have a quarter inch hole in a metric part. I was never taught how to annotate this properly.

Asking for a 6.35 mm hole implies an extremely fine tolerance, but asking for a 6 mm hole might mean it's too small. Obviously it depends on the situation, but what is the appropriate annotation? Does a simple dual dimension suffice? What's the appropriate way to add a tolerance to that?


Additionally, it's often the case here that we have imperial stock sizes used for metric parts (because Canada). If 1"" bar stock is being used and I dimension a part as being 25 mm wide, it might imply that I need that extra 0.4 mm finished off. What's the appropriate way to say ""Nah, it's cool, leave it.""

http://ii.worldmarket.com/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi?FIF=/images/worldmarket/source/22639_XXX_v1.tif&amp;wid=2000&amp;cvt=jpeg

This is called a chub and both ends are closed with an aluminium clip. My biggest gripe with this is the inability to scan for metal and machine parts inside the chub after it's being clipped. A metal detector will be triggered by the clips on each end of the product. An x-ray machine can't tell the difference between the food and the aluminium clip that might have entered the process as the densities are similar. 

I've asked the manufacturer of the clips if they can be made of anything different. He said that can't because there are no metals similar. I don't believe it... 

Does anyone know of other metals or alloys that could do the job. 

Obviously the metal must be Corrosion Resistant, Impermeable, Odourless and have a similar Ductility so we don't need to change the clip closing machines to much. 

Looking for any help. 

Thanks. ",AskEngineers,42points,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1nmt6n/need_a_metal_that_is_most_like_aluminium/

[Typical section diagram of bolted connection](http://i.imgur.com/odWV2bT.jpg)

Extensive background: These 3/4"" diameter fasteners need to join supports composed of 1/2"" thick 304 stainless steel to a base composed of 3/8"" thick hot-dip galvanized A36 steel.  It looks like the galvanized base/zinc may corrode a bit faster than normal in the presence of S.S., given the fact zinc is more anodic, but there is a lot of zinc, so I'm not too worried about it.  I am worried about the fastener being corroded, but would need to know what the armor coat consists in order to know if galvanic corrosion would be an issue (right?).

The test section of the wind tunnel has a cross‐  sectional area that is 20% of the cross‐sectional area of the upstream reservoir.  A   fan is used to accelerate the upstream velocity to 20 m/s.  An airfoil is being tested   in the test section at a free stream Mach number of 0.5. [Note: free stream Mach   number equals the velocity at the test section divided by the speed of sound at the   ambient conditions].

Assuming that the upstream temperature is equal to the standard   atmosphere condition, what is the temperature in the test section?

Story time: there was a very nice job from one of the most prestigious companies in our country. Among the young engineers in our consultancy firm it was the talk of the month to get that position.

I was nice to nearly all people; including janitors and people on the field. The other guy was a “suck up” and was very nice to people with a nice position but a real scumbag to other people. He had better references than I had. So most of the time he was bragging how he would get that position.

She told me the other guy rearranged the furniture, left everything behind in a big mess. She once asked if he could help her to place it back, and he told that she needs to do her ****ing job. She told me she had some back problems and hated it so much when someone did that.

80,Need help with a cooking project that has the potential for a pressure explosion,1380629559,"I'm a experimental cook, rather than an engineer, but I have a project I'd like to do that requires a little engineering.  I'd like /r/machining's help in verifying that I've done my math well.

I had the idea that supercritical argon might work as a frying medium.  It's entirely inert, but it's dense, and as a supercritical fluid, it will get deeper into the nooks and crannies of a food than, say, oil.  It should also not degrade at high temperatures (planning on hitting 190 C / 375 F), make a food greasy, and evaporate easily (I plan on draining to a large low-pressure exit cylinder and later recompressing to its source, ultimately, losing one potsworth at SP and elevated T; argon is rare stuff).

Problem: The critical point of argon is pretty cold, but it's at almost 5 MPa / 50 atm / 700 psi.  I'd accepted I'd have to have built a pressure vessel - and as a cook, a cylinder with a lid is just, you know, a pot.  For safety, I'd like to follow the rule of three (plus a margin) - meaning that I need a vessel to safely contain 15 MPa at 190 C.

I did the math below, based on Barlow's formula to work out the wall thickness:

	Barlow's formula:

	P=Bursting pressure
	S=Tensile strength of material in tube wall.
	t=Wall thickness
	D=Outside diameter

	P=2St/D

I care about the inner diameter, since that determines the contained volume.  To alter Barlow:

	I = inner diameter
	D = 2t + I
	P = 2St/(2t + I)

I wanted a device that was roughly pot-shaped (with similar diameter to height):

	V = container volume = 4L
	h (height) = I
	V = pi h (I/2)^2
	V = pi (I^3)/4	
	I = (4V/pi)^(1/3)
	I = (4 * 4 liters / pi)^(1/3) ~= 17.2 cm

Using I = 18 cm for liberal volume, I now have my desired inner diameter.  Time to solve for wall thickness:

	P = 2St / (2t + I) [Solve for t]
	P = 2St / (2t + I)
	(2t + I) P = 2St
	2tP + IP = 2St
	IP/t = (2St - 2tP)/t
	IP/t = 2S - 2P
	1/t = (2S - 2P)/IP
	t = IP/(2S - 2P)

	P = 15 MPa
	S = (using yield strength of common 6061-T6 aluminum) 55 MPa 
	(apocryphal, from what I understand; can someone verify?)

	t = 18cm * 15 MPa / (2 * 55MPa - 2 * 15 MPa)
	t = 3.378 cm

Just over an inch and a quarter seems thin to me (but I really have no point of reference).  Can someone verify I've gotten the math and metrics right here?

I'm aware that I'll need a blow-off valve, and plan to have one set to 7.5 MPa - 1.5x operating pressure.  I also want to have a primary blow-off valve feeding back into the exit cylinder when it reaches 6 MPa (and I'll need to know how to drop the pressure back to just above source pressure - it may just involve cooling the output stream, but I don't know.  Still, I'd rather not burst an argon cylinder).

Also, I'm aware that every hole I poke into the cylinder is a risk; how can I minimize that?  Do I just install them all on the lid and overengineer that?  My plans presently involve: a pressure meter, a thermometer, two blow-off valves (one to the exit cylinder, one to atmospheric), and a control valve to the exit cylinder.

By the way: is there a more suitable gas I should be using?  I've ruled out CO2, since it dissolves a lot of flavor compounds, as well as water and ethanol - both of those have critical points that are too high.  I went with argon for its density, but I'm wondering if that matters - I might be able to use helium, neon, krypton or xenon instead. If I'm correct, the specs for argon will be able to handle any of the others with only modifications to the operating blow-off valve.

Additional: I realize that the thickness of the endcaps require a different equation to suss out, and that the flange for the lid should probably be thicker and bound by X number of bolts, where X should probably be calculated based on the material and diameter of the bolts.  If anyone can help with that stuff, it would be appreciated.  Also, I have the tensile strength of aluminum, but how much does that float down with heat?

Any other advice is welcome (including, ""Hey, there's a company that makes these things"").

**tl;dr**: HELP!  I want to do a thing without making a bomb or a gun!

I have a material properties spec sheet from the 3d printing contractor for the polymer that we will use, but I suspect that the actual shear and tensile strengths will be significantly lower due to the nature of FDM and past experience with this manufacturing technique.

88,"Hello Engineers, I have a heat transfer question for you!",1380536913,"I've got a bit problem at work and I was hoping you could explain it to me where I can explain it better to my boss.  We have a small gas treater with a heating mantle wrapped around it. The max temp of the mantle is 220°C and my boss insists the inside will never get hotter than 150°C.
We need the inside material to be at least 200°C. Don't ask why we didn't order a mantle with a higher max temp, it wasn't my call.

The vessel is a 11cm wide x 30cm tall cylinder made out of stainless steel with a 4.6L total volume. The inside material will be different depending on the purpose so I cannot give any details about that.
The treater will be heated either under a pressureless environment (vent open, bottom sealed) or vacuum.

So will the inside material ever see 200°C+ if left on for 7 hours?

My boss is a Chemist so please explain it where he would understand :)

Edit: From what I have been able to piece together I have calculated using the Q= k (Change in temp)/wall thickness.  Q for our mantle is 3.5kW/m². This gives a temp difference of 0.001°C.

18,"ELI5 (or maybe 15): Television bands internationally, what are usually available to lease and how can they be used for wifi, digital distribution?",1380236040,"My knowledge of this stuff is totally from news reports and high school level science. Apologize in advance if this is totally off base.

I know a lot of TV bands in the USA have been freed up by the switch to digital. What about other countries that are less developed but still use the analog broadcasting but only have a few channels? What bands are typically available there and how could they be used?

[EDIT - Specifically I am interested in Australasia region.]

[EDIT 2 - Also, if it is not clear, I am trying to make a way to distribute acceptably ""high quality"" image and video DATA (perhaps with audio) in locations where all traditional internet options are unavailable/cost prohibitive. Not necessarily live stream broadcast (not all the time at least) - but like let's say there dozens of little units of video that add up to 1 hour of video I want distributed that change daily. after a day all the nodes on the network will have received that content saved on their local hard drives and can replay it indefinitely. 

Maybe during a certain time of day the band can have live video broadcast, that would be cool (assume we are the only ones on the band so we can turn off all competing traffic for that time frame) but during off ""non-live"" hours it severs this data-push update functionality. OR if it could be a decent high speed wi-fi that we can prioritize traffic so that at certain times we can stream live video reliably that would be cool. But I need as large a coverage area as possible as cheaply as possible (piggy backing on existing towers). I just don't know enough to know what is possible

**TLDR2 - basically if I could buy a piece of the TV frequencies for completely proprietary use what would be the most possible use I could squeeze out of it for overlapping data propagation and/or internet connectivity for up to and including relatively high quality video? What would be the limits I would hit?]**

**TL:DR Can you give me a birds eye view of what is technically possible as well as what is actually feasible/easy to do given engineering back end required to make these bands into a digital distribution network? Can you piggyback on existing (possibly analog) broadcasting tech to DISTRIBUTE digital? How about receiving so you can make a wi-fi network? And what about a special purpose new channel that may require special equipment and have certain digital ""tags"" or other features**

Is there any way that analog can be used in this way to have local devices buffer and replay the video (I'm guessing that analog doesn't have to do with the band per-se but the method of broadcast-but I understand analog usually has a longer range and gradual signal fall off, which would be useful since we want to reach pretty remote locations)

To give an idea of what I am thinking. Is it possible and what would it take to do the following:

**1) Create a digital distribution network that just *PUSHES* something that special-made-devices could download from?** The internet requires packets to go back and forth right? but could we make a push only network on the cheap? Is there any advantage to this? Maybe we could have (expensive, slow, low tech, low bandwith) internet connection in parallel that reports each devices status back to the central network periodically, and checks to make sure data received is correct.

**2) Create a large scale high speed WiFi network** - what would be the range? internet speed? can you piggy back on the existing TV broadcast hardware or would massive new hardware need to be put in place (IE new towers)

**1&amp;2 combined)** Could you make a large network that pushes to a large area but also simultaneously offeres high speed WiFi to locations near by.

**3) Create a... I don't know how to say... new proprietary channel.** I guess it would be the same as a normal broadcast channel but lets say that I only want to broadcast to a (relatively small) number of boxes with special equipment at each destination to try to make sure the quality is high. This equipment can buffer the signal and enhance it and can be moderately expensive (like commercial grade, not consumer grade) If possible making it so that it is not picked up by normal television sets would be nice, but not essential. Nothing secret on the screens.

I guess I am thinking digitally here, since I want to take the video and other content that is ""downloaded"" by this proprietary channel and store it to a hard-drive. So maybe:

**2 &amp; 3 combined)** I am totally spit balling here... but lets say I had something like have constant wi-fi type internet as well as live video like traditional broadcasting (possibly analog) on the same band. IS there any way those two can overlap in a useful way?

Like for instance, have the digital signal ""tag"" where a piece of content begins and ends, how long it is supposed to be, and any other meta-categorical information like ""emergency"" vs ""low priority"" or ""advertising"". That way the receiving device can store the analog video digitally and re-play it later.

Also any input to the normal political/business interests and prices in this arena would be nice. But keep in mind **this is NOT the USA or developed western market**. We are not a telco or anything, but could we partner with one to make something like this work?

I have no idea if I am explaining the technical part right, but hopefully someone can help me learn the right language.

I've really enjoyed my software paper (first year is general, we specialise from second year on) and I'm in the top quartile of the class, but 90% of them are going on to Civil etc. and I imagine most of the people studying software, and then going on to be successful in the field, are the people who've been coding for fun since they were kids.

33,Will I be unhireable? My situation is a bit unorthodox.,1380148204,"Hey fellow engineers! I've been feeling a lot of anxiety lately over my hireability, and was wondering if I could get some advice.

I graduated from college with a degree in ECE in 2008 with a GPA of 3.2 - 3.3 (I don't really remember, but I did graduate with honors, which has a cutoff of 3.2). I had an internship with the Army in the summer of 2007, and decided to go work for a private defense contractor after graduation. I didn't really like it, and decided to change my career path, and took some post-bacc classes in premed with the intention of going to medical school (which seems stupid given my low GPA). I got A's and A-'s in the premed classes and did pretty ok on the MCAT, but didn't get into medical school unforch (waitlisted, probably because I applied pretty late.) 

I was intending on doing the post-bacc part-time while working full time (the program was designed to for working professionals), but about a month after I started the program I got laid off after working for about 1.5 years. I thought ok now is a good time to focus on getting into medicine, do the coursework and volunteering etc. Of course that didn't work out, and I thought that given I had spent the past three years trying for medicine that I would be unhireable, so my first attempt to get a job after all of this was to go back to my internship. They hired me back (a little too easily I would say), and I've been there since january of this year. However, now that sequestration has happened, and with very deep budget cuts looming in the future, I'm a worried about my job security at my current job, and wondering if anybody will hire me if I start looking for a job. What do?

Also another question: I want to become a better programmer because I think that would be a good skill that I can use no matter where my job takes me, as well as something I can put on my resume. What can I do?

34,Is working as a project manager relevant engineering experience?,1380145845,"This is about career paths, so I believe this is in the correct sub. Apologies if not. 

So I'm a recent ME graduate who has been doing the whole post-college job search deal since around June. I've had relatively little success - a couple of phone interviews that didn't materialize.
Today, I received a phone call about an interview for a design and manufacturing company. The position is a project manager but requires a mechanical or industrial engineering degree. This position is not in the field or the type of job I was hoping to work in and if I were to be hired for the position I would only take the job to gain experience and reapply for different jobs the following year (or so). I am concerned that if I were to accept the position (presuming I were even hired) it would not be considered relevant experience for a more design based engineering position. If it helps at all, their definition of Project Manager is as follows: responsible for managing the pre-production process of new project development.
So I guess my question is - Despite the title not containing engineering, would this position help me find a different job down the road? Or does it really depend on the duties and responsibilities?! Are the titles of Project Engineer and Project Manager interchangeable?!! Were quexclamation points really necessary?!?!

**Requirements:** I need some extension springs to be securely attached to a printed circuit board. They must make electrical contact with the tracks on the circuit board. They have to withstand user interaction - bending, pulling and pushing.

**Proposed Solution:** 

http://i.imgur.com/2pimZHe.png - diagram shows spring in the normal usage orientation. Assembly would be upside down.

The PCB will have a 6mm diameter hole which is plated-through (the inside of the hole is copper plated to connect top and bottom layers). The spring is made so that it can protrude most of the way through the hole, and a flange shaped part of the spring stops it from falling through.

http://i.imgur.com/KGkDS2K.png (sorry, I mainly do 3D modelling as opposed to CAD and my modeller is crap at making line drawings)

The spring is made to be 0.5mm smaller than the hole to allow for manufacturing tolerances, and it is tapered to allow for self aligning insertion.

**Assembly**: Solder paste is applied to the copper pad on the PCB, the spring is inserted, and the unit is reflow-soldered in a standard PCB oven.

My goals for this design are:

* machine/automated assembly possible (is it?)

* if machine assembly isn't possible, hand assembly is fast and foolproof

* secure attachment, can withstand vibration and mistreatment

* cost effective by virtue of a simple spring design, easy to manufacture the spring

* allows for manufacturing tolerances

Is this design sane? Is there a better way to achieve this?

Would it be better to make the spring like a screw and screw it in from the front side, and have it lock itself into place somehow?",AskEngineers,ArtistEngineer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1n0o7w/help_designing_a_custom_spring_for_an_electronics/

65,"Career path question - New job 6 months ago, old job wants me back",1379995149,"TLDR: Old job wants me back after not counter offering my previous job offer 6 months ago. I'm torn.

So roughly 6 months ago a recruiter reached out to me with a job opportunity which resulted in me leaving my previous position. I had been with the company for 4 years, had been passed over for a position that had opened (they hired outside the company) and the whole place was in turmoil due to bad management and an influx of higher ups that really had no business in our industry.

Long story short, I gave them three weeks notice, and the VP of engineering did not counter. Three days before my scheduled departure date both the VP of sales and the CFO took me out separately to try to entice me to stay. I declined, wanting to get some perspective on other manufacturers. 

Fast forward to the last month - the VP of engineering and many of the higher ups have all been fired by the new CEO. I've gotten several calls from people asking how it's working out at the new place.

COO invites me to lunch, we go, he wants me to come back for a higher position and a substantial raise. 

Now I'm really torn. I'm looking at a 25% raise, and a nice job title, along with benefits. The company that I currently work for has been great to work for, they've invested a decent amount of money into me (UL training, PLC training, etc) and I get along really well with everyone there. I know for a fact that they won't be able to afford what my previous employer is offering me. 

I'm just really in a moral dilemma and would love to hear if anyone has any input based on my situation. If you need any more info just ask and I'll edit and reply.

67,At a possible crossroad at the end of undergrad: masters or industry?,1379991510,"WARNING: long post, tl;dr below.

I'll be graduating in a few months with a BSEE, a terrifying and gratifying thought. I'd like to end up somewhere that's doing something really cool with hardware. At the point, I have a graduate school offer at Georgia Tech, where I'm currently doing undergrad, too. I've also got a few interviews in the coming weeks. I'd sure like some opinions on the various paths I can take from this point:

- Continue my education. I (regrettably) did not pursue any research options in my undergrad, so funding my MS as a GRA seems pretty unlikely. Though I am talking with a friend about a possible position through a research company affiliated with the school. Maybe I find a job as a GTA. I already have moderate debt from undergrad (~22K), and in the worst case, I undertake more debt, something I was really hoping to avoid. I really like being a student though, and I'd sure like to do some things I didn't have a chance to do in my undergrad since I was always up to my nose in classes and extracurriculars. I would definitely be interested in research as a grad student though, just to see if a doctorate might be for me. But more likely than not, it's industry after the MS. 

- My on-site interview at &lt;insert company here&gt; goes really well. (I feel like I shouldn't disclose who I have interviews with). I put off the MS, either for a few years or indefinitely. My current top choice, that is, one that I currently have an interview with, is with a digital hardware R&amp;D position. It sounds like a position where I stand to learn a lot, and it's perfectly aligned with my current technical interests. It also would be nice to start making money (sure would be nice to be able to save up in a reasonable amount of time for things I see on MFA or /r/battlestations). I hear the company doesn't have a lot of career advancements, even though it's consistently ranked a top 100 place to work. 

- GT has the option to pursue the MS through distance learning. I take 2 classes in addition to working full time until I fulfill the credit requirements. Ehh...

- I work for a year, year and half, at wherever, then pursue the MS full-time. I'm afraid that this will appear badly though. Plus I am concerned about the transition, after working to being a student again, after hearing so many people have trouble with it. I'm really curious about this one. Is there anything a job experience couldn't provide that a MS could, and vice versa? Some work experience to finally put on the resume would be really nice as well. 

ANYWAY, thanks for reading if you did, if not, the tl;dr will suffice. I'd appreciate any input. 

TL;DR - pros and cons of working, pursuing MS, doing both concurrently, or returning to school after working a while.

So I'm graduating at the end of this year and I've been offered 2 positions (I know...first world problems).

The idea is to have ten/twelve individual LED 'fireflies' in each jar.  Each would act 'alone' and randomly flicker on and off.  These would also have to ran off a battery pack of some kind.

Of course ""safe"" might be hard to quantify...so I'll give you the context:

I am taking a public fire service management class.  In this course, we plan the amalgamation of 8 small rural &amp; small town fire departments into one county-wide fire department.  

One of the design parameters for the county department is a travel time of 240 seconds or less for the closest fire truck, for 90% of incidents.

We'd like to calculate how many road miles an emergency vehicle can travel in 240 seconds.
-----------

The emergency vehicles in question include SUVs, Ambulances, F-Superduty fire engines, 40,000# fire engines, 55,000# water tankers.

At a minimum, 'safe' means not more than 10 mph above the posted speed limit.  Obviously, that speed may be decreased for the larger vehicles and in inclement weather.  For the purposes of our project, we'll assume that 90% or more of incidents occur in good, dry weather.  If you have information regarding wet, icy, snow or leaf-covered roads, please share it.

Basically, the courses I've taken so far don't intrest me, and if I were to simply do problems from them as a job for the rest of my life I would hate it. I want to create things. If that involves technical engineering and design, great. But If an engineering job doesn't really involve that, I can become a craftsman of some kind. The money from engineering is great, but I'd rather do a job I enjoy.

Designing an airplane from scratch based on given requirements sounds very rewarding. Spending 9-5 analyzing wing loadings sounds like hell. Is there any real way for me to know what I would be doing in industry? 

I realize that design work will involve analysis as well, but is it tolerable? Is it more enjoyable when applied to achieve an end goal? For example, I really do not like math courses. Pure mathematics seems downright painful to me, but if you are using the same mathematics to solve for something in physics, for example, it doesn't seem bad at all.

It has been too long since I've worked in structural (all hydraulics these days)... On my morning commute, I noticed a funny detail on a bridge beam. It seems that a piece of cable was affixed to a structural I-beam web, close to the flange. The cable stretched from one end of the beam to the other, through a few interior eyelets (see linked sketch), and seemed to be in tension (very little sag), but not connected to anything else (i.e. no power / comms / signage). I wish I had a picture, but alas, sketch will have to do.

My best guess is that this is some sort of strain gauge that can be used to monitor beam bending, but that's a fairly weak guess. I've never heard of such a technique (but as I say, it's been a while since I've worked structural).

25,How can I exit a company gratefully?,1379615344,"So I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible. Here's the situation:

I've been with my present company for just about 3 years and recently I've been thinking about finding a new job. I definitely like the people I work with, and I get along with all of them, especially my boss who does a fantastic job of trying to keep me engaged and happy. The issues are, there isn't any room for advancement and my compensation seems to be substandard. For instance, most salary websites peg the average salary for someone in my industry with my degree (BSME), experience, and in my area at around 60k - 62k, which is around 35% more than I currently make. Add to that the fact that my benefits are decreased every year (they switched us to a crappier health plan last year and started making us pay 20% of the premium, and they said they now won't pay for me to go to grad school, among other things) and that the last person in my department to get a promotion got it more than a decade ago, means that I'm not terribly rosy about my future here.

There aren't any perks to speak of, unless you count free coffee, and through some subtle, and not so subtle, questioning I found out that the only people who don't seem to make more than the engineers are assistants. I know for a fact the company's profits have increased the last couple years, but I've still had to fight to get small raises despite excellent reviews. I honestly love engineering, but I also don't want to leave money on the table for no reason, especially when the field I'm in isn't my dream job. The reason it's critical now is that I plan on moving in around 3 years, so if I change jobs, I want to do it now. 

So my questions are:

1. Is my compensation really as bad as it seems, or am I just being greedy?

2. I once told my boss I'd let him know when I thought I should move on, and I'd really like to use him as a reference. Is there anyway I can let him know without risking being let go?

Our project entails a moderately sized chamber, roughly 800-2000 cubic feet in volume.  The chamber will be sealed a large percentage of the time, but it will also need to be opened to allow people quickly in and out on a semi regular basis (10-20 times per day).

I was handed back the drawing with marks on it, no big deal, but I noticed that all the marks were changing form ASME standard to how ever the company drafts up parts. and the plant manager (small company so I had him look it over) stated that this is how they draft up parts here.

Now the problem is, they state in ISO that they adhere to ASME standards along with others, but all the changes that were asked to be made go against ASME standard.  

So yeah, not sure what to do

52,Questions regarding impact strength and hardness.,1379463392,"Hi, /r/AskEngineers/. So I've been wondering about something concerning the impact strength and hardness of two different grades of steel lately. Let's use ~~mild steel and quenched steel~~ two pieces of mild steel for the purpose of this discussion. For the first piece I leave it as it is, the second piece I perform quenching using water on it to make it harder than it originally is. 

My understanding is that quenched steel is harder than mild steel. So if we are to put a dent in the specimen, quenched steel would require more energy. However, mild steel is more ductile than quenched steel. So if we are to fracture the specimen instead, then mild steel would require more energy. Is my understanding correct? If yes, how do I put all these data together in one graph and explain?

My home AC blower motor has stopped working.  The outside compressor and fan works just fine, but the attic blower attempts to start up very smoothly, but then shuts down.

I got an HVAC guy out to my house yesterday and he said my blower motor was bad, and it would cost 500+ dollars to replace it.  This didn't sit well with me, because when he was telling me this, he also said the blower motor capacitor was bad also.

So, now that I pretty much knew what the problem was, I sent him on his way and started doing some research of my own.  I pulled the blower motor and capacitor out and did some tests.  I confirmed the capacitor is bad.  But then I started wondering about the motor. 

I found this youtube video  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqiHh_Rufi0  and it showed me how to test the motor.

Here is a [diagram](http://imgur.com/m2i3njv) I drew, like in the video, of the resistance of my motor.  The ohms don't quite add up like he was saying in the video, but they are pretty close.  

Can anyone with more electric motor knowledge lend a hand and tell me if my motor is still good?  It will turn a 200 dollar self fix into a 15 dollar self fix.

99,Idea for CSP and Desalination together. Could something like this work?,1379187517,"Hey y'all,

This is not my original idea. I'm just curious if this would work and why/why not. 

Start with a regular CSP plant that uses Sea Water as its HTF/coolant.

The HTF gets super-heated in the plant's boiler and then gets driven towards the turbine, which is contained within a low pressure chamber. This causes the water to flash to steam, whose pressure drives the turbine. The steam is then condensed into fresh water. 

This would be an open system.

Problems I can see: salt disposal, moving steam into a higher pressure chamber to reduce energy requirements for condensation, best method for mass condensation. 

I'm sure there are many more issues with my idea. The only other ones I have found use molten salt in a closed system as the HTF then use the waste heat for desalination. If it works I think my way would be more efficient with a higher yield. 

Thanks guys.

At a high level, a LabVIEW VI will output coordinates to a 3-axis gantry system. I was looking into achieving this through an RS232 connection from a PC to a control box that interfaces with the stepper motors of the gantry system. I was told by a senior engineer that this setup would be impossible to control repeatably because RS232 is asynchronous, as is Windows. He suggested that I pursue a real-time operating system (RTOS) such as Mach3 and use a parallel connection to the control box. I am skeptical as to whether or not an RTOS is necessary for my application. My required tolerances are +/- 0.25 mm in each direction.

* **Offer-** $80k + 1 mo salary relocation, full benefits

* **Industry-** Midstream Oil &amp; Gas

* **My Expenses-** Houston, TX cost of living; $120k student loans; 13 year old car that's about to die

* **Leverage-** Interned there over the summer and did exceptionally well; well-liked by all employees too

* **Experience-** 3 month internship with company; 2+ years part-time engineering work while in school (modeling and research-related); not much full-time/salaried employement

* **Education-**Bachelor's in Physics (Tier 1 uni); Master's in Mech Engr (Tier 2 uni); 3.5 GPA


I was able to negotiate one round and just got a $4k signing bonus; no salary increase.

Then if it seems right, they might build it, and make sure.

But how do they even know how much force a part needs to withstand? Some things will be largely obvious, like downwards force due to gravity.

~~There's a weld that I need to check for leaking. I can't find an appropriate way to plug either end (I can't do anything permanent, and I need to test 17 different pipes, that are all the same).~~

~~I need to pump air into the tube up to a high pressure. Using a rubber fixture to plug the end ended up having the rubber expand and burst, so, not good enough.~~

~~Any suggestions?~~

~~Edit : Forgot to mention, it has to be sealed around the outside diameter, not along the inside.~~
~~For example, this wouldn't work : http://estgroup.cwfc.com/productsservices/spokes/01a_HTplugs_01-GripTight_HiPressure.htm.~~

~~Also, it needs to be able to work at pretty small dimensions. Less than 1/2""~~

~~Edit : This would almost work : http://catalog.estgroup.cwfc.com/viewitems/hydrostatic-test-plugs/o-d-griptight-8482-high-pressure-test-plug. They don't make the correct size for the pipe I'm using, though, so now I'd also be able to work with simply a way to essentially ""decrease"" that tools inner diameter/increase the pipes outer diameter that will hold up to high pressure testing.~~

**SO**

I did a quick drawing now that I'm home. Grey is steel. Orange is copper. Steel flange (bushing?) is fitted to a copper pipe. The weld I'm testing is the weld connecting the steel/copper.

Here's the drawing : http://i.imgur.com/IkwALnD.png

51,Any advice for individual considering switching ME jobs after long tenure at a company? (Crosspost r/Engineering),1378924102,"After graduating college with my BSME, I took a job at a small family owned OEM. I've worked here for 8 years. I've always been fairly compensated and I've become a trusted employee and go-to guy on several things besides just the engineering design and research. I would say my employees, colleagues, and I have good rapport and respect. I enjoy my job, but with the economy being down the past few years and because of day-to-day work load, I don't get much of a engineering challenge as much as I did earlier in my tenure. There are special projects or improvements, but not a constant challenge or long-term goal.

I only report to my boss who is above me and then the Pres and VP who are the owners. So there is not much room for advancement. My boss is pushing retirement age (2-3 years form now he'll be 65) and has not laid out any future plans, although I know I am the leading candidate to be ""next in line"" as engineering manager. The owners have hinted at but not put anything in stone as far as succession planning with me taking over for my boss. My boss has said in the past that he will work till he can't. So this isn't a guarantee. The President has also hinted that with my MBA, he could see me starting to take over some corporate responsibilities as well.

I recently have been getting more and more head-hunting calls, emails, and outside interest. I finished my MBA three years ago and a similar thing happened back then, but I felt I still enjoyed my job and didn't feel a need to move.

In the past few weeks I've been contacted by a head-hunter several times for a corporate level engineering job that will pay half again as much as I do now. It is in similar field and my skills would cross over very well. The job on paper and from the first phone and personal interviews seem like a good fit. Both my current company and the company interested in me are established and job security should not be of a concern.

I want to make the proper decision - should I be a big fish in a small pond, with no promise of advancement. Or should I be a medium fish in a large company? Any thoughts on this or proper process to switch jobs in the future would be welcome. I've read other similar posts, but most are about starting jobs right out of college. This is much different than I felt 3 years ago and I feel there might be a ""push"" to move-on.

TLDR: Employed 8-years at family owned business. Not much room for career advancement, enjoy day-to-day work, but not feeling challenged. Pay is good and enjoy 'family-owned' atmosphere. Being offered new position at larger corporation, similar field, room for advancement, and job will be a more constant challenge. Pay is excellent, but never really worked in large corporate setting.

The prospects were few and far between, so I stayed in and got my MSCE with specialization in structural the next year. I looked for structural positions as my main focus, but zilch. I ended up taking a job in the oil field, and two years later took a job in project controls for an civil/environmental firm. I hate being an accountant. I had two great structural internships during school, but frankly haven't touched code or a design program since '09.  

Now I'm really trying to get back to structural, but I am having a hell of a time. I've gotten a couple calls, but I can't get around the fact that I'm 4 years removed from the work I'm applying for. I spin it with ""although it hasn't been structural, I have stayed in engineering positions.""

Because the firm is so small I have to know about materials, corrosion, the equipment and how oil is produced, machining of our solutions and more that I don't remember. I have the impression that in a bigger company, you are more specialized and ""only"" have to pay attention to your field.

I'm guessing it might have something to do with the strength of the magnetic field the motor can generate. There's got to be less than 0.150"" clearance between the main rotor and the external housing, so surely the housing itself is experiencing surface currents of some sort, of a strength affected by its own conductivity and magnetic permeability, but I'm really just not sure.

I was inspired by the Maker Movement to start building/tinkering things. Most of the ""tinkering"" I've done involves software. I have no actual experience building things. 

I thought of an idea/concept that I want to try out. It requires a system of cables whose tension can be changed electronically (via a program). This might sound like a silly question, but does this technology exist? I would not want to spend time ""re-inventing the wheel"".

I imagine it is possible to change the tension mechanically by changing the position of the pulleys. However, I would prefer an electronic solution where I can program the cables to have a certain tension given certain conditions.

I am a biomedical engineering rising senior concentrating in biomechanics and interested in medical device R&amp;D. I go to Drexel University in Philadelphia. Because of a severe acute mental illness and some unfortunate circumstances, I was unable to get very much at all out of Drexel's co-op program that for most people settles the issue of the internships one needs before pursuing a full-time engineering position. Essentially, I have no industry experience and my GPA is still between 2.85 and 3.0. Despite this, I am determined to become a successful engineer, and I want your advice because I'm not entirely sure that I'm doing everything I should be. I graduate next June and I've decided to start looking for work now.

I have MEM/field related coursework like CAD and mechanics of materials. Skills include Solidworks and other CAD programs, MATLAB, statistics, carrying out experiments, and communication from being a math tutor. My biggest problem is no industry experience and no machining or manufacturing skills(besides using a drill press). I am currently volunteering in a gait analysis lab where I'm helping to create a piece of equipment for foot torsion testing. I thought it might be a better idea with my history to ease into a career with an industry internship after graduation instead of trying to apply for ordinary full time positions. However, I don't know how plausible this is. I've heard hearsay that internships are for undergrads only(and I've seen some job postings that state this).

So far, I have put together a list of 30-40 plausible companies from all over the country. Within a week or so, I will begin to reiterate my resume, create a generic cover letter that can be altered for each company, and then I will begin contacting them. I may or may not be able to get the machine shop here to let me in for a few days to show me things; I don't know if they will allow that.

For several of the matches the wind swirling around was a serious problem. So I wondered what could be done to minimize this problem. I assume that the architects did not consider the wind during the design. So if you were designing an open air stadium of that size how what would you do to the standard stadium bowl? (This is an engineering question so cost is a limitation. Covering the stadium would work, but I'm thinking about open air.)

I was thinking about something like movable sails on the top. Or ""carefully"" places tunnels to let the wind out. Is there something that could be done?

On page 12 of the instructions:

&gt;The transformer we wound up using was the third size, which has 4000 
windings on the secondary, which gives us plenty of high voltage output. It 
also has the larger sized wire, and with the proper spacers would oscillate 
right around 18kHz. This frequency is above most people’s hearing, but your 
dog won’t like this too much. 
So what do those spacers do? Without getting into magnetics too much, they 
lower the saturation point of the ferric core. This means the core saturates 
faster with a larger gap, which also translates to a higher operating frequency. 
This also means, however, that since the core saturates faster, less energy 
will be transferred from the primary to the secondary, which reduces power 
output.

Does that mean smaller spacers will make bigger sparks?

I'm guessing the circuit already operates at the optimal 18KHz, and ANY change to the size of the spacers will reduce spark jump power... (voltage)

86,Would a wind turbine built into a house be feasible/efficient?,1378775867,"Some background and further explanation for my poorly-worded question:

2nd year student in architecture.  I've been tasked with designing a house in Kansas.  I would like to incorporate sustainable design into the house.  I have already been doing research on ideal solar panel placement, etc.

But I was thinking of a low-footprint way to harness Kansas' wind as energy as well.

So here we go:

As of now, this house is a 2 story cylinder shape with a diameter of 25 feet in its most essential form.  If I use lightweight materials, I feel I could have the whole building be supported by a superstructure on the outside, and the second floor wouldn't need to be supported by the first floor's load-bearing walls.

So now there is a void between the two floors.  Is there any way to have a custom-built wind turbine that is oriented vertically instead of horizontally? (Think ceiling fan instead of traditional wind turbine)
 ([Here is a picture of a wind turbine in the orientation I am explaining- only much much smaller, and with a simplified fin design](http://www.pacwind.remnet.com/Hesperia1.jpg))
The blades could be designed with scoop shapes to help catch wind, and I believe the heat massing from the first floor rising up into the blades would help facilitate air movement as well, provided the tops of the blades curved over, making a 'C' shape with a straighter bottom portion.  

I imagine if the 'hub' of the fan was large enough, it could accommodate all of the utilities needed for the first floor (heating, water, electricity, a chimney) and of course the generator the fan would be providing power to.

13,"What is ""voltage sag"" in mixing gear setups and why does it happen?",1378527533,"So, when you hook up a speaker (live sound) you usually use a power amplifier. 

I can make the output of my mixer reach a relatively high voltage (say 16V) but if you hook up a speaker to it directly, the speaker won't get as loud and also the sound is distorted.

I've been told / heard in my past that this is due to the voltage sag that happens; the mixer isn't designed to ""drive"" a 4Ω speaker, so it can't produce 16V across that load.

My question is ""well why the fuck not?"" Technically, what is happening so that it can't produce the 16V? How does the voltage change?

My answer that I have been telling students for years, is that ""it can't source the current"". That is what I was told. 
But what does that mean? How can it not source the current? What technically happens that keeps the current from flowing to the speaker?

I know that 4Ω and 8Ω loads are low, as most outputs are 150Ω. So, I guess what is happening is that while the output of the mixer is 16V, most of that voltage is being developed across isn't own output - and it is only developing a small amount across the 4Ω part. Basically, a voltage divider.

21,Questions about galvanometer-based laser XY scanners/projectors and vector displays.,1378484718,"Before I ask my main question, let me give some background to explain what I'm trying to accomplish with this project. 

I was thinking about how one might solve the problem of replacing vector monitors for vector-based arcade games. In my opinion, nothing can really emulate the look of an authentic vector display. There are apparently CRT ""emulators"" which attempt this, but thus far I have been underwhelmed (I should say though that for casual gaming they can really improve things and I don't mean to denigrate the authors here). 

Now, apparently, you can actually rewind the yoke on regular raster scan CRTs to make a sort of homemade vector display. One problem here is the fact that AFAIK, tubes are not really being made anymore, or at least, not in any reliable quantity or variety, so you're still dependent on old-stock, and I would assume that the methodology is going to be slightly different for each tube you come across. More importantly, however, is the fact that many people (myself included) don't exactly relish the idea of mucking about with things that can very easily kill you.

Another option I've seen, is to use laser projectors to emulate the effects. This would seem preferable, were it not for the less-than-stellar performance of most I've seen. The operative word here is ""seen,"" because I haven't actually witnessed any in person, so I'm reliant on videos of them. What I can't tell is to which degree the flicker is from the limitations of the scanners or from artifacts of the camera. In any case, many vector games relied heavily upon the persistence effects of the CRT phosphors, which is obviously absent in a persistence-of-vision based system like laser scanners. In theory of course (and many do anyway, just to make the image visible), you could probably emulate this by rescanning, but I think that the required scanning speed here would categorically rule out galvanometer mirror scanners.

The above-mentioned option would be preferable for several reasons. First of all, it's conceptually the simplest, and thus, cheapest. Secondly, there is flexibility in terms of the display; you can simply project it onto any flat surface. Lastly, color would be exceedingly easy to achieve. You would merely use an RGB laser set up, and selectively mix the beams to modulate the color. The problem is the aforementioned scanning speed. Would this be possible with acousto-optic deflectors? If you want color you would need PCAOMs, and I'm not really sure about the capabilities of these. This is of course to say nothing of the cost, which I don't think I need to say is completely out of sight for the average hobbyist.

So, the idea I thought about that seemed the most probable is to emulate the working mechanism of a CRT most closely without requiring the high voltages or vacuum tubes. Stimulate phosphors with a UV laser. This is apparently already done, for large video wall installations, but apart from the fact that there is no consumer model planned, it's also raster-scan. Basically, my question is, using the same, or similar phosphors as would be used in a CRT, could galvanometers ""keep up"" with the required scanning speed as used in a vector CRT? One of the problems I've encountered in trying to answer this is the confusing nature of the various way specs are given. Galvanometers scan rates are given in PPS, points per second, but this raises further questions since the distance between points in a vector display obviously widely varies. There are other, more esoteric units that are even more bizarre. Secondly, it's unclear to me how to objectively measure the ""capabilities"" of a vector display and compare them with one another. The closet I've gotten is that vector displays have a characteristic bandwidth which somehow relates to how much can be scanned on a single frame. However, it is somewhat unclear to me how this translate into maximum scanning speed of the electron beam. There was a guy who managed to hook up the output from an Atari Asteroids board to the display from a Vectrex (for those unaware, the vectrex was the world's first and only vector-based home console).  He mentioned that the native asteroids display has a bandwidth of 1 mhz, whereas the vectrex display only has around 100 khz. I was thinking that maybe these numbers might relate to the maximum frequency an analog oscilloscope could handle, but I was under the impression that they were mainly limited by the electronics, not the tubes (obviously this is the case for digital ones, but I thought it was for analogs too). An even further problem is the fact that vector based videos games, to my knowledge, were always composed of straight lines. However, clearly other vector displays like, for example, oscilloscopes are clearly capable of curves. Is this simply a software problem? Or is there an intrinsic difference between the two that prevents one from (intentional) curves? I say intentional because oddly enough, it would seem one of the effects of displaying an output on a display with lower bandwidth is that the corners end up curved, almost as if it were a person drawing a sloppy sketch. 

Anyway, I apologize for my wall of text, and I appreciate your reading!

42,Possible Causes of Motor Overheat / Smoke?,1378338820,"So I recently completed building the core of an eBike I've been working on and have noticed some disturbing overheating in the motor.  Essentially what happens is the motor gets incredibly hot and begins to omit a very ""burnt rubber"" smell.  It has recently gotten worse and I've seen vapor/smoke coming off the motor.  At first I though this could've been loose material burning off or something similar but I'm starting to suspect that it could be burning insulation inside the motor and I'm worried about a short.

My initial guess as to the cause of this is the strain on the motor and the relatively low amperage being provided to it from the battery system I have in place.  The current motor is the [Ampflow E30-150](http://www.ampflow.com/three_inch_high_performance_motors.htm) with dynamometer results [here](http://www.ampflow.com/E30-150_Chart.png).  The battery system is a pair of NiCd battery packs in parallel at 5000mAh, 24V, and 5A Max discharge rate each.  The current mechanical system is geared at 1:8 and is driving a load of approximately 80 kg, which includes bike and rider.  My worry is that since the batteries are only able to provide 10A that the motors are straining incredibly hard relative to their input amperage, causing the burnout.

We are measuring flow with a differential venturi. We are still waiting for the differential pressure vs. flow curves since the venturis were installed so long ago.


Another person at work however was talking to a rep from the venturi company who is saying that this venturi is an extra low head loss meter due to it's wide throat, and therefore this will react ""differently"" than their normal meter. In addition there is a 7° forward (against direction of flow) offset to the high pressure side tap to cause a small amount of velocity pressure to be converted to static pressure. Presumably this is to give a greater pressure to flow velocity ratio due to pressure transducer limitations of the era. But I digress.

1) when i was a freshman in college, i got kicked out of ROTC because i stupidly admitted to trying a small amount of shrooms on my application.  i drank all the kool-aid, and ""didnt want the foundation of my career as an officer to be based on a lie"".  i later found out that tons of kids in ROTC were on all kinds of drugs, but they had the smarts to lie about it...  i should mention that the CO of the ROTC unit told me that the ordeal would not go on any kind of permanent record, and that I should re-apply.

2) i live in a state where marijuana is legal, and i smoke often (0-10 times a week).  the company that i'm applying to is based out of the same state.  i did ecstasy for the first time 3 weeks ago, but other than that, ive never done drugs.  RE: the shroom thing listed above - i only tried a very small amount (didnt feel the effects), and I never tried them again.

3) i had a run-in with a security guard in a super-ritzy neighborhood near my house.  basically, she rudely told me to leave, and i told her to fuck off. i didnt get arrested, but i have a misdemeanor disturbing the peace on my record (happened two years ago).

I'm a embedded systems student and I don't have a lot of experience with actually making systems work in the real life. For a project that I'm working on I want to create a small and light package that can launch a single small balloon into the air automatically. 

After some searching around I found this http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4872414.html which somewhat similar to what I want to make. It must also be possible to launch it remotely though. Also it is critical that the launching system is small and light, think less than 500 grams preferably although I'm unsure if it is even possible.

I have found some tiny helium cartridges that may be able to fill a small balloon sufficiently but I'm really unsure on how one would go about actually filling and then launching the balloon automatically. I guess there must be some kind of valve system that I can use, but I'm having a difficult time finding out what I actually need to make this work.

The swing would be very heavy. Usually when you let a swing go, it will come back but just not as far as the originally spot.

I'd imagine it would require a separate set of plumbing for the reclaimed water, but other than that, I don't know how much it would cost in terms equipment, costs (both initial and recurring i.e. electricity). Is this even possible for a small-scale residential use?

Second, I'd like to capture rainwater off the roof and store it for later use (watering the garden, most likely). In estimating the amount of water I could expect to collect, I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation of (roof area) * (annual rainfall) which gives 0.12 acre feet. (Average household use of water is about 1 acre-foot.)

However, I know capture won't be perfect, due to evaporative losses, and some rainfall events will be so small that they don't accumulate water on the roof. I'm wondering if there's some factor I should multiply by to account for these losses.

* A report that tries to investigate what is the **relative** life expectancy of the blades in a jet turbine? I have never dealt with turbines at work, I have however taken 2 thermo courses which I think will come in handy. As well as plenty of materials related courses.

*  A more wild idea that I had was to investigate ""why Carnot efficiencies are a real thing?"", for example: ""why can't we get an engine that is 70% efficient?"" But then I realized that I'd have to get into statistics+thermodynamics and that is a whole different game than what I'm used to...but if anyone can word this into a better problem that is more doable for someone in engineering then that would be great.

* My final idea is to determine optimum highway cruising speed for a specific car (ie: Toyota Corolla 1998) - I would somehow get the specific built (engine used, etc etc). I know this speed is quoted a lot online but I've never seen an actual study done....I also think it would be really easy since the ""hardest"" part would be to determine the relationship between speed and engine torque (I ofcourse would add tons of assumptions and make the whole thing unrealistic)...

40,My advice for (new) engineers – feel free to add your own.,1377683857,"•	The most important rule for your : When you see any major errors, problems or risks, always report them. Don’t wait for people to take action. Make sure you’re actively looking for solutions. If you solve the problem, the worst that can happen is that the profit of the project is lower (or negative). Next year people forgot the bad financial result. However, if you don’t report it, and people get injured, or in the worst case die, then this will chase you the rest for your (professional) life.

•	Always cover your ass. People make mistakes, you will make mistakes. Make sure decisions that are taken or when you report something too your boss, make sure there is a written report. You can tell your boss 100times a certain solution is a terrible idea. A year later he forgot (on intention) you reported it when the solution backfires. Make sure you have written evidence that you warned your superior for this. Even when your boss give you an order, and you have to follow it, send him a memo that you changed XXX that he asked for and he can find the result on place YYY.

•	Focus on the goals of your project and make sure the finance of the project is healthy. If your projects require a precision of 1N/mm, don’t spend more time than needed. Don’t spend extra hours to get it right to 0.01 N/mm². 

•	Become pro-active in projects. Seeing problems in a design is one thing, reporting them is slightly better. But you will get credit if you actually solve them. This is your task and gives you a reputation to get the job done!

59,Stumped with linear guide rails and bearings,1377594342,"Hi all!
Please be patient with my description - I'm not a native speaker and the technical vocabulary has me wondering even in my mother tongue.

Researching the properties of guide rails turned out much more complicated than I thought: 

My application, as seen in the sketch (http://i.imgur.com/mXdVUlS.png), is a vertical guide rail, which needs to absorb torque from all angles. I have no preference for the form factor, but so far I suspect a cylinder rail with two connected linear ball bearings would be better than a regular guide rail because of weight. (I have mainly looked in the following product families for suitable products: http://www.ina.de/content.ina.de/en/products_services/linear_products/index.jsp)

The application I go for is an ""unweighing"" machine like they are used in rehab: (http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2011/04/22/8659051/freestep%20SAS.bmp). 

I can't have an overhead beam, since the machine should be no taller than 160cm. Therefore, the user is strapped into a lower body harness at about 50cm from the vertical guide rail, which takes up to 40kg of the person's weight. 
I assume the unweighing itself is a lesser problem, since the force works in the direction of the guide rail. A spring/pulley system should do the trick. 
The actual problem is the torque this creates on the bearing - When the user moves around, I aim for no jamming even if ~350Nm are applied in any direction. 

Can you think of an appropriate solution? I look for a solid feel with lowest possible weight and noise. Pricing, while definitively an issue, comes second.

74,Choosing a Motor for a Robot Car,1377479179,"Hi guys,

I'm trying to build a telepresence robot. In my head, I picture the robot to have a triangular platform base on three wheels of which one can be turned with a servo, and the other two wheels are shafted together and driven by a DC motor. On top of this triangular base I want to prop up a camera tripod with a phone or tablet on it, and the battery/other stuff would sit on the triangular base between the three tripod legs to make it stable/bottom heavy.

Now I haven't done anything like this before, but I figured I can try to learn along the way. The first step is to build the base car platform, and so far I have the following requirements:

* **Speed should be 0-3m/s in 2 seconds**, this is based on average person's jogging speed, and the hunch that it wouldn't be too unreasonable to expect a robot of a camera tripod size to accelerate to that speed in 2 seconds.
* **Weight of the car would not exceed 10 kilograms**. This is purely based off of me having 2 10lb dumbbells and thinking ""I have no idea how heavy this thing will end up to be or what's reasonable, but it probably won't be heavier than these dumbbells."" 20lb is then estimated into 10kg to make the rough math easier.
* **Wheels would be 180mm in diameter**. In fact, I was thinking of using [these wheels](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WS-MO-7DI0Y/UKdRPkz4c3I/AAAAAAAAFXE/RZo3cALgd8g/s1600/xootr%2Bby%2Bsimon.jpg) when I saw them in person and thought they'd be a good size for the car.

So using these requirements, I've [calculated](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=XxWBd6Mi) that the motor for powering the car would need to have a torque of 1.35 N*m, with a speed of 318rpm. Now being a total noob when it comes to shopping for motors, here comes my questions:

1. So far, do this requirements sound realistic? If not, how would you change them?
2. Am I doing my calculations right so far?
3. I've ignored rolling resistance in my calculations because I thought it would be small enough that I can ignore. Is this a big mistake I'm making?
4. Where do people usually buy their motors from? I've tried to google up some motor vendors, but it seems like everything is very disorganized. Motors come in all sorts of sizes and shapes, and many spec listings are missing things like torque. Any guidance on choosing a motor?
5. An general tips with projects like this one?

79,How do you calculate the stability of an indeterminate truss?,1377430941,"Mathematically, calculating the stability of an inherently unstable truss is easy.
m+r &lt; 2j

Calculating the stability of a determinate truss (m+r = 2j) is more complicated, involving matrix algebra and hoping for a non-zero determinate.  This, of course, works because the unknowns = the equations i.e. you get a square matrix.

However, how does one calculate the stability of an indeterminate truss (m+r &gt; 2j)?  I would assume it's possible, it's not as if you come across a truss that's neither stable nor unstable.

This is all, of course, assuming pin joints and one dimensional members and all that jazz.

I apologize if this is a bad/dumb question.

**Diagrams:**

[Figure (i) is obviously stable from a glance.  Figure (ii) is obviously unstable from a glance.](http://commons.bcit.ca/math/examples/civil/linear_algebra/249250.gif)

*Calculating: Figure (i)*

m + r ? 2 * j

5 + 4 &gt; 2 * 4 ∴ indeterminate truss, may be stable. (It is, but I can't calculate it.)

*Calculating: Figure (ii)*

m + r ? 2 * j

6 + 3 &lt; 2 * 5 ∴ unstable truss, definitely not stable.

[As we can see, a small push from the left will cause figure (ii) to topple over while no force on any point of figure (i) will cause it to shift.](http://commons.bcit.ca/math/examples/civil/linear_algebra/251.gif)

[The stability of this truss (Figure (iii)) is not initially obvious.  Could it move about without changing the lengths of any of its members?](http://commons.bcit.ca/math/examples/civil/linear_algebra/252.gif)

*Calculating: Figure (iii)*

m + r ? 2 * j

8 + 4 = 2 * 6 ∴ determinate truss, may be stable.  I can calculate this stability I think.

Written in matrix form, assuming tension in all beams because I don't know any better:

We then can take the determinate, which, skipping the calculations, is -1/2.  This is non-zero, so this means the truss structure is stable I think.

[This truss (Figure (iv)) is obviously unstable as it could easily pivot about the centre, but still indeterminate.

I will try to be as technical and informative as I can, but alas I am not an engineer.  

I want to basically construct a cube on stage, but in the beginning of the play the audience only sees the back wall (so they assume that the set is simply a wall). The left and right walls of my cube will be attached to each side of the original wall, they will have 180 degree hinges that allow me to initially ""hide"" them by placing each of them at a 90 degree perpendicular to the original wall. So at this point the audience still just sees the original wall, but an aerial view would show a shape like this: l_l

The walls can then be moved to the following positions because of their hinges:

1. _ _l  

2. l_ _ 

3._ _ _

4 and then towards the audience to the opposite of this l_l

Now to the problem! I need to make the top part of the cube or the ceiling, but i still have to originate with just the initial wall. Ideally it could be directly behind the initial wall and using the fly system I could pull it upwards to where it sits on top of the initial wall (which would make a tall rectangular shaped wall). I need this tall rectangle shape to do projections, but at the end of the play when the walls all fold towards the audience to make the cube, I need this wall to fold 90 degress forward (making the ceiling). If I use the fly system to pull the wall up I can't fold the wall forward because of the ropes that are still connected to it. 

Sorry for the lack of a picture, and the wordiness of the explanation but if anybody has any idea in a somewhat simple way that I can bring the ceiling wall up and fold it over I would be very interested in learning how.",AskEngineers,TheFauxlosopher,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1kzmab/making_a_cube/

I suppose I can draw a diagram if required, but hopefully my explanation is good enough.
