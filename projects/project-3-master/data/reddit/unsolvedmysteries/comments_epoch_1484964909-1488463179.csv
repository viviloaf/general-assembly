1,[Civil][UK] Going into industry after PhD,1488454399,"I am asking this question since google offered little advice apart from [this](https://targetjobs.co.uk/career-sectors/civil-and-structural-engineering/advice/427572-will-a-civil-engineering-msc-phd-or-engd-help-me-get-a-graduate-job).

**My background:**
In 2015 I graduated with a 1st class civil engineering MEng. My supervisor offered me a PhD and I accepted since the topic and funding was attractive to me. The research is risk and reliability analysis of heterogeneous materials using Bayesian random field theory. I feel I have gained strong skills in statistical methods and reliability analysis. In 2018 I will graduate and want to work in industry as a structural engineer. I have no industrial experience.

**My question:**
Should I try to get value out of my PhD by finding a company that values it (more of a specialist/analytical role)? OR should I accept that [a PhD is not valued by industry](http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/11149/what-are-the-potential-pitfalls-of-having-a-phd) and apply to engineering graduate schemes as a normal MEng candidate?

3,Canada New Grad - Electric utility vs consulting,1488434092,"Hello senior engineers,

I am a graduating electrical engineering student this year, and I am extremely lucky to have two job offers prior to graduation: one with an electric utility in the GTA and another with a consulting firm in the prairies, but I am undecided on which to choose...

I have done an internship with the current consulting company for 16 months. I worked on some very interesting projects during my work term, and I know there will be much more to learn when I get brought on as a new grad.

Meanwhile, the job with the utility was very lucky for me. It may be a once in a lifetime opportunity since they rarely hire outside of university new grads and the pay as well as the pension are excellent. However, I did not have a pleasant experience working with an utility (different one) during one of my summer work terms, where I dreaded coming into work everyday. Also, I probably prefer a large city life compared to the suburbs of the prairies.

Do any of you older engineers have advice for a new graduate like me? My heart feels like I should stay with consulting where I am familiar with the people and am interested in the work, but the job security, lower stress and pay are big pluses on the utility side. Are there any other factors I should consider in my decision?",AskEngineers,younglad2017,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5x1k4t/canada_new_grad_electric_utility_vs_consulting/

For the most part, my job is engineering, but I do some CNC programming in MasterCAM for the manufacturing cells because I have a higher success rate then some of their dedicated programmers. 

Our company is growing more successful after getting some new big ticket clients. Now the VP of engineering (my supervisor) hired a Sr. CNC Programmer to oversee other programmers and make sure delivery dates are met. Because I do some programming, I fall under his purview in some aspects. The issue I am having is he is overstepping his boundaries because now he is interfering with the design phase of my projects because of his concern of machinability or ease of manufacturing. While I have worked with him in the past to find a solution that works for the both of us, he has begun overstepping his bounds by ordering me to change the way a product is made to suit manufacturing needs. Sometimes this is just a personal annoyance, because of the way I like to make things and I can still get the item to do what it would have anyways, but several times his change has forced me to go back and recalculate how to hit minimum specs required. 

The VP has been little to no help with this, stating that it is the Sr. CNC Programmers job to make sure projects hit the deadlines. He did not have much concern for the on-the-fly changes I had to make to ensure the item worked at all. The Sr. CNC Programmer does not have a background in design engineering or concept-to-final product, but is more similar to a manufacturing engineer in discipline. Frankly, I do not feel he is the right person to have authority over me and his changes have forced me to work extra hours I would not have had with my previous designs.

I'm curious as to what exact mechanisms there are that can accomplish this on a very small scale (&gt;~4mm when contracted, ideally ~1cm when extracted).

One idea would be to have a Z shaped object with two hinges at the nooks where the bar in the middle is fixated. Like that, you could push one side out by pulling the other side of the entire mechanism, even though it takes up a lot of space and only pushes the pin as far out as half the length of the middle bar, which is kind of inconvenient.

69,[Electrical] How does this circuit measure Current Leak?,1488257116,"Hi guys, 

I'm currently working in the medical device area but trying to get into electrical engineering. A really cool problem came up that hits a little bit of both, but I am struggling with trying to understand the content. For a bit of context, I am working with ""current leakage,"" or the presence of unwanted current due to the non-ideal behavior of devices. For example, an ideal transistor will not have any current passing between its plates, but transistors in the real world will have this ""leak"" of current because the dielectric in the middle is not perfect. Similarly, breaks in insulation can lead to current leaks. Now in implantable medical devices (such as pacemakers, ICDs, etc.) measuring and containing this leakage becomes increasingly important as we don't want this leakage to lead to unintended shocks in the patient's tissue. The confusing part came when I was looking at methods of measuring this leak. From one of the [references](http://slpower.com/reference/An113%20Leakage%20Current.pdf) I found: 

&gt; For very low leakage currents, the meter is replaced with a network consisting of either a resistor
or a resistor and capacitor combination. The voltage drop across the network is then measured
using a sensitive ac voltmeter. Ungrounded or double-insulated equipment is checked by
connecting the meter between any touchable conductive part and ground. In the case of nonconductive
housings, a copper foil of a specific size is placed on the housing, and the current
flowing from it to ground is measured. 

[Here is the circuit of what I think the above paragraph is referring to](http://www.mddionline.com/sites/default/files/mddi0407p54b.jpg). ([Source website](http://www.mddionline.com/article/leakage-current-standards-simplified))

From the diagram it seems that the incoming signal is attenuated by a low pass filter. The capacitor blocks low frequency signals while higher frequencies ""short"" the capacitor. What's going on here? Is the leak always represented by a low frequency signal? How is this circuit really capturing what leakage is from the circuit?

70,System Model required for application of control theory,1488256009,"I am a senior in college and taking controls II this term. The course focuses on discrete systems techniques: root locus, frequency response method for compensator design, and state space models.  In all cases it seems that we need to have a system model given, or at least be able to derive it from first principles. 

I get the impression that this does not scale to large systems in industry.  Sure, if you want to design a system with a few nested control loops for position control of a motor etc, then I can see this being practical. But, from what I understand it seems that many systems are massively more complex and full of non-linearities. 

I asked my professor about this, specifically, if you can't determine a system transfer function for some reason, either the system is to complex and/or you can't reasonably determine it experimentally, what do you do?  His answer was basically: ""you can't apply the techniques we have learned"". 

So what do you do in practice?  It seems like you could just throw a few PID controllers in there, tune, and hope for the best; but, that doesn't seem to provide the level of rigour you might want. Anyone with experience in this area?

A coworker has recently sent an email about his daughter being involved in an accident and resulting with significant eye sight loss (blind in one eye, very limited on the other). Apparently she likes taking part in [dressage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT6Yn7SLkmQ&amp;t=255s) competitions.

The arena is 20mx60m and has markers (letters) around it. http://i.imgur.com/z2pMFVk.jpg

To compete properly she needs to know where she is standing and where to go.

To do this he thought of setting a set of weatherproof speakers on each of the letters connected to a device where someone outside the arena can input the letter (Via a phone, tablet or control panel) and the speaker would play the letter when she's 12m away, then again at 6m and then again when she gets there. Then the next letter would be input and so on.

Basically it is an array of speakers connected to a control device (preferably wireless) which would play different sounds on one speaker at a time as commanded .

This also needs to be portable so it can be transported and set up easily in new arenas.

I thought it would be cool if I could replicate this. I’m thinking that I will need to build an “exoskeleton” what can support the weight of the suit (mostly foam floor mats). This “exoskeleton” will probably just be weight-supporting rods with joints to mimic the human shape (like a stick figure), and I’ll build a frame for the foam armor on top of that. The joints need to be human-like so I can move while I wear the armor (hence ball joints), but also be lockable so the armor can stand on its own when I exit the armor. I want the locking/unlocking to be fast and not require external help, so I want to control it electronically.  
  
Any ideas on where I can find such joints? Or if there is a better/simpler way to build an armor that can both be worn and stand on its own.

2,In dire need of some guidance from a residential structural engineer,1488173280,"Hello all,

To premise, I truly apologize for the length of this post. I don't think a short post will help to explain the problems. I asked mods if I could post here and they said that they'd be ok with it. 

I know you can't give me anything without actually looking at my problem, but I just want to run a few things by you and see if I can get anything helpful. 

So, to summarize I'm a first time home owner. I bought my house almost 2 years ago. I had an inspection done and the inspector said everything was A-OK. Unfortunately the inspection was done during a hot and dry summer. 

Fast forward and while having plumbing done under my crawl space a plumber mentioned that there was some water down there. This spurred a crazy adventure of having contractors of all natures come out to share their opinions and needless to say it's been the Wild West as far as suggestions and costs of said suggestions. 

Here are pictures of one problem area under a footing in the corner of my house. 


Here are pictures of one of the known problem areas. 

imgur.com/96Xzn6h

Close up

imgur.com/MweHoXm

Hole in crawl is near downspout in picture but also see foundation wall to the left 

imgur.com/WSLUbvW

Seems water is intruding. I'm working on addressing drainage issue. In the picture of the exterior of the house I found that the footing is literally 1 to 1 and a half feet down in the ground so very close to the surface. 

I unfortunately violated the rule of 45 while digging to see where water was intruding, but only for about an inch and filled the dirty place back in with compact wet dirt and tamped it down. I stopped as soon as I saw the bottom of the footing which is already undermined as seen in the crawl space. 

Anyhow, I found where water was pooling about a foot and a half under ground about 2 to 3 feet from the foundation wall and I'm trying to brainstorm in how to put some sort of drainage in here without violating the rule of 45... any ideas you might have would be appreciated. 

Second, once I fix the water intrusion issue what do I do to fill in that space under the footing as you see in the picture? I've heard everything from ""DONT TOUCH IT CALL AN ENGINEER"" to ""just fill it in with cement/concrete from Home Depot"" from a local long time foundation company. 

I want to be clear that, yes, my house has settled. It was built in 1962, and does have some dips and valleys in the floors in areas up to an inch grade. I also want to point out that doors aren't sticking, but it is possible they were shaved by a previous owner, and also that there are hairline stress cracks about pretty much all of my windows corners in my living room, but nothing huge or gaping. The walls aren't separating and my large living room doesn't have any cracks along the ceiling. 

Here are the suggestions that I've been given so far

1. Tie in downspouts to drainage system to street around perimeter of house - $3000+tax

2. Put in a sump pump - $3000+ tax(I'm not sure how this will help if water is pooling only in certain areas of the crack and not filling up enough to travel to the sump pit)

3. Full perimeter footing drain $18,000+ tax going to dry well. This company also quoted a footing drain for the front that you see in the picture and wants $6700+ tax just for that tiny area. 

4. 7 push piers installed at front of house $7800+tax and also recommended sump and putting piers in crawl to provide more support for living room floor

5. Full perimeter curtain drain and tie in downspouts to curtain drain $5000+ tax ( this guy seems like an idiot because after research I discovered that you should NEVER tie in your downspouts to a French or curtain drain due to debris from the roof and the ridges in the drainage material) 

I've also had companies come out that just said to fix drainage and leave it alone. 

I don't know if I just have a ton of inept contractors near me, but I feel like I'm either being told bad information, or just trying to be sold on something that's overkill and will rape my pocket book. My crawl space isn't flooding. There is water in a few areas that seems to come from under the footing, and I feel confident that I could dig a trench and add drainage myself which is my plan, but I just don't know what to do about the divots under the footing  like we see in the picture, and I don't want to create more issues. 

I'll also save you some trouble and let you know that some of the digging that I did today seems to have shown that I likely have clay soil. It was very brownish as I pulled the soil up even above the footer. I did not dig the footing out completely at about a 2 inch width once I saw the bottom I stopped and filled back in. 

Any help, suggestions, thoughts that someone qualified could provide id greatly appreciate. I bought this house for $230,000 and it's not worth more than roughly $250,000 right now so if I start dropping a fortune on it I've pretty much gone underwater on this place.

6,Can you guys please give some feedback on my ideas for repairing a retaining wall?,1488161299,"So basically, part of the ruined retaining wall in the garden is leaning out, leading to holes in the soil above. I would like to correct this, and to preserve the wall.

Imgur album of the situation: https://imgur.com/a/jZiHP

My idea is stolen from a technique I've seen used to keep old English cottages together. Basically, you drill holes in opposite walls of the house, poke a massive threaded rod through, and then use a brace to literally tie the whole house together. If you've ever wondered what the little metal crosses on old buildings are, this is their purpose: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Oldendorf_%28Luhe%29_Wohlenbüttel_-_Wassermühle_05_ies.jpg/1280px-Oldendorf_%28Luhe%29_Wohlenbüttel_-_Wassermühle_05_ies.jpg

Now, obviously I can't drill right through, as it's a retaining wall, but because we're on a hill, I'm sure there is bedrock behind there- there's very little topsoil on the property. My plan is to drill into this, anchor the rod, and tie everything back up. The rock is a fairly soft limestone, known as coralstone.

So the questions I'm currently trying to address are:. 


1. Is this feasible? 

2. Is a 36"", 0.75"" hole going to be enough? (I'll be renting the bits and a hilti). 

3. Should I try and use a concrete anchor or exposy glue to keep the rod in place? 

4. I was thinking about using 2"" by quarter inch plates, and putting in about four crosses. Does that sound about right?  

Or am I barking up the wrong tree entirely?

In case you are wondering why: 

* First, I'm just plain curious. I really want to better understand how things work in practical terms. The aerospace industry absolutely fascinates me; I think it illustrates just how intelligent our species is and is key in ensuring our survival. 
* Next, I want to invent. My knack in the business world is process improvement and innovation. I take the constraints of the organization and try to find ways to make it more efficient and effective. I would love to be able to apply that same framework to products and inventions, but am lacking the technical skills to do so. I have tried the approach of just googling/researching what I ""need to know"" for individual scenarios in the past, but would prefer to have the background knowledge to truly understand  the underlying principles.

1. Is this career path flexible in terms of where I can live? Nearly everything is connected to the grid, so it seems this job will be needed nearly everywhere. (This is the most important question for me)

2. How competitive is it amongst more season professionals? I'm thinking of transitioning to the private sector in the future, but I have no idea what the competition is like.

3. What resources should I look into to mastering transmission engineering? I've read the Lineman &amp; Cableman's Handbook, RUS, and am currently reading the NESC Handbook. 

4. Any tips on getting the handle of PLS CADD and PLS Pole? It's been very learn as I go at work, I would like to be less intrusive with my superiors with every roadblock I run into.

5. What has your opinion on the field been since you began to where you are now? My impression so far is that it's not a sexy field, but it's very important and seems to be overlooked by the general public.

There seems to be a recent influx of high school students and other prospective college students asking what engineering major they should choose, or wondering what engineers actually do at their jobs. The AskEngineers work experience posts linked above was created to address these questions. These *""what major should I choose?""* threads are not allowed according to our [submission guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_questions) due to the high number we get every year. Our users have complained in the past that these threads become very spammy and take over subreddit traffic.

That said, I haven't locked any of the ones posted so far as they are technically allowed if you follow the guidance below.

###tl;dr BEFORE posting about how to choose your college major:

1. Ideally, you should have already made your decision on which major to choose (or at least narrowed it down) based on info in our [**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/workexperience#wiki_work_experience) page... so if you haven't done any reading yet, please do so before posting.

1. Come up with followup questions about the specific engineering discipline you're interested in and include them in your post. Some examples of relevant followup questions:
  * *what's the job outlook for this field?*
  * *are there any jobs in this field that allows frequent travel?*
  * *what's the work-life balance like for a typical job in this field?*

1. Finally, use the search function and look for past threads asking the same question. Many of the questions you have may have been answered in the past.

Occasionally check back on your thread for new comments so that you can answer followup questions and provide more info. The more information you provide, the more our users can help you. Here's an example of a recent thread that was well taken care of by its OP: https://redd.it/5vqwxu

23,Should I choose job based on likelihood of receiving an interim security clearance?,1488055856,"I recently got my undergrad degree in mechanical engineering in the US and received two job offers from two separate, well-known defense companies (let's call them Company A and Company B).

My preferred choice is Company A since the location, pay, team I'd be placed on, company reviews, work I'd be doing all seem great. I was about to go ahead and accept the offer until they informed me that I'd need a security clearance before I can begin. On the other hand, Company B is an OK offer but will let me begin working as long as I am pursuing the clearance.

I have no worries about obtaining the actual clearance, since I have no financial problems, arrests, drug use, etc. However, I am worried that I will not be approved for an interim clearance since I am a dual citizen of Japan, spent a semester abroad in Singapore, and did a decent amount of travel in Southeast Asia. Additionally, my mother is a citizen of Japan so I have family members (not immediate) in Japan.

If I am not approved for an interim clearance, I may have the job offer for Company A rescinded or if they are willing to keep me on, I'd have to wait an unknown amount of time until I can receive the final clearance (I've heard up to a year or more due to the backlog). Company B is not my first choice, but at least I can start when I want and have an income during this time.

Should I go with my preferred choice of Company A and risk the long wait or being unemployed months in the future, or play it safe and go with Company B?

I think that control systems can (should?) be implemented in embedded using DSP, but am really not sure. That's why I am asking this here.

Do the follwing few words make any sense: ""dsp engineering for control systems of ballistic
missiles""

38,Making a clamp with bolts,1487972822,"So I am looking to build a ski press. Typically a ski press uses an air bladder to achieve a uniform ~40psi across the ski. 

Since I am only going to use it a couple of times at best, I had the thought of using small paddles and bolts to achieve the clamping pressure needed.

Torque(in-lbs)=.2 x bolt diameter(inches) x clampload (pounds)

That equation is the one I ran into that seems to fit approximately what I'm after. That function with the table below tells me I'll get 800lbs of pressure at the end of the bolt if I put 40lbs of torque on the nut.

40,Why do my earbuds have only the vocals cutting out?,1487965006,"I've gone through about half a dozen sets of earbuds with the same failure mode with different mobile devices and different earbud brands. It typically is some sort of loose/intermittent connection near the earbud plug. I can only imagine this is mostly because repeated tension on the wire throughout it's lifetime of use.

The symptom is that both Left/Right audio channels still work, however the vocals are lost or intermittent when I flex the wire near the plug (while holding the plug still inside the jack). I can still hear background music/baseline through both channels.

**What I don't understand is there is only 3 wires (Left, Right, Ground?) and if there was intermittent connectivity on any of them I would expect one earbud to cut out completely. Why is it that I can still hear background music but not audio? It's almost like certain frequencies are passed but not others.**

Other Troubleshooting:

- Fresh earbuds work on the same audio source devices, the devices have no problem connecting with the plug itself and I have not observed any loose plugs

- I cut off the plug of one set of earbuds and soldered it to a new one and they still work, confirming there is no problem with the buds themselves

Ideally I'd like to order a few low profile plugs, solder it and then over engineer the shit out of the strain relief so this doesn't happen again.

For example, my Keurig requires a K-Cup be inserted into the feeder, and I imagine a carousel of sorts to hold the cups, then some other mechanisms to select a cup and move it to the feeder, another mechanism to extract the spent cup from the feeder, etc... On the whole it's a daunting task, but I can visualize breaking it down into difficult but manageable pieces and then it becomes a matter of implementation but I run into a couple of issues : 1) I do not have the terminology to describe what I need when searching for help or parts on the internet 2) my solution may involve the use of square wheels and due to my ignorance I may not know that round wheels exist for the task and 3) I'm not a machinist, don't have machinist tools, and I'm not set-up to craft custom parts. 

Does anyone know of any sites that cater towards the hobbyist that needs to fashion gizmos at this scale and doesn't require the hobbyist have a workshop of tools to create custom parts? Also, is there a book or site that would help someone new to *this particular* field, some series or book of bag-of-tricks, solutions to common problems, etc? For example, I have a problem where I want to utilize a single motor to drive two different loads (only one active at a time)... what do I search for? How do I do it? Are there ready-made parts out there that can accomplish this at the scale I'm working at? I can envision a solution in which a gear attached to the shaft of my stepper motor can be moved up or down in order to engage a different load (sort of the way I imagine a multi-function printer would shift gears to work on different loads), but what is that device called? Perhaps there's a simpler way to do this? Someone else mentioned a solution in which something is attached to the shaft that will work one load when going in one direction and another one when going the other direction. Awesome, but what is that, and where do I find it? Now I don't want this thread devoted to answering these particular questions since that's not the point, but I want to illustrate the type of questions that come up all the time and I'm hoping someone can help point me in the right direction.

I'm trying to drive this motor using a [VESC \(v4.12\)](http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/)

However, I recently shorted the 3.3V rail to the 25V or something rail, damaging most of the components. I've since replaced the STM32 chip, bluetooth, Vreg, and CAN transceiver (still waiting on a new thermistor, right now the VESC thinks it's at -15 degrees C) and most of the functionality is back, except for detecting some of the motor parameters.

See, the BLDC-Tool program that is used to change the settings on this VESC has a feature where it can detect R, L, and λ for the motor, and uses those parameters to help control the motor. [\(Image)](http://i.imgur.com/ONMI90B.png). ""Measure R and L"" works, but ""Measure λ"" doesn't- the note on it says ""Spins up the motor using delay commutation and measure the flux linkage"". While it worked in the past, spinning up the motor smoothly and giving a value, trying to use it now returns a ""Bad detection result received"" error from the program. No other faults are registered (over voltage/current/temp, DRV fault), nothing. The weird thing however is that you actually can spin up the motor smoothly- I took a guess at a value for it, and turned on FOC- worked alright so far, though I have not tested the motor under load yet.

While scouring the net for solutions, [I came across this post](http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?t=131#p693), by the designer of the motor controller- he said:

&gt; Do you know the motor kv and number of poles? In that case you can calculate the flux linkage like:
&gt; 
&gt; lambda = 60 / (sqrt(3) * pi * kv * pole_num)


So my question is- have any of you used a VESC with the same kind of motor as me, and if so what was your value for λ under the FOC settings?

Otherwise, is it true that I can just calculate λ using that equation? If so how would I find out the number of poles on my motor? Is it the number of lobes/groups of windings on the stator? (I count 12)

It's rather powerful, and should discriminate targets with 1 m22 RCS in ranges up to 200 km. Okay, let's build its range-speed image (about ±±750 m/s in speed dimension, about 1500 m in range).

But there is a problem: when there are some targets nearby (about 10 km) they give not just a peak that can exceed the discrimination threshold, but a cross-like figure (sidelobes in range dimension, end, especially, sidelobes in speed dimension). And if the target is close enough, freaky sidelobes still can exceed the threshold and be treated as target candidates.

Even if I use window function with heaviest sidelobe-cancelling effect (Blackman-Harris), the sidelobes became smaller bus weren't wided out completely (and still give me ghost targets).

I'm reaching the end of my enlistment in the Air Force, in which I sacrificed 7 long years to uncle Sam. Now at the ""ripe"" age of 26 I have made the decision to start new and change careers! I LOVE engineering in general, I love tinkering with things, working with computers, building, upgrading, redesigning things, etc. I've been leaning towards Mechanical Engineering, but the mysterious Computer Engineering major is calling my name. I'm not afraid of any challenge or any math, but the fact that I cannot find many people talking about it is concerning... Is it a bad major? are jobs scarce/hard to find? high fail out rate? is the field super boring? it attracts my attention because I feel like it's the most adaptable BS for today's market, and the one where I get to tinker and make gadgets with the most. Thanks for taking the time to read.

TL;DR:
Is there anything wrong with Computer Engineering? How come I cant find people talking about it at all?

**UPDATE 1:**

After all your comments and my own research this is what I got...

I've been staying up till 3 am for a week researching the different disciplines, what classes are covered in each, their market outlook, the competitiveness involved, pay charts (by state, city, industry). I mean I've researched thoroughly and this is where I stand:

**-Option A**: Computer Engineering, the curriculum is very similar to EE but it doesn't go 6 classes in depth into electronics as EE would. It has about 70% Electrical, 30% Comp Science. The title this degree offers does allow me to use my previous IT experience as a System Administrator for an edge in the IT side of CE, where jobs like Software Engineer, Developer, Systems Engineer, come up. Finding Jobs that seek EE skillsets is possibe, but it will be difficult. Projected starting entry-level pay is around $60,000 increasing to $100,000 after aprox. 5-6 years in the field, then upwards of $140,000 for senior level experience. Things that stand out for me in this field are: robotics, software engineering, the ability to create gadgets like a wifi controlled lock, Air Conditioner, etc, and working in fields like Automation (not sure how well computer engineers fit here... (http://www.flodraulicgroup.com/clientuploads/Automation/Automation.jpg).

**-Option B:** Electrical Engineering, it only has a couple or 4 courses at the most relating to computers, the rest is your standard electrical. Realistically, I won't be able to related to my IT experience as closely as computer engineering, but EE is solid on it's own and I would be able to obtain a job. Starting salaries are around $55,000 increasing to around $75,000 with a few of experience in the field. Must obtain a PE (professional engineer) to be able to advance further apparently, but not sure. It seems to be the backbone to the many disciplines that are out there, which makes it a solid option if you want to branch out, but I feel like I can't correlate IT with EE as fluidly as I can with CE.

**-Option C:** Mechanical Engineering, seems to be hands on. Creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving. Seems fun and engaging, wide variety of jobs and will always be in demand (good stability). About the same salary as EE. I like it and I'm interested, but don't know if it's the right one for me. This would put me back at square zero with a new career. Things that interest me: building airplanes or flying machines (hover craft, etc), automation, cars/engines, bionics.

**Bottom line** is that I'm really interested in R/D (research and development), but I want something that is a solid stepping stone to achieve what I want, which is to create something innovative that could help millions, make life easier, make life funner, something revolutionary. I like working with my hands and seeing things come to creation, I like fixing things, I love coming up with creative ways to solve problem in the most efficient way possible.

93,How to incorporate non-negativity in Interior Point Method?,1487812252,"Hi All, 

Hope you are well. 
I am trying to solve an optimization problem (quadratic) with the interior point method where I have 4 variables, and box constraints (2 of them force variables x1 and x2 to be non-positive (-x1 &amp; -x2  should be non-negative), the others are free between their lower and upper limits.  Does anybody have a clue how would this be implemented? 

To incorporate non-negativity I have to use the barrier method, which would require me to rewrite the KKT conditions (For the derivation without constraints, see Reference [1]).   I tried to do so, but no convergence (and sometimes still constraint violation). 

For the linear case I found a book that suggest a method for box constraints (Linear programming, Foundations &amp; extensions: link:    ), though I can't put it in practice as of yet. 

---------------

Reference [1]: see equation~5 of this reference: http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008677427361. Here they do not incorporate the possible non-negativity of some variables of x in the derivative of the Lagrangian w.r.t. x) 

--------------
THE PROBLEM: The problem is quadratic. 4 variables and 4 box constraints (i.e. 8 in total). I have to solve this problem in a real time implementation (i.e. as fast as possible). A,B,C will will be provided by the top level logic (varying with time). w1-w6 as well (though they will only be positive values). 

min J = J1 + J2 + J3 + J4 where

J1 = w1 (A-x1 -x2)^2 

J2 = w2 (B - x3 - x4)^2

J3 = w3 (C - [dx1 - dx2 + ex3 -fx4])^2

J4 = w4x1^2 + w4x2^2 + w5x3^2 + w6x4^2

Also curious about the foundation of the emergency overflow section. Based on some of the photos it looks like rock may be relatively shallow and the concrete could be/should be founded on rock. - Heard on good authority that the emergency spillway is founded on 'decent rock', but rock quality downstream is poor.

Thanks in advance - too much chatter coverage out there for me to find details!

The goal is to have a force displacement curve with a very high slope initially (aka, infinite stiffness) and then a very sudden change to flat (zero stiffness). Essentially I want very little movement until a certain force is applied, at which point there is a lot of movement. The reason behind it is to have a paddle for a steering wheel shifting system that will not actuate until a significant force is applied.

The idea for using rubber came from old pencil grips that would exibit the same behavior.

I'm using Euler's buckling equation to try and predict the buckling force of a rectangular piece of rubber. I've settled on silicone (but can be persuaded otherwise) as the rubber, but now it comes down to hardness and prediction of Young's modulus. Does anyone have experience with rubber to help with any advice? How does rubber hardness affect stiffness and rebound?

34,Would taking the FE Exam be beneficial to me?,1487712109,"I just graduated in December from the University of Michigan with a degree in electrical engineering, and am currently in the process of job searching. Academically, I admittedly did not do as well as I had hoped to, and I have a very low GPA of 2.4, which is why I'm asking about the FE exam. I don't look great on paper but I know that I'm not an idiot and could have done a lot better. I believe it was the combination of being extremely unmotivated and depressed throughout college, and not networking effectively (and therefore having to do everything by myself - homework, studying for exams, lab writeups, etc) that led to my poor academic performance

I don't know if the situation is different at other schools, but I personally do not know any Michigan graduates who took or are planning to take this exam. This is part of the reason why I'm hesitant. Is it not a widely recognized certification? A lot of my peers hadn't even heard of it. I think most people don't feel that it's necessary, if they have other outstanding credentials. From my research, the result of passing the exam is obtaining an ""EIT certification"", which of course is something I can add to my resume. 

I was thinking that for someone in my particular situation, this may be helpful. It could show that I actually learned something in college, and draw some attention away from my GPA. It could be part of a story to employers - like hey, I screwed up big-time here, but as you can see, I pulled my shit together and I'm not totally incompetent.

On the secondary, X1 and X3 are tied together, and X2 and X4 are tied together.  There is a ground wire that is attached to the frame of the transformer, but doesn't attach to any of the legs coming off of the transformer.  

One wire is treated as a ""hot"", and another is treated as a neutral.  In the 120 volt panel this transformer is powering, there are only circuit breakers on the ""hot"" wires and all the neutral wires go to a distribution bar.  

I don't think this is right- coming off of the transformer, aren't both wires technically ""hot""?  If one of them isn't connected to ground, then shouldn't there be dual pole circuit breakers on everything?  If we are going to connect one of them to ground, does it matter which one?

Theoretically, I am a bit confused.  If the two wires coming off of the transformer are at different ""floating"" electric potentials (120 volts), shouldn't ""ground"" be at a third electrical potential?  So if I connect one of these wires to grounds, how are they still 120 volts apart?

I have a project that needs to use at least one of these sources of renewable energy.

The catch is that we will only have 3 hours once a week with the ""set-up"" to do with whatever we want. Well, on the first week I would really like to gather all the data from these three energy sources so we can begin the design process right way. 

We can only use normal everyday items to do this, as the professors doesn't want the richest kid in class to win the competition because he uses his money to buy the normal items we'd use in real life.

Water: We know we need to fill up a bucket and calculate how long it takes to fill the bucket in a given time for flow rate.

I'm an amateur craft hobbyist. Typically I work on costume pieces for larps and cosplay conventions. I decided to try my hand at making a pair of wings, but I'm having trouble with the mechanism that makes them go up and down. The left side of the image shows the limb of the wing in its resting state. The right side shows how far up the wing needs to lift.

*Each limb is approximately 3.5 feet in length. I believe each limb weighs just under half a pound.

*The 'caps' on the opposite wall of the limbs are makeshift spools. They're one inch in length and 1.5 inches in diameter. I've wrapped several coils of twine around them.

*I believe the twine can hold 2 pounds of pressure, but I don't know that for certain.

*When I secure this unit to my back and pull directly down on one of the cords, the wing barely moves. I have to tug hard to make it go any distance, at which point the rope snaps.


**The question:**

What method can I apply to reduce the amount of force needed to lift the wings?


**The limitations:**

I've done a fair amount of research on google and youtube and haven't had a lot of success with answers to my current method. I have seen other viable means of creating retractable costume wings, but they are either too expensive (CO^2 cartridges), or are impractical for other purposes (attaching the lifting mechanism to one's arms such that lifting/lowering your arms operates the wings). I suspect that using some form of gear or pulley would do the trick, but I'm not certain how to properly apply them. For parts, I have access to my local home repair store, and I'm fairly handy with scrap plastic and/or metal. Please bear in mind that this will need to go on someone's back, so weight is also an issue.


Thanks for any advice. I'm interested in not only the solution, but the math behind it.",AskEngineers,the_write_ability,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5v94ke/engineering_costume_wings/

56,I'm writing a screenplay with an engineering student as its protagonist. Looking for advice to enhance the realism of the script.,1487638456,"Hi AskEngineers,

I'm writing an indie film script that opens with its protagonist, an immigrant from the Middle East, studying engineering at a technical college in the Midwest. Specifically, the character is an undergrad studying mechanical engineering and, as a central plot point, is paired up with a difficult older man (EDIT: a guy who's gone back to college to get an engineering degree) for a homework assignment.

I've never studied engineering, so I'm looking for advice in terms of making this aspect of the script feel believable.

My question breaks down into two parts:

1. What are some 2nd or 3rd year mechanical engineering classes that would be offered at such a college, bearing in mind that this isn't exactly an elite university?

2. Do any of you have suggestions for a type of homework assignment (i.e. lab project/experiment) for such a class that might be assigned to a pair of students? Something, ideally, that would require a few days to work on and could potentially lead to conflict if one of the two students is struggling with the material.

Any advice would be hugely helpful and if it makes it into the script, I'll be sure that you'll receive a special thanks should the film end up actually being produced.

72,Power Generation dropping Magnet through solenoid,1487599876,"[SOLVED]
I'm only a high school senior so I apologise for a lack of experience writing in engineering language. 
I don't conceder this undergraduate homework, but in case I'm breaking forum rules let me know.

I'm investigating the efficiency of the [AMPY portable self changing motion charger](http://www.getampy.com).
The device contains two solenoids hooked up in parallel, both containing a magnet that moves up and down the solenoid when the device is shook. Now I hooked one of these solenoids up to a data logger, dropped the magnet through the solenoid and got a weird graph. [Screenshot of graph](http://imgur.com/UTMEzoz)
It would make sense if there are two peaks to the voltage/current/power graph, one when the magnet approaches the solenoid, and then one peak as it generates the voltage in the alternate direction in order to keep it from leaving (Lenz Law).
The graph however contains another small peak after the two main peaks. I am sure that there is some phenomenon that can explain this type of ""recoil"".
Could you point me in the right direction?

Thanks 

**Edit:**

To clarify: I am very familiar with the basic concept of EM induction. As the magnet approaches the solenoid, it will generate an opposing force for conservation of energy to be true. The same happens in the opposite direction when the magnet leaves. I am wondering about that last maxima. I can't explain its existence with my knowledge, but I am pretty sure there might be some EM phenomenon out there that explains this.

**Edit 2.0 (more thoughts from comments):**

I talked to a friend of mine and we generated two theories for this (Neither of us are electrical engineers. We did this purely out of intuition. It might be total BS):

a. The first conclusion we came to is that the alternating current is setting something into oscillation (the change in the wire). We thought that maybe once the charge is set into motion like, say a pendulum, it will continue to oscillate until dampened to a halt. But the charge has insignificant/no mass so why would it oscillate?

b. We thought that it may have to do with the construction of the neodymium magnet. The magnet might have some weird pole configuration that causes this third oscillation. But from holding another magnet in proximity, it seems that it is a simple north south pole magnet. I will get my hands on a flux meter tomorrow to test the magnet strength and make sure I am correct.

**Edit 3.0 (The correct answer collected from comments)**

I unwrapped the tape covering the Solenoid. 
Turns out the single Solenoid I was testing consists of two smaller solenoids that are wired in series wrapped around the same core. [Pictures of unwrapped solenoid](https://imgur.com/gallery/3Vsxm).
This actually explains my data A LOT better than the other reasons that were mentioned.
As the magnet approaches, solenoid 1 will induce a voltage. Then the magnet will move out of solenoid 1 and the opposite voltage will be induced. At the same time as the magnet leaves solenoid 1, solenoid 2 wired in series will be approached. Now they have wired the solenoid so that both voltages induced at the same time will coincide. **This is why the second maximum is the greatest**. As the magnet moves away from solenoid 2 it will again induce the inverse voltage.
**I did an integration trace under the voltage graph and it turns out that the area is zero**, implying that the total voltage induced is equal for both, it just happens that one part of the ac voltages induced overlaps for one of the oscillations.

76,Biochemistry vs. Chemical/Mechanical Engineering,1487570617,"Hello,

I have been increasingly anxious about university and my future, more specifically the job I want.

So essentially the issue is whether I should get a degree in biochemistry or chemical/mechanical engineering. Biomedical engineering may be out of the question since I have heard job prospects are bad.

I am very interested in how scientists are developing pharmaceuticals to combat cancer and the like and I am also very interested in genomic research. This led me to believe that I would should get a PhD and become a scientist for a biotech company, but it is time consuming, competitive, and insecure (from a job prospect standpoint).

On the other hand, I am also interested in the engineering side of science. Finding ways to apply what is found in research to actual people is great and problem solving and math has been something I have been pretty good at. I guess the only problem with this route is that it is a much challenging course load compared to the former options and I will not be focused on biological research and courses which is one of my passions.

In an ideal world, I would be both -- I would find new biological discoveries and find ways to apply such discoveries to patients as an engineer. But I think we all know that the world has never been such an ideal place. I know for sure that I want to work somehow in R&amp;D (biology), I want to be employed/employable, and I want work that is interesting.

The university I am attending has a pretty good biochemistry program with research that I like, however, I have seen that there are a lot of internship opportunities for chemical engineer students, as well (Tesla factory being built and Capstone Project with some biotech companies).

Would anyone be able to give me some insight as to how I can tackle this problem? Would it be difficult to become and engineer and do biology research during university or vice versa?

81,What is the best weigh to reduce the weight of a load bearing block without sacrificing structural integrity? (Details inside!),1487548411,"Tl;Dr I have a weightlifting apparatus made of wood.  I would like to drill holes in it to make it lighter.  Want to know most efficient way to do this without compromising structural integrity.

My gym has what are known as “jerk blocks”.  These are a stackable set of blocks which sort of function like a squat rack.  They consist of several modular lower blocks (used to adjust the overall height), and a strong upper block which is topped with rubber (used to absorb the impact of a dropped barbell).  This allows you to do a variety of overhead movements without having to pick the bar up from the ground every time.  Here is a link to help visualize the blocks and how they are built. http://www.catalystathletics.com/article/52/Jerk-Block-Building-Tutorial/  Also here’s a video of some random dude doing a jerk from a set of blocks.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CmtdAfTKiU

Ok, so the problem with jerk blocks is that they are VERY heavy, but this is because they need to be VERY durable.  A single lifting session may involve dozens of repetitions where the bar is dropped from a height of 3-4’ or more above the platform, and with weights exceeding 400 lbs.  Regardless, it makes it very difficult for smaller (and even mid-sized) athletes to use the blocks because they are so difficult to move and take apart (even the individual sections are very heavy on their own). 

Since building these, I’ve envisioned drilling a bunch of large holes (2”?) into the exterior walls of the modular blocks to reduce their weight.  My question is; WHAT IS THE MOST STRUCTURALLY SOUND WAY TO DO THIS?  Is there a certain pattern of drilling I could follow to preserve the ability of the wood to bear a vertical force?  You’ll notice there are several central supports which I was going to leave intact (since they’d be hard to reach), so I’m thinking I can drill out quite a bit of the exterior walls.

I know this is a really weird question and I’m sorry I don’t know a better way to ask it.  Let me know if I should ask this somewhere else?  Thanks r/AskEngineers!

90,Bearing arrangement for a shaft with access from one side.,1487526592,"I'm currently designing a shaft that mounts a propeller however I have encountered some issues in its design due to the mounting point for the propeller being so large. This effectively prevents you from assembling bearings from this end.

[Here is an image the current arrangement of bearings and gear on the shaft.](http://imgur.com/a/daGcz)

Now normally this type of stepped shaft would be fine however, due to the axial loads generated by the helix of the gear and the thrust from the propeller the shaft requires tapered needle bearings. Whenever these are used you require a pair assembled back to back (or face to face) as [shown in this image](http://www.skf.com/binary/143-3527/0008f05_tcm_12-3527.gif) meaning you require your bearings to be resting against two shoulders, one on each side of the shaft. It would be impossible to do this due to the mounting point. 

So, how would you resolve this issue? would you try to find a new arrangement or is there a way of installing a shoulder onto the shaft after the bearing goes on?

95,How to Calculate Drag Load of Sticker on Fast Moving Vehicle,1487496630,"Hi Great Engineers,

Need you help. I am required to calculate drag load on sticker to ensure it is not peeling off in operation. The vehicle may moves as fast as 220 km/hr with rectangular sticker size of 30 cm x 40 cm, thickness 0.0635 mm on its body. Wind direction is parallel to 40 cm length and perpendicular to 30 cm sticker length.

My first though is using (1/2)*row*A*V^2*Cd basic formula to get the drag load for each value :

A = 30 cm * 0.0635 mm ... (unit conversion will be done in actual calc.)                                                                                          

V^2 = 200^2 km/hr .... (unit conversion will be done in actual calc.)                                                                                              

Row = density of the air at that altitude                                                                                                                                               

Cd = not sure about the valid strong value for reference, but i will use the Cd for rectangular shape which have been establish in few reference to NASA docs. May change if I found another publication that I feel confidence.

Does this method acceptable?

Is there is another factor that I need to take into consideration? Please do highlight.

My purpose is not to get accurate answer on the drag load, but being conservative is good already. Our main objective is just to ensure it wont peeled of during operation. So accurate value of drag load is not necessary.
If required to install any test set to gain some value on vehicle is also impossible as we have no access to it and may cost money for operation.

Anyone have any idea on something or some material I could use as an insulator to insulate the outside of the steel box (or inside) so that it doesn't drip all over the place? Initially some thick EPDM comes to mind, but even thick EPDM may not allow for that much insulation when glued onto the outside or inside of the box. Cost is definitely a concern here.

10,Application Test - Milk Ultrasound,1487374060,"Hi All,
I recently applied for a position as a mechanical design engineer. I got this email this morning asking for an approach to the issue. Its not the easiest to understand but any advice would be helpful.

Dear Applicant,

As part of the selection process, I’d like you to complete the following short challenge by the end of the weekend if possible. Let me know if you need more time.

Milk ultrasound measurement chamber

I have attached an image of a milk ultrasound measurement chamber taken from a commercially available bench-top analyser. The analyser works by bringing the milk to a temperature of 41°C, measuring the acoustic velocity, and repeating at 65°C.

The key design attributes of the chamber are: 
· Thin brass wall for high thermal conductivity (faster temperature stabilisation, 0.3mm) 
· Small internal diameter for fast heat-transfer to the milk, but wide enough to allow acoustic transfer (4mm) 
· Long enough to allow the measurement of velocity (approximately 50mm) · Inlet and outlet ports flush with the transducer face at either end of the chamber (no corners easily soiled) 
· Milk-contact transducer face made from polysulfone (suitable for on-farm)

Also of note: 
· Inlet and outlet ports soldered to the main body 
· Solder used to support the transducer assembly 
· Heater wire wound around the chamber

This technology is unsuitable for permanent on-farm installation because the brass material will not resist the wash chemicals on farm. The device must tolerate acid and alkaline conditions at high temperatures. To translate the technology to on-line on-farm, we need to use stainless steel instead of brass.

Your task Write about 400 words describing how you would approach this problem, maintaining the first five key design attributes above but with stainless steel as the material. What are the key challenges to overcome? What extra information do you need? How could you find this out? Why would you use this approach? You may provide sketches to support your discussion.

Although 400 words is short this is a tough challenge in terms of the content, which may be quite foreign to you. I’m keen to see your thought process so please don’t stress and just give it an honest attempt.

Best Regards

I am designing a system that will involve a pump, bladder tank, and then a final distribution station where people can get drinking water from.

I am using a bladder tank so that the pump does not have to be cycled on/off every single time a person wants to drink water. Therefore, the pump will pump water into the bladder tank, the bladder tank will discharge the water at some set pressure range (say 60 psi to 40 psi), and then the pump will turn back on to refill the bladder tank. My question is, do you think this pump is oversized for the demand? If so, are there any issues with this besides it not being cost effective?

26,Optimization (gradient?) with indefinite hessian,1487309823,"Hi All! 

I am working on an optimization problem that can unfortunately become non-convex (hessian with an eigenvalue that can become 0 or negative). I tried to implement an interiot point method for non-convex problems (LOQO) but I did not succeed. 

My current hope is gradient descent (Projected gradient descent because of inequality constraints): initialize it multiple times and use the minimum value. One thing that remains unclear to me is how the projection is actually performed to remain in the feasible region. [Reference 1] speaks about using only active constraints, are those constraints that are (close to) being violated? 

There is also the assumption about the cost function being convex. I see this throughout literature. Can this method still be used on non-convex functions where each variable is bounded (i.e. box constraint: properly bounded)?

[Reference 1 :http://www2.esm.vt.edu/~zgurdal/COURSES/4084/4084-Docs/LECTURES/GradProj.pdf]

EDIT: 
The problem is quadratic. 4 variables and 4 box constraints (i.e. 8 in total). I have to solve this problem in a real time implementation (i.e. as fast as possible). A,B,C will will be provided by the top level logic. w1-w6 as well (though they will only be positive values). 

min   J = J1 + J2 + J3 + J4 
where

J1 = w1 (A-x1 -x2)^2 

J2 = w2 (B - x3 - x4)^2

J3 = w3 (C - [d*x1 - d*x2 + e*x3 -f*x4])^2

J4 = w4*x1^2 + w4*x2^2 + w5*x3^2 + w6*x4^2

27,"Is it typical for medium-sized projects to form ""inner circles""?",1487309180,"I've noticed this at my place of work when working on projects that have 7 or more people on them.  The people form this little ""inner circle"", where all ideas and decisions are supposed to come from.  Then there's this ""outer circle"" of collaborators, who are occasionally asked to investigate certain issues, or do certain engineering designs.  

On some projects, I'm on the outer circle, and I get asked certain questions on issues that I specialize in.  

The part that really bothers me is how marginalized my contribution comes.  Basically, someone from the ""inner circle"" comes to me with the issue, and I end up offering a solution.  Or sometimes I find an issue on a project that is moderate, and I bring it up with the inner circle.  One member comes and confers with me.  Then that person regurgitates the solution to the other inner circle members, as if they came up with it themselves.  The rest of the inner circle members confer, come up with a decision, completely ignore me, never asking me again for additional clarification or support.  It's as if I never was really there to begin with.  A lot of the times, then end up doing the wrong thing, and the process repeats.

It's getting on my nerves, as it really marginalizes my contribution, and helps the career of the inner circle member who gets my help, not mine.  It also limits my ability to really contribute to the success of these projects.

Does this happen normally?  Is it a sign of a bad culture?

If you put a thick, high temperature oil in your engine when it's cold outside, the oil won't be able to reach all the nooks and crannies until the engine warms up, that's the general idea anyway.

63,High expansion dough,1487207889,"Hey guys, I'm working on a project in which I am using bread dough for certain materials purposes (not for food purposes, so the materials used can be inedible). I've been wondering if there's a way to make dough that could rise/expand by a lot, hopefully by a couple orders of magnitude (preferably a couple hundred times; if not, less would work).

I've been thinking about using super-absorbent polymers in the dough so that they expand by a lot, stretching the bread surrounding the bubbles formed by the yeast's co2 emissions. A disadvantage of this is that the dough would expand almost immediately upon mixing it together.

Alternatively, I could use some sort of compound that will expand the dough under heat, so I can trigger the expansion later; could glycerol work? It's non-toxic and seems to have a high volumetric expansion coefficient.

70,"Smallest, most leightweight, high frequency actuator?",1487178334,"Hello,

as mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/5tdu94/whats_the_best_way_to_make_small_objects/), I am currently working on a project where I will be needing very tiny actuators that make small (about ~3mm) back and forth linear movements. I have already gotten a lot of good suggestions, but because I phrased the question badly a lot of the ideas I have gotten unfortunately don't exactly fit the purpose. The best option I have found to this point were [these](http://www.technohands.co.jp/en/products/um-tula.html) tiny actuators that (if you scroll down a bit) have even been used to make a tactile braille display, but I feel it's still not ideal for my purpose. For one, the possible movement is way too big, it's enough if the actuator can ""wiggle"" 3mm instead of up to 15mm like the tula35 does. Also, the speed of 3-5mm per second is far from enough, 35mm per second like the tula 50 still isn't but that would be something you could work with (if you go up and down 3mm the display would be able to ""refresh"" ~6 times per second, which I'd like to be able to vary even more)

Does anyone here know what other actuators you could possibly use? I have also thought about vibration motors, but unfortunately you can't really control their movement, so you can't ""retract"" a pin when you're not using it unless you hold it in place with a magnet or something whenever the pin has to stay still or otherwise it would just be ""loose"".

72,Steam Condensate Meter Accuracy,1487172348,"I am trying to figure out exactly how much steam we are using in an aged historic building.  The steam service is metered at the condensate discharge via a [Lincoln Gravity Flow meter]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIw5VHhoE5s), and the drum gets replaced on an annual basis.  The condensate receiver is old and rusted out, and does not appear to be in good shape, and neither does the face dials which read out the total mass flow (in pounds) of the discharged condensate, so I wanted to check the accuracy of the steam meter independently.

Downstream from the meter assembly is a separate tank with a duplex discharge pump arrangement.  The tank has a simple float switch to activate the pumps on an alternating basis to eject the condensate and dump it to the sewer (after a quench).  I put a pair of dataloggers on the power supply to these pumps and measured runtime and concurrently took readings from the steam condensate meter.  I then combined the total runtime and the pump manufacturers’ data to get a total flow in gallons.  After converting the gallon flow rate from my pumps to pounds,  compared my pump flow to the meter readings.

I performed this exercise twice, under different building loads a few weeks apart over the winter.  The result was that the pump flow came in about 40% lower than the meter readings (~42% the first time, a 26-hour period; ~43% the second time, a 10-hour period).  This is concerning to me, as the meter is what we pay our utility bills off of and it seems like we are being significantly overcharged.  When I brought it to the utility company’s attention, they argued that since we don’t really know what the pump flow rate is the results are invalid.  The pumps are original, and have not been changed out since installation.  I also double-checked with the manufacturer to confirm the flow rate based off of model and serial numbers.  

Am I missing something?  I can’t think of a mechanism by which my readings would be off, and I believe the utility when they say that the drum is accurately calibrated (or should I?).  The only other thing I can think of is that the meter interface with the drum is off – as in one revolution of the drum is calibrated to # pounds of condensate, but that is translating incorrectly to the face dials somehow.

  I'm looking to design my own drone and I believe this falls within the realms of aeronautic engineering.  If this isn't the best place to post this inquiry, recommendations on where i should go would be appreciated. 

One concern I have is the minimum spacing between multiple propellers before the wingtip vortices start impacting performance.  I see many people speculate on this distance but no math to back it up.  I would assume that there is a ratio for this distance and it to be based on the length of propeller and possibly the RPM and tip design?

My other concern is that I'm planing to build a quad copter in a ""tilt rotor"" configuration.  So given that all propellers may be on the same plane, after so many degrees of tilt, the prop wash of the front propellers will affect the performance of the rear propellers.  Is it safe to assume that if ""lines"" are drawn 90° down from the tips of the propellers, taking the motion of the drone through the air out of the equation, that at a given tilt angle, if these lines were to intersect, that prop wash would occur?  If so, I would assume that prop wash could be avoided by either spacing the front and rear propellers further apart, or having the rear propellers on a different plane, as well as a mixture of the two?

For the most part it seems to me that these calculations should be made by testing for them, but given my lack of knowledge on the subject, I'm unsure if there are principles already where the calculations can be done by math alone.",AskEngineers,MagicsMan,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5u6zgh/prop_wash_and_spacing/

77,Going to my first job interview- With an expired license! Please help!,1487149925,"I'm in a pretty crappy situation here. I just turned 21 about 3 weeks ago, and my license expire dp on my birthday.

This is relevant because I made it to the final round of interviews for an incredible position working as a process engineer, which is to take place at there chemical factory about 3 hours from my apartment.   On a recent application one of the questions asked if I had a valid license, and I had to check the box that said no (I probably could have just lied and said yes, but that would have made me feel very uncomfortable). Would this immediately disqualify me from getting the position, seeing as ill have to break the law to drive to the plant?

I talked to my parents (both lawyers) and they agreed the risk is worth it. However, breaking the law is a bad look for anyone and so I guess my question is should I even go?  If you were in their shoes would you even consider me for the position?  I will almost certainly have a license by the time the coop starts in the summer (assuming I get the job).

Some background as to why I couldn't renew my license:

I go to college out of state, and so renewing my license involves proving my residency in two forms. After multiple trips to the DMV and lots of research online I have come to the conclusion that is is impossible for me to renew my license before spring break as I cannot provide two proofs of residency until I go to my home state, where I will renew my license in my permanent adress. The whole process has been completely demoralizing. I get that this is my own fault, and I get that it won't look good. Should I even bother pursuing the position further?  They already booked me a hotel room and the interview is in two days.   I really need some advice. Please help me out!!


UPDATE
Thanks everyone for the advice. I actually made it down to the DMV again today and even though I technically didn't have the government required proofs, they gave me a new license. I was in shock, I guess if your persistent enough eventually you'll find a weak link. It's a good thing I'm not a terrorist.

11,Why are equatorial launches done mostly in Cape Canaveral?,1487006697,"I understand that launching near the equator is beneficial for launches for equatorial orbits since the rocket gets a boost in velocity due to the rotation of the Earth (and the higher linear velocity near the equator). I also understand that launching on the East Coast is beneficial since the rocket travels over the Atlantic Ocean upon launch, rather than over the continental United States. I am unaware of any other factors ivolved that lead them to launch in Florida.

With that being said, why do aerospace companies, like SpaceX and ULA, always choose to launch from Florida? I would assume that leasing a launch pad from the government is probably pretty expensive, and there are plenty of other locations where they could launch from that are even closer to the equator. On top of that, it doesn't make sense to me why they wouldn't just launch from a ship or barge, like what the company Sea Launch does.

I am just hoping for a good overall summary of all of the factors involved that lead these companies to choose to conduct most of their launches in Cape Canveral. And why wouldn't they want to launch from other locations, such as Hawaii (which I believe is closer to the equator than Cape Canveral, and is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean)?",AskEngineers,nickkud,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5tu5rs/why_are_equatorial_launches_done_mostly_in_cape/

me, weight of craft( &lt; 30 pounds), and all gear will displace ~ 90 liters and result in a water line ~ 1"" below pods; center/bridge platform will have navigator/fisherman 2"" higher.

some of the design considerations are:
minimize material waste(extruded polystyrene XPS) plan to purchase just (2) 8'x4'x2"" sheets. current dimensions fit this criteria.
would like it to track as straight as possible with consideration to how deep it protrudes into water; these pods are 9"" wide and 8"" tall, i modeled another pod with similar displacement 7.5"" wide and 10"" tall but wanted to gain back the extra 2"" of displacement plus i suspected the 8"" tall version might be more stable because the flatter angle?

in the image provided i want to understand what may produce the best resistance to tilting over. seems a flat bottom(?) would do this but what about within a catamaran type design? (i have read some discussion on the heel angle? can you suggest for me to read about certain concepts at play here?  i imagine when it is all done, there will be compromises with some of the concepts to meet the current design considerations.

i am open to all forms of critique you can offer.  part of why i kept the inboard angle vertical is to minimize waste and make cutting of the material easier; i assume it may want to track straighter as well?

although i have already created some fins, i think there is a chance i may be able to get by without adding any.  the design idea allows for the fins to pivot and swing up should they contact an obstacle; gaining an additional 4-5"" of clearance.

Question is is this inline fan too big/noisy? My plan is to use the fan controller to adjust the amount of power needed, will that work?

I plan on using one of these ~40x30cm hepa filters , and then making the carbon filter the size I need(should be adjustable pretty easily with pellets), this along with adjusting fan power should make for no problems no?

54,How do you decide the ratio of a transformer in a flyback converter?,1486876574,"Hi all,

I am trying to copy a reference design for a flyback converter for a USB charger. The problem I'm having is choosing a transformer for this circuit.

The design is in a Datasheet for a flyback controller, [it looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/QUTlKRh.png). The controller I want to use is the [TEA1731TS](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/TEA1731TS.pdf).

My understanding is that mains voltage (230 * sqrt(2)) gets rectified into ~325V DC, the DC is switched by the controller, and the signal is passed into a transformer.

If I wanted a 5V output, do I simply make the ratio 325 : 5 --&gt; 65 : 1, and let the controller handle the rest? What should the auxiliary winding of the transformer be? 

My (novice) thoughts are that:

* Z1 ultimately regulates the output voltage
* If Z1 has a zener voltage of 5V, then the output of the system will be 5V
* When it goes above 5V, current will flow through O1, and the IC will know that it is going over the limit, thus reducing the duty cycle of the DRIVER pin

Does this seem accurate? If it is, then how do you limit the current through the output?

94,Is raising the head of a bed with rectangular feet structurally sound?,1486706857,"I previously had a bed that had narrow feet, and I raised the head of the bed 5"" using these:

https://www.amazon.com/Slipstick-CB656-Incline-Risers-Protector/dp/B00APEZP2Y/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486706521&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=slipstick+riser

They would go under the feet of the head of the bed.

I now have a bed that has four rectangular feet. They are approximately 3"" by 1.5"" with the longer end going with the length of the bed. There are four feet.

They do not fit in the previous bed raisers I used. I have found wider raisers but they are sold in sets of four and designed to evenly raise the height of a piece of furniture. I am concerned that using these would put too much pressure on the bed as the bed would be ""on it toes"" for lack of a better term.

If you look at the THIRD thumbnailed picture on this site you can see what the foot looks like:

http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S59040240/

I have thought about whether I could create my own raisers that would be at an appropriate slant such that the entirety of the feet would be in contact with the raisers, but I am a bit unsure how I would go about this.

Thank you for any help you can provide.'

95,Is there a metric I can apply to determine how long a water heater is in use?,1486705211,"I'll be working a project this summer that requires the installation of temporary electrical water heaters in a few homes in a neighborhood. We are also just starting the process of metering and billing electric use. Since the electric draw from the water heaters is a project cost, I was hoping to use some standard metric to estimate its usage in hours.

I know I can find the draw rate on the water heater plate, but I need to know how long the heater runs to calculate the total electric use. Similar to water use per capita assumptions, is there a metric I can use to estimate water heater usage?

Edit: I was hoping to clarify my initial question based on the feedback I received in the first few comments. I was definitely looking in an overly complicated direction initially.

When I plug in an electric domestic hot water heater, can I estimate it's usage (kWh) based on typical hot water use per capita and some other metric based on the efficiency of the heater?

Some additional background:

I work for the DoD as a project manager. This summer, we have a project to upgrade the heat line to a neighborhood on a military installation which will take take down hot water to these homes for the duration of the project. We will supply hot water to these duplexes by way of domestic hot water heaters in each unit.

In previous projects where similar work was done, we didn't care about the electric usage of the water heaters because tenants were not billed for any utilities. At the exact same time as our project start, our housing vendor is kicking off an electric billing program. Since hot water is not a utility the residents are to be billed for, our housing vendor wants to estimate how much power the water heaters will use during a billing cycle and deduct that from the metered value.",AskEngineers,iluvbewbies,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5t5k8g/is_there_a_metric_i_can_apply_to_determine_how/

It's a universal motor hooked up to a turbine and it howls like a banshee, even when hooked up to an SCR dimmer and throttled WAY down, (it flows a lot of air, way more than I need to loft a pound of beans).

How do I make it damn near silent so I can hear the coffee roast?  Exhaust is routed outside, so I THINK most of the noise comes from the intake.  Intake has a 18"" section of 4"" PVC on it, which quieted it down some, but it's still loud.  Foam on inside and outside of PVC intake?  Tuned pipe branched off the intake?

I was hoping if someone here can elaborate or...really, dumb down the following from the website:

&gt;In case of a **transmitter** a voltage V is connected on the electrical contacts and the excited carriers are accelerated by the electric field during the optical pulse, which results in a short broadband electromagnetic pulse with a time-dependent electrical field E(t) and frequencies in the THz region.

&gt;In case of a **receiver** a current amplifier is connected on the electrical contacts. During the optical pulse the excited carriers are accelerated by the electric field component of the incident terahertz pulse with the time-dependent electrical field E(t). This leads to a measurable current signal in the outer circuit.

&gt; Imagine you are the head of the engineering team responsible for getting the Soviet copy of the Nene operational, you report directly to the Beloved, Fearless, Doston ka Dost, Dushmanon ka Dushman, Dear Leader Uncle Stalin— an experience no sane person looks forward to.
&gt;
&gt; These are the questions your team, meaning you, must answer:-
&gt; If a fitting is built with a clearance of 5mm from the surrounding components, why is it 5mm, why not 2mm? or 20mm? What is the rationale here?
&gt;
&gt;What is this hole for? Its not on any of the other engines. Manufacturing error? Something specific to this engine? Something missed on the other engines?
&gt;
&gt;Hmm, the guys at the lathe station tell me they cannot grind the axle to the tolerances we need for the primary compressor spool, lazy shirkers! Perhaps a few months in a holiday resort in Siberia will make them more enthusiastic.
&gt;
&gt;How did the Brits bend these feed pipes to such precision, every time we try it, the pipe cracks, or kinks, or both, it can’t be hot forged, the cross section would distort, it can’t be cold worked, its too brittle for that. How did you do it Mr. Cripps?
&gt;
&gt;We still can’t get the first stage compressor disk to spool up to XXXX rpm without cracking, we have replicated the British design to the micrometer and still the damn thing keeps flying apart, what kind of heat treatment did they apply during fabrication?

So I wanted to ask you experienced engineers : what is the answer like? what form does it take? Is it like a formula that academic literature can never hope to discover? Is it like a specific material ratio that works for no known reason? Is it like a design that is ridiculously complicated that no genius in their spare time could come up with? Or is it something so breathtakingly simple that is nevertheless so counter-inbuitive that no one could derive from public-domain engineering knowledge?

The problem is, I have never done any real engineering creation (unless you can count a few thousand lines of trivial code), but I have dabbled in research (masters in computational engineering).

[Here's my proposed equipment layout.](http://www.mmudforums.com/images/systemdiagram.png)

The intent is to have the pump boost the water main pressure when the first valve is open to the main and the second valve is open to the nozzle, for rinsing animals; to spray shampoo onto the dogs when the first valve is open to the tank and the second valve is open to the nozzle; to fill the tank when the first valve is open to the main and the second is open to the tank; and to mix shampoo (added manually via the top cover) after filling by having both valves open to the tank. 

I'd like to get about 60 PSI at ~5 GPM at the nozzle when boosting the water main pressure, if possible. We'll just say the main pressure is 40 PSI right now for comparison. High pressure or flow when pulling from the tank is not necessary. 

My original thought is that [this pump here](http://www.waterpumpsdirect.com/Simer-2825SS-Water-Pump/p5555.html) would do the trick. It has a stainless steel housing and plastic impeller so I don't think it would be harmed by any dog shampoos. The fact that the pump will be physically below the tank should keep it primed and there will be at most 3 feet of head between the pump and the level of nozzle in use. Any comments on this pump or suggestions of a different model (hopefully not too much more expensive) would be greatly appreciated.

33,Tool for propagating measurement uncertainty?,1486583725,"I've long believed that Excel is causing active damage (along with all the good it does) by making it really easy to set up complex scenarios with cascading formula, all of which assume perfect measurements and estimations.

I've long wanted to make a replacement tool that provides similar functionality, but that allows every number to be associated with an arbitrary probability distribution, where every result shoves in your face not a single number, but the probability range for that number.

To that end I just finished an experiment that allows one to sketch arbitrary probability distributions for two variables, enter an arbitrary formula, and see the results as a big ugly histogram. For those interested in playing with it, I've provided it for free (and ad-free) at: http://phrogz.net/JS/CombiningProbabilities.html In true engineering form, it does this not analytically, but using brute force hacks. :) The result validated my desire, showing me that uncertainty measurements can interact in very surprising ways, producing result distributions that I would not have expected.

My questions, then:

1) Does anyone know of an existing tool that already does this? (If something good already exists, I don't want to re-invent the wheel.) I've found plenty of information on propagating simple flat distributions (10.3±0.1 * 12.05±0.1), but nothing about complex or arbitrary distributions.

2) Do you find it reasonable to express uncertainty as arbitrary probability distribution across a value range, instead of simple, flat ± variance? If I believe in the accuracy and precision of my calipers, I'd like to assume that the probability of the result being exactly correct is higher than the probability of it varying by 0.1mm or so.",AskEngineers,Phrogz,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5sv25d/tool_for_propagating_measurement_uncertainty/
34,Air-cooled engine efficiency,1486581400,"I was having a conversation with a friend about some cars, and he told me about some very popular cars that we had here in Brazil, that were air-cooled. 

My question is, what is the difference between air and water in terms of heat transfer properties. Should we compare the heat transfer coefficient? If so, the water has a much higher one, and because of that the air could never reach the same efficiency, therefore, the water can make the system cooler than the air? 
Let's say that some engine need to work at 70º celsius, if both water and air get to that temperature, would air take longer?

49,Is image algebra the same in frequency domain than in image domain?,1486517779,"Hey there. I have some doubts regarding image algebra. First, as the title says, is adding (or subtracting) two images in frequency space the same as doing it in image space? By frequency space I mean Fourier domain. One particular example is, if I obtain the low-frequency components of an image, if I subtract that image with its original, do I get the high-frequency components? Or is that only true if I perform the subtraction in frequency space?
  
Second, I was having a discussion with a friend about addition between images. He says that addition of images is the same as the mean of the two images, which I think it's not correct. Well, mean involves a division that addition does not have. But, is he right? Is it the same (mean and addition) if we force normalization of the images along the process?

I got word from a company with a nice assignment for my internship, with the question if I'd also like to do my graduation there. In this case, the assignment could be split in analysing the problem/math (internship assignment) and actually building a complete simulation/model (graduation assignment).

I've asked around on the university, since it's not usual to do this. The biggest arguments I heard where that, since I'd be stuck on the same thing for a year, I would lose the flexibility to use both assignments to expand my skillset/resume. This could benefit me with getting my first job. Additionally, since I'd practically be a free workforce for the company (I will get some compensation), I would sell myself short in this regard.

On the other hand it's close-by, which financially helps out a lot, the company is nice and the assignment is interesting and lays in the area I want to graduate in.

I would appreciate some practical advise from you on this situation, since I don't have the life experience myself to see how this could end up. Thanks in advance, though!

74,Have a question about Electrodeionization (water treatment),1486458362,"Hello,
I have a question about CO2 levels in Reverse Osmosis and Electrodeionization (EDI) systems. Since CO2 is gas , in reverse osmosis , membranes does not reject CO. However, CO2 is unwanted in Electrodeionization systems. CO2 is usually lowered by  increasing pH by adding caustic. One of the systems we observed this results:

6.8 pH (high alkalinity in water present) - HCl Dosage  (6.2 pH) - 1.Pass Reverse Osmosis (5 pH) - NaOH Dosage (8.4 pH )- 2.Pass Reverse Osmosis -  EDI 

As seen above, the water entering the 2nd pass is increased to 8.4 from 5 with the caustic dosage. Based on our previous knowledge, we expect CO2 level to be 0, but here we have measured 13.25 mg / l CO2. We also measured the pH from 3 different devices to confirm the pH. We repeated the measurements 4 times, but each time we observed the same result. Then we unloaded the 1st Pass and renewed the water, and we tried the following;

6.8 pH (high alkalinity present in water) - 1.Pass Reverse Osmosis (6.1 pH)- NaOH Dosage (8.8 pH)-  2.Pass Reverse Osmosis - EDI 

When we turned off the acid dosage, we observed that the CO2 level dropped to 0. if bicarbonate is present in water, the dosage of Hydrochloric acid will emit CO2;
 2HCO3 + 2HCl = 2CO2 + 2H2O + Cl2 as can be seen from this equation . But is it not possible to get this CO2 out by raising of the pH level with caustic? Is there any effect of carbonic acid produced by CO2 gas in water?

WELL, oscilloscope' probes are on a Gate (hot) and on an Emitter (GND crocodile) of the IGBT valve (power stage of a welding inverter). Oscilloscope' input is OPEN (I mean 'DC sensitive'). Sorry for possible term's mismatch for I'm not an English native.

So, I've been suggested with two mutually exclusive (as I suspect) ways to interpret the oscilloscope's picture:
1. You should read the pulse height (G-E voltage) from ZERO LINE to pulse' peak.
2. You should read the pulse height (G-E voltage) from PULSE' BOTTOM (foot) up to pulse' peak (i.e. the full swing).

Which one is right? What I mean to ask - what voltage they are talking about in data sheet docs when they put as follows: 'Absolute Maximum Rating of G-E voltage is 30V""?

77,Loading conditions on a discrete spine model (multibody-ish),1486439205,"I've been producing a 3D spine model for use in scoliosis, treating the spine as 17 discrete blocks joined by spherical joints (fixed translation, 3 DOF rotation).  I was initially using bushing joints (6 DOF movement) but found a study from established authors who used spherical joints instead.  Shear stiffnesses are quite high so neglecting them is probably appropriate, while losing the Y-axis shouldn't be a problem.

I've also switched from multibody to a matrix analysis (simply solving the equation [stiffnesses]^-1*[loads]=[rotations] now) because I realized the dynamics are unhelpful and computationally-intensive (it now solves in 3 ms!)

This change produced a problem: the loads have to be in the form of just moments now instead of linear forces and moments.

I think I need to produce a shear force diagram and then a bending moment diagram but how do I generate my 17 element external moment matrix out of it?

2. I know that mechatronics is a mix of electrical, mechanical and software, but how many electrical engineering topics would you cover in the program?
3. If you get a degree in mechatronics engineering, would you be able to apply for a broader range of jobs than someone with just degrees in say mechanical, electrical, etc?

In simple terms, I need to reduce the humidity of the air coming out of one machine before in going into another. The humidity does not have to be reduced massively, only down to around 60%. A design we have used before is simply a box which the warm air coming from the first machine is pushed through (around baffle plates) using a fan on the inlet (first change I am looking at machine is putting the fan on the outlet to pull the air rather than push?) whilst another fan pulls atmospheric air through pipes running through the box. This has the simple effect of the warm air coming out of the machine condensing against the cold pipes. However, I am worried this will not work as well in hotter countries due to the air in the pipes not being significantly colder than the machine outlet - or is this not true? Does the temperature of this air depend of the speed at which is is pulled through the pipes and the original atmospheric temperature not massively effect it? This would be a simple fix or just speeding up the fans if correct. Alternatively, I use a refrigerant unit to cool the pipes to ensure they are below the machine outlet temperature allowing it to condense. So back to the original question.. Does this have the same affect as heating up the machine outlet further so the atmospheric air is below that?

I've been messing around with a program which simulates the results of light reflected on echelle gratings but I'm struggling to make sense of the results I'm getting. Unfortunately my understanding of this topic isn't spectacular but I'm attempting to teach myself.

The graph is a result of a simulation of wavelength input 1.26μm over a 0.08μm range but I'm not sure I understand what the graph signifies as the reflected light reaches the output waveguides. There seems to be a lot of noise but no variation over the wavelength spread resulting in pretty clear peaks. There are 20 output waveguides, does each peak correspond to an individual waveguide or is each peak a result of the overall output from the waveguides over said wavelength..?

I'm sure this is basic stuff in terms of spectral analysis so any help to point me in the right direction would be appreciated.

Problem is the watt meter won't read above a few watts when I turn the generator shaft with a power drill. Does there need to be a high load on the other end to pull the 300W? Will the generator only give what is being demanded? If I hook up a 12V cordless drill motor as the load it only shows a few watts in the meter. What can I do to get 300W showing on the watt meter? My guess is hookup 300W worth of load and get the generator up to 400 rpm, would this be right? Also there is no battery, charge controller or DC/AC inverter inline. Just generator to rectifier to inline watt meter. Any suggestions would be appreciated for testing the generator.

I worked for a company designing automated test stands for top-tier aviation and auto OEMs, but my company went bankrupt at the beginning of the year. I didn't do any PLC, EE or software stuff, but I contributed to the physical control system design.

After having exposure to the industry, I'm set on becoming a controls engineer. I am practicing my Matlab, PLC and C skills at night. It's coming along slowly, but I am learning and it's sticking. I have some projects in the works to demonstrate, but they take time and money to get working.

I'm having a real hard time finding a job and I'm starting to become frustrated. For the 6 weeks I've been applying, I've sent out about 75 (quality) applications and following up too, but I am hearing little back. Many are for mechanical design positions at industrial automation companies.

On the other hand, I have specialized in materials science and metallurgy. I know with confidence that people in my network would want me to become a QA engineer at their metal fabrication plants. I could have a job pretty easily there, but I'm afriad that it might push me away from my long term goal of controls. I've done a project at school working with a steel mill and I really didn't enjoy it.

I'm really torn right now. I know long term I really do want to be in controls, but I know I am currently outmatched by EEs that graduate with significant project/co-op experience. Should I hold strong and keep applying to entry level controls jobs and network with anybody I can find in the industry, even if it might take a bit longer?

I am embarking on my next project for work, which consists of me putting another product through UL. Specifically UL 60950-1. The product is already designed this time, but I must ""tweak"" it so that it meats this UL spec. I've had the spec for two days, and so far it seems a bit rougher than the last spec. I think the biggest problem so far is this: This spec is meant for a broad range of IT products, so there is a lot of information that does not apply to my product. But I must dig through it to find the parts that do apply, and evaluate the design accordingly. So I guess what I'm asking is this:

How would you go about reading/extracting the relevant design constraints off a 550+ page UL spec such as this?

Hello everyone, I've posted here before asking about something similar. I'm currently unable to work due to some health issues, and I have a lot of free time right now. I've always loved tinkering and building things. I took some entry level engineering courses before I had to leave school, and always did well in math and science courses. Over the years I've taught myself 3d graphics, programming, and digital(some analog) electronics. However, I most enjoy working with my hands building things, and I want to try to build a linear motor capable of producing around 120-130N of linear force, that can travel about 8"" from point A to B, then back to point A around 11 times per second, essentially mimicking the output of a scotch yoke or similar rotational to linear motion mechanism, and I don't see it needing fine position control or accuracy.

I was looking at tubular linear motors, but beyond some papers, small homemade ones, or ones for sale I didn't find much. I'm also severely lacking where knowledge of magnets and electromagnets are concerned. This isn't anything important or too serious, more boredom and curiosity.

So my questions are
1)Can anyone recommend some free online material for taking notes and learning about magnetism and electromagnets?

I'm painting a surfboard for a friend. The board has been shaped but is unsealed so is in a bare-foam state. I would like to get a nice desaturated colour effect on the paint i've already put down by using a thin layer of shellac. My shellac is dissolved in some sort of alcohol (ethanol?) and I'm wondering if this will mess with the polyurethane. Will the ethanol act as a solvent and start dissolving the board?

73,I want to calculate the effect of a force on the spine. I intend to do a static modeling of the system with rigid bodies for vertebrae joined by 6-DOF linear springs for intervertebral discs. How do I do this?,1486069564,"I'm trying to simulate a scoliosis brace.  I've been working with dynamic multibody software but I've discovered that it's too computationally intensive to get a steady-state in a reasonable amount of time.  I'm only including the vertebrae and the intervertebral discs.

I realized that it's basically a super-simplified FEA problem that can be described as [K][U]=[F] and the matrix inversion would be fast enough as I only have 108 DOF.  I tried a random 108x108 K matrix and solved for U in MATLAB and it took less than 100 microseconds.  This also allows me to optimize my external forces better than with multibody.

So I was thinking of using MATLAB but I'm not sure how to generate my matrices.  I'm applying three external forces/moments.

I don't know the weight on each vertebra or the natural length of the intervertebral discs; instead I know the length of the intervertebral disc under that load.  For a linear spring (the assumption I'm making) in a force-based calculation (as opposed to energy methods) I think that cancels out.

I have the geometry in a MATLAB-readable file.  The most important things are the locations of the centres of the intervertebral discs, top and bottom, the thickness of the intervertebral discs, and the slopes of the vertebral end plates (this is what I'm measuring).

How do I generate the K, U and F matrices?

Examples online are super-simplified (the most complex I found used an arbitrary number of 1-DOF springs with point masses) and even the simple ones are rare.

Or is making the matrices from scratch the wrong way to go and there's software that'll make my life easy?

I feel this question is incomplete but I don't know what to add.  Please feel free to ask for clarification.  I really appreciate your help.

Thanks

This design was commissioned to be stowable (can be taken apart), made of steel, easy to transport, have a variety of heights to select from, and be simple to assemble and use. 

Unfortunately, the base of the frame bowed from the welds, and now the frame rocks when placed on a flat surface. The base was designed to have three feet (one on each end and one in the middle), but the fabricator made a modification to the design that makes the feet option not as simple to install.

As you can see the frame has now been galvanized to protect against corrosion. Is there any way to modify the base to be either flat or even slightly convex (as seen from above) without damaging the galvanization or weakening the structure?

edit: Thank you for all the suggestions. Extra question: How can we prevent this issue in the future? The base was welded in a jig to try to prevent the flex, but it didn't seem to be adequate.

I am a senior in high school currently, starting my second semester. My favorite classes are the ones that involve math: Pre-Calc, AP Calculus, Chemisty, Physics. 

Up until recently, I thought that a place in the medical field was for me; I've loved the idea of helping others, but what really interested me was the idea of being given the clues (symptoms) and having to diagnose the patient and discover the best plan of treatment for that person. One thing that saddened me about the medical field was the lack of hard math problems and equations.

I never really considered engineering because the whole concept confuses me....what would I be doing on a daily basis?? Once I started considering it more and more, I did some peeping around I have found out that this varies day-to-day, job-to-job. I know VERY little about engineering so anything helps, and these questions may make you cringe, idk. 

There are 3 things that I would like more info about:
1) Designing: I am not creative. How am I supposed to draw and design things?!? What exactly do you all mean by ""I design all day""? 
2) I like research, how often does an engineer get to research, if at all??  
3) I am stuck in the mindset that engineering is extremely hard and that I wouldn't be good at it, I feel like I would be incapable of designing or planning or testing, etc. Is it hard to be a successful engineer?

I initially locked the thread, which had &lt; 50 upvotes at the time (if memory serves), because I felt there were more appropriate subreddits like /r/darknetplan and /r/AskNetsec, and because the post had attracted a large number of low-effort comments. I admit to only casually reading the OP before making the decision to lock down the post.

I sincerely apologize... both as a moderator and as a person. The decision to lock the thread was made solely on my own without consulting the rest of the mod team, and without looking for additional info that would have prevented me from making this poor decision. I unlocked thread less than 30 mins later, after some users stepped forward and appealed my decision over modmail.

I started moderating this sub over two years ago. I had just been through a stressful and emotionally draining job search, and set out to make AskEngineers a forum where people like me could get the help they needed — both with technical questions, and with how to navigate their professional careers as I did (and still do). And although I have to enforce the rules and often do so unilaterally, I consider myself a just another user like the rest of you, simply with some extra responsibilities. Unfortunately it's easy for me to forget over time why I started doing this in the first place, and the backlash I received after locking that thread is a reminder that the purpose of AskEngineers is to help people. I'll try harder not to forget that.

The truth is that this place is nothing without you, the community. That's why I want to point out one final thing: out of the 50+ comment downvotes I received for my bad moderator actions, only three people stepped forward to say something. Everyone here should thank /u/ld43233, /u/my_recycle_away, and /u/Zagaroth for caring enough to call me out on my shit.

This is why I always tell you guys to message us if you ever have any concerns. One thing I've *always* wanted more of from this community since I started doing this is more feedback on how we're doing, and how we can improve AskEngineers.

I will never, ever ban, mute, or otherwise take action against any of you for speaking out against moderator decisions... because as I've shown, we're only human and we will make mistakes, and I'm counting on all of you to tell us when we've fucked up.

That's all. Carry on, and as always, please [**message us**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers) if you have any concerns, or simply leave a comment below.

23,[Challenge] Methods and Discourse on Producing a Gemstone Billet,1485928366,"Hello Reddit. 

Backstory: 
First, I realize I'm a crazy person. Second, I've never let that fact stop me before. I do R&amp;D for an Electric Motor Repair Corp. I have a background of Organic and Physical Chemistry, as well as Embedded Electronics and anything comp-sci. I have many means and resources available to me thanks to my employer; what I'm looking for is your *collective expertise.*

My future ex-wife (just kidding, D, if you're reading this...) fancies Diamonds. I could care less about any gemstone, aside from their physical/mechanical properties. (Read as: It don't matter if it looks purty, what does it *do?*) I know about the DeBeers family history, and their manufactured-value to their specific carbon configuration. What a joke. But, she likes sparkly things, and I sure like making things.

So, I'm looking for practical advice/brainstorming/suggestions/tips/guidance/sagely-experience regarding the home-manufacture of gemstones relating to the following:

* [Verneuil Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verneuil_process)
* [Czochralski Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czochralski_process)
* [Microwave-Plasma Fusion Process (It's a cheesy Instructable, but the physics are there as a baseline for further improved processes)](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Synthetic-Diamond/)

Now, there's quite a bit of information behind the former two, and not much behind the latter. Doing this as a one-off, home-shop/lab process is not very well documented on the internets. (At least with my google-fu.)

With a potential budget of a few grand, I'd much rather spend the monies in R&amp;D to make my own stone with similar brilliance and hardness. [Moissanite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite) (Crystalline Silicon Carbide), [Cubic Zirconia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_zirconia) (Crystalline Zirconium Dioxide), [White Sapphire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire) (Crystalline Dopant-Dependent Aluminium Oxide), and [Topaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz) (Aluminum Fluoro-Hydroxyl-Silicate) are to her, acceptable analogues.

First, I'd like to summon a few Redditors who have some experience in this arena: 

/u/theobromus

/u/LukeSkyWRx

/u/5degreenegativerake

/u/philosoraptor1000

Now, I have quite a few resources which are relevant to any of these processes; they will surely surface at some point of this thread. A concise thread (lets call it the base thread) is this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3jfvtb/can_i_make_a_sapphire_or_am_i_crazy/

&amp;nbsp;
*****
&amp;nbsp;

**Now,** I feel the first chunk to tackle in this endeavor is deciding on which process to attempt. They all have similarities; extremely high heat. I'm personally leaning on the [Czochralski process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czochralski_process). It's been around for [decades (1916)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022024813008579), so probably it should have a decent amount of information behind it. I am torn though, because Microwave-chem is a very **big**, burgeoning field of [research](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp306190n) (at least in org-chem!), albeit quite young. 

So, with the process not-quite-chosen (but rather well-leaned on), now we come to the target crystal. 

The wikis for both [Silicon Carbide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide) and [Moissanite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite) display a melting point of:

&gt; 2730 °C (decomposes)

The key point here is that the listing describes *decomposition*. This is where worldly-experience-slash-better-references can help.

The wiki for [Aluminum Oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxide) (unsure as to the conditions used to test this; what is it, crystalline, powdered, what the hell Wikipedia...) displays a melting point of:

&gt; 2,072 °C

and the wiki for [Sapphire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire) (which is crystalline Aluminum Oxide, as discussed) displays a melting point of:

&gt; 2,030–2,050 °C

So, we have a target furnace with a capability of maintaining a working temperature between 2,100 °C and 2,750 °C

(Notes: I'm *assuming* this is **not** in an oxygenated environment. Therefore, we must add an inert atmosphere/gas for our melting. Argon or Nitrogen. As far as I know, Argon has a [lower thermal conductivity than Nitrogen, and so would seem to be more suitable](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Should_I_use_Ar_or_N2_as_atmosphere_in_DSC). However, I happen to have plenty of Nitrogen on-hand at my shop. So, now the ever-present 'price variable' rears its head.)

With much leaning on one process, and two viable target crystals as our goal, this is where I'm looking to you: 
######The Hivemind. 

Thoughts, ideas, anecdotes, and *especially* experience are most appreciated **here**.

I feel a calling to teach (like, professor someday, if we all make it that far...); I will record and compile my trials to the best of my ability. I will gladly provide the results, plus a hopefully easily-digestible pictorial guide once this process is finished. To all, for free (duh.)

Heat source? Well, according to [MetalLab](http://www.metallab.net/kanthal.php), this could be achieved *without* an HHO torch **or** a high-voltage arc (both of which I fully consider **viable** options!) by using a 'Zircothal' wire-element (ZrO2). Although I have created my own hotplate-stirrer with Aluminum and NiChrome, I have never heard of (nor found cheap manufacturers of) Zircothal wire.

24,Non-Engineer Graduating Student in Tech Industry: Advice ?,1485927070,"Hello r/AskEngineers !
I am a future graduate studying international relations ( aka politics/economics ), but looking to get into the software industry for my career.

I found my true passion and interest for development during my last year of college and I have continued to build my portfolio since. Skillsets: HTML,CSS, JS -React/ReactNative, Angular; mostly front end at the moment; I also have exp with design: Sketch, PS, Illust.

Basically, a software company who interviewd me suggested me the position of a Sales Engineer based on my experience/education.

- The recruiter stated that my skill sets aren't yet mature for a developer position, but can be utilized as a sales engineering position
-  Should I start my first career in this way, or should I venture out further into developer positions at my level? 
- What I am worried is that I want to grow as a developer, not as a sales person with technical knowledge
- I currently hold a part time job at IT support and I don't enjoy the customer service part; especially when I deal with frustrated non-technical clients directly 
- Just wondering if there's a chance of me landing a developer position after grad, or I should take the Sales Engineering position and grow from there and make the switch later if need arises.

Thanks for your input ! :D

Due to life circumstances I'm not going to get into here, I was too overloaded to land an internship or even come out with a good GPA (mine was 2.73). Looking back I should have taken a year off or not crammed everything into four years, but I can't go change that now. I didn't understand the importance of networking while in school and didn't really associate with anyone in my department or join any relevant clubs or societies. I have been applying at every entry level position I can find regardless of experience requirements and have been applying to internships even when they list ""currently enrolled in an engineering program"" as a requirement. I've only had maybe a dozen call backs for phone interviews and even fewer of those have lead to in person interviews. No internship positions has ever called me back.

I have noticed the frequency of call backs has dropped significantly since roughly a year after graduating. I believe this is because a fresh wave of graduates entered the job market and many of them are better qualified than myself and haven't been out of school for a year, so they get hired over people in my situation.

I like talking to people, being active, and putting an effort where I can see the direct effect on citizens. I really do care for this planet and the people living in it. I like thinking about big solutions to big problems like how to create employment for people in developing nations, how to decrease our use of non-renewable energy, how to provide accessible education for everyone, and overall making sure that everyone is safe regardless of their ethnicity, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, and social status. I know I can't effectively do much for that, but doing something even small within that would be incredibly fulfilling. 

I am going on a 10 day trip to Honduras with an engineering club to work alongside and assist local engineers to design a water system for a rural community. Activities like that excite me so much! I am even learning Spanish so I can talk to the locals as much as possible. Anything to do with development really excites me. Do you have any suggestions on anything else I can get involved in that are similar to this that will help me land a job in the field I'm looking for? 

I just don't know what kind of jobs would be right for me, and how to show my passion because it seems very scattered. By looking at my resume, no one will want to hire me for a typical engineering job because I was such a mediocre student and didn't work relevant jobs.

58,Need Offer Negotiation Advice! Lockheed Martin - Aerospace Engineer Associate Offer,1485817380,"I interviewed with Lockheed in mid December for this position and just got a phone call today with an offer of $57K. From comparisons on glassdoor, $58,928-$74,187, this seems like a little more than a lowball. 

I graduated this past December in Aerospace Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology (ranked 2nd in aerospace) with a GPA of 3.00. It is the bare minimum GPA, but the man I interviewed with said I met all the qualifications, had every desired skill, as well as letting me know I was a high priority candidate. From what I have heard, recent college grads can only negotiate with Lockheed if they have another offer on the table (which I currently do not, nor do I plan on lying about that).

Should I still try to negotiate the salary? I don't want to lose this offer so I'm wondering if I have valid grounds to negotiate on. The deadline for my response is February 2nd (in 3 days).

59,Do contact forces act through the center of the surface or center of gravity of the body?,1485815556,"http://imgur.com/a/sfZMS

I'm designing a fixture for a large tensile machine and I'm trying to take advantage of the wedged gripping area that is already existing. It consists of two halves that clip around the test sample so that it's easier to load in and out of the machine (the base sits 19"" off the ground and these test specimens can be 6 ft. tall).

I'm trying to figure out how friction interacts with these wedges, and because of it, I need to know how the forces interact to create moments. If I get rid of friction (worst case scenario), then I can solve for N and R using simple force equations.

The question is: **do the reaction forces on the wedge block act in the center of the surface, toward the center of gravity of the body, or something else?**

Obviously they are distributed loads, but they should still be able to be simplified to a single point I think. I can absolutely create the fixture without the need to know the friction involved, but it could help save material/cost/weight if I can see what it can do to help. Also I just want to know for practice anyways.

I had purchased a heat pump water heater and know it's kind of just the inverse of an air conditioner. 

**My question is basically - why are HVAC systems (hot water tank, AC's, etc) not typically combined?**


Basically I told my friend that I thought you could essentially combine the refrigerant line and the hot water tank with an in-between tank that drew cold water to 1, increase AC efficiency, and 2 reduce hot water tank power draw by introducing already warmed water.  

In addition to that I do realize that putting already heated water into what is essentially a sealed system is a recipe for disaster, but I had another idea to simply spray out water on the roof when the pretank reached a certain temp (80f or so). So essentially...

air handler -&gt; condenser -&gt; water heating pre-tank -&gt; water heater -&gt; roof sprinkler system/wastepipe system

This idea assumes that dumping hot water on the roof would actually cool it down (double dipping for cooling) here but i'm not 100% sure, if that's not the case then simply dumping the hot water (either to waste or to something that requires it, like a spa) should be sufficient to draw in the pretank water and maintain temp.

I've suffered from an anxiety disorder since I was about 10 years old, but with the right medication it was kept under control for most of my life. mind you I haven't taken my medication in three years because I felt I no longer needed it and my anxiety never crept up on me until now. Recently (starting last semester) my anxiety and panic attacks have returned with a vengeance and its becoming so hard to do school work when the thought of getting less than an A is making me so anxious and triggering panic attacks. I'm skeptical about going back on my medication because it makes me groggy and hard to get up in the morning as well as decrease my motivation. 

But my real question is, how many of you guys/girls went through anxiety/depression from school and how did you learn to cope with it?

5,University question,1485607314,"Hello there,

I'm looking for some advice / experiences, I'm an adult student (24) going back for engineering.

My issue is my university selection.
I've decided prior to this semester, to go to my local university for ME but they have no program for adult students that work full time  (40 hrs a week).

So thru my searches I've found an ABET accredited distance ME degree. That degree is from the University of north dakota. (I've attached a link to the university if anyone is interested)

Im currently leaning toward going for this degree but I'm wary of it being a distant degree. 

So if there is any engineers or engineering managers that could weight in on this that would be great.

9,"ChemEng here. If I love distillation but hate what fossil fuels do to the climate, do you think I would enjoy building a distillation column for a refinery? Is the big picture end goal of your work important for satisfaction or is your actual day to day activity all that matters?",1485598367,"Hello Engineers,

I am studying chemical engineering. I have to chose what direction I am going to go in by picking my Master's Thesis topic and by choosing my courses. I am conflicted, however. I love all things related to heat transfer, thermodynamics, reactors and distillation columns. I love reactors. There is something about seeing these monumental machines that puts me in awe. However, when I ask myself what the end result of my efforts are, the answer is not often satisfying. If I worked in a refinery, I would help make gasoline so people can put more goddamn CO2 in the atmosphere. If I work in polymers, I am helping to make more plastic. Whoohoo! More plastic. That's what the world needs. Let's make more plastic to fill up the oceans. 

On the other hand, there are options where I agree with the big picture, but do not like the science that much. I would love to see biofuel from algae become a reality, but I do not like biology. I think battery development is one of the most important things for the world, but I don't think I would like the chemistry involved. I prefer subjects where math can be used to model the physical object, like heat transfer simulations for example, to subjects that have a lot of weirdness and uncertainty like chemistry.

16,What happened to the top sections of the WTC towers during the collapse?,1485570575,"Hi all, I am hoping for some insight to this specific question.  I don't think I will find anything further just by googling around.  Any informed responses are welcome as it seems doubtful there will ever be objectively verifiable answer.

Many are familiar with the very thorough NIST report which addresses the events leading up to the initiation of the progressive collapse(s).  I have continued to wonder about the actual dynamics of the collapse progression itself.  I don't have an engineering background.  I have read Bazant's analyses which assume that the top sections of the towers remained essentially rigid, progressively down-crushing the lower sections with minimal upward propagation of the crush zone until the collapse reaches the ground.  I imagine some assumptions are being made here about whether the top section could feasibly withstand deformation to the extent that it can be treated as a rigid object until the final stages of the collapse progression.  Bone fragments continue to be recovered from rooftops of high-rise buildings in the vicinity of the towers, ostensibly from laterally projections of the collapsing tower.  This suggests that a great deal of material occupying the upper floors was already obliterated when the collapse front was still at a relatively high altitude, particularly in the top sections where human bodies were concentrated.  

Like many Americans, I have always been a little horrified at the fact that so many bodies, like the desks, chairs, etc., where apparently reduced to dust.  Firefighters who survived in the 4th floor stairwell of the north tower described how the floor seemed to bounce as the oncoming collapse smashed down story after story coming down at them.  To me, this suggests that the building frame was reflecting resistive forces upwards at the collapsing mass even though these forces countered only a very small fraction of the downward kinetic energy.  Put another way, it makes sense to me that objects being serially impacted against 80+ concrete floors by a falling 50000-ton top section would result in nearly-complete disintegration of furnishings and human remains.  Still, I wonder about whether the people in the top section were crushed in this way progressively over the course of the collapse, or whether the top floors would have remained largely intact and only pulverized upon hitting the ground.  I would like to think there was minimum pain/horror for those victims but I just want as close to a realistic understanding as I can.

TL;DR - Would the top sections have disintegrated early in the collapse (due to up-crush or deformation), allowing everything inside to be pulverized at an early stage, OR would the sections have remained rigid and perhaps somewhat preserved until being pulverized upon hitting the ground (on top of the rubble)?

24,Compability of Pump with Bladder Tank,1485555418,"Hi all,
I am doing a water project in thailand that requires transporting water from a storage tank to a water fountain station. The demand at this station will be about 15 gpm and the pump I am looking to use is a CNP pump (CNP-CHLF2-50 MP) also shown in this brochure. https://www.whiteint.com.au/documents/Pumps/CNP%20Pressure%20Systems%20Brochure.pdf
However, to preserve longevity of the pump and make sure that it does not also start/stop frequently, I plan to use a bladder tank. Specifically, the amtrol 250x, which is shown here. http://www.amtrol.com/media/documents/wellxtrol/MC7025_04_14_WXTsizingCard.pdf
So I plan to use the CNP pump to draw water out of the storage tank, and pump it to the amtrol 250x, where it will then discharge water to the water station. Do you see any issues with this arrangement or have any concerns? I talked to an Amtrol rep who told me to use a jet pump to pump water into the bladder tank. When looking at the CNP pumps brochure, it mentions that it is for domestic pumps/booster sets. What exactly is the difference between a jet pump and booster pump anyways?

44,Feeling Helpless and Lost in Engineering,1485488142,"This is kind of a depressing post as a warning to those reading. I would really appreciate any advice or words of encouragement. 

I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering in June 2016. I kind of knew that I really didn't like my major and was feeling a lot of anxiety at the time, but felt that I would just graduate, get a job, and figure things out. Well it's now 2017 and I still don't have a job. I feel like I am just trying to bull shit and fake my way into an engineering job that I don't even want. I feel like engineering is a poor fit for me, but then on the other hand I haven't had much industry experience besides internships. I'm pretty smart and technically minded, this is why I went the engineering route in the first place. I think I'm kind of getting depressed. I moved home with my parents to save money and that's fine, but I feel so lost and like a failure. I started taking classes for healthcare related options because that was something that deep down for the longest time I always wanted to do, but I still have a lot of doubt in pursuing this. I feel such an overwhelming sense of anxiety and stress about my future and I feel like I don't really know who I am or what I enjoy anymore. It's a rough feeling and I've never had to deal with something like this before. I know I should probably suck it up and stuff, but I can't help having the feelings I do. 

If anyone has felt similarly and could give some advice that would be great. Everyone tells me ""things will work out, you will figure it out"" but I'm in a really dark mindset right now and can't see that perspective. Something that recently got my interest was Sales Engineering because I feel like for me I do enjoy learning about technical things and products, but since I don't like actually designing them maybe that would be a good fit. I'm more extroverted than any of my peers ever were and am someone that really enjoys social interaction and building relationships.

52,Please list everything you do and don't like about your job (kinda urgent),1485467067,"Hi engineers of reddit,

About six months ago I did a little DIY project that eventually led me to develop an interest in engineers, at first structural and now also mechanical. I have until tomorrow morning (so about half a day) to finish my registration at an engineering school. I'll then have 3 months to decide whether I want to go with structural or mechanical engineering, but that's now what I'm asking here.

My brother, who is also my ""boss"", offered me an enticing proposition: instead of being paid by the hour, I'll have 50% of the revenues of his eCommerce business. He sells watch parts on eBay, and right now I make about $1300 a month which is kind average in my country, but I can expect to start earning as much as $4000 in half a year or so from now (assuming I don't go to engineering school). Theoretically, it could be even more after an year or so, if we do it right and recover the business to the way it was an year ago (it was somewhat neglected because my brother started another business which is more worthy of his time investment).

So yeah, I've been torn between these two options in the last month, changing my mind back and forth between the options. With engineering, it might be a more satisfying job because I could say ""I did this"" and ""I built that"", but it means I'll be a poor student for the next 5 years, by the end of which I'll be 30 years old with no money at all. THEN I'll start earning $2500 a month (as a start) and of course it increases with time... So economically the reward is way farther back, but it MIGHT be a more satisfying job.

So... let's go back to the subject: please list everything you do and don't like about your job as an engineer. It MIGHT help make my decision just a bit easier.

Thank you.

54,Killing the engine for economical driving?,1485460591,"Now before all this is just a thought experiment on how engines work, 

Ive been wondering if it would be more economical to use the following strategy than to keep the velocity constant when driving on highways or other high speed roads.

Entering highway one would just like normal accelerate to the appropriate speed. Then he would kill off the engine and let the car glide until the car would have decelerated to a slow speed. Then he'd accelerate again and kill the engine for the second time when in an appropriate speed.

I know this sounds pretty stupid, but an idling engine takes about 1 liter an hour in a normal car, and with my reasoning it is used to overcome all the friction within the engine at circa 800rpm. At 2000 rpm (normal driving) the energy needed to overcome this friction would be 2,5 l/h (I can be terribly wrong here). If the engine would be dead, say 2/3 of the time or even longer, there would be no friction to overcome at those times. 

The real question is that how much more inefficient the engine is when its producing lots of power for acceleration compared to normal steady use to keep the car going. 

I know this would be very impractical and that it would never be used even if it worked, but just out of curiosity I hope there's someone who can answer me.",AskEngineers,MtJuke,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5qceip/killing_the_engine_for_economical_driving/

65,I acquired a hand-me-down plastic-coated wood play structure. I've read water-tight seals can lead to rapid rot if compromised. The seal has some small tears and the plastic masks any potential problems brewing. Should I remove the plastic coating and treat the wood instead?(x-post \r\woodworking),1485398617,"[Structure in question](http://imgur.com/a/AbVfL)

My concern with the plastic coating is two-fold: the little I've read about building science I've come away with the impression that water-tight seals on wood are usually a bad idea since when moisture inevitably does get past the seal it tends to stay and lead to rapid rot. And in fact a non-structural part of this structure got a bad gash and the wood inside became like wet paper pulp. I suspect the gash was during the move and I found the mushy wood just a couple weeks later---so that would be concerning if I have the timeline right. 

Secondly the plastic hides any problems that might be brewing with the wood. I would feel much better if I could inspect the wood every once in a while. 

The design is such that the swing has a lot of leverage and strains the whole structure quite noticeably when in use. I know it's proably not *likely* but I can imagine catastrophic collapse without visible warning signs if, say, two of the legs were both to get water in them and start rotting over a couple weeks. 

Is this worth worrying about? Would it be worth it to tear off the plastic, sand and UV/weather treat the wood underneath and leave it bare or painted?

Whenever I'm working on a project or thinking about what jobs I want after school I refer to the code of ethics from the military and engineering. Like I stated, I'm only a sophomore and I still have a lot to learn, but looking at the code of ethics and seeing what my fellow engineers are doing, it brings me to a point of reevaluating things. 

Being an engineer is not about wealth, fame, individualism, or being deceitful. We are the ones that keeps the world from collapsing in on its self. We are ""expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.""

-Theft of a credit card (class 4)

99,What's Wrong with My PWM Chopper-Type Brushed DC Motor Driver Schematic?,1485302553,"So my college team and I are working on an ROV and we've hit a bit of a road block.
The ROV is propelled by 8 modified pumps. The pumps are to be controlled by an Arduino Mega. To allow the Arduino Mega to control the motors, the team (rather impulsively) bought a bunch of TB67H400AHG drivers. 

In my opinion, the datasheet for them is rather unhelpful and there is very little third-party documentation for the product. As a result, designing a circuit for the motors has been a rather slow process. Because of budgeting, we're stuck with the drivers.
I've found myself in charge of the project, but I've hit a bit of a road block. I can't get my circuit to work. I'm certain that my breadboard setup and soldering is good, so the error has to be in my schematic. Whenever I flip on the power to the chip, Vref and OutA are essentially 0 and VCC is 11.7 V (well beyond the rated value). I've tried it with several chips and I get the same result. It doesn't respond to any of my PWM inputs. I think the chips are instantly frying, but I'm not sure why? I'm guessing the internal voltage regulator for VCC is getting blown and a short occurs, but again, I don't know why. 

For all the broken chips, there is a short between HBMODE and INA1.

Any insight you guys can provide would be really, really appreciated! If I'm making any obvious mistakes, feel free to verbally abuse me.
Let me know if there's any additional info you'd like.

**Documentation**:

https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/product/linear/motordriver/detail.TB67H400AHG.html

**Schematic**:
http://schematics.com/project/tb67h400ahg-motor-driver-for-single-small-motor-47722/

**Values and Calculations**:

foscm = 1/(0.56[Coscm(Roscm + 500)]

fchop = 70 kHz (recommended to avoid overheating)

Foscm = 1.12 MHz

Cosc = 270 pF

Rosc = 5.1 kΩ


Vref = Rvref1*Vcc/(Rvref2 + Rvref1)

Vref = 3V

Vcc = 5V

Rvref1 = 15 kΩ

Rvref2 = 10 kΩ


RRS  = Vref(gain)*Vref/Imax

Imax = 0.76 A (max current rating for test motor)

RRS  = (1/5)*3/0.792 = 0.76 Ω


Logic input has operating range of 2-5V


I referenced the following test board for my own design: 

http://www.marutsu.co.jp/contents/shop/marutsu/datasheet/toshiba_TB67H400AHG.pdf


**My current understanding of the driver**:

VCC is internally regulated and should be close to 5V.

VM is used to power the chip and is also the peak voltage you wish to apply to the motors.

Vref is used to limit the maximum current that can be applied to the motors. In my circuit, I connect it to VCC with a voltage divider to apply 3V to it.

Because I want the logic INA1 to always be high, I connect it to Vref (which is 3V).

The OSCM is essentially used to set the clock cycle of the chip.

I control the motor with a function generator hooked up to PWMA to turn the motor clockwise when the signal is high.


Unless you guys have any ideas, **my next troubleshooting step is**:

To hook up INA1 to a 3V power supply instead of Vref. Hooking it up to Vref is unorthodox and was originally done to make the breadboard setup cleaner.

I have a friend there so I heard they were looking to hire, and was upfront that I *could* stay where I was but that I also wanted to see what was out there. At the end of the interview I was told the decision depended a lot on upcoming projects and that I shouldn't expect an immediate callback or be offended if I saw a similar job posted on their website. 

It's now been about a year, and I just got an email with practically the same wording my friend got when he was initially offered a job there. So I'm expecting either a follow-up interview or an offer over the phone.

If I mention that my company has actually addressed some of my reasons for looking around without being specific, do you think they will take that as a lack of interest?

7,"Hello, I have thought of something that would improve solar energy collection but I do not have the skills to calculate this or see the (very possible) flaws in it. Thanks in advance.",1485292104,"
Sorry for talking down to you but I wrote this trying to explain it to laymen....which is not going well...

You take your solar collector, photo electric cells in colder areas, focussed mirrors in hotter areas.

Then You take a heat pump...you what a heat pump is? it is basically an inside out refrigerator using air as the gas to be compressed....If you compress air, it will get hot....so you will lead that heat via some great heat conductor towards your heat storage tank. This tank will be filled with something that needs a large amount of energy to turn from a solid into a liquid..so you can store a large amount of energy without raising the temperature of it....Water is like that (the energy to turn solid water into liquid water is enough to heat that same water to 50 ish degrees C) but probably at a higher temperature (some help from some chemically smart person could be useful here,) . By compressing this air even more and letting the heat go into the heat storage, you will eventually get to liquid air. You store this in a pressurised tank (like a big diving tank)..

So what do you have by now? Heat storage and Cold storage...all you need is something to turn it into electrical energy when you want it to....

You are gonna need a Stirling engine for that, they can use the difference in temperature to work the bigger the difference in temperature, the more bang for your buck...

You could just use the liquid air tank and the heat storage to react against each other to give you electrical energy at any time you want.

Daytime operation is different from night time operation...and this works even better in a place like a desert with a high daily amplitude ....

Right....Day-mode You use the cold storage (liquid air will turn into cold.if you let it evaporate..) against the high ambient temperature...creating an extra difference in temperature..aka more electricity while not even using your heat storage tank...you even top that one up with compressed high temperature air giving you even more heat to use during the night time

Night time-mode

You have cold ambient air and a full heat storagetank.....so your Stirling engine starts to operate again..this time with your hot storage against the cold ambient temperature....again electricity galore....and you get to fill your liquid air storage again with the cold outside air.

Rinse and repeat...

I already had a bit of an idea a couple of years ago but I got sparked again by looking at [this TED-talk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZiaTV6uvFQ), it is very close to what I am suggesting but she wants to store energy as pressure.. I think turning pressurized air into cold would even be a better option.  I posted it at the TED site, [her companies site] (http://www.lightsail.com/) and even on several other sub reddits. No useful answers yet so here we are...

Thanks in advance...

11,Instantenous center of velocity of a mechanism,1485283769,"Hey!

I started kinematics and I came upon a weird problem that showed me I don't really understand ICs.

Basically I got this ""mechanism""

http://i.imgur.com/jcEm22L.png

The ball is rolling without slipping, There is a rod attached to it (point N). The rod is being pushed and point N spins around of course.

I would like to find the IC of the rod. Let's say I got the diameter and the angular velocity known and the length of the rod. If I understand correctly, this is a composite movement (not sure what is the correct expression) - the point N is moving translatory (direction x - to the right) and spinning (let's say that in this moment it is facing downwards - the point N is at the leftmost point of the ball/circle).

So from what I gather the absolute velocity of the point N is in this moment facing -45° (speed equals to v-horizontal=angular velocity times the radius (vh=w*R) as it's not slipping and angular: va=w*R). So should I use for finding the IC of the rod the absolute velocity ([image 1](http://i.imgur.com/4V27BWm.png)) or just the angular ([image 2](http://i.imgur.com/WrY001r.png)).

Would appreciate if someone explains this to me!

I'm assuming that radiation intensity and error rate have a directly proportional relationship, but I suspect its more complicated than that. I'm guessing that wavelength of the radiation vs size of the circuit components would matter here, since hardening electronics seems to involve making them bigger.

so now he told me to send him my current salary and bonus this past year. i told him i was currently happy where i'm at but i'll consider if the offer sounds good to which he acknowledged. he told me there's no bonus here, so i was thinking of throwing out $88K, for 15% increase (i read 10%-20% is about the norm for switching) plus another $2K to compensate non-bonus (he suggested this last time i applied). the salary range for someone in this position has a wide range so i'm not sure how reasonable my figure is. however they are a huge company so they usually pay well for even entry level engineers (i think about $70K).

my parents think this is too much a difference and might risk giving them a sour first impression of greediness, and suggest i just tell them my current salary and that i prefer a 15% increase and not even give a figure. i would wait to see his offer, and if it's above $88K, then great, but if much lower (lets say under 10% minimum, which is $83K max), then i can renegotiate. my thinking is that if they don't agree with my figure, then they'll just give me lower offer and i'll re-consider again. after all, the theme here is that they need me more than i need them, so i don't think my offer seem that unreasonable in this scenario like my parents think.

31,6 groove pulley for tapered generator shaft,1485211397,"Hello,

I am re-purposing a diesel engine auxiliary power unit from a truck into a standby genset. I have an odd-ball 10 kW permanent magnet generator lying around that I want to spin at 3000rpm using the engine.

To minimise the amount of work I want to keep the engine's existing pulley on the flywheel. The engine is a derated Yanmar 2TNV70. The pulley on the flywheel is approx 95mm. 

To make things interesting the generator's shaft is tapered. I believe that the shaft is a 40mm shaft with 1:10 taper at the end. I can probably get a pulley internal diameter machined for the taper but I am struggling to find suppliers of 6-groove pulleys the size that I need (3500/3000rpm = 1.16 * 95mm = 110mm generator pulley diameter).

Here is a photo of the alternator pulley and belt. How do I determine the type of belt profile? 

http://imgur.com/a/E3uRh

TL:DR
-Anyone know European supplier with online store for 6 groove 110mm pulley?
-How do I determine the correct belt profile?

I am in Ireland and so a European supplier would be preferred but not essential.

32,How to insulate a room with a hallway using a bedsheet?,1485211213,"


I have done some doodles for visual aid.

So I have two rooms with a long hallway connecting them together. 
One is my Kitchen and one is my Living Room. 
The kitchen is a colder room in the apartment than my living room which I want to keep warm. 
&gt; http://imgur.com/a/K8BjE 

My idea is to pin a bed sheet from wall to wall in my hallway, keeping the heat in.
 I know it's not a perfect idea but whatever, it's what I got.

THE PROBLEM: The bedsheet is shorter than the height of my ceiling, forcing me to make a choice. 

MY QUESTION: Is it better to have the bedsheet touching the floor and leaving around a foot of space between the top of the sheet and the ceiling like so:
&gt; http://imgur.com/a/tXz4H 


OR put the bed sheet right up against the ceiling and leave about a foot of space between the bottom of the sheet and the floor like so:
&gt; http://imgur.com/a/B2eJS


I ASK BECAUSE: I figure warm air rises and cool air falls right? So there must be a better way to keep heat in a room; stop the warm air from escaping out the top or stop the cool air from getting in though the bottom.

33,First Job - Aluminum Extrusion - Resources and Advice,1485201036,"Hello all,

I was recently hired as an engineer in a plant that produces extruded aluminum products.

This is my first job (barring internships/co-ops) and I will be working on a quality related project when I start in February.

My Questions:

* What advice do you have for a young engineer working in a manufacturing plant? One of my internships was in a manufacturing plant, but I was behind a desk coding, running data, drafting, and updating SOPs most of the time.
*   What materials do you recommend I review? Materials science jumps out and I'm proficient with statistical sampling strategies and analysis (part of the reason this is my first project).
* What quirks are associated with aluminum extrusion? Personal anecdotes welcome.

Thanks in advance!

35,Optical Pyrometer Temperature deviation,1485199717,"I have an situation where we use two color optical pyrometers to read the temperature of a graphite surface in a furnace operating at 1800 C.  We use nitrogen pumped into a sight tube to prevent oxidation on the sight glass thus blocking the pyrometers reading. 

My question, would higher or lower concentrations of Nitrogen affect the EM wavelengths causing a distortion of the temperature readings?  We have limited information that suggest the amount of Nitrogen does affect the temperature reading.  

However, there are two camps, one group thinks the amount of gas flow is enough to cool the graphite target affecting the reading.  However the target is up to 2 meters from the source of gas in a rough vacuum and the graphite vessel is at least 1.5 m by 1.5 m and 3 cm thick.  

The other camp thinks that the gas flow is affecting the EM wave by some form of refraction as it passes through the Nitrogen and that the amount or density of the flow is what causes temperature reading variation.

I am wanting to remove a couple walls to open up my living room, dining room, kitchen area. The area would end up being a 22' x 22' room. Currently is is divided down the middle with a load bering wall. It is a one story house with a crawlspace below it and an attic which is too small and hard to access to be used as storage. So this beam would only be holding up the ceiling, roof and any snow load.


Under the wall is a beam made of 3 2x8s supported on either end by the concrete foundation and at two places by 4x4 posts resting on concrete footings.


Basically I want to figure out how big of a beam I need if I want to remove this wall completely and how big it would need to be if supported at one more place along its length... though preferably not in the middle.
I have been trying to figure it out with [this calculator](http://learnframing.com/wood-beam-calculator/) but I am unsure of how to read the results. Does it calculating a beam size of 30 1/2"" inches mean that the cross section should be 30 1/2 inches square?


And when it asks for the number of piles... is that in addition to support on either end? I find it weird that zero is not an option but 1 is. It seems if in was not counting the ones on either end then zero would be an option, and if it was then it should start at 2 because I cant imagine a beam only being supported at one point.

49,"I want to do rough calculations of a theoretical single-cylinder internal combustion engine, mostly concerning the chemistry and physics of combustion",1485133342,"Say I have a standard 4-stroke single cylinder internal combustion engine with 1"" bore x 0.8"" stroke. The head has no recess or special combustion chamber geometry. The valves seat flat to the surface of the head, so the top of the cylinder is effectively just a flat surface, 0.125"" above the top of the piston at TDC.

On the intake stroke, it draws in a stoichiometrically perfect amount of ethanol and air. How much of that is ethanol? How much is oxygen?

C2H6O + 3(O2 + 3.76N2) = 3H2O + 2CO2 + 11.28N2

I got 0.01029L of displacement = 4.59E-4 mol. (4.59E-4)/4 = 1.15E-4 moles of ethanol and (1.15E-4 * 3) = 3.45E-4 moles of air. (3.45E-4)/4.76 = 7.24E-5 moles of O2 and (7.24E-5 * 3.76) = 2.72E-4 moles of N2. That's the input.

4.59E-4 * (16.28/4) = 0.00187 moles = 0.0419L after the reaction.

Is any of that right? It's been a while since I took chemistry.

On the compression stroke, I believe finding the pressure at TDC is just (P1V1)=(P2V2) right?

So (101325Pa * 0.01029L) = (P * 0.00161L) -&gt; P = 647598Pa before combustion.

58,Automotive drag and downforce,1485112810,"Hi, recently I am having some thoughts about aerodynamics, but I don't know much about engineering.
For the sake of the argument, lets assume that we have a car with no air intakes/open grill on the front. 


1- If I create openings in the front, and add ducts to move the air like on the picture, will downforce be increased? The green ""way"" will redirect wind only to the rear spoiler, while the red will go through the windshield and then to the spoiler. Is the red more efficient (ignoring drag), or the windshield redirects air up, avoiding the rear spoiler? And if the duct starts at the botom of the vehicle, and moves up, like the green one, will the duct itself afect downforce?


2- redirecting the air to the back of the car (blue) can generate a downforce increase as well (blue line)? On the areas that were closed and are now a duct, the drag of those areas is completely nullified? 

3 - To generate more downforce, the air must be redirected to the middle of the rear spoiler, or even if it goes lower will work (even though not optimal)?

4 - When I use scale models on a wind tunnel, the speed of the tests must mimmic real life or they change depending on the scale? A smaller car needs slower/faster winds to behave like a full sized at a given speed?

5 - This kind of aerodynamics change the handling of a car on speeds smaller than 80Km/h (even if by a little), or they only act at greater speeds?

Any help is appreciated &amp; or ideas on how to create this !

Based on https://www.energusps.com/shop/product/li8pt-li-ion-building-block-with-temp-sensor-3-6v-18c-37

The best thing I've come up with for direct airflow to the batteries is by connecting same length clear tubing to each vent hole (keep flow constant between them) and bundling them together (both sides/push and pull) then  connecting a fan to the larger combined tubes.

From what I understand of how airflow/fans work if I use a fan like this http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/162058660409?lpid=82&amp;chn=ps&amp;ul_noapp=true
and stack say 4 of them inline like a turbine, I'll have the same CFM, but with a higher pressure to overcome the smaller vent holes. Is this correct thinking? I'll take any suggestions.

I wanted to know how I could structurally analyze my balsa tower design. I am aiming for efficiency, so my attempt is to create this tower to be the lightest while holding up the most. This is the current one I have built, and I am attempting to make a triangular base (so three of these together with a wider base and a smaller top). What are some possible **weak points** in this structure? Also, after studying off of previous towers and asking questions, I learned that the triangle is the best shape *in terms of its strucutral efficiency*. *Why is this true?*

Specifications of design:
* Trapezoid with base of 24 cm, side length of 65.5 cm, and top width of 6 cm. Height (altitude?) of trapezoid is 65 cm. Each truss connection is at alternating heights, first 15 cm, 15cm, 10 cm, 10 cm, 5 cm, 5 cm. 
* One side weighs 3.36 g; total tower probably anywhere from 10-12 grams. 
* Needs to hold up to 15 kg.
* Weight is hung from the top of the tower pulling downwards

75,DC-DC Current Regulators For High Current Loads,1485043647,"Hey all! A question regarding DC-DC regulators! Let's say we have a car battery (14.4V) Which can obviously output quite a lot of current at that voltage (~700A). Now I have a load that I want to put on it, that operates at exactly 14.4V. It's a load that can draw quite a lot of current, however I want to limit it to what I want the current draw to be. Say for a while I want to run it at 20A, then 60A (the max I intend on using). What options do I have for a current limiter that does NOT use some huge dropping resistor that will just eat up valuable power and output heat. The kicker is that I have to make this able to work with a microcontroller (preferably arduino) that can control these parameters at will. I was thinking possibly using a ADC to convert to digital and bump the voltage down, then stepping it up again to 14.4V but with low max current draw? Maybe a boost converter? Can anyone help out?

Oppressive regime led by a dictator has cut off internet from our region. We have a strong case for a federal state but our regime won't even consider it. They responded by locking up our leaders who have been in the forefront of our peaceful protest and resistance after a failed dialogue and rejected bribes. They banned a consortium that was formed to represent us. 

Our people were sharing photos of illegal arrests, tortures and killings on the social media. This has now been made impossible. Only our targeted region of the country is under internet blackout though. Other regions are ok.  

The only idea i have found so far for bringing internet to some people in the region is via a satellite internet provider out of the country. But it involves a lot of logistics and it is very expensive  

Please we need your help! A lot of lives can be saved.
