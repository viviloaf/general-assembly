Basically the idea is to make a device that packages a wireless keyboard, mouse and display and make it act as a remote control for desktop computer by linking it to the desktop via a direct RF link (Not WiFi). The device should not have a cpu, mother board or memory (in the conventional sense). 

Is this possible to build it with out a noticeable lag in the user interaction. So if the user moves the mouse, the mouse cursor should start moving without a noticeable lag. 
If analog transmission is used instead of digital, for the video signal, could the performance be better?

I'm a mechanical engineering student and we recently covered the diesel cycle in class so I was interested in the technical details of this case. What I know so far is that for optimal performance, the fuel should ignite when the cylinder pressure is maximum at the top of the stroke, but the air and fuel aren't mixed well so there are a lot of NOx compounds. To avoid this, the fuel is ignited when the piston is moving downwards. This results in a lower efficiency but is cleaner. What I don't understand is how they achieve this controlled ignition since there are no spark plugs and what exactly Volkswagen cheated on. Please get as technical as you wish.

41,"CAREER: Is my gut regret feeling logical? Left a comfortable, well progressing stable job at a large engineering company due to slow movement of management. Accepted job offer at a startup field office for a small company.",1448044169,"BACKGROUND:
I'm a controls systems/automation engineer. I've worked in large companies all my career doing work for water, and power control systems so far. At the water one, I wasn't given a lot of responsibility as I came on as an intern, there was a lot of turn over and I felt like I just floated there supporting PLC and HMI work. (5 years)

I changed to the company I'm currently leaving now, which specializes in power systems. They took me on, with just my controls background and I flourished here with their support. I had a really good role (lead) at this company and had opportunities to move up in this space. (4 years)

The problem is, I don't find myself particularly interested in this ""power world"" since I'm not a power engineer and I have no passion to learn it. I just liked controls, HMIs, user interface, networking, security and robotics. The current company only utilizes their own proprietary products that don't have a large foot hold in the control systems world outside of power. Also, since I excelled so much and the work was easy compared to other control systems it became mundane but still frustrating due to organizational challenges. The harder projects were reserved for our HQ which I would never move to. Understaffed no power to hire. I also had the yearning for moving into the tech industry space, utilizing the skills i have now and growing them. I've always wanted this.

I have since given up my position at the power engineering company to join a small group (only 1 other engineer at this location) doing control systems engineering. Back to PLCs and HMIs for motors, manufacturing, food/beverage. Which I want to learn. They are all my age, I feel like we synergize in our passion for programming and new tech. It felt like a tech startup, but for industrial controls.


My question is, why am I racked up with so much regret since announcing my departure. I get that there is definitely an emotional part of leaving the people you're comfortable with and a job you were good at. But i feel like lost in the wind, not sure what I'm doing although I felt confident I was doing the right thing. I feel physically sick in my stomach. I'm having serious doubts like I'm going to hate the new place. Does anyone have experience making similar transitions or journeys in my role? I felt like if I was involved more with manufacturing, process, hvac food and beverage. That could get me a foothold to working for a tech company I'm passionate about. 


Another thing on my mind is am I just going to end up with more of the same? Still yearning just to be involved in tech? Am I putting it on a pedastal?
Also, does anyone here have advice on a career path that will lead me to being involved in that world, not just doing projects for them as a contractor (although I know that works sometimes), but for being staffed as a controls systems engineer for large tech companies for their data centers?",AskEngineers,anxietyengineer123,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3tlgsj/career_is_my_gut_regret_feeling_logical_left_a/

Rock climber here. It's well known that strong acids like those found in car batteries can totally, completely, death-inducingly damage climbing ropes which are all made of nylon. But I have a slightly different question.

I (accidentally) left my climbing rope in my trunk for about a month. I discovered recently that, in the trunk along with the rope, I had something similar to [this](http://www.batteryjunction.com/wagan-ea2045.html?gclid=CJrb6qPxnckCFQcdaQod6-kIbA) but the specific one that was in there was much older, and it didn't have a switch.

53,Include crush ribs in tolerance stack,1447974441,"Hello!

TL;DR: How do I calculate how much misalignment of the axises can I get from putting a pin inside of the hole with crush ribs? Here's a very simplified image - [link1](http://i.imgur.com/53RPclC.png?1)

I am doing a big tol stack. Position of one of the parts (pin like) could be fixed inside of the ""hole"" with crush ribs in the hole (rather then just having a big clearance that will ensure ease of assembly). I don't mind a bit of a press fit. However! The position of the pin is important for further stacks, there for I need to know a maximum misalignment I am getting. How do I calculate a maximum misalignment on the press fit part? Is it just a thickness of the crush ribs (therefore we'd assume that in the worse case someone completely removes one of the ribs)? But in this case it is not much better than not having ribs at all.. I'd be glad to hear your opinion!

54,"Should I have an ""actual"" interest in the field that pertains to the engineering degree I want to pursue?",1447973937,"I'm a senior in high school with grades good enough to study just about anything, but I know that I will most likely pick engineering as my career path, architecture being my only strong second choice. I hesitate, however, when it comes to deciding what aspect of it to study in particular. 

When I say ""actual"" interest, I refer to having, prior to entering university, dived into whatever part of engineering one likes best. For example, and I apologize if any of these sound cliché, tinkering with cars for mechanical engineers, building circuitry for electrical engineers, or having a background in aviation for aerospace engineers. 

It is that last example that interests me most. Even though I have had an interest in figuring out how things work since I can remember, I feel like my passion or lack thereof for planes and rockets and the like does not ""justify"" a career in such a field. I have memorized the make, name, and technical characteristics of hundreds of cars, yet I haven't done something of similar magnitude for spacecrafts, which would could be perfectly feasible I do not actively follow Space X; I'm not up to date with the latest developments in private or commercial aviation; others pursuing the same career probably do.

I have watched countless videos on YouTube about space exploration or WWII aviation, and I cannot deny that I enjoy suck topics, but, in comparison to many of the stories told by aerospace engineers in that thread a few weeks ago, I feel like I may lack the passion to complete (and do so well) a degree that will undoubtedly challenge me.

I like to put my abilities to the test, but perhaps here something not so lofty (aerospace does have that 'feel', fairly or not) would benefit me personally and my career in the long run.

I'm trying to evaluate myself for an engineering position in Ontario. Ospe publishes a yearly salary survey, and salary varies by responsibility level (A through F). The new employer has said that I would be paid at the A level, but that seems below what I was expecting. My qualifications are: Masters degree, 1.5 years of coop experience, 1.5 years real experience, and ~6 months of various contract work I did with some professors just after getting my B. Eng.

In either case, level A sounds like a very inexperienced engineer and the pay gap even from A to B is pretty big.

My question is why is it required for these tubes to be bent? My assumption is that there are a few reasons which could include:

* Ease of manufacturing. Welding the tubes to the header pipe in a straight line would be difficult without a gap in between each tube.

* The bending of every other tube allows for circulation between the front and back of the boiler, as the tubes of this header make up a division water wall.

26,How does a power source know about the load on the other side of a transformer?,1447712564,"Not the greatest title, but I'll try to explain more clearly. Circuits was never my strong suit, so forgive me if this is silly. This is all hypothetical - I'm just looking to understand the concepts.

First, let's say I have a 5V DC source that can supply 1A (5W). I then connect a 20 Ohm load. Ohms law says that my source will output I=V/R=0.25 A @ 5V (1.25 W). If my understanding is correct, the supply is only outputting the 1.25 W. The remaining 3.75 W isn't just turning in to heat somewhere.

Now I'm picturing a situation where I have an AC source (Let's say mains) that can supply 120 V @ 15 A. Now let's say my circuit needs 1200 V @ 0.5 A. So, I run it through a transformer to step up the voltage, which is basically two coils of wire wrapped on opposite ends of a ferrite core (As I understand them).

My question is how does the supply know what is required on the other side of the transformer? I can understand it in the DC case, since the resistances are directly connected to the source, but I'm having trouble grasping how this information propagates backwards through the transformer. Does the transformer always take a constant power on the input side, and whatever isn't used on the other side is just dissipated as heat (in the ferrite core)?

I.E - 120 V @ 15 A comes in (P=IV=120\*15 = 1800W), and 1200V @ 0.5 A is required (P=IV=1200\*0.5 = 600W), so 1800-600 = 1200 W is dissipated as heat, making my transformer 600/1800 = 33% efficient.

This feels awful inefficient to me, so I feel like I'm misunderstanding something. I imagine that the supply side must react to the demand side somehow, but I'm unclear as to how.

32,Digital clock on microwave ran fast following a power outage.,1447702669,"During a power outage that lasted a day, I had the house running on a generator.

After electrical power was restored I set all of the clocks in the house, and they all worked fine except for the microwave. I had to set it multiple times, and it was gaining nearly an hour every four or five hours. The rate was off enough that setting the timer for 1:15 took less than a minute to complete.

Half a dozen other clocks in the house plugged into the wall are of varying age, and none suffered the same problem, so I really doubt it was a strange frequency. Plus, that was so different from normal clock speed, and different parts of the service area came back online with power at different times, that it seems like an unreasonable way to correct clocks that rely on the wall frequency.

Eventually, I unplugged it for about fifteen minutes, and it was only gaining a couple minutes an hour. After repeating this process, it began tracking time normally again.

It *seems* like there was a built up charge that caused the internal quartz clock to run fast, but I don't think quartz clocks can be sped up that way, and I don't even know if it has a quartz clock mechanism or instead listens to the frequency of the main current.

Hey guys,
I'm building a rotary inverted pendulum to demonstrate reinforcement learning principles, however I have little experience with mechatronics. I will be building something similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd96_8iwP6s)

However instead of plastic I will be using 10mm aluminum tubes. The arm (horizontal) will be about 150mm long and the pendulum (vertical) will be about 150mm to 200mm with a little weight at the end.
So I have started my construction, but the problem I have now is choosing a motor. I started looking through sparkfun and some chinese stores for motors until I realised I have no idea what type or how powerful of a motor I need.

I was hoping someone could give me a ball park estimation of the torque I would need, and the best type of motor for this application (stepper or a classic DC motor) considering my setup ?

Right now Im doing the Physics first year. But, I really dont know if I like engineering better. The first year consisted on linear algebra( which if I would change to engineering I would have to do it again because they are supposedly different), calculus I, chemistry and basic physics (like simple kinematics and dynamics. I wasnt too fond of this course which I found pretty boring). 
I like physics because it will cover extensively the core understanding of every science and will led me to become more secure intelectually. As well as trying to understand everything which I always wanted. I want to try to contribute in our natures understanding. I dont know about it because: I would definetely have to leave my country, family and friends behind; I will have to study endless amounts to something which might not be that useful in actual humanity's advancement as a civilization(Lately I have been thinking that Physics is just an approximation to reality, this approximation or model helps people like engineers to solve different kind of problems). 

I like engineering (mechanical or electrical) because it will give me an array of marketable skills that would also help humanity advance like physics. I like a lot how well a machine fits together and creates movement for example. Like when the deploying animation of the james webb space telescope. I like to understand everything but also be useful in the applied sense. What I dont like about engineering is: I dont know if I would miss a lot of interesting physics lectures like QM; I dont know if I would have made a good researcher in Physics;

I am a person which likes to have an informed opinion about everything, I like helping people with any problem they might have, I enjoy a lot everything space related, I enjoy things like how does an engine produces so much power, The beauty of turbines and flying, ships, but I also like a lot nature. If I would be able to do research maybe I would do something that has applications in the real world.

In the future I see myself trying to entrepeneur an industry related to space, non conventional energy ( like solar), something related to prostethics or nanotechnology. I see myself as someone who wants to be valued over his intellect. I want to be useful. I dont know how smart I am in physics because first year is nothing related to it and I dont know if I want to waste
More time to see if Im good at it. I want to be good at what I choose to do.

Tldr: Im seeking advice on what to choose as a degree. Im torn after reading everywhere(literally all reddit and physics forums) thinking everynight between physics or mech/elect engineering.

57,Passive Solar Dryer Design Questions,1447594866,"So I'm designing this passive solar dryer using black sprayed soda cans as heat collectors, this is my final [drawing](http://imgur.com/gallery/pt9Np)

It will be used by a community of [artisans](http://artetaba.com.br/associacao-dos-artesaos-de-tabatinga/) in the Amazon to dry native seeds for their arts and crafts.

Some questions need resolving before I start building it, I hope you awesome engineers can help me! So, let's go:

1. Inlet/Outlet ratio and Air Flux - I made the inlet with half the area of the outlet so the air is forced to go in the right direction, despite it entering the collector from the top. Will this work? I'm worried that the air heating up will create a flux in the opposite direction because of the natural buoyancy effect.

2. Dimensions - I designed the drying chamber with 50x50x60cm (more or less) volume, I calculated that by putting 3 trays of seeds, 20cm apart from each other, it would be able to dry about 4.5Kg at a time. With this design I'll be able to stack about 25-30 cans in 5-6 columns as a sun heat collector.
The volume of air being heated in the collector will be a little less than 1/5 of the volume of air inside the chamber, is that a good ratio?

3. Reflecting Surface and Heat Loss - Last thing I want to know is if there is any significant drop in efficiency when reflecting the sunlight onto the collector instead of exposing the soda cans directly to it.

That's it, any help is appreciated!
When the project is finished I intend to post a construction manual in the [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/) website.

Last year, we designed our own frame and had it cut with a CNC machine out of a carbon fiber composite panel. This year, we're planning on making our own. Of course, I don't think what we're going to get this year is going to be good enough to be used. But we have to start somewhere.

We've done a bit of research, but it's hard to know what concerns this kind of application. A lot of youtube videos show carbon fiber applications that are purely aesthetics. I looked at some processes: infusion/vacuum bagging, compressed prepreg, etc. The most affordable one seems to be infusion - because an hydraulic press is expensive. Even if (I think) infusion is most appropriate for complex geometries, we'll probably start with infusion for now. This application doesn't require something with high-grade mechanical properties anyway.

This leads to my question: do you know of any good textbooks, papers, or standards regarding different carbon fiber composite manufacturing processes? I'm interested in the manufacturing part, but a bit of theory and analysis would be cool.

Hi All

&amp;nbsp;

Following on the last thread, there has been some changes to the situation.  While my company is still sorting out the paperwork, a different startup heard about this and approached me.  Essentially the startup offered to fully cover the tuition fees but the total amount is less than what my company offered because the offer includes expenses + conferences costs etc.  

&amp;nbsp;

Note that the startup is unlike the IT world.  It's currently making a healthy profit and is not reliant on external sources of investment.  

&amp;nbsp;

So in summary: 

&amp;nbsp;

**Startup Pros**  
* My research is interesting to and aligns with the work of the startup, but the primary reason is they wanted me to join them.  
* Very flexible working arrangement, i.e. remote work from home and not fixed hours + some shiny new gears (engineer here!)  
* I know the startup and the people well, so for a start I know they will do what they reasonably can to help me, i.e. I wouldn't be immediately tossed aside.  
* Offered profit sharing  

&amp;nbsp;

**Startup Cons**  
* It's a startup so the company currently has a good 1 year workload projection but not beyond that.  (Note the tuition fees will be paid upfront).   
* I might burn bridges with my current company if I were to leave after all the effort they put in.    
* The funding covers tuition fees only so I'll have to make up the rest via different funding.  The startup tentatively suggested depending on financial performance they could cover those too.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Company Pros**  
* Funding is twice as much as the startup.   
* Big company so better prediction with workload.    
* Big company with a number of experts in there that I can more easily tap into.    
* Maintaining the current reputation and relationship I built.    
* I wouldn't burn bridges.   

&amp;nbsp;

**Company Cons**  
* Standard work arrangement, i.e. 9-5 office work.  
* Salary offered is ~18% less than the startup.  
* No profit sharing scheme. 
* Less flexible than a startup due to the size of the company.  

&amp;nbsp;

Can anyone think of anything else?  Any opinions and suggestions are very much welcomed and appreciated, many thanks!

71,Why don't hard drives have more than one actuator? Wouldn't this increase performance?,1447477486,"It's my understanding that mechanical hard drives have one read/write head per platter surface; arranged in a stack so the heads move as a single unit. Each head ""comb"" is apparently controlled by one actuator. 

What I don't understand is, why not use two or more sets of heads and actuators? As far as I can tell, every drive on the market uses a single actuator. It seems like there'd be room for at least 2, if not 3, per drive over their full range of motion, and this would presumably allow reading and writing at significantly greater rates. I'm sure this would add some cost to the unit, but might this not be worth it? Given the speed disadvantage of mechanical drives compared to SSDs, and the price advantage of mechanical drives over SSDs, why hasn't any manufacturer tried this? 

Or have they tried and failed to sell them, already? :)

**EDIT: Thanks for all the awesome answers!**

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the general TL;dr version of the answers I'm seeing seem to be:

1. It was tried, once or twice, with underwhelming results.

2. You're practically doubling cost while not increasing capacity. You need two head controllers, and they need to be able to work together, so you wouldn't even necessarily get double the seek performance or throughput. Makes more sense to use a RAID and let the RAID controller do the heavy lifting.

3. More moving parts means more room for failure, and introduces more vibration, which can also reduce performance, even if it doesn't cause mechanical issues.

4. Nowadays, applications that actually need low seek times and high throughput and can handle the extra cost can simply use SSDs, with the added bonus of lower power use, diverse form factors, and much better shock resistance.",AskEngineers,EffingTheIneffable,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3sqzmf/why_dont_hard_drives_have_more_than_one_actuator/

http://ooznest.co.uk/Empty-Plastic-Spool?search=spool

I've calculated there is 58.75mm between the center cylinder of the spool and the outside edge(I could be incorrect). Anything over 59mm will essentially foul on the jib of my hoist.

Basically is the spool too small or too big to accommodate 103m of 2mm thick cord?

Can anyone help me with this?",AskEngineers,GlasgowAitchy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3snvjy/how_much_cord_can_my_spool_hold/

87,Why type of powder material would work best for powder coating a steel oil pan?,1447383706,"I just TIG welded some turbo oil return bungs on a steel oil pan and I'm preparing to powder coat the pan, but I'm unsure what type of powder to use.   I'm leaning towards a relatively high temp powder material, but I can't seem to find any information about chemical compatibility.   I'm also a bit intimidated by the available choices:  polyester, polyurethane, polyester-epoxy, and straight epoxy.

I've read that it's important to be careful with the heat of a powder coating oven when it comes to soldered joints like the oil plug reinforcement plate, but my joints have been TIG welded so it won't be a problem.

The inside will obviously be coated in oil.   

* Should I leave the inside bare for better heat transfer? 

* Should I coat the inside with paint?  

* Or should I powder coat both the inside and outside?    

* If I use the wrong type of powder on the inside, is there a risk of the coating dissolving and causing an oil pump failure?

I'm leery about getting this right because 10 years ago I made the mistake of powder coating a master cylinder and quickly learned that brake fluid isn't compatible with the type of powder coating I used.   The coating came off like it was sprayed with paint remover.

7,Utility trailer racks built with steel pipe. Are these calculations reasonable?,1447287868,"I'm looking to add a home-built rack to a utility trailer.  Found plenty of examples online.  Here's an ""interesting"" one: http://imgur.com/a/Tvy4H  

This uses 1"" schedule 40 galvanized pipe. This table shows that this pipe can support 521 lbs at 3ft horizontal distance: http://imgur.com/O04THqo   

Using that, I try to figure out if the whole thing would collapse if I slammed on the brakes.  

So, I assumed 100lbs of kayaks (2x50 lbs) loaded on a cross member 3ft above where the pipe is mounted to the trailer.  If you brake hard and decelerate at 20ft/s^2, I figure that's 100lbs * 20ft/s^2 = 2000 lbs of force.  Let's assume this is distributed to the 4 pipes equally (uh, yeah).  That's just under the load rating of each pipe (521 vs 500).  

For now, ignore what I'm ignoring. Do I even have the units right here?  Is the force I calculated comparable to the weight in that Pipe Loading Table?  

My gut reaction is that the design looks really deficient. I'm actually looking at racks for surf boards so the weights will be lighter and the required height will be a lot lower.  Oh, and I'd join the two racks and brace the legs.  Of course, towing any trailer is probably horribly dangerous. But, I would like the rack to to survive if I slammed on the brakes.

Facilities intern here.

We're expanding our paint line, so our steam usage is going to increase. My boss tasked me with finding out how much of an increase in natural gas usage we'd experience if we need to add an additional 5000 lb/hr of steam.

Our four boilers are identical models and rated at about 85% efficient. They have a combined max output of 8280 lb/hr of steam. I tracked the feedwater gallon meter, but I don't have any means of tracking blowdown. So I really just found how much our gas increases if our water increases.

Is there a rough estimate percentage I can go off of to give me how much steam is produced out of feedwater? So far I found that if our feedwater usage increases by 5000 lb/hr of water, our gas will increase by 8.25 MBtu/hr. I'm assuming that this number might be way off if only a certain percentage of that feedwater is actually being converted into steam.

20,[Rant] Is engineering just sitting behind the desk and being told what to do?,1447246681,"Throwaway time!

**tl;dr**: My job mechanical engineering job has been nothing more than sitting behind the desk and being told what to do, and as the only engineer in our engineering department I'm easily sidelined as the majority of the tasks are sent to the draftsmen. The remainder of my job is reading rules and regulation books for construction, there's no fun in designing or solving problems like I expected it to be. However, I have recently passed the FE and got my EIT certificate with my home state and plan on beginning a job hunt again.

I've been working as an mechanical engineer for over a year now for a small company in a small engineering department, and I'm starting to wonder if this is really for me. All my life I've wanted to get into the STEM fields, as a kid I used to picture myself designing and discovering new things, and in high school I fell in love with physics. I went to college debating between a physics or engineering degree and ultimately settled on a degree in mechanical engineering, now I've been working as a mechanical engineer for over a year and I've never been so unsure of myself until now.

I do think my situation could be an exception to the rule, which is why I've come here. I went into engineering to develop solutions to interesting problems and design things (I've realized since beginning that I like designing systems over components too) but at my current company I'm the only engineer in my office and a few draftsmen (we do have another one, but he's the manager and is always busy doing management stuff), and then there's me. You'd think that I'd have a lot of fun being the only guy calling the shots in my specialty, but since all the engineering work is contracted out here I'm on here for on site consulting, meanwhile the draftsmen are actually busier than me doing as builds and doing design proposals. 80% of my time I'm sitting at my desk being told to interpret rules and regulations from regulatory agencies, that's it. So it's really easy to feel sidelined here.

On top of that all, one aspect I've really began to dislike is lack of interaction with others. I identify as an introvert, but I still like talking with others, hell my last job I was a manager of a two story dining hall with 25 employees a shift on campus and it was the best job I've ever worked. Now my job forces me to work alone on everything I do which is super taxing on my brain, and being detached from the rest of the main office doesn't give me an excuse to go to the break room and talk to others not working on engineering or design (I have nothing against my coworkers, in fact I think they're great, but every day it's just the same faces over and over again I need verity). Working alone has also made me more unsure of my skills than anything I've done before.

I did get my EIT certification so I can make myself more valuable to employers and I plan on starting a job hunt again, but if engineering is just sitting behind a desk all day and being told what to do then I have second thoughts if this is really what I want to do for the rest of my life. I want something that allows me to work with other people on coming to a solution to an interesting problem, not this.

23,Career Advise for Junior Petroleum Engineer,1447232792,"Hey guys I'm a PETE major in the first semester of my junior year seeking some serious advice. I'm having a mid college crisis if there's such a thing. My major GPA is a 3.8 and overall is a 3.2 at a pretty good program. Entering college I thought that would be good enough to get a job. I had field camp with a service company sophomore year, but didn't get any interviews this semester. My predicament is whether or not its too late in the game to change majors (either chemical or mechanical) because I'm taking out so much already in loans for out of state tuition. If I finish out and stick with it will put me at about 50K. Switching majors now would probably keep me in school for another 3 years! I'm not sure I am comfortable with that kind of debt which is why I'm leaning towards sticking it out and finish my degree. 

Do you guys have any recommendations on other jobs that i could apply for? I plan on applying to as many engineering internships as possible(even if they don't specify as usually taking petroleum). Is it even possible for a petroleum engineer to get a job in any downstream/midstream operations? I am actually genuinely interested in a career in the oil and gas industry and would hate to graduate after putting in all this time and work to have what some people tell me may a be a ""useless"" degree as far as getting hired with this major downturn.

43,Getting position with Runge-Kutta question,1447137350,"I'm working on a project to numerically integrate the equations of motion for a 3-body orbital mechanics problem. I was given a matlab code to convert to C which was updating the position of the spacecraft by using Runge-Kutta. Specifically it calculates the velocity like so    

    r_dot = r0_dot+(1/6).*(K1+2*K2+2*K3+K4);    

then updates the position in the same iteration like so

    r = r0 + step*r0_dot + (step/6).*(K1+K2+K3);


I haven't been able to find any information online about this. Everything that I do find is unrelated because it assumes you know the acceleration AND velocity equations. I'm not very experienced with numerical integration but understand it. Does anyone know what this position update relation is? Is it legit? From trying it out by double integrating cos(t) it seems pretty inaccurate. With an initial value of t = 0 and position = -1, numerically integrating with cos(t) at 3.2 is 0.987 but at t = 2.7 it was at it's peak of 1.11067.

If you haven't checked it out yet, it's worth a read, and shout out to /u/audentis for organizing it.

This thread is the third in a series for engineers to talk about their work. Today's is for all the Civil, Structural, Fire Protection/Safety (FPE), and Mechanical/Electrical/Plumbing (MEP) engineers!

The two previous threads, for Mechanical and Aerospace engineers, are still open for responses — check below for links.

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**



### Timeframe

*(Skip this section if you don't care about how these posts are organized.)*

Unlike the original posts which only lasted 1 week per discipline, these will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted &amp; stickied, but the old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Once all the disciplines have been covered, a final thread will be posted with links to all of them to collect any more responses until archived. The current list of disciplines:

1. [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3nhwu1/call_for_mechanical_engineers_talk_about_your/) - still open for responses!

### Questions

To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions asked by students as writing prompts. You don't have to answer every question, and how detailed your answers are is up to you. Feel free to add any info you think is helpful!

    * What inspired you to become a Civil / Structural / Fire Protection / MEP Engineer?

    * Why did you choose your field and/or specialization?

    * What’s a normal day like at work for you? Can you describe your daily tasks?

    * What school did you attend, and why should I go there?

    * What’s your favorite project you worked on in college or during your career?

    * If you could do it all over again, would you do anything differently?

    * Do you have any advice for someone who's just getting started in engineering school/work?

62,How to keep a horizontal plate level with gravity,1447090742,"A small part of a project I'm working on requires a horizontal plate to be kept level WRT gravity while a robot carries it around on an uneven surface.

I have been looking into building an automated tripod that uses 3 linear actuators to control the plate, but that is looking like a difficult solution to implement. 

I have also considered a passive system with a gimbal and counter balance, but I don't know if that would cut it. 

Is there something I could buy for a few hundred dollars to do this for me? Or is there a simpler solution to the tripod I could build on my own

I'm working on a project that I'll be looking into installing a 350kW Gen onto the rooftop of a private building. The building in question is sandwhiched by two residential buildings. My supervisor metioned to me there is a regulation that the distance from a window in the residential to any sort of equipment needs to be around 15' away from the residential. Of course we are worried about the dimensional and structural weight that this generator will add on to the building and we will be addressing that after.

In the meantime I was asked to verify the regulation referring to ICC 2009 and I'm having some trouble finding anything that specific. Can anyone point to the correct ICC 2009 book to reference or perhaps the correct subreddit to post this? I would greatly appreciate it.

My name is Alex (nice to meet you). I'm doing a project with a research institute that has developed a Fluidic Actuator for Active Flow Control and I need some help. I need to find some other potential applications for it and I thought that because you guys span all kinds of industries you could help me out.

Details of device:
They are compact, but size can range (smallest is about 2cm thick and 5x5 cm sides)
They generate momentum without mass-flux
They suck in and eject air in an oscillating manner, driven by the oscillation of a transducer
Require between 2 and 10 Watts to be powered
Up to 150 m/s velocity of ejected air (not the smallest one, though)
Nozzle can be placed on any side of the device

So far, I have investigated the following:
Active Flow Control for Aircraft, Cars and Windmills
Electronics Cooling
Drone Flight Stabilisation

Any new ideas would be of great help. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer. I really appreciate any help provided.

Thank you,

Just to let you know my domain of study is computer science so my physics skills are St college level and on top of that I've only been good at electricity related stuff. 

Some basic information that I consider useful:
Diameter of skateboard wheel: 80mm
Weigth of skateboard: 5kg
My weight: 90kg

Main requirements would be for the setup to fit underneath the board( about 5-10 cm)  and have a decent range.

I do not know what performance I can expect from an air vane motor and even if I can manage to squeeze some performance out of it...how fast would it chew through the compressed air? 

Another ideea I am considering is using the motor as a regenerative brake that would push air back into the air tank when needed.

88,Do people who don't have 'the knack' or who aren't passionate about engineering do as well as those who do/are?,1447009103,"I have a number of friends going into engineering because of the pay. 

Many of my friends doing engineering have had 'the knack' (for taking things apart and tinkering) for most of their teenage years, whether it be radios, computers, software or in the case of my girlfriend's older brother - his rubiks cube (to file the corners down and lubricate the internals for quicker performance). Yet some of my friends from secondary school who don't have a passion or even interest for many areas of engineering are doing it solely for job security. They are smart guys, but I was wondering if people like that do well in the long run or get the exciting jobs. I was just curious.

I am not doing engineering or anything remotely related at university, but I am interested in technology as a layman, and find it hard to fathom that top engineering firms want anyone who is anything less than passionate and engaged in their field - especially with the growing supply of engineers in most international markets. 

The main reason I ask the question is that a friend of mine asked me why I was pursuing my degree. I told him it is because I was passionate about the field and I that I had a good idea of how I am going to use it to get a job. He seemed puzzled as to why I didn't choose an 'easier' route into work like engineering or CS. When I explained that I wanted to work in a non-STEM related industry- he thought of my remark as foolish. He went on to say that anyone who is reasonably good at maths is doing themselves a disservice by not pursuing a degree in an engineering related field. We both go to quite well ranking British universities, and I found his comment largely unfounded. I felt kind of sad he wasn't doing something he was passionate about.

I would imagine the most successful engineers are passionate, or at least those who are interested in their field. 

And what about those who lack 'the knack'? I could learn mathematical concepts like differential equations with hard work (as could most reasonably intelligent people), but I thought the nuts and bolts of most engineering fields is the curiosity to tinker and experiment with making things more efficient/less shit. I was also under the impression that the advanced maths itself isn't used on a daily basis in the majority of engineering jobs and that computers did most of the computing - and it is the decision making and technical aptitude that make the engineer. 


Sorry to ask a question as a layman, but I just wanted to know whether those who aren't engineers by nature/character/passion end up doing as well as those who are, especially when they are in it primarily for the good pay (which isn't as true in the UK as they seem to think it is.)",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/3s1980/do_people_who_dont_have_the_knack_or_who_arent/

He believes that turbocharges do not in practice make a small engine more efficient than a larger one. Additionally he believes that the back pressure created by turbocharging an engine is substantial and worth considering when evaluating the turbo's overall efficiency.

I disagree with all his points, mostly that the turbocharger requires any meaningful amount of engine power to run. Yes, routing exhaust gasses through a turbo is less optimal than though a well designed header, but I maintain that the power lost due to the turbo's exhaust wheel is minimal, perhaps in the range of 1-2 HP. I believe it is likely within the margin of error when measuring engine power output in the real world.

I did and found that I really liked Environmental Engineering and sustainability. However, the thing I most enjoyed is when I was using math in creative and challenging ways in my major. (Heck, multi-order differential equations was my favorite course as an undergrad.) I want to focus my career on these analytical and numerical methods in environmental contexts. I know I can get into the Environmental Engineering program at the school and since it has financial aid this would be the least risk option for me. My background is after all in Environmental Engineering. However, I really do want to learn more math (for enjoyment/curiosity and math is my favorite subject still) and applying to the math program will solve this passion of mine that I couldn't quite obtain as as undergraduate. However, the computational math masters at this university has less funding/financial aid for masters, and my background, since it's not in applied math, does not make me a totally strong applicant. I also like the idea of having Applied Math as a Masters as it would provide breadth in my background as well as diverse skills that will obviously help in the future. 
  
So, there's the dilemma. I would greatly appreciate if you all had time to weigh on this. I'm going back and forth but I ultimately have to decide very soon.

we think its because the lighting we don't get anything

9,"Advice needed for finding a job in Alberta, Canada as a newly immigrated Provisional Engineer with 30+ years of international experience.",1446916831,"**tl;dr:** 30+ years of engineering experience, moved to Canada, having trouble finding a job. Issues primarily regarding best level to apply to, and seeking any other advice (or leads or jobs \**wink wink*\*) that you may have.

-------

Hello! I am a new immigrant to Canada, and I am a civil engineer, with lots of experience in structures and project management, among other things. I had more than 30 years of experience in many countries and climates around the world, but none yet in Canada. Obviously, I built everything according to local (and occasionally foreign) building codes and regulations.

A few months ago, I did pass the NPPE (National Professional Practice Exam) with APEGA, the licensing and regulating body for engineering in my province. Because of the experience, they let me become a Provisional Engineer. This license is valid for one year; I would still need one more year of professional engineering experience in Canada, under the auspices of a licensed professional engineer, before I can become a Professional Engineer myself.

I tried applying for many jobs, but haven't had any luck yet. I see many openings, but I am not sure at which level I need to apply. Here are the options:

* **Entry level:** From the responses that I do get to my applications, I seem to be overqualified for entry level jobs. On the other hand, I do not have any Canadian experience, so I don't have any workplace exposure to national and provincial standards. (I am currently studying those on my own, though. I'm pretty sure I should have no problems with that since I've juggled many countries' regulations for a long time.) 

* **Intermediate level:** I might be slightly overqualified, but I am not sure about that. Low responses overall. Most applications to intermediate happened before I became a Provisional Engineer, and they obviously couldn't accept me back then.

* **Senior level:** Would that even be an option for me? I need to have an engineering supervisor, and I would not be able to sign off of anything. I don't think it's *impossible* to find an arrangement where the person in management is also an engineer (I am one myself, as a director of a company), and yet still takes time to personally check over design and drawings to sign them off. Maybe there could be an advanced role, with an engineer close to retirement who would teach the ropes? I don't know. What do you guys think?

I'm not getting many replies from prospective employers, though. I have worked with immigrant centres and employment offices in my city, and have worked hard to get many relevant courses qualifications (like project management) as well. I've been using sites like Indeed.ca, too.

What do you think are good ways to search for engineering jobs, especially at higher levels? (I am fine with anywhere in the country.) Any recommendations or protips?

Is there anything useful I could prepare myself for since this is an all day thing? I feel pretty prepared for behavioral/STAR questions and that they are also looking for a good personality fit, so far. I know ~$1k is nothing for a big corporation, but is there any significance I could read into me going out for a third round?

Its one part electrical and one part pumping. all parts have me stumped.,1446777750,"I just started working for a pumping company here in toronto and was called out for a service call today to try and troubleshoot the issue. I was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on some troubleshooting things I could investigate into because I'm pretty stumped. 

  So its a 125 HP 600 V motor FLA 115A on a GLOBAL pump. It has a ABB Soft starter electronic control panel on it that reads and displays the amperage and voltage. Fed off a 500KW generator and  it has an 8"" hose into a pond. 
  So the motor kicks on in hand. Amps go up and level out on start up ' normal' . Then we open up the primer to create vaccuum pressure to start pulling water from the pond 'normal'.  starts building vacuum more and more until VVVVRRRRRRRWHAM!The motor begins to shake violently as the water head slams into the impeller. Suddenly now everything starts going crazy. Amps go up and then come down a little but then go up again and down a little and it just keeps fluctuating. Voltage doing the same thing. It spikes (on the electronic controller) as high as 200 Amps and then drops as low as 20. Same with voltage, up to like 800V to as low as 200V. Back and forth violently until the contactor begins chattering and the control fully drops out. No fuses blow or overload trips. The pressure on the Primer goes crazy too right up and straight down. But the odd thing is the pressure on the line out stays the same thing. So the voltage in at no load is fine at 347 per phase and 580 something. So I can't figure it out.
  I should be looking more into it in the future but I need some tips on what to try for troubleshooting next time. The in rush of current when the water hits the impeller is normal but instead of holding the pressure and leveling out it goes crazy. The pipe is clear too.

 I'll try to post a video next time I'm working at and will try to answer any questions you might have for me. Thanks for any help 


*edit. So we had our engineer out there Friday and apparently they got it running by closing the discharge line again and letting the system prime way more and then slowly open it. Now he's saying there's a problem with the phase voltage and one of the lines is  dropping out. The pump had done that before when we had tested it. But now I'm starting to suspect something may have been damaged in the generator from all this crazy power fluctuation. Because even when it had done it before we were still able to regain normal voltage after it was shut down. 
One other thing.  It's an ABB soft starter there was a guy there when we were troubleshooting saying the soft starter should have an internal contact that should pull in when fully primed. Problem is we never hear that. Don't know if that's a programming issue or a faulty soft starter. ...?

What I'd imagine the avionics system to be organized is by having a ""master"" computer that handles the mission/flight plan. The destination is at coordinates X,Y and the path that it needs to take is these list of procedures. At time t, the velocity and bearing should be V and theta at altitude h. Then that information gets relayed to another set of computers that consist of computers that control the control surfaces, another for the engines and fuel systems. And those sets of controllers delegate tasks to another set of controllers for each wing and engine with settings like thrust and net bearing. Then those controllers then calculate and delegate the angles and speeds that each actuator needs to be at to achieve those settings. And then each actuator is coupled with a sensor and computer to perform closed loop control to those targeted angles and speeds. And at each level, there would be some sensors that validate the state of the system and act accordingly to mitigate any issues.

The generator is 3 phase permanent magnet AC with 3 unidentified green wires coming out of it. These connect to a AC/DC bridge rectifier. From the rectifier the plan is to add a charge controller, and 12v car battery. I guess I have 2 questions:

1. How to I determine the wiring of the 3 generator wires to the 3  wires on the rectifier? Both sets are unmarked. Does the order matter?

2. Does a ground have to be included in the circuit? Does the generator itself have to be grounded and if so how? ",AskEngineers,McTech0911,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3rnjkc/question_about_grounding_a_pm_3phase_generator/

49,What's your go-to for locking down a ribbon cable?,1446741376,"We use these[ 2mm ribbon cable](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/TCSD-05-D-12.00-01-N/SAM8532-ND/1106670) headers that are fairly small all around. Occasionally, they like to pop out when the board is under vibration and mounted sideways/upside down. For vibration critical parts, we use locking connectors, but these are on standard products that don't have the luxury of space for the bigger locking connectors.

We've tossed around the idea of gluing them down, but that makes them permanent and even damages them thanks to the chemical process for some adhesives. I've been trying to find a product that can 'seal' the ribbon down without being permanent or disruptive to the PCB layout, but I've come up empty so far.

Does anyone have any good suggestions that might work? The biggest restriction is serviceability, we need to be able to remove it if something goes wrong without damaging the boards.

I work for an engineering firm doing some simple electrical design work, I'm the lowest level of engineer here in terms of seniority. About a year ago I got my PE for personal aspiration reasons and haven't used it in the true sense, and so haven't received any salary boost or promotion.  
  
Recently I've been asked if I would stamp some designs (not my project). The principal guy who used to do it has retired and there isn't anyone currently who is able to approve these and finding someone would cause a delay in the project.  
  
I feel this is unfair to me because it is not my job to take on this liability especially because I'm such a low level guy and it is not within my job scope. So I need some advice on how best to approach this:  
  
1. Should I go ahead and review designs for approval but immediately ask for a promotion to an appropriate level within my company (renegotiate salary, etc.) because I may be the sole PE for a while?  
  
2. Refuse and walk away?

64,Is a progressive cavity pump curve like a centrifugal pump curve?,1446680316,"Alright, I would like some clarification. I know a centrifugal pump curve the frictional losses in the system dictate the discharge pressure and flow. 

So for example, I have a discharge pressure of 60 psi and 4 gal/min. If I increased discharge pressure without increasing system head loss, I would get increased flow. 

Now then, lets say I do this for a progressive cavity pump. I increase the discharge pressure without changing the system. I would get increased flow at 60 psi, correct?

So, for another example. Lets say my pc discharge pressure is 60 psi at 4 gal/min doing 900 rpm/min. It has a gear ratio of 2:1 and is hooked to a motor that does 1800 rpm at 60 hz. 

I decide to go with a gear reducer of 1:1. I desire to keep the same flow rates. What will happen?

1. Will the motor reduce hertz to 30, and the pump maintain the same discharge pressure and flow at 900 rpm?

2. if the motor hertz stay at 60, will the pump produce 4 gal/min at 120 psi at 1800 rpm?

I am thinking of making clocks as a hobby, figure it would be fun.  But I am having a little trouble understanding how the pendulum of a weight clock receives energy to counteract the force or friction.

all the videos and text I have read state the pendulum is what keeps the time.  that part I understand. what I don't understand is how it keeps a periodic motion.  I know that it is receiving energy some how form the hanging weights.  now if I get it this right (for a very simple set up, ignoring the gear trains, i just want to get how the energy flows figured out), you have the weights that are the energy storage thanks to gravity. they are attacked to the entrapment gear? via a pulling. so if nothing stops the entrapment gear it will just spin wildly out of control.  to stop that you have a ratchet? that is attached to a pendulum, as the pendulum swings it will move the ratchet to allow one tooth of the gear to move per 1/2 oscillation. 

Now how does the pendulum get energy form the hanging weight to counter act the force of friction?  the the ratchet part transmit the the force of the hanging weights as the pendulum swings? so as the pendulum is swinging to release a tooth, the weights add a little ""push"" to the ratchet that then transmits that to the pendulum? if that is the case then the design of the ratchet is very important.

Here’s what I’m working on: https://imgur.com/gallery/H35OdUC . I’m trying to make the large center gear spin the side gears to a limited extent (hence the slider which only allows so much movement).

The following are a given:

* 1 central gear; 8 side gears…hence the number of teeth on the central gear must be divisible by 8.
* The side gears must not touch one another…hence they cannot be too large.
* The side gears are docked to specific midpoints (i.e., to spin poles underneath).

**Given these parameters, how do I calculate the following?:**

* Desired gear ratio
* Number of teeth on both central and side gears (ul)
* Diametral pitch (ul/in)
* Center distance
* Pressure angle
* Helix angle
* Total unit correction for both central and side gears

I’ve tried fudging the numbers myself but clearly they are not working. Screenshot of my attempt + error message (something related to the unit correction) [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/5Dl2dcu).

99,Air cooled heat exchanger sizing and pressure drop correlations,1446568665,"Hello,

I'm trying to size an 18 kW air cooled heat exchanger (HX) that needs to be mounted on a truck. The HX obviously has very tight space requirements and mass requirements (1 x 1m face area, 0.2m depth and max 60-70kg). In addition to the physical requirements, I also have a very tough power budget in terms of parasitics (max 0.6 kW for blower fans). 

Blower fan power is the most powerful factor driving the design optimization. I obviously want to keep size and mass to a minimum but I must have a sufficiently large face area to keep the pressure drop/fan power down. I am trying to find a good correlation for the air side pressure drop as I want to double check the values that I've already calculated. 

I have found several different friction factor correlations online and in books for my configuration but they can differ by a factor of 10 depending on which one I used and so the overall fan power requirement is extremely wide depending on what I use. This is the key factor driving the overall design so I have to be sure that I am within say 30% of a believable value.

Framing the subfloor has me flummoxed, as does the framing for the sides and roof. Initially I was going to use steel studs anchored to the subfloor, then rivet insulated fabric panels over that... But it seems like that might be a bit heavy. Would aluminum tube construction be better? Could it be bolted rather than welded without overly compromising strength? The cab-over bit is only meant to hold my battery rack and some ventilation equipment rather than people, so I'm debating between using a cantilever or traditional support struts to support it. 


Also, exactly how to build the subfloor isn't totally clear in the materials I've been able to find. I'm shooting for a footprint that extends off the sides and back of the truck bed, and I'll most likely build it directly over the stripped-down bed rails instead of over the standard truck bed. Should I lay down a plywood bed and build joists over that? What about protection against water or insect ingress?

11,New manufacturing engineer in a company experiencing growing pains.,1446515836,"Hi reddit,

I just graduated with a biomedical/mechanical engineering degree I've now been working for a year at a small 20 person factory as a manufacturing engineer in training. I've been learning a lot and I've been given a lot of projects. However I've noticed that most of our mechanical manufacturing fixtures, processes, fixes, and manufacturing-related designs are put together with almost no calculation or formal design. 

The current manufacturing engineer who is gradually retiring is very creative and bright, but relies on tinkering and hand building things. He then tries it out and sees if it works without recording his results or analyzing them beyond what he sees with his eyes. He does use SolidWorks to model our actual products and a machinist for some product parts, but not for anything else manufacturing related. This may be because he only had some formal electrical engineering schooling and almost no mechanical schooling. 

I understand that work is not like school and that calculations, statistics, and theory can be unnecessary or overkill, but should I be worried about a complete absence of this? Is this normal for manufacturing engineering? We often have failures with new fixes and fixtures that seem like they could have been avoided with some calculation beforehand and/or analysis afterwards.

This factory has grown quickly from a startup of about 5 people and 1 product to 20 people plus a product design team based elsewhere and 5 products. Leadership is eager to grow and they understand that many things have to change. We are already experiencing growing pains in documentation and testing. I am already starting to work with them on implementing a PLM system and mature some of our protocols. Should I also be worried about the manufacturing engineering process? If so, as an inexperienced and very new engineer can I hope to build the department into what this company needs gradually from what I learned in school and as I gain experience? If so, aside from trial and error do you have any recommended resources? Courses, books, seminars, etc? Do I just need to push harder for another more experienced manufacturing engineer?

I really like working at this company. The products are interesting, the people are great, and management is willing to evolve. 

TLDR: The factory I work at is struggling to move from a small startup that Macgyvers everything to a factory that can output substantial and consistent quantities of 5+ different products as well as provide servicing. How can I help?

I was talking to my friend the other day about the good old days of dial-up modem and I got to thinking about how everytime someone would pick up the phone at my house when someone was online, the computer would disconnect not more than a couple seconds later, even if the person hung up right away without saying anything or dialling.  My friend couldn't remember whether the same thing would happen to him. 

Was this just something that was localized to my phone system/computer or model of modem?  My thinking is that it's because of the noise/garbage introduced into the packets to/from the ISP/computer, which would be totally understandable if someone picked up the phone and attempted to dial right away or in a loud room.  Since the internet signal isn't on a different ""channel"" as the voice signal, I'd imagine both the computer and the ISP would have trouble decoding what they're hearing. 

But is simply having the phone off the hook in a reasonably quiet room enough to bring the noise level to the point where the internet signal degrades so much that it just automatically disconnects?  In both of these cases was this considered an issue with the noise floor drowning out the signal or was it that the bandwidth of the voice signal from the phone was overtaking the bandwidth of the internet signal or causing enough distortion to it to render it useless?  If that's the case, how much distortion could a broadband signal take before the same thing happens?

So I want to make a decorative set of legs for the drinking horn. They will dangle as decoration when not in use, possibly held against the horn with magnets for convenience.

Obviously a human brain can write, improve, and tell when code will halt so is this a sort of ""loophole"" since the simulated brain is technically an AI that's running on turing machines (the chips simulating the neurons).

# The problem

Hi,

I got my hands on a really nice car lift, unfortunately the manufacturer has gone out of business and with it almost all information about the lift including installation instructions.

The lift is a [Ford Smith TEC-9A](http://i.imgur.com/T9igpkN.jpg). It consists of two column with hydraulic cylinders, the two towers are not physically connected except by an hydraulic hose.

According to the seller, it will lift 9000lbs which is more than anything I plan to put on it.

My main concern at this point is safely anchoring the column in concrete. I think I have found the strongest method of anchoring.

What I'm asking here is a ""second opinion"" to make sure my math checks out and if anyone can't point an error in my reasoning or calculations.

Thanks.

# The lift and wedgeall anchors

[So here is the base plate of the columns.](http://i.imgur.com/HxUyFnT.png)

Each columns has 6, 3/4"" diameter holes for anchors. The most commonly used anchor type is called a ""[wedge all](http://i.imgur.com/lQtzOxJ.jpg)"".

The principal loading mode will be in tension with almost negligible shear loads. The wedge all anchors 3/4"" [according to this table](http://www.strongtie.com/products/anchorsystems/mechanical/wedge-all/loads_carbonsteeltension.html) are good for an allowable load of 2510 load in tension (safety factor of 4.0). That is in 2000 psi concrete.

I am pretty sure I have 4000 psi concrete but no economical way to test and no record from when this slab was poured back in 2010. I am going to assume the lowest grade available of concrete, so 2000 psi. I am also going to assume an embed dept of 6 inches.

The wedgeall anchors have to be de-rated when they are used close to one another. There are [six holes in the base](http://i.imgur.com/8GUWD2D.png) however I believe that the 4 outward holes are the only ones that will see any loading.

The holes are spaced 6 inch then 7 inch then 6 inch. I asked Simpson engineers and they told me that de-rating adds up if multiple anchors are near one another.

The de-rating is done [according to this chart](http://www.strongtie.com/products/anchorsystems/mechanical/wedge-all/loads_adj_spacingtens.html).

# Wedgeall tension load rating

Each anchor is 6 inch from another anchor so de-rating is 0.87.

2510 lbs allowable in 2000 psi * 0.87 = 2183.7

+2510 lbs allowable in 2000 psi * 0.87 = 2183.7

+2510 lbs allowable in 2000 psi * 0.87 = 2183.7

+2510 lbs allowable in 2000 psi * 0.87 = 2183.7

Total allowable tension load = 8734 lbs for car lift industry standard wedgeall.

# Special requirement, must be easily removable 

Now I have a special installation requirement of being able to remove the car lift without leaving anything that sticks out of the floor and then to be able to re-install the lift in the same spot without making new holes in the concrete.

For that reason, I can't use wedgealls.  I checked out the rest of Simpson's product line up and the only product that had equal or better performance while being removable, was the Simpson Titen HD anchor.

So I did the calculations again for this type of anchor.

[Simpson Titen HD 3/4"", 8"" long anchor, tension load table](http://www.strongtie.com/products/anchorsystems/mechanical/titen-hd/loads_conc_tension.html) 

Each anchor has an allowable tension load of 3440 lbs.

[Derating table](http://www.strongtie.com/products/anchorsystems/mechanical/titen-hd/loads_adj_spacing.html) 

6 inch spacing de-rate is 0.81 and 7 inch spacing is 0.84

Calculating... 

# Simpson titen hd anchor tension load rating

3440 lbs allowable in 2000 psi * 0.81 = 2786.4

+ 3440 lbs allowable in 2000 psi * 0.81 * 0.84 = 2340.576

+ 3440 lbs allowable in 2000 psi * 0.81 * 0.84 =  2340.576

+ 3440 lbs allowable in 2000 psi * 0.81 = 2786.4

Total allowable tension load = 10253 lbs for simpson titen hd 3/4"" with 6"" embedment

So I have my easy removal requirement filled in and a 25% boost in load capacity relative to industry standard, great !

Now I want to calculate the actual tension load that my lift will apply with a 9000 lbs car lifted to the maximum height.

# Actual forces on anchor

I'm not really sure how to calculate this. Nominally, a 9000 lbs vehicle should exert 4500 lbf of downward for on each column. However the center of gravity is not aligned with the tower's center of gravity so I think that the base plate is actually seeing a torque with the entire column as a lever.

[So I think it is something like this](http://i.imgur.com/HsHcV63.png)

And the torque on the baseplate is [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/0dbGRDZ.png)


So I would have a 77 inch (max lifting height) lever and the car is applying 4500 lbf of force on the fulcrum at the base of the column. The four load bearing anchors are about 12 inch from the fulcrum .

4500 pounds times 6.41 foot =  28875 foot pounds

Since the second lever is one foot, then the pull out force is 28'875 pounds ?

That seems very very high, in fact it seems higher than the allowable tension load for any concrete anchor system.

# Conclusion

I suspect that my calculation is exaggerating the loads that are put on the columns. There probably is a large component of the force that is still purely downwards and another fraction that is ""sideways"". My calculation is putting 100% of the force as sideways but I have no idea how to determine how much of the force is downward (and therefore exerting no pull out force on the anchors).

At any rate the 28'875 lbs figure is still only 70% of the ultimate strength of the anchors. I don't really want to go below the 4.0 safety factor though so I could de-rate the entire lift to a meager 3150 lbs. That would suck as it would not be enough to lift my heaviest vehicle (f-150 2003 v8 4.6 auto supercrew 4758 lbs).

# The question TL:DR version

Am I calculating the allowable load rating properly for titen HD anchors. (I think yes, 10253 lbs ?)

Am I calculating the forces on those anchors properly ? (I think no, 28'875 lbs seems too much)

Am I forgetting something else ?

Any comments welcome !

During the course of quoting and building the prototype, the vendor offered a few suggestions on how to reduce cost. (I'm not completely on board with all of the suggestions. I suspect the vendor lacks the capability to make the product as it was originally designed, and suggested at least some of these changes to suit himself.)    

Recently, one of my colleagues who has worked closely with this vendor in the past, said that we now have an ""ethical obligation"" to place the production order with this vendor.  Because the vendor provided ""valuable design input"". He went on to insist that we must make that vendor the sole source, and not even to get quotes from other vendors.  ""Because it's below the target cost and it's a qualified vendor.""  

I certainly never promised the vendor any future work based on this prototype.  His quote for the prototype and the PO I sent are clear on that.

76,"How to ""fix"" Toilet Flappers in a low-pressure system.",1446225037,"Setting: Haiti
Problem: Low pressure (gravity fed) system, probably in the 3-4 psi range, tend to have insufficient force to close the flapper properly, leading to lots of leakage and wasted water.

Hypothesis:
Flappers seem to be in place as a time-delay mechanism to ensure the toilet gets sufficient water to flush, correct?
So, if we were to weight the flapper, it would shorten the delay, but it would also provide better sealing...
Therefore, I would think that a toilet with a weighted flapper would simply need the user to hold the handle until the toilet flushes properly before releasing, which could be as simple as putting up a sign.

I have a 12v DC (4 amp) submersible bilge pump which I am wanting to use for a spa project. The idea is to pump water through a copper coil in order to heat it, and then deposit it into a small pool/pond. In order to effectively heat the water to the desired temperature it would be great if I could control the flow rate of the pump. I have looked around online and have seen that a PWM module might do the job (some verification or better alternatives would be helpful). I have found a PWM module on ebay that is rated to 12-40v and 10 amps, will this be suitable for use with my 4 amp pump or not? Is 10 amps its max input or will it damage the pump if its used.

86,Heat Transfer on Insulated Piping?,1446163702,"Hi,

I'm having some trouble understanding heat transfer on an insulated pipe and wondering if somebody can help (other resources online are just confusing me more).

I understand the Fourier equation rearranges to **Q=((2*pi*kpipe*L)(ti-to))/(ln(ri/ro))**,

where i=inside and o=outside (so that ti=temperature inside pipe and ro=outer radius of pipe), and kpipe is the thermal conductivity of the pipe.

What happens when I add insulation to the pipe? I understand that that adds another radius into the equation, but how is it accounted for?

I have an equation that adds the term ln(ro/rinsulation)/(2*pi*kinsulation*L) to the equation above, where rinsulation is the *inner* radius of the insulation, making the complete equation:

 **Q=((2*pi*kpipe*L)(ti-to))/(ln(ri/ro))+(ln(ro/rinsulation)/(2*pi*kinsulation*L))**

But aren't ro and rinsulation the same, forcing the second term to become zero?

I just need to understand how to account insulation into the situation. The end goal is creating a spreadsheet that will help me easily calculate heat gain in pipes (I've found some online, but they are either overly complicated, or I don't understand them).

Thanks in advance (hope this made sense)!

I'm imagining this would have a lot less wear and maintain similar efficiency, but also know that I am assuming a lot that you can find/create a useful lubricant that would conduct well, that might not be corrosive or have other issues.

Essentially theres a platform that the skydivers would stand on, lifted by a helium balloon, which once the divers have jumped off, has an engine underneath(protected from smashing the ground with its props by 'legs') that pulls it back down to the ground.

My main question is what kind of engine could do this? Let's say the balloon is only taking people up to 10000ft/3500m, this balloon only has to travel that distance back down. 

The balloon would be about the size of a hot air balloon, holding 2000m3 of gas, so about 2tonne of lift. The engine would need to be able to over-come this and some, to get back to the ground.

Is there anything particular 'impossible' or difficult about this design/idea? is an engine that has 2500kg of thrust(or 3000kg of thrust) going to need to be very large? I have found a lot of conflicting results on how many HP = Kg of thrust. 

Thanks for any help! This idea is to help make skydiving a more accessible activity by reducing cost, as planes/pilots/runways/fuel/maintenance end up costing the end user a lot of money to do something that, I'm sure can be done a lot cheaper.

Since we are working within a closed system, the exiting fluid will be pumped into a high pressure container, let's say 7000 psi. Eventually this will lead to some pretty crazy pressure ratios, and we have limited horsepower for our pump. 

Can anyone recommend a good pump for the job, or a creative solution for doing this? Thanks!",AskEngineers,space-buddha,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3qm6os/high_pressure_ratio_pumping/

19,I have a few questions about this very basic circuit- can anybody help?,1446061638,"Here is an [Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/Zd6kX) of the circuit.

I understand there to be a DC motor, small rechargeable battery, a slide-able switch with distinct ""on"" &amp; ""off"", a resister in series with the LEDs, 3 LEDs and a *mystery component*. The circuit came from a [crank powered torch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003KGB992?ref_=pe_1909131_77697001_tnp_email_TE_AMZLdp_1) that I disassembled- I had to break it open as the screws were seemingly glued in... weird, I know. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyhow, I was hoping that there would be someone out there capable of helping me to decipher essentially **a)** a circuit diagram (I've taken an educated guess), **b)** what the extra component is (voltage regulator?) and **c)** hopefully clarify that this is indeed a DC motor (it may be a dyno judging by the product name on amazon). 

&amp;nbsp;

It looks to me that the switch is dictating whether there is a complete circuit which connects either the LEDs to the DC generator **OR** the battery to the DC generator. However, my lack of understanding of the ""mystery component"" is causing me to be a little confused- what part does it play? I'm guessing its a voltage regulator which ensures that although the generator will produce an unsteady, potentially high, voltage due to the nature of human power, the voltage within the circuit will never exceed the limits of the LEDs/ battery.

I've recently reached a point in my life where I am looking into starting over. I'm looking deeper into mechanical drafting in 3D software as a goal to work towards. I'd like to end up in Architecture or Engineering as a future, and I've a few choice spots I'd be interested in landing. What interests me most is design of aerospace technologies, playground equipment, architectural design, and furniture as well. My thought process is that mastery of the software will lend itself to anything, and it's a matter of study of the actual tenets in designing these things. I am currently proficient in Rhino, a 3D CAD program mostly used for jewelry, fashion, and architecture, but I will need to spend some time solidifying my experience. Even if it takes some time (which is also something I hope to gauge here) I am willing to work tirelessly to achieve my goal. What I am in need of, however, is a general list of steps necessary to actually doing that. I want to get to work, I just don't know what I'll need to do in order to succeed. What makes someone hirable? what makes someone qualified? what certification exists? If I'm designing my own education, what are the areas of study recommended that I take? I have no money for real school, so I was hoping to study from home or online, either gaining knowledge through MITOpenCourseWare or some corollary system. Ideally, I'd like to spend the next year doing as much as humanly possible to devote myself to a new trajectory, and I'm in need of a little help in devising my plan.

22,can any of you help me with my LED light box project?,1446059732,"please^be^gentle


a while ago me and my step dad followed [this](http://www.instructables.com/id/Music-LED-Light-Box/) Instructable to create an LED light box that flashes with music ([here is mine](http://imgur.com/a/9vJ5L)), but as you can see in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPhm8VTCWpg#t=52) video the lights flash when the speakers get power to them, so it flashes to *every* sound the speakers make. which is cool for a slow song, but faster songs become kind of chaotic. thats not exactly what i want, what i want is a box that you can *choose* when the lights light up. for example, i could tell it to only flash with the treble of the song, or with just the bass of the song. i also want to make it to where the lights can flash different colors (RGB LED's) with the sounds, example: i set blue to base and red to treble. so, essentially i want to combine this project with [this](http://imgur.com/a/owrIe) project to create a light box that can be adjusted (light color, light color with bass/treble, brightness, etc.)  through bluetooth with an app.

23,Hardness testing AR500 steel plate. Brinell vs Rockwell C,1446059084,"Here's the breakdown

* I hardness tested some plates with a Rockwell hardness tester setup for the C scale.

* The plates are spec'd to be 470 - 550 Brinell hardness. 500 Brinell = 53 Rockwell C

* Plates measure on average 40 RHC. Far below the miniumum 50 RHC that they should.

* I replicated my results on a second hardness tester just to make sure nothing was off.

24,Bearing and gear choice for rotating knife,1446058659,"Hello,

I'm evaluating how to best build a rotating knife and would love any suggestions on how to do this in the most economical fashion while still allowing functionality.  

[Diagram of my initial design](http://i.imgur.com/hjUErer.jpg)

The knife is driven by a mounted motor, but the blade itself is on a swivel that rotates freely.  The goal is to use a separate stepper motor to control the blade direction using bearings mounted to a small 'bowl' (for lack of a better description) about 4-5"" wide.  My challenge is in figuring out a) what sort of bearing to use to join the 'bowl' to the fixed mount, and b) then how to attach a pulley or similar to use a timing belt to control that rotation.  The hole in the bearing only needs to be wide enough for the knife blade (so 1/2"" is plenty), my diagram shows it as approx 4"" wide but that's not essential.  My only need is that it's wide enough to be stable when I mount the 4"" 'bowl' to it.  I can mount the stepper motor however needed (above, below, or through the mounting plate).  I'd prefer not to have to rotate the whole knife motor, which is why I put the blade on a swivel.

* Thought #1 for bearing options:
http://www.surpluscenter.com/Power-Transmission/Bearings/Flange-Mount-Bearings/3-4-BOLT-FLANGE-BEARING-1-215-48-4.axd

* Thought #2 (a lot cheaper but not sure how I'd attach a gear to it): 
http://www.aliexpress.com/item/free-shipping-4-8-mini-Quiet-and-Smooth-Solid-Home-Hardware-Aluminum-Round-Lazy-Susan-Bearing/32264876601.html

Any thoughts/suggestions on if either of these will work, as well as how to then find a pulley to use in conjunction?  This would be used fairly regularly so I'd like something that's at least moderately durable, ideally a balance between total cost and durability.

There's an ultrasonic sensor that's mounted on the ceiling of the cylinder which can return a dynamic height of the fluid inside the tank.

There is an IR sensor that uses the same ToF principles as the ultrasonic but it's not as reliable due to the refraction of light in the water (let's call this fluid water).

and finally a radar sensor that's basically the same as the ultrasonic.

I have a few ideas for some non-invasive sensors but I don't know which route to go.

One option is using a system of piezoelectric buzzers and transducers/receivers to compare the acoustic impedance of plastic-air and plastic-water, setting a baseline would let me distinguish between the two and I could determine whether the water is up to a certain point (the sensors would be aiming parallel to the tank like this http://www.gemssensors.com.cn/~/media/Images/Operating-principles/ExOsense-OP.ashx?w=342&amp;h=452&amp;as=1)

Inspiration is taken from these desks http://www.retro.net/product-category/office/sit-stand-desks/

Now obviously I am not going to build something that high in quality but I want a similar lift system for my desk. As of right now I am looking into buying two worm gear screw jacks, with couplings and rods to match. The ""I"" layout here is the system I (think) will be building http://jacton-screwjacks.com/uploadfile/2015/0417/20150417033618269.pdf 

Main problem I am having is that everywhere I look for these jacks they are insanely priced cheapest ones being from Joyce Dayton for around $280 per jack. The main reason I believe they are priced this way is because they all have super high weight rating (2.5T being the lowest I can find) Unless I shop through Alibaba which I have found to be a terrible experience and then I get killed on shipping ($67 per jack then $300 shipping). 

A few questions:
A. Am I looking at buying the correct equipment for the job?
B. Is there another mechanical lift system I can look into that doesn't use these types of jacks? Must be mechanical, no electrical linear actuators.
C. Can these jacks be found for a lighter weight rating for a cheaper cost within the United States?

My method is going to be 3D paper design, then reinforce with fiberglass and resin, body filler the outside, smooth out and paint. Still have yet to fully plan the assembly and stuff but right now I'm at the fiberglass stage.

I bought some 150gram mat and some 150gram twill, figured they'd be best for the curvature. Will they be strong enough? I was assuming multiple layers anyway but with it being a suit I wanted to opt for the lighter option.

I also bought a square meter of Carbon Fiber twill, It's about 10-15 times the price so I only got a small amount. (Really I just wanted the experience of using it.) Will the Carbon have to be cured in an autoclave or can it be done at room temp? Strength isn't a real issue..

Any advice on the resins? I got a cheap Epoxy resin for the Fiberglass. Can I use the same resin for Carbon or does it have to be a specific Carbon resin?

The vehicle in question has a snorkel coming from the airbox, reaching into the fender well. This should, in theory, bring colder, denser, air to the engine. It also is on the vehicle to function as an air silencer. 

However, the hole in the end of the snorkel is approximately 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the opening there would be when removed. This ""new"" hole is still fairly close to the fender well, but is more susceptible to sucking hot engine air, which would be less dense.

Removing this snorkel would increase the amount of air that is brought into the engine, but keeping the snorkel would improve the density.

The shock mounts don't have a specific stiffness, however.  The stiffnesses of the shock mounts vary by the amount of load applied to them.

Essentially, we are trying to determine how much of the load goes into each member beneath the coil mounts given a fixed P value.

A 120' pit had to be built/dug to access the cutter head, it was removed, re-engineered and recently put back on. The planned resume date was November 20 something and is not pushed back to December 20 something. The reason given was that it ~~took 2 days to install the cutter head (instead of 1?) and this~~ (this was not correct) was due to a temporary bending/deformation of the cutter head and they want to make sure it gets a good seal. 

I get it, Steal can flex, it is even a desirable trait...but to cause a 30 day delay sounds fishy to me. ~~If it takes 24 hours longer to install the cutter head that doesn't equal 30 days of delay.~~ I am not an engineer so i wanted to ask the pro's. ~~What is your take?

I'm not exactly looking for school advice, I know what I want to study. I'd just like to know what might help my situation easier. I've pasted the text below for your convenience. Thank you in advance for any insight I may get from this subreddit.


Hey guys, new to reddit so forgive me if this isn't the right subreddit for this issue.
I'm a college student studying Computer Engineering. Unfortunately due to average grades during my high school years I wasn't able to get into the school of my choice so I've been going to community college for my Associates Degree. Before enrolling in my first semester I went for course advisement to find out what program I should take since the community college didn't have a Computer Engineering undergraduate program. I was advised to go for an A.A.S. in Electronic Engineering Technology as that was the closest thing to Computer Engineering they had and that after obtaining my Associates Degree I could transfer to my school choice for my Bachelor's in Comp. Engineering (their words). This was almost six years ago. I was awarded some money for the first year so I started off college strong and knocked out a decent chunk of credits in that first year. Unfortunately after that hard financial times hit and I had to start working to support the household. This made going to school extremely difficult since I would be paying out of pocket for classes and I've only done a class here and there with very long intervals in between.



Two years back I was a lot more savvy than I was when I first entered college. Even though I wasn't in college I looked for as much information on the subject of Engineering as I could. I also obtained info as well on transferring schools by speaking with the Head of the Admissions Department at my intended school. I was planning on going back to school at the next available semester so I was on my CC's website and saw that they had an A.S. in Engineering program. I investigated further and saw that this particular program had concentrations in many specialties, including Computer Engineering. I started to wonder if I had been advised incorrectly when I first started college. I compared this program (AS in Engineering) and what I was currently doing (AAS in Electronic Engineering Tech.) and saw that many of the classes required were the same and that I had completed them thus far.
I decided to get insight from my CC's Engineering Dept. Chairman before selecting any unnecessary classes. After speaking with him my suspicions were confirmed that I had been advised incorrectly from the beginning. The AAS in EET would get me a B.S. in EET and not Comp. Engineering. I was told to switch to A.S. in Engineering and that that would carry over to grad school with the Bachelor's that I wanted. So I did and got a few more credits out of the way. This brings us to the present.


This is my dilema. I know an A.A.S. is designed to prepare you to directly enter the workforce while an A.S. is more of a general degree. The job I'm working at sucks ass and barely keeps me above water (so to speak). I'd like to get my Associates and then start working in the Engineering field as I would be at least getting some professional experience and earning much, much better pay. Is this possible though with just an A.S. in Engineering? Should I switch back to the A.A.S in EET, finish that, find a job, then pay my way towards finishing the A.S. in Engineering and then finally completing my Bachelor's in Comp. Engineering?

91,Questions about entry level &amp; future work with a M.Eng Pharmaceutical Engineering degree obtained by SUGS (4-yr BSE Chemical Engineering + 1-yr M.Eng PharmE),1445877029,"Hello. Feel free to not answer every question.
Thank you for your time.

Background: I am a junior chemical engineering undergrad. I am interested in the pharmaceutical industry and R&amp;D. My university offers a 5 year Sequential Undergrad/ Graduate School (SUGS) program for M.Eng PharmE, so after I complete my 4 year undergrad in chemical engineering I would have 1 year of graduate school. Currently, I have no internship experience. However, this past summer and during the current school year I have been performing research on Pluronics/Amphiphilic copolymers for drug delivery mechanisms in a lab. I can continue working in the lab for the upcoming summer and my senior year. I do not have an internship yet for a pharmaceutical company for the upcoming summer and I am unsure if I will be able to obtain one.

1) What will I most likely be doing for a pharma company fresh out of graduate school with potentially no industrial experience? (Process, Manufacturing, Quality, R&amp;D)

2) How marketable/ valuable am I with only 1 year of graduate school compared to someone with 2 years or a Bachelors?

3) Would a company allow a fresh graduate to do any R&amp;D within 1-2 years?

4) Is a PhD necessary to do research on product design or development?

5) How much involvement do engineers have with R&amp;D for product design or development?

6) Any relevant experiences from other chemical or pharmaceutical engineers in the pharmaceutical industry?


*regarding questions 3&amp;4, I have not decided completely to pursue a PhD in either Chemical or Pharmaceutical Engineering or stick with a M.Eng PharmE. My thoughts were to obtain a M.Eng PharmE, work for 1-3 years and gain a real sense of the industry to determine if I a PhD is right for me.

5,Looking to get experience from other people on how you jumped industries,1445813477,"Hi Engineerit, I've got a BSE in EE and CE as well as a MSE in EE and have been working all my professional life in the automotive industry and as you guys can mostly imagine- it's pretty one dimensional.  I've done some software, and some systems engineering, but it's kinda meh and want a change of scenery (I've done this for five years, give or take an internship).

To try and combat that, I've worked my way into teaching at the local university teaching Electromagnetic Compatibility, signal processing and some communication/circuit classes.  It's basically the only thing I have that keeps me close to design/hardware so that I can stay relevant in things that interest me.  I, however, am looking for a change in another industry and have been targeting hardware/pcb jobs which focus on layout (as well as other lower level type stuff), schematic capture and signal integrity (since that's what I enjoy out of the two career's I have).

So what I'm asking you guys, has anyone of you successfully jumped industries?  If so, how did you do it?  Looking for some strategies, once I start interviewing towards the end of the semester.

10,Terms to use for running average methods,1445807817,"I've been searching for this and not coming up with much. Should be a simple question, though.

I've processed some data by performing a running average, and I use two different methods in different situations. One reduces the sampling rate, and the other doesn't. 

Basically, if I start at point i and I'm averaging n points, the reductive method works this way: average the values and times for points i through i+n, which gives the time and result for averaged point j. For averaged point j+1, start at point i+n+1, go to i+2n+1.

For the non-reductive method, averaged point j+1 starts at point i+1 and goes to i+n+1. This gives smoother data and removes the high-frequency stuff I don't want.

I fully acknowledge this is not the best way mathematically to do this, but it's a simple post-processing task which doesn't need to be super robust.

11,I made a post yesterday about a handcrank-based Arduino generator- today I'm looking for some further advice.,1445806640,"Hi all;

Yesterday I created a post in [r/askEngineers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3q2gm4/is_it_possible_to_filter_excess_power_generated/) and received a great response from the community. Today I'd like to make a second post, further illustrating the issues I'm having and to hopefully better understand the solutions I have available.

&amp;nbsp;

So the jist of it is as follows: To ""demonstrate my engineering capabilities"" (read: *I want to tinker*) I want to create a small handheld generator which can be used to power an arduino through a USB output (10W, 5V and ~2.1A). To do so, I wish to make use of a human-based mechanical input (*turbine, crank, pedals*). 

&amp;nbsp;

My issue is as follow- I have **no idea** where to source the required electrical components, the specs required from them nor how to wire them. From the previous thread, [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Crank_powered_flashlight_disassembled.jpg) type of circuit was suggested. I also found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmvXG2jNQ5M) video online, which at 5:39 shows the circuit employed- this time for a smartphone charger but I'd guess the principals are the same.

&amp;nbsp;

Is there anybody out there who will be willing to guide me through this ""design"" process- I'm fine from a mechanical point of view but my electrical understanding is very much letting me down. I'd need a bit of help with finding suitable parts online (with the alternator / DC motor in particular as I have no idea where to buy any which aren't *masssiiiivvveeee* or where specs are available to let me ""design"" adequately). For example, I found [these](http://www.ebay.com/itm/AC-3-Phase-Micro-Brushless-Generator-Mini-Wind-Hand-Generator-DIY-Motor-3-24V-/201421946888) but have *no idea* on how to begin deciding if they are fit for purpose or not. That and pointers on where I can find some basic formula for calculations etc would be useful.

&amp;nbsp;

Therefore to conclude- I need help with a lot of the electrical side of things. This includes- what exactly will I need in terms of components, how do I ""size"" them and pointers on where I can buy a cheap, compact alternator or DC generator (motor basically). **I  don't want to treat this as *you tell me, I simply do it*. I would like to understand the core concepts and better my understanding through this project.**

Imagine a person standing on the black rectangle, pulling the red cable. They feel the force of the green weight pulling back. They can pull it in, hold it steady, let it go back down at a controlled speed, or release it entirely.

I'm trying to figure out a system that would simulate this from the person's perspective, except that it would allow the person to keep pulling, holding, or releasing at a controlled speed for as long as they want. The version in the diagram stops working when the weight hits the pulley or the floor.

In theory, the red cable could just be in a loop around a motorized version of the blue pulley.

29,road/street engineers: is there a term for this phenomenon when a worn cracked road section deflects and makes a loud thump thump sound as cars pass over it?,1445715353,"Back story: I live on a residential street in Seattle that is paved in sections where each section is roughly 12' x 12' (give or take) and one of these sections has cracked (I think due to excessive heavy construction traffic this year) and now this section makes a loud thump thump whenever cars pass over it.

This [video](https://vid.me/TwbU) is an example. You can't see it in the video, but I've watched cars pass over this and the smaller of the two broken sections deflects due to the weight of the cars (this is the section on the right hand side). Oddly, this only happens when the cars are moving from east to west, not when they are moving west to east (east to west is right to left in this video). 

It is loud enough that all of us that live near this hear it all day long as cars pass. Up until this summer, this was quiet, but this is no longer the case. 

I'm planning to reach out to the city road department, and in preparation for that conversation -- I'm trying to education myself and understand what a road engineer would call this? (other than a noisy cracked road). 

[edit]
I should add that there is some chance that the cause of the crack is a combination of heavy traffic and large tree root that I just noticed is extending under the road from the ""parking strip"" area which is the green space between the street and the sidewalk. This area is rather wide and has a couple of very large old trees whose roots have also lifted part of the sidewalk. So as I look at this more closely, it could be that the cracked piece is slightly balanced on this huge root, and the balance shifts as the weight of the passing cars moves over the section.

Common knowledge seems to be that front-engine rear-wheel drive cars are more expensive to produce than front-engine front-wheel drive cars.  As far as I know this was the reason that Nissan decided not to bring the very interesting IDX prototype to market as they had originally intended.  On the one hand it seems like FR configuration has many cost advantages: your steering linkage and axleshafts don't live in the same place, your axleshafts don't need to articulate to accommodate steering, and you aren't trying to cram the engine, transmission, and differential into a space in front of the cabin.  So what is the problem with FR cars that makes them more expensive?  Is there a fundamental problem with mounting the engine and transmission to drive the rear wheels?  Are the additional driveline components too costly?

53,Dealing with a toxic employee is tough. How do you begin to deal with an entire team of toxic employees?,1445602474,"I'm writing this today because of a conversation I just had with a senior engineer whom I rarely work directly with (but interact with often) who very thoroughly dressed me down in public. He told me that I was shit, my work was shit, and that I have a shitty attitude. Of course, this couldn't be further from the truth. He has a naturally combative personality and takes this stance with literally every single employee that we have in our group, regardless of their work quality.

A little about our team. We're a very specialized field integration team for one of the big four Aerospace companies. It's critical to note that, because there isn't an ability to ""just replace an employee"" because of the amount of training, time required, and overhead we have to do to get a new person into our team. I am the youngest, by far, at 26, and I believe I'm relatively normal. I've been working in the engineering field for the last 7 years without any major issue until now. 

The next youngest is 37 or so, and he has his own vices. A nice guy, but a severe alcoholic and pack-a-day smoker with a divorce under his belt and kids that he never sees (because we're field services). While his personality isn't toxic, his work ethic is. He regularly shows up maybe 2-3 days per week. While he's at work, though, he does a good job.

After that, we have a whole host of ""crusty old greybeards"" who are at or past retirement age, but are too well-paid and deeply ingrained to leave. The majority of them are so jaded and cynical, that literally every other sentence out of their mouth is about ""this idiot"" who can't do anything right or ""that idiot"" who designed a part wrong. A couple of them are actually good individual workers, but have horribly toxic personalities when working with a team. The rest of them don't produce any work (including the person mentioned earlier), yet still have a toxic personality, bringing everyone down. 

And then there's management. First line management is actually ok. The chief engineer is an insane workaholic but him and the field manager are nice guys with positive attitudes. But going anywhere else up the chain, there's more rotten personalities. Even our program manager is playing unethical games with the customer to try to squeeze out every penny that he can from the contract. He also threatens everyone on the team with layoffs every few months, which is doing wonders for our productivity.

All in all, of the maybe 15 people on the team, I would categorize 12 as showing signs of being a classic ""toxic employee."" Daily personal attacks, not producing any work, purposely torpedoing meetings just so they can justify their job, unethical decisions, building their own castles so no one else can do their jobs, tearing everyone else down so they can feel better, etc. 

My dilemma is that this team has expertly fortified themselves into these jobs so they literally cannot be replaced. We have no overlap or redundancy, and so losing even one engineer on our already tight program would sink it. I've tried to remain positive but going into work each and every day hearing about how awful you are/the program is/the company is is just killing me. 

I have thought about leaving the program, but there are many reasons why I don't want to. Selfishly, going back home would mean a 66% reduction in pay (field services packages are extremely lucrative), and an incredibly tough talk with my girlfriend who would likely not relocate with me. Not so selfishly, I don't want to sink the ship while leaving my manager and chief engineer to go down with it. They're good guys and don't deserve that. 

Do any of you have experience with this? It feels like if it was just one toxic employee, then maybe we could all work together to fix him. But instead, me being the ""normal"" guy means that I'm the odd one out and I get ganged up on.",AskEngineers,toxic_employees,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3pwc4w/dealing_with_a_toxic_employee_is_tough_how_do_you/

65,[Electrical] How does the ringer work in a rotary phone?,1445560098,"I know that there is a 75-90v AC going to the coil of the phone, and that it should magnetize the metal sheets inside it. What I do not know is how it interacts with the magnet that is between the a piece of metal and the small contraption that oscillates the ringer that hits the bells. What is exactly happening? Is the magnet getting pushed and pulled due to the changing poles of the electromagnet (if that's even correct), or do the poles of the magnet between the electromagnet and contraption change forcing the contraption to move back and forth.

So my boss cheaped out again and I'm making threaded thumbscrews with a 3D printer.  They're 1/4"" diameter rods.

Last time I asked a question here I got an answer which didn't answer my original question but solved the problem much more elegantly, so I'll leave this one open-ended. ;)

I can't simply hold it in place using the threads as one of two things happens: one is that the threaded rod simply pushes out the back of the handle when tightened, and of course it's inclined to strip like nothing.

My instinct is to use some sort of adhesive, but I don't know what's both suited to bonding plastic and good for shear.

2.  OMISSION OF THREE LATERAL SUPPORT BEAMS ON THE 13TH FLOOR G3005 BEAM 

Technical Statement: NIST omitted three lateral support beams from the exterior frame to 
the north-most beam (G3005) framing into the A2001 girder between columns 44 and 79 
from the east. The NIST WTC 7 report contains a second possible failure initiation 
mechanism, where G3005 buckles and causes the other four beams framing into the girder 
from the east (A3004, B3004, C3004, and K3004) to also buckle, lose their load-carrying 
capability, collapse downward, and rock (pull) the girder off its seats back to the east. When 
these lateral support beams are excluded in the NIST analysis, the beam slenderness is 
increased by 16 times, and this reduces the actual buckling load to 6% of what it would have 
been in reality. Analysis with the lateral support beams included shows that the beam 
would not buckle and that it would actually deflect the girder and put the other four beams 
in tension, eliminating any chance of them buckling, as beams and columns need to be in 
compression in order to buckle. 

3.  WTC 7 COLLAPSE AT FREE-FALL ACCELERATION IS NOT EXPLAINED 

Technical Statement:  After initially denying it, NIST was ultimately forced into a public 
acknowledgement in their final report on WTC 7 that the building fell at full free-fall 
acceleration for 2.25 seconds, during which time it traversed the vertical distance of eight 
stories, or just over 100 feet. However, there is no attempt in the report to confront the 
implications that there could not have been any structural resistance during this eight-story 
fall at gravitational acceleration. Since every other skyscraper in history that has fallen in 
the manner in which WTC 7 did was an explosive controlled demolition, and since there is 
abundant eyewitness testimony of explosions and molten iron as well as chemical evidence 
of incendiaries found in the debris pile, one would expect NIST to at least consider the 
possibility of explosive or incendiary use and test for them, according to the National Fire 
Protection Association investigation standard NFPA 921: Guide for Fire and Explosion 
Investigations, which is strictly followed by the FDNY. Incredibly, NIST continues to refuse to 
test the remaining debris for explosives or incendiaries.  

9.  IGNORING THE RESULTS OF FEMA 403, APPENDIX C 

Technical Statement: NIST did not take the FEMA documentation of melted steel and 
sulfidation in its Appendix C forensic analysis as being indicative of something that could
have contributed to the collapses. Instead, NIST claims, without a basis, that the damage 
was caused in the rubble pile, although the extreme temperatures required to melt steel 
and the presence of sulfidation have no logical mechanism there. 
 
In February 2012 an FOIA request produced three photos, taken during October 2001,  
showing Dr. John Gross of NIST posing with a heavily eroded WTC 7 beam. These photos 
contradict Dr. Gross’ statements about not witnessing steel that had been subjected to 
high temperatures.  In fact, Dr. Gross was on the team headed by Dr. Jonathan Barnett, 
who was responsible for discovering, during the FEMA investigation, the WTC 7 beam 
featured in the Appendix C forensic analysis, which was melted and sulfidated. This is 
one of the steel beams the ends of which Barnett had previously described as “partially 
evaporated.” Such evaporation required temperatures exceeding 4,000° F. ",AskEngineers,_Chappie_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3ptm10/an_organization_comprised_of_architects_and/

He made the comment that he wouldn't care if you were the leader of an organization or project. He would only like to see what problem you solved and how, that sort of thing. Totally makes sense that leadership isn't a big factor in whether you can analyze and solve a problem, I've just always been hounded that companies want the leadership first. 

He made another comment that I enjoyed. Something along the lines of he doesn't like to see the ones that didn't work through school and daddy gave them everything they needed. Also that when looking at GPA, if it's low they also consider family and work conditions at the time.

84,Braking linear actuator that won't break the bank,1445530863,"**What am I making?**  
A belt tensioner to be controlled by an Arduino using a MOSFET. The tensioner will be applying a near-perpendicular load to the belt in order to increase tension via a roller. I would like to use a linear actuator. I don't think a solenoid will work, because I want a higher degree of belt tension control opposed to an on-off switch and high holding loads. The belt tensioner will mostly hold the belt at a constant tension, but will periodically (a few times a minute) alter belt tension by retracting, followed by extending back to it's normal state. 

**What's my problem?**  
A belt tensioner will require a high holding load. For most of the linear actuators that I've looked at (~2 inch stroke, load rating ~100 lbs.) they all have a max duty cycle to prevent the motor from overheating. My system will constantly be under a high load, so I'll just fry a normal linear actuator. 

**What am I asking?**  
Can I somehow implement a linear actuator while using a brake to hold the shaft into place, reducing the holding load on the motor? I know that Thomson makes some for around $500, but my budget is ~$150. I know I can get a linear actuator that meets all of my specs (speed, IP rated, load holding) for under that price. Is it feasible to cross drill the shaft, and have a radially-load rated solenoid shoot a shaft through the hole to brace the shaft?

Anyone have experience with this?

I want to explain a short algorithm with a typical control theory diagram. I study in germany so I don't know the right word for it in english. I want a diagram like [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory#/media/File:Simple_feedback_control_loop2.svg). I know that this isn't a typical control problem, because it changes over time and has to save something.

The algorithm decides between two possible outcomes A and B. It has a input `p`, which is the target percentage of As based on all decisions. The decision is made through a comparison with the current percentage `pC` of As. At the beginning 0 decisions are made so pC=0.5 because both As and B decisions are made in equal amounts (both 0 times). `pC`is calculated with `cA/c`. `cA`is the number of A decisions and c is the number of all decisions. The decisions are presented with methods `A()` and `B()`.

The algorithm in pseudocode:

    pC=0.5
    p //p is a user given value between 0 and 1
    cA=0
    c=0
    
    while(!finished){
    x=p-pC
    if(x==0){
      A()
      cA++
      }
    if(x&lt;0){

90,Calculate the force required to deform a tube radially?,1445511859,"Some friends and myself have been working on a project during the past couple of days, and we're kind of stuck. The project is to design a system which involves a peristaltic pump, driven by a wind turbine. However, in order to set the right dimensions on the turbine, we need to know how much torque that's needed to turn the pump. We're also most likely going to have to design the pump by ourselves, which means that we can't rely to much on the somewhat lacking technical specifications on pre made pumps.

Anyways, our thought is that if we would just look at the friction in the pump as a simple rolling resistance problem, we could get some numbers which aren't too far of. But, in order to do that, we need some way to calculate the force required to ""squeeze"" the tube shut, and that's where we're stuck right now. Is there a way to calculate this?

We have found some ways to calculate radial deformations on solid rods, but it doesn't really seem to translate too well to hollow rods, or tubes.

Edit: I guess I should have specified that the size of the turbine is also a thing we need to consider, and our pump capacity requirements are really low, just 4l/h of water, a lift and head of about 1m and no pressure difference besides the 9,81kPa from said lift.

2,Roof Trusses - Adding plywood gussets?,1445473081,"I added gusset plates to the wood trusses above my garage for additional joint strength since I noticed some flexing when going up there to run electrical wires. The plates are 9""x11""x 5/8"" OSB attached with construction adhesive and 7/16"" crown construction staples. I did not remove the metal plates used at the joints as recommended by a contractor. From my uneducated perspective I added a slight amount of weight and removed flexibility that previously existed.

Do I need to have a structural engineer review and sign-off on these modifications? Someone mentioned to me that I should have had this change reviewed and approved by an engineer ahead of time after I had completed the work (yeah I screwed up). Have I created some risk?

With that being said, I do own one and can tell that there are some kind of conductive, insulated wires (copper?) that run throughout the blanket which generate the heat. And of course, the blanket plugs into a control which dictates the power level of the heat. 

My main questions are what kind of raw materials will I need?
My guesses are as follows:

1.) Some type of conductive wire and plastic shield for the wire?

2.) Some polymer/material that can insulate and protect the blanket from burning.

3.) I want to incorporate a lithium battery so that no wall plug is needed.

4.) And the heat controller might be a bit complicated so I won't include this in my project.



And of course I will need some guidance on how to make the circuit from the battery to the wires and how to even
control how much heat is generated by the wires (clueless here).

7,Can i modify these trusses to turn my attic into a vaulted ceiling ?,1445466503,"Hi

I want to convert a room in my house to a vaulted ceiling, the room itself is pretty much separate from the house (see (pic: http://192.254.186.252/room1.jpg ) it has its own separate 8/12 roof. Everything i read and understand about converting flat ceilings to vaulted have trusses that look like this (pic: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/g78Tl9Om-h0/maxresdefault.jpg) and require the rafters to be beefed up with something like a 2x10. The problem is my trusses are like this: (pic: http://192.254.186.252/room2.jpg).

The rafter that needs to be beefed up usually spans from the ridge board to the wall's top plate, but my rafter doesn't stop at the wall top-plate (it doesn't even touch the top plate at all). so beefing up that rafter doesn't really help in supporting the roof because it seems that the weight is all transfered to that smaller rafter going to the top plate... so how would i go about doing this ? 

should i simply start my rafter on the wall's top-plate and modify the angle of everything and go directly to the ridge board like this: (pic: http://192.254.186.252/room3.jpg) or is there another way to do this?

The welder is pretty simple, just a big honking transformer that converts wall voltage to somewhere around 20vdc @ ~100A at the top end. The first thing I did was put a sizable cap across the 20vdc rails to help stabilize the arc. Worked great, but the wire feed motor was off the rail and the cap would spit out about 5 feet after I let the trigger off. So I replaced the motor controller and it got me thinking about getting more precise control of the amperage output, since I have a controller in there already, why not?

If I were to put a solid state relay to turn the primary coil on an off would I actually accomplish anything?

With CAD and CAM, people started sending the CAD model along with the fully dimensioned 2D drawing.  This presents a problem, because it's tantamount to double dimensioning your part.  What's a CNC machinist to do? Check every dimension on the model against the print? If he doesn't, and there's a discrepancy, he's on the hook for the scrap he just made.     

A coworker of mine is making a really good case for sending the shop the model and a very basic drawing.  He calls it an engineering drawing. The engineering drawing just has a few dimensions: overall, critical, and inspection. There's a note that says that you make it from the CAD model provided, and all dimensions are +/-.005"", except as shown on the drawing.

10,How to make a safe underground fort in a remote area?,1445463541,"I've searched the internet. Most places take this one of two ways: Either dig some hole in your back yard, or make a concrete bomb shelter.

I'm looking to do something kind of like the former. I'm thinking about building a fort in a somewhat remote location, so I'm going to need some advice. The only way I can transport materials to the site is by foot, in a backpack. This means no big support beams. The longest pieces of wood that I could bring would probably be no larger than two to three feet long.

My current plan is to dig a hole... say, 6'x6' at the center, and then have the walls sloping away at a 45* angle. The hole would be around four feet deep, or less depending on how difficult it is to dig through the soil. 

I am thinking of making a gravel trench where the walls meet the floor so that, if it gets wet, the water will drain into the trenches. The floor would be made out of either dirt or wooden panels, and the walls would be left as dirt, or possibly framed with wood. 

I'm not sure what I'll do for the roof. The width of the hole, once fully excavated, will be somewhat large. I'd like to make some kind of sloped wooden frame, cover it with a tarp, and then cover it with a few inches of dirt. (Yes, dirt is really heavy)

LET ME SAY THIS IS NOT A PROJECT. WE WILL NOT REVIVE A GRADE FOR THIS. THIS IS FOR FUN. WHEN I SAY WE IT IS MY FRIEND AND I. 

I am looking into building a hovercraft for cheap and was wanting to use a large electric motor I found on craigslist. I know it can pull 62 amps if it were to stop, but it wouldn't. How feasable is this to use this as a lift motor and to run the fan in the back to push the craft along? 

I think it is a bit overkill as i have seen that a 1-2 hp electric motor will due but POWER is awesome. How could I regulate the speed on this and would regulating the speed interfere with the lift? Should this motor just run the prop in the rear and we use something smaller to provide the lift?

The motor itself weights 110lbs, when you add a person and and hovercraft what kind of lift do you think would be needed to get it off the ground and moving? Here is a picture of the post : http://imgur.com/DNv7e0z?

Literally any input at all would be great. I have tons of time and were just in the brainstorming portion. Our budget is about $200 but we can fundraiser and we will be chipping in and I think I could talk the motor down to 150.

31,A mechanical question for some mechanical minds...,1445391804,"I want to design an ATV that has a special characteristic: as you turn the handlebars, the entire frame of the machine cambers in that direction. The reason for this is say for example you ride into a banked turn; your center of gravity is not parallel to the surface of the bank. Normally this is compensated for by shifting your body into the turn to be more stable. If your vehicle tilted into the turn, you would theoretically be more stable and be able to ride faster into it. I also want to wheels to camber too, to stay vertical to the surface you're riding on. 




I guess you could say that depending on the degree of offset from center at which you turn the handlebars, all the vertical lines of the machine tilt to a corresponding offset.

In my very limited knowledge of the field, I'd say the biggest thing against all electric motorcycles right now (like [KTM Freeride](http://www.ktmfreeride-e.com/en) or the [ZeroMotorcycles FX](http://www.zeromotorcycles.com/eu/zero-fx)) is their range

Their price is a bit high, but it is very easy to see how their running costs (petrol &amp; maintenance savings) make them cheaper than any other motorcycle very quickly (3-4 years into ownership)

However, their major defect (at least for me, and AFAICT from /r/motorcycles and other motorbike forums) is their almost non existent range

At their absolute best, they report a 132km / 82mi range in city speeds. If you go to MINIMUM highway speeds (ie 89kmph / 55mph), this range very quickly drops to 80km / 49mi

Compare this to a VERY small tanked petrol bike, the [Honda CRF250L](http://www.honda.co.uk/motorcycles/range/adventure/crf250l-2013/overview.html) which gets a little over 200km / 124mi at the lower end of range, for highway speeds of 89kmph / 55mph

46,Career woes,1445357032,"So a little background, I graduated with my degree in Mechanical Engineering in December 2014, got a job a few months later with a design firm/contract engineering place that does design work for several of the biggest agriculture and off highway machine companys, usually they hire guy out of college and have them work onsite at one of their customer locations. The work usually entails engineering drawing maintenance and low level engineering support for assembly lines.

Now onto my problem, I worked for a couple months, everything was going decently, they were absolutely terrible at providing training and I had to rely on coworkers for a lot of things. There was one other engineer who was working on the same support team as me, and it was fine, fast forward a couple months and he moves to a different department and I'm the only engineering support for this particular machine, meaning all engineering changes that need to be processed/reviewed must go through me (with my whole 4 months of experience). Needless to say, it was a lot of work, I wasn't used to this arrangement and I was still fresh in the ""real world"". I also got married around this time too (yay more stress!). 

Now my mistake, I started getting less accurate with my time reporting, no more 15 mins off, I didn't keep track of my hours throughout the week so I winged it when they were due on Friday (I know). We were also expected to take a 30 min unpaid lunch break, I like eating alone so I'd eat at my desk and would be done in 10-15 mins max. 

So you see where this is going, yearly review comes around, (I've been there for 8 months at this point) and before I met with my onsite manager my contract agency manager sets up a meeting, he says we have a serious problem, blah blah, your reported hours to badge swipe in times don't match, I admit that I've been bad About tracking my hours throughout the week, but that I also don't take a 30 min break (they automatically subtract 30 mins from badge in-out times). Either way, I admit I messed up and that I will be more accurate. He agrees and we move on. 
The next week he calls me and says that I incorrectly reported my hours again, he shows me the logbook, I actually underreported my hours but switched two days around, so I worked 8 on Tuesday and 9 on Wednesday but on the time sheet I mixed them up, he said my onsite manager was sick of it and wants my contract terminated immediately. Now this surprised me, my onsite manager always mentioned how well I was doing at all our meetings and said everyone I dealt with was happy. My work was always done properly and promptly.

Either way, I accepted it, I knew I messed up and moved on. My contract company manager said they would give me a job at their headquarters because he knew I did good work, I accept the offer and here I am.

Now my job is essentially a design engineer, I sit in front of a computer using Creo all day designing parts for farm equipment that I have 0 interest in. Schedule is 4x10s but everyone ends up working late and Fridays most weeks. To add to my unhappiness my boss is extremely cold/rude to me, only the engineering managers know why I transferred and he is one of them and I feel like that's the reason behind his attitude toward me. 

I'm worried that any mistake I make will get me let go at this point.

I've been applying to other jobs recently, and Im worried about how 9-10 months at my first engineering job would look compared to say 2 years to companys that im applying to.

Secondary question, I'm thinking of going into a quality related career next, I realized that I'm not happy if I spend my entire day doing CAD work. Any other suggestions for positions that don't do much CAD?

Tl;Dr 
Had my contract terminated for seemingly small mistake, got offered job at contracting company and accepted, hate job and boss knows why I ""transferred"" to the contracting company from the place I was working at through them so he acts rude/cold toward me. Worried about 9-10 months of first job experience on resume when applying for other jobs. Also looking for positions that are CAD-centric as I'm worn out on it.

(Q4 2015)",1445275426,"First I want to thank everyone that responded in the [Mechanical Engineers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3nhwu1/call_for_mechanical_engineers_talk_about_your/) thread. The responses have been great, and we all look forward to reading them! The thread is still open to replies if you want to share your work experiences.

This is the second in a series of posts for engineers to talk about their work. Today's thread is for all the aerospace, aeronautical, and astronautical engineers.

**Feel free to share your experiences even if you don't have an AE degree, but work in any of the related industries!**

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**



### Timeframe

*(Skip this section if you don't care about how these posts are organized.)*

Unlike the original posts which only lasted 1 week per discipline, these will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted &amp;amp; stickied, but the old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Once all the disciplines have been covered, a final thread will be posted with links to all of them to collect any more responses until archived. The current list of disciplines:

1. [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3nhwu1/call_for_mechanical_engineers_talk_about_your/) - still open for responses!

81,Simple structure that could increase cow pat burn efficiency to the point it could be used for fast or efficient cremation?,1445252816,"This isn't a homework question, just something that came to mind after looking at someone's photo documentary of the Ganges river... soo many half burnt bodies, or just dumped.

So the idea, and it's not thought out at all, is that these structures would be located alongside the river, where people could cremate their relatives and then scatter them in the river. Being India it might not work out at all, but who knows. 

Required features 
----------------
- Runs on cow dung. We can assume dry as it's fairly hot most of the year.
- The structure is bombproof. Nothing can be removed, ripped off. 
- Needs to get hot enough to incinerate most of the body. 
- Easy cleaning 
- Operation by absolutely uneducated people.

82,Statistics question!,1445249632,"Hi,

First off. I do not know much about statistics, so there is a good chance I am using the wrong terms here, but I hope I can get my question across. I would like to know how ""certain"" I can be that a test is accurate.

First approach to the issue: I have 100 units of a hardware. I want to test 30 of them, either they pass or fail the test. Assuming all 30 pass the test, how certain can I be that all 100 units are ""OK"" (that they would also pass the test) ?

Second approach: I have 100 units of hardware. I want to know that 99% of them are OK and I want to be at least 90% sure that at least 99 of them are OK. How many units do I need to test in order to be 90% sure that 99 out of the 100 units are OK?

Thank you very much in advance and I apologize for any mistakes/misunderstanding, English is not my first language and I am not very familiar with statistics.

The idea is an axle with a wheel of some sort on the end. Then we have a tube shaped magnet around the axle. Around/beside the magnet are 3 iron cores with wires wound around them. Basicly a magnetic generator, to make electricity. We are slowing down the speed of the wheel by creating electricity. We can regulate the braking power by making more/less electricity. 

Our question then is what are the optional amount of wounds around each iron core, to create the most elecrticity? Is the most amount of wounds possible best? What thickness of wire is best?(should we have thick wires with very few wounds, or very thin wires with alot of wounds) And is copper good enough?

An additional question is how large does our iron core(s) need to be?(compared to the wires. Do we have to have a small core with a lot of wounds of wires or a large core with less amount of wounds?)

The magnet are 20mm in diameter with a lenght of 40mm(then the hole through them at a diameter of 6mm)

So I was recently offered an internship position at NASA, but were I to accept it, I'd have to take spring semester off. And, because the aerospace department (my major) is set up so linearly, were I to miss a semester, I'd be missing an entire year of aerospace classes, setting back graduation by a year, and having an entire year to forget things I've learned in class. On the other hand..... NASA internship!!!

I was wondering, as engineers more familiar with the industry than I, a lowly sophomore, am, would you say it'd be better for me to take the internship and miss essentially a year of school, but also getting a great experience and resume-oomf, or declining the offer, and keep on track with school?

Now what I would like to do is include the hoop stress and radial stress created by internal/external pressures to examine how they raise or lower the total hoop &amp; radial stresses. 

Is calculating the resultant hoop and radial stress for combined loading as simple as adding the radial and hoop stresses in equation (8) and (9) in this doc : http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/users/papers/engr/ernesto/poworp/Project/4.%20Supporting_Material/References/3_Thick_Vessels.pdf

92,Want to improve on a portable steam inhaler that people use. They use Capillary Force Vaporizer to produce steam.,1445202477,"Hi all,

I ran into a product a few day ago and have a few ideas on improving the item.

But before I dive into the R&amp;D phase I want to ask you all about the product. I am looking for your perspective because I am not an engineer and do not want to miss any obvious problems.

The product I am using as a starting point is called MyPurMist. They use a technology called Capillary Force Vapor that they patented.

Basically this product creates a warm water vapor without boiling the water so that you can breathe it in. It is for people with lung problems and other respiratory problems. I would like to hear what people think about the main components and the costs for this type of product. I think after molding costs, this item is probably around $15 - $20 to make.  

**Here is a link to the product.**
http://imgur.com/bdNNQ0L

**Link to a video if you have 1 minute to kill**
Capillary Force Vaporizer ""CFV"" technology, previously only available in hospitals.

** The reason what I am interested in this product is that I am an entrepreneur and was looking for something like this because I have breathing problems because of pollen, etc. And steam inhaling has helped a lot. I just want something portable to give me flexibility. 

CFV devices use engineered ceramic materials to turn water into vapor instantly, efficiently, and without having any boiling water in a reservoir. CFV technology was originally developed for use in FDA cleared mechanical ventilator humidifiers used in hospital ICUs. These devices are also used in acute care settings to humidify high flow oxygen systems.

The patented CFV is a thick film, high surface area boiler that combines two natural phenomena: capillary force and phase transition. By inducing phase transition in a capillary environment, the CFV imparts pressure onto the expanding gas and ejects it with significant force (as well as killing any germs). This allows for a Directed and Targeted steam delivery to provide maximum humidity where you need it.

95,Help me choose between two almost identical job offers,1445196039,"Hey guys. Long story short, I'm about to graduate and received two almost identical offers from company A and company B.

&amp;nbsp;

I worked at company A for about a year while doing my undergrad. Met some cool people and while some have left, I still have some friends there. The guy who offered me a job at Company B used to work there at this Company A but now he is president of Company B. He was the guy who hired me and basically got me into this career path. A good friend of mine also left with him when he went from Company A to B. 

&amp;nbsp;

Company A is about 8 years old and pretty well established. I've been working for them for about a year now and I do like it. Long drive to work though and may get longer as I move again soon. 401k, health and dental, all the usual in a company. I do have a sign up bonus thats about 10% of my offer so that's nice. Additionally, I feel as though I could probably ask the same at Company B and get it. I may not have as much as a learning opportunity in field work and may have to travel more at this company. Moving up the ladder is fairly slow. Engineers here typically work anywhere from 45-55 hours a week, no overtime. 

&amp;nbsp;

Company B is fairly new and a division of a larger company. They have made huge progress and are about 300% above expectations from this year. I feel like I have a much better opportunity to learn here and move up the ladder as there are only a few other engineers here. It'll be more close knit and I'll be able to work from home as well. Company B does not have an office as of now but will get one soon. 401k not established yet but very soon. Health and dental as well. More vacation days here as well. Work from home is the biggest benefit. Also I get a fairly large credit toward my phone bill from Company B (basically $100 less a month on my bills). 

&amp;nbsp;

Any other questions I should ask both? I asked about vacation, PTO, 401k, insurance, contracts (none from A or B). I'll ask about typical work hours and overtime if possible from Company B. Relocation is optional from both companies.

Since I know the batteries are good and wanted to eliminate all the variables I cut the wire to measure that it was hot but have been unable to get any measurement from it.  

I would love to be able to repair this solar light system, or, at least, convert the panel to power another light for my friend.  Can anyone help me understand what the problem might be?  It's certainly possible that everything got wet from rain or flooding at some point.  Maybe the switch went bad?  Or perhaps i'm using my multimeter wrong to test the low voltage wire?

I graduated with a BA in math and been working at an investment consulting firm for about six months. Pay is enough to live on, job is not stressful, but I don't find it fulfilling at all. I want to make the world a better place. I don't envision myself becoming a big wealthy philanthropist or making a groundbreaking discovery, but even a small change would be nice.

The only experience I have was doing research for two semesters on wastewater systems in upstate New York. The job itself was mostly working with database and ArcGIS and probably isn't representative of a typical Civil/Environmental engineering work. However, I've realized I'd always be more intrested in designing/analyzing infrastructure and environmental issues than private equity or high yield fixed income.

Here are two options I see:

1. Get a second bachelor's degree. I'd probably need to take the prerequisite sciences at a CC and end up at the bottom, but I'd rather do that then be stuck in the finance industry, which isn't very fulfilling for me.

2. Somehow be accepted into a master's program in engineering. Having a degree in math is marginally better than someone in the humanities trying to get in, but it's still a lot of engineering and science classes I'd have to take.

Company B offered me the on-site interview in November or December on some specific dates, but I am not yet sure which dates I will be able to take a day off. I have a few questions

1) I just heard that in the first 3 months in most companies, you cant take any holidays. Is that true?

2) My friend suggested that I can call in sick, and can take a holiday just like that. I am in academia, so dont know about industry. Is that something you can do at will? Do you have to show doctors receipt or something?

3) Should I just tell Company B that I already have a job. The job at Company A is slightly different compared to the job in Company A, so I am worried that they might think that I am too scattered. Or should I just say that I got a job with an un-named company, but I am very interested in interviewing with them.

4) I also have a non-compete clause in my contract with company A. Company A is a supplier for Company B, but I havent even started the job. Also my position in Company A and Company B are very different. Does the non-compete still apply, and should I disclose it to company B? Then I would have to tell them who the company B.

I've recently been given a job which involves taking resistivity measurements of high quality graphite at a range of temperatures.  The customer is keen on me using 4 point resistivity probes and I am confused as to what benefit this brings and wonder if anyone can offer any suggestions?

I understand the benefit of using a 4-wire resistance measurement in order to negate the wire resistance to/from the current source, but my instinct would have been to use only two electrodes. It seems to me that if each of the 4 wires has its own electrodes then we will essentially be adding in extra, unknown resistances between the current source electrodes and the volt meter electrodes. I don't think that this additional resistance will impact the reading, but it will put extra strain on the current source and I don't see that it will add anything.

So in summary - what is the point of a 4-point resistance probe?

27,"Serious Question: Do you think that the Stereotype of the ""Autistic Engineer"" is true?",1444997552,"So there is a theory called ""neurodiversity"" that says that people on the Autism spectrum are introverted, but technically-minded.  Some people even say that most engineers are autistic.  Some examples of people voicing this theory:

* http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/diagnostics/engineers-and-autism

* http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/baron-cohen_pr.html

* http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_24956222/temple-grandin-half-silicon-valleys-got-mild-autism

In all three cases, the evidence is very vague.  However, Jonathan Mitchell (not me), an unemployed autistic, claims that most people in STEM are actually extroverted and wants a cure: http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html

My case is interesting.  My dad is a math professor, and a lot of my extended family is in science.  When I was born, I had poor coordination and was a late talker; however, I really liked technology and doing basic arithmetic.  I thought I would do great in engineering, but it seems that most people are actually **opposite** the stereotype, namely that they can network with recruiters really well and are extroverted.  I also saw this at schools like MIT.  Additionally, ""talent"" for me wasn't sufficient, as I have difficulty being organized.  My parents and some teachers said I was lazy, when it was beyond my control, saying that I had great capabilities, probably based on the stereotype.  In my electromagnetics class, I was **heavily mocked** by my teacher and students because I couldn't do the more theoretical problems, only the basic formulas.  My parents are still skeptical of me.

I decided to look for a treatment and this is the closest that I found for my case: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemic_sensory_overstimulation

I've ordered an array of:

* [4 infrared \(850nm\) LEDs with an output of 8 watts](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/110-machine-four-lamp-dot-matrix-light-board-100-meters-monitoring-camera-array-infrared-LED-high/32385034250.html)

* [3X Fresnel lens](http://www.ebay.com/itm/XL-Full-Page-Magnifying-Sheet-Fresnel-Lens-3X-Magnification-Magnifier-FE-/231437162057)

[His camera](https://www.lorextechnology.com/site/HD-DVR-Security-system/HD-720p-4-Channel-4-Camera-Home-Security-System/LHD84.p) has an sensor which can put an IR-cut filter in place when the picture is being washed out by too much infrared. Will this be effective enough against the 8 watt focused beam, or will it just look like a twinkle during the day on his end? 

If this is the case, then I can bore out a hole in a stock intel CPU heat sink and insert a 12mm Copper Modules housing a [laser diode](https://sites.google.com/site/dtrlpf/home/diodes) for continuous running. But i'd prefer to use an infrared beam because a laser can be considered a weapon.

32,I'm exhausted; my boss just shrugs,1444963558,"I work for a small MEP consulting firm in the US where I've been for 5 years.  I do all the electrical design work and drafting. I keep working longer and longer hours each week, but keep getting further and further behind.  We are regularly adding new projects, compressing existing project timelines, and making huge revisions after the stamped drawings are issued because the owner added to the scope of the project or the architect never mentioned a portion of the project or sent us the relevant plan.

I get home each night exhausted and I constantly feel beat down; I don't have time or energy to do or enjoy much of anything.  I know I'm not spending the time with my wife that she deserves.  The one thing I haven't let slip (much, yet) is time with our daughter--I don't do any work from the time I get home until she's in bed, but once she's asleep, I start back up.  I have home improvement projects around the house that I'd love to finish, but never have the time or energy.

I would have no problem working a few long weeks to get through a push, but there doesn't seem to be an end to the rush.  If I could just stop time and magically insert 3 weeks between tonight and tomorrow with no new demands, I'd still be behind, but at least I'd be less behind--I might even sleep for more than 6 hours for a night or two.  The problem is that there are constantly new demands, the scope always changes, and I always need to be done ASAP.

I hate to admit it, but I have started ignoring emails; I figure that if it's not important enough for a phone call, then it's not that important.  Emails are for when I get the time, but I never can seem to get the time.

Several weeks ago, I spoke with my boss to let him know I was concerned--I don't have enough time to do good work and I'm constantly rushing to get things out the door without my work being checked; I'm worried that I've got some mistake that's going to come back and bite us all.  I told him that I know that things are falling through the cracks; demands change constantly and I never know what direction I'm supposed to be going.  He just kind of shrugged and said something like ""that's just the way it is right now.""

I've got some questions for the rest of you:

* Is this just the way industry is going now--timelines shrink, scopes change on a whim, architects expect revisions by the end of the day?

* Am I just being whiny and do I just need to suck it up and work more?

* Is this just a part of being an engineer and I had an easy run for my first few years?

* Is it time to polish up my resume and find someplace more concerned with doing quality work?

I think I know what I should do, but I'd love to hear it validated by someone else--I'm so worn out right now that I'm second-guessing most of my decisions.

48,Should I continue doing engineering?,1444883066,"HI 
So im currently in first year engineering and Im not sure if I want to continue. Its always a toss up between a degree in Engineering or dual degree in Math and Physics. We have had people from industry come and talk to us about their jobs. One of them said that the university degree is more theoretical and once you graduate the job is more practical. This scares me as I do not enjoy the practical in class, I would rather do theoretical work.  

Also alot of engineers say that you will probably rarely use that level of physics or math when you finish your degree. I feel like that is kind of a waste, you learn in-depth knowledge and then rarely use it (and probably forget it). But at the same time if I did a physics/math degree there are not a lot of job opportunities like in engineering. Im assuming a lot of them either teach or lab tech. And in teaching there are so little jobs opportunities and I think working in a lab would not suit me.

But apart from that I like the concepts and theory we do in class Im just not sure if I would like the job of engineering, if that makes sense. What do you think I should do?

My model is a sootblower lance (essentially a distributing manifold with a closed end). There are 12 nozzles along the length of the manifold that the steam flows out.

Inside diameter of manifold = 0.06268m
Nozzle diameter = 16mm throat (convergent divergent)
Inlet mass flow = 2.65kg/s
Inlet pressure = 8 bar
Inlet velocity = 295.815m/s
Inlet Reynolds number = 2196809
Inlet temp = 675K

The basic concept is to essentially mist (50 micron) droplets across plant roots to promote faster, more efficient growth. The electrical section is easy - control temp, on off cycles, light, etc. 

However, I'm stumbling over the choice in pumps. Obviously, this is the most expensive and important part, so I'd like to make an educated decision. I need a high pressure (100-125 psi) at a relatively low flow rate (4-5gpm would be plenty). 

How do I choose a pump? How does head lift equate to PSI? I read somewhere head lift can't be converted to psi, other places say it can. On top of this, I'm not sure of my terminology, so googling is leading down the wrong paths and weird rabbit holes.

The cheaper the pump, the better. I found [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Solid-100PSI-DC-12V-1GAL-Min-Diaphragm-Water-Self-Priming-Pump-High-Pressure-/131556382165?hash=item1ea15f15d5) which seems to fit all my criteria. Would something like this, plus an accumulator tank, fit my needs? I also have an offer for a free sump pump - high gph, low head lift. Does this translate into the plumping equivalent of VI=P?

Also, the pump would flow through a small nozzle, something like a .012"" npt nozzle to mist the roots. This is just a recommendation others put out, I'm not entirely sure how to go about measuring water mist.

94,Hot Slab Cooling Model,1444738176,"Hello!

I'm a student conducting a university project and i'm having some problems creating a MATLAB model.

All I want to do is model a hot steel slab initially at 1173K cooling in ambient conditions down to 293K. In doing this I want to compare the 3 types of heat transfer (Radiation, Convection (natural) and Conduction) and see which dominates. The conduction, radiation and convection can be assumed to be over a 2D face of the slab.  The main goal is to get a temperature V time graph of each of the cooling profiles.

I have created a MATLAB model but I don't think it is quite right. Would someone be able to check it or provide a simpler type of model. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1,"[Mechanical] I have a materials datasheet. How do I use its contents to guess bendiness vs. brittleness, and whether a bent rod will spring back or stay bent?",1444691304,"I'm an EE / Software guy by background, currently helping someone 3D print a thing that needs to hold up another thing, but so far have not been able to hold their material in my hands to see what it's like.  The guy on the other side of the telephone isn't very technical and can't help much with that, but has provided me with a materials datasheet for their metal alloy.  

[This is the material,](http://asm.matweb.com/search/SpecificMaterial.asp?bassnum=MTP641) Ti6Al4V. (Ti-6-4, ""ASTM Grade 5"")

I have a basic layman's understanding of compressive and tensile forces as a volumetric distribution of differential values, e.g. what's happening and why in [situations like this.](http://physog.co.uk/pluginfile.php?file=/871/mod_page/content/58/stressesdouble.jpg)

What I need help with is understanding:

1. What material attributes in the datasheet relate to a material's ability to bend without snapping (whether it is brittle or bendy), and what value ranges mean what,
1. How to tell from the datasheet whether a material will tend to bend and stay bent, or spring back to its original shape,
1. Whether this is even something you can reasonably know by looking at material data, or whether you really need to do tests. (Not to optimize or know anything precise, just to get a general feel of whether something is generally brittle or generally springy.)  For example I'm aware that a 3D printed beam of this material might not behave the same as a forged beam of that material, but I don't know that for sure for that material and don't know how much difference it's reasonable to expect.  

I'm looking at [Young's Modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus) and playing with [this Euler-Bernoulli beam calculator](http://www.efunda.com/formulae/solid_mechanics/beams/theory.cfm), but I can tell this is something where I don't have the fundamentals and will likely make mistakes or invalid assumptions.

The client would rather I not discuss the specific application (like many entrepreneurs, he believes his idea is novel and must not be shared, or someone will steal it) but the gist is to create a foam-like mesh of that alloy to help keep a very small (1.5cm) vertical load-bearing post in place.  If the material is brittle or does not regain shape, I would choose tetrahedrons to keep things from moving at all.  If the material is bendy *and* springy, I would lean toward something more open to allow some give, like truncated octahedrons or rhombohedrons.  (Suggestions welcome as well, I know there are lots of very smart people here.)

I've suggested that the client should simply print a few small rods of various thicknesses so that I can see what the material is like, but I'm not sure if that will happen.  We can't always have nice things, right?

5,Powering a stepper motor (Nema 34) with an external battery pack [Checking Logic],1444676225,"I'm interested in powering a Nema 34 stepper motor with an external battery pack. The [pack](http://www.amazon.com/Poweradd-Pilot-Pro-Multi-Voltage-Compatible/dp/B00DN0KBXU) is rated at 32,000 mAh and can deliver 20V @ 4.5 amps.  
The stepper motor is a 2-coil bipolar that has a rated current/phase of 5 amps. From Ohm's law the calculated current (I = V/R) would be 20 amps which would require a current limiting driver.  
*A motor control will always draw less than 2/3 of the motor’s rated current when it is parallel (or half-winding) connected and 1/3 of the motor’s rated current when it is series (or full-winding) connected.* [geckodrive](http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html)  
Since my stepper is rated to 5 amps per phase and at most (parallel) I'd be drawing 2/3's of 5 amps (3.33) the pack can be used as the power source since it can deliver 4.5 amps.  
  
Is my logic sound? Any special considerations?

7,[Update] Regarding resignation notice,1444668502,"Hi guys.  This is an update to my last thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3gr273/regarding_resignation_notice/

A few people mentioned they'd like to hear how it went, and I figured my experience could help others in the future.  

**Tl;dr: Asked if I should give &gt;2 weeks notice to my current employer in last thread.  Most people said no, with a few people saying I should.  I gave 2 months notice, and it worked out very well.**

Very soon after that original thread, I informed my manager of my intentions of moving across the country in December.  He told me not to tell anyone until I was sure I was going and that I had a new job  (pretty much the resounding opinion of most people in the last thread).  I agreed.

As time went on, and my involvement on these new projects ramped up, I felt more and more obligated to let everyone know my plans.  I spoke to him again a month later (about a month ago now), and I told him I felt really inclined to give my notice (he knows I get stressed out and am a bit neurotic).  He said he didn't necessarily agree, but he understood my perspective and thought it would be fine.  

So, 1 month ago I informed all the managers in my department, my chief engineer and adjacent department's chief engineers of my plans and gave an end date of Nov 20 (~2 months notice).  The immediate reaction of everyone was flattering to say the least.  They were sad to see me go, but very grateful that I gave a big notice.  Stupid me mentioned that I didn't have a job lined up, so they immediately asked if I'd do contract work for a few extra months after I left.  I initially said no, but then, as my girlfriend and I started planning our move, I felt overwhelmed with trying to find a job as well as coordinating the move.  

I then proposed that I continue to have my last day as Nov 20 and then start offsite contract work for two months starting January (with a nice 5-week vacation in between :) ).  This would allow a less stressful transition to the new city, giving me a bit more time to find a new job. They happily obliged and so everything turned out great.  I know that's a bit unorthodox, but I'm young, and if this turns out to be a huge mistake... well, lessons learned.  

So, just like anything, every situation is unique.  I hope this post helps someone down the line.  I surely didn't do it 100% correctly, but I think it all worked out for the best.  ",AskEngineers,ImBored_YoureAmorous,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3ogxyy/update_regarding_resignation_notice/

As you can probably tell I'm not experienced with engineering and design at all but I got really inspired by the woodworking and thought it would be fun to try.

I guess it would make sense to 3D print a model out of the design to test it with the cans first at my school and then maybe have a company here in Norway to do the frame in aluminium or magnesium unless that becomes too expensive.

I have seen the DIY guides on using both a thermostat and a PID controller to operate a solid state relay which would turn on/off the control device (fan for BBQ/heating element for sous vide).

From what I have read regarding sous vide constant temperature control is critical, the BBQ is probably more tolerant.

So my question, where I am using a relay providing basically on/off control to my end devices is there any real benefit gained by using a PID controller?  Can that benefit be quantified (i.e., a thermostat will control within 2 deg F and a PID controller will control within 0.5 deg F using the same temperature probe)?  For purposes of this conversation let's stay in the realm of $50-$75 for the whole control setup (let's keep components at a low budget level).

The PID controller will be more expensive (marginally so) and will require reprogramming should power be lost during cooking.

The thermostat will be simpler to program (PID values won't have to be input) and will probably be more tolerant of power glitches (loss of utility or kids tripping over extension cords).",AskEngineers,ialwaysforgetmyuname,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3odcg0/onoff_temp_control_thermostat_or_pid_controller/

As a background, I've taken several career tests in school, and all of them have recommended engineering because of my aptitude for math and science, and my ""thinker personality type"" (whatever that means). Unfortunately, my schedule forbids me from taking the class, but I have asked several people who take it about it, and their descriptions of it really don't appeal to me. All of it is building things and drawing diagrams, taking pieces from kits and gluing them together. This is stuff that I'm absolutely terrible at and if engineering is like that at all, then it's definitely not a field I'm interested in. Again, I do have an aptitude for math and science and I enjoy it a lot, I just have no manual dexterity and I'm not really a hands-on person.

40,Formal name vs nickname usage when entering the professional world?,1444490795,"I'm currently in my final year of my BS in Electrical Engineering and as career fairs come around and recruitment starts becoming a big focus, I'm having some concerns over what to call myself, and how to introduce myself as far as using my formal, given name or my nickname.  I'm using a throwaway account to give myself some anonymity.  



So, my formal name is William, but to all of my friends, family, and current co-workers at my retail job I'm using to pay my way through school, I've always been Billy (with the exception of my father, who has always called me Bill).  As far as professors go, unless I get to know the professor, I keep it at William just to make life easier on them and myself for grading tests and email correspondence to keep things simple between correlating myself to enrollment lists and things like that.  



Now I've never considered Billy to be a ""childish"" name or anything, but I've noticed, especially over the past few years where my face has gone away from being a bit of a ""baby face"" as my jaw line has filled out and I've grown a short beard, people I interact with at my current job don't *like* calling me Billy, or are uncomfortable with it.  At work, I would say about half of customers (and nearly all male customers) I introduce myself to as Billy, even with my business card saying Billy and my freaking name tag saying Billy, they will call me Bill.  



So my question is thus:  Engineers who have a nickname you've been called growing up and identify with, did you change how you introduce yourself when entering the professional world?  If you have, does it have any effect on relationships if your work circle of friends starts to blend with your existing family and friend circles that call you by your nickname?  If it makes any difference at all, I'm 26 years old, I had a bit of a winding road through college.. haha

41,Follow up question and update on: Engineers who have worked at small companies... what do you do in this situation?,1444445023,"First off thanks for all the smart and considerate responses [on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3o1ksl/engineers_who_have_worked_at_small_companies_what/).  It gave me a lot to work with and a lot to think about.

One of the commenters remarked on how the initial thread was more one for human resources and I think from one angle that's really fair.  But I think that one of the biggest challenges that I've faced in my engineering career is finding and then maintaining situations where everyone's talents can elevate a group, partnership, or company to fantastic levels.  I've been in more than one situation in my working life where everything is win-win because of the team dynamics.  I want to maintain that were I work now.  I've seen teams rocket ship people's careers, and the company I am with is primed to rocket ship the group.  

So as I said before he (the kid) is smart.  Just socially and egoistically retarded, and it came out.  I was too in my early 20s.  I calmed his ego and shut the snark that comes out of his mouth today by showing him how classes work in code and how that could clear up the global variable mess he has.  He listened.  I showed my credibility by showing him that I know things he doesn't understand and he was humbled.  I was too busy before to do this, so I let him hack together something.

This is where I have the conflict: I'm the one who let him work on the projects he did.  He's capable.  Can it be worth trying to mentor a capable person with ego problems out of their issues in a tech situation?  I also started documenting the issues and communications we've had in case I need to present to my frankly heroically working and burdened bosses.  I've also started politely asking him to comply (with a joke or two) to company policies when I know an owner can hear or is on the thread.  I don't want to make what I've helped to build negative.  I just want to know if I can push a kid that maybe maturity wise over his head to succeed.  I want him to grow but I want his BS to stop.

47,Suggestions for Power Relays,1444421286,"I'm looking to build a Arduino-based load control system for use in Haiti.
Typical Situation:
15kW generator on a house with an average load of 50A @ 240VAC (~12k)
But, it can easily spike beyond that depending on when compressors for A/C units, fridges, etc are kicking on/off, and the residents don't have a good grasp of how to deal with it.

Overall, my biggest issue currently is in finding cost-effective relays, so I'm looking for advice on that.

Example Power Flow:
Grid Power (240Vac) and Generator (240Vac) run to a DPDT selection (60 Amps)

This 60Amp service then feeds a box of smaller relays, both 120Vac and 240Vac ranging from 15-30 Amps as needed, which will be set with priorities in the control software.

When the total load gets too high, the system starts to open relays to reduce the load to an allowable level.

I'll also want to put in some filtering/TVS/surge suppression as I get more into the design, but let's start with the basics. Where can I find parts to do a 60A DPDT circuit?

My employer funded my security clearance application through OPM about 7 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since. Many of my colleagues who are also new hires have already received their interims.

I have a couple of skeletons in my closet, notably a drug case involving marijuana a couple of years ago which was dismissed pre-trial. I indicated this on my e-qip app. as well as that I abused marijuana here and there throughout my college years.

62,Need motivation. Are there any STEM graduates (specifically engineering and CS) who found university insanely hard but stayed on the course anyway without dropping and eventually succeeded? Do share your stories?,1444357807,"As far as I can remember I was always interested in science. When I was 7 years old I had told my parents that I will pursue a career in science. 

I usually did well in school. In Ordinary Level exams I got 7A*s and 4A's. During these years even though I had other self esteem issues regarding social skills I was always confident that I am capable of pursuing my dreams in life. It also helped boost my confidence that I got a higher achiever's award. Only 7 from my entire grade got this.

After Ordinary Levels I started doing Advanced Levels where I chose Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Core Maths. After a few months my confidence vanished. A Levels was insanely hard compared to O Levels. I found that  some students managed to get decent grades with moderate effort. Some quit science altogether. However, with 6 hours sleep and studying in most of my waking hours I managed to get 3A's and a B. It takes me longer to learn something that others. I had to practice something more. After the end of those 2 years I was so exhausted that I gave up science.

I saw how my peers doing commerce put less effort and yet gained good grades. So, I thought that I am not smart enough for science and got to university to do an accounting degree.

This was far more easier than science. I had free time to do other things in life. However, I felt that something is missing in me. I envied those who say they enjoyed their jobs. Because I knew that accounting will just be a job for me. I won't enjoy doing it.  Science is where my passions lie. 

Then I read about deliberate practice and how average students get to grades using learning techniques. books - [Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown. Here's How. eBook: Daniel Coyle:](http://www.amazon.com.au/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown-ebook/dp/B0026OR1UK)

So, I transferred to do computer science. The first semester was very hard for me. Specially because I take longer to remember things than others and there is lot to learn in the short time span. I vigorously used anki to study but still found it difficult. Again my social life is terrible and having depression doesn't help it either.

I have thoughts about going back to do accounting. I will have a more balanced existence, good social life and will enjoy my  university experience. But, I'll have to bury my lifelong science dreams and settle for a job that pays the bills.   And I am not sure if I will regret it in the future. Lots of people do in forums. They wish they had done the course they were passionate in even though it was harder. If you could go back, would you major in accounting again?

He was a little nerdy and anal but he made an effort to fit into the bawdy joking and ribbing that can go on between guys at small spots.  Shy, but nice and smart.  We have an extremely egalitarian culture at this company.  I don't lord over anyone, because to me it creates resentment and prevents work.  I just look to them to help me and teach me.

Then the young twenties thing started to come out.  Asking me questions and talking over my answers.  Talking himself up constantly.  Giving bitchy responses.  Going from ""I'm the king of the world"" to ""please be my friend"" with me constantly.

Here's the thing.  He failed out of engineering but is a smart kid.  He just obviously very insecure.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/lugoH) are some rough sketches to help give you an idea of what I'm planning.

I'm attempting to fabricate a completely custom chassis for a PC, and the plan is to use aluminum plate (appx. 24""x12""x.25"") for the main portion. This is going to be a small form factor case, so maximizing interior space is the entire reason behind trying to minimize the radii of both bends (exterior radii are not as important). The goal is to create a very clean aesthetic without compromising the strength of the chassis.


The depth of the relief cut planned can vary, as long as it will work (my sketches are really just approximations). After the bend is made, welding the seam seems like a good idea. Another question is, would it make sense to create a couple of very shallow cuts along each face of the V-cut, and then sandwich metal epoxy between the faces as it's bent?

85,[Acoustics] Sound insulating box in a hemi-anechoic chamber problem,1444261497,"Hi all. Recently I constructed a 5 sided box + lid out of drywall and mineral wool insulation which I will be using for R&amp;D testing. My intention is to place this sound insulated box in a hemi-anechoic chamber with a bluetooth speaker inside it, put a gasket on the rim of the box, place the lid over the 5 sided box and gasket, send a particular frequency through the speaker, and measure the sound pressure level coming out of the gasket. A cross-section depiction is shown below.

http://i.imgur.com/uhN6r0p.png

The problem is I messed up the design of the box. Between the outside and inside layers of drywall, I only put in a ~1.5 inch gap with 3 inch mineral wool (so I compressed the crap out of it) instead of putting in a ~3.5 inch gap. I did some in-house testing with the box (not in the anechoic chamber) and measured the sound pressure level at points A and B in the picture, and the sound pressure level is higher at point B than point A than some cases.

I realize the point of an anechoic chamber is to virtually eliminate reverberation, but I have no idea how this affects sound pressure. When I perform this testing in the anechoic chamber, will this matter? Like, will the sound at point B ""contaminate"" the reading at point A?

Typical holes are anywhere from 24"" to 120"" in diameter and up to 100' in depth. 

Right now our estimating process is EXTREMELY primitive.

These test boring sheets are absolutely overflowing with data about soil composition and it's basically all being ignored. My goal is to write a small excel/VB program that will essentially take the data from the test borings and compare it to the production of our various sized rigs past performance under similar conditions and make predictions about job times.

I am an Undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student who has been given the objective of researching 'Overcoming geometry issues when creating analysis models'; or to put it less academically my aim is to:

 * Determine key issues that make the use of CAD models for meshing difficult

 * Test strategies for preparing analysis models in the presence of these issues


Now at this early stage it is all about the research of said issues, and whilst there is much to be gleaned from journals, articles, ETC, I was hoping to reach out to online CAD/FEA/CFD communities to see if anyone can offer further insight.

&amp;nbsp;

So, what I was hoping I could ask right now is;

**Are there any specific geometric features you have encountered which cause difficulty in the preparation (e.g. meshing) of analysis models?**

&amp;nbsp;

This is all very low key at the moment, and without coming back and conducting surveys it's also not readily suitable as evidence, but i'm just looking for a framework of an impression of the difficulties those working with CAD-to-CFD/FEA encounter.


Anyway, if anyone can help me out i'll be very grateful, and i'm grateful for all your time

98,Want to transition to a more engineering-oriented position but not sure how to go about it,1444223589,"Hey reddit, thanks for reading.  Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.


I want to transition to a more engineering-oriented position but I am not sure which route to take or what realistic options are available.  I was a good student.  I completed both a BSEE and MSEE within 4 years.  I completed my MSEE in 08 with a focus on comm systems.  I wrote a thesis on collision avoidance of automated vehicles at intersections and published a conference paper in 09.  After graduation, I wanted to stay in the DC area but realized that most of the demand for EEs is for defense companies so I decided to go into intellectual property.  Even though I deal with both engineering and legal work, I am not really interested in it and think I would be happier in a more traditional engineering or research role.


I have been considering a number of different options.  I really enjoyed grad school.  Ideally, I would like to do research and\or engineering work on automated vehicles and work toward a Ph.D.  However, I am not sure what to do to get to that point.  As another option, since I enjoyed SatComm in university, I am thinking about getting into engineering as applied to civilian space.  Alternatively, since I have experience programming in a variety of languages, I am considering software engineering for a non-defense role (ideally related to automated vehicles).  I have programmed a few basic web pages on my own within the last year or two so I have some more recent programming experience.  I am not sure if recruiters would find these experiences strong enough so I've even considered going to a coding boot camp if I need to.  However, from what I gather, most people going to the boot camps have no programming experience at all so it feels like it might be a waste for me to go.


So, in summary, I would like to transition to one of these roles ordered by priority:

(1) research\engineering work related to automated vehicles

(2) engineering related to civilian space

(3) software engineering position


(4) a temporary internship\unpaid position of one of the above? [I'm not sure if employers would even do this.  But I have a lot of leave saved up and may even be able to go on unpaid leave for a while.  It would be worth it to wake up every day to do something interesting.  Money is not a primary concern.]

(5) coding boot camp (which one to go to may be a topic for a future post)


Do you have any advice on what I should do to make this transition?  Money is not a primary concern.  I'm fine with something entry level.  Do you think any of the above numbered options is unrealistic based on my background?
