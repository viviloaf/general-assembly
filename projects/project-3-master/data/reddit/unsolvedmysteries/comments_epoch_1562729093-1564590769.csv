0,Taking time off after first job. How much is too much?,1564590355,"Hi all, looking for some opinions on my situation.

I graduated with my BS in electrical in December.  I started a contract position shortly after that is coming to an end.  Prior to that I had 10 years work experience in various technical and non-technical roles. 

In short - I'm exhausted.  Not so much from the job, but university was a struggle for me as I worked full time while taking classes. 
 I've never had a real vacation, and for the first time in my adult life I have some extra cash and some free time. 

I'm planning to take at a little time off to simply relax and maybe do a little bit of traveling.

8,Finding an internship during second year of uni,1564579062,"
Tldr: just finished 1st year of EE with 70% avg after repeating the year. I'd  like to find a work placement  in ai or robotics before the end of 2nd year. No related projects or experience to demonstrate skills. Don't  know how to search for them and whether  i have any chance of securing one. How do i proceed?





I'm  a student from the EU going into 2nd year of my Electronics  degree in the UK. In 3rd and 4th year i will be having shared  modules  with the CS department  and will be specializing  in AI.


I am planning  to start applying  for internships from mid-August - September.


The issue is i feel incredibly  under qualified even though  not much is supposedly  required from 1st years. 


I have no projects  I've  done outside  Uni in my field. I'm  also currently  not a member  of a university  engineering  society  (planning  on joining  the robotics and ai soc next year but i wouldn't be able to include this in my cv until at least the end of 2nd year). The only extracurricular thing ive  done this year was joining a team sport and competing  a few times until i stopped  after spring break to concentrate  on exams.


The worst part is I have repeated  1st year as i just didn't  attend  my 2nd semester the first time. During my repeat year my avg is about 70% which is not that high. And i don't  know how i would  explain during  an interview  why I've  repeated - i couldn't  possibly  omit this fact, could  i.


I would  be happy  of taking  unpaid  internships during winter, spring or summer break. I'm  not fussy about  location, it's  not even  necessary  to be in the uk. I just would like something  to help me in the pursuit  of a career  in ai or robotics. I just don't  know what my chances are.


Also, could you advise on how to approach applying? Using indeed.com, many of the positions require more experience than i currently  have. Ive  thought  about  emailing  small companies  i find on gogle whether  they'd  be happy  to have an intern to train no matter paid or unpaid but am not sure if this is appropriate. Also, ive  heard people apply to more than 20 internships  per week when applying, but i don't  even  know where to find these. Most as i said seem to look for more qualified  people and on these work related websites they seem to run out of positions.

18,What is my job title?,1564532045,"Hello, I am a Mechanical engineer and since I got out of college I worked developing consumer products for companies such as Whirlpool (4 years of experience doing that. It was what I liked at the moment). In the last few months, I felt I picked a career path that was stagnating me in terms of job opportunities, salary, and technical growth. I spent some time looking at other areas and I was attracted to automation. 

I set a long-term goal to become more attractive to employers, increase my income and become more specialized while doing something I enjoy. I decided to start this career change by learning how to program PLCs and get experience doing it in order to get into the automation world.   
I am a dual citizen and live near the US/Mexican border in San Diego. One of my cousins in Mexico married into a Korean family that has a company in Tijuana that makes packaging for Samsung. Their machines automate most of the process and use PLCs. I told her I was interested in working there to gain experience (I made it clear I would be learning). She said they had nobody to work on their processes so it seemed like a good fit. I met the owner and I was working here by the following Monday.

To my surprise, no other engineers worked at this company. Since I started working here I've been troubleshooting factory equipment, reprogramming PLCs and modifying existing processes. I fixed a machine that had been sitting for a year. There were no manuals or schematics for the machine and nobody knew how it worked. In addition, half of the labels were in Korean and the ""technicians"" left a wiring mess that only added to the puzzle. I was able to get it running after many days of intense problem-solving.

I've also reprogrammed other machines' PLCs and I've added components to them so they can make different custom packaging products. It's all been really difficult to do with no documentation or other engineers to bounce ideas from, but I've stuck to it for the sake of personal growth. 

The next big thing I will be working on is in replicating these Korean machines so they can be built in-house because the owner wants to sell his own versions. Being the only engineer means I basically do everything myself from repairs, modifications, reprogramming and soon managing PBOM and such. The only exception is that they have a machinist from Korea (that doesn't speak any other language other than Korean) to make custom parts when they are needed. Overall, I've enjoyed getting my hands dirty and all the problem-solving involved.  I've certainly got my engineering fix while working here. 

I plan on searching for a US job as the pay difference is considerable. I really only took this job to gain experience to get my foot in the door for a well-paying engineering job in the US. 

What would my job title be if I'd be working in the US this whole time? What kind of jobs and pay can I expect with this kind of experience? Do you consider this good engineering experience to get a well-paying engineering job? (85k+?)

I feel somewhat fearful I might have derailed from my original intended goal because I was on the phone with a random recruiter last week and she said: ""well, it sounds like the only thing you know how to do is work with your hands"" and dismissed me. Is this experience perceived as negative for an engineer? Am I heading in the wrong path? Perhaps I am doing things that technicians are expected to do? I want to be an expert in an area and make a good living doing it. I know older engineers making 100k+ but I fail to see the path to get there.

As I prepare to make the jump to a four year university I just want to know if I chose the right field.

My degree credits will work for literally any field of engineering. I always thought I wanted to be a Civil Engineer (closest thing to an architect) but recently I've been thinking about a different field of engineering. Mainly because civil gets paid the least with the least room for growth.

Two, finding a job shouldn't be too hard. Everything I've read said engineers are in high demand. Although some advice on my career path would be nice. Like do I need experience for my first job or will they see the degree interview me and train me?

I think the work done by mechanical engineers is so cool and interesting and I would love to get into it as a career. I enjoy being hands on. 

But on the other, I've been an electronics and computer main my whole life. I love how they work and doing them as a hobby. Typically in an engineering project you'd see me more interested in the wiring and hardware assembling side of the project. I'm not too super into programming to the point that I'd consider a CS or CE major, but I don't mind it. 

I'd want to go into the Aerospace industry. I've often heard the ""choose mechatronics"" idea before and I wouldn't want to go into it. I don't know, robots just aren't for me. 

If any EE's or ME's read this, what is your day in the life like? What software(s) do you use/what hands-on activities or labs/tests do you need to do? What tasks do you need to do, what elements of your degree do you use in your work? What do you think I'm more built for given my interests?

Over the summer I applied to maybe 20-30 fall part-time internships. Last week a P.E. from a company (transportation and design work, we'll call him Jim) called me back for an interview Friday and then subsequently offered my the position yesterday afternoon. After the interview Friday, another P.E. (we'll call him John) from a different company (land development work) called and wants to set up an interview. We spoke for almost 20 min on the phone and we hit it off well from the start.

My issue is I'm not sure if I should tell John about my other offer and see if he could possibly match it or something? idk i've worked my whole life but I've just never been in this exact situation. Ultimately I think if it was completely up to me and Jim and John both gave me the same offer, I'd go with John. It seems to be a better fit, and land development is what I have intern experience in and is slightly more interesting to me. Although I am specializing in transportation in my degree (partly because i wanted to, partly because I could make it work best with my schedule).

To add on the mess, John left for vacation this week, and I'm leaving for a wedding next week. So the soonest I could meet with him would be two weeks.

57,Blue-Sky Aviation Business Idea - Engineering Advice Appreciated,1564480901,"Hey all,

I have a super ambitious business idea and need help from people in the know to see if it's even viable please :) 

I want to create a new airline that is dedicated to people that want to travel in-cabin with their dogs (cats welcome too).

My idea requires that the cabin is restructured &amp; refitted with new components to suit the purpose. I have rough plans/sketches for this &amp; what I consider potentially viable - but I know nothing of engineering - and to take this forward, I will need to understand costs involved, and also even if it's doable at all.

I'd ideally like to chat to someone that understands the ins and outs of long-haul aircraft ie 737/747 or A380/cargo ideally,  materials used in the build (inner) and any limitations.

My idea is to build modular compartments (similar to what I think Singapore Airlines have done with their hold area - to create larger sleeping bed quarters) - think of train compartments almost, except that the human will fly with a ""business class"" reclining seat and there would be space for up to two large dog crates in same compartment. I also thought of making these compartments modular, ie being able to swap in and out its regular passenger configuration - by putting it all on a rails system. So configuring the plane will take like 1-2 days maybe each way (guestimate!) - but how practical that is vs having a dedicated plane with the ""train-cabin"" configuration, I'm not sure.

I have done super top-level maths ito volume of plane (which may not be accurate as I still need to decide which aircraft is best use &amp; then recalculate based on its volume) but I think could fit in 10-12 of these 'cabins'.

1. In your opinion as engineer, is this doable?

I graduated in June with a BS in mechanical engineering and accepted a contract to permanent position in the Valley in LA. The contract is for 6-9 months and I would be making about $4200 a month after taxes. The position is pretty much my dream job in my dream field and I feel extremely fortunate to have been offered it at a company where I think I can learn a lot. The only problem is my living situation. My commute there would likely be at least an hour if I leave my place at 6:00 AM. If I left at 3:30 PM, my commute back would almost be 2 hours. I would be driving on average, 3 hours a day. My round trip last summer for my internship was about 2 hours, which was absolute mental torture, especially after using my brain for 8 hours on top of that. 

I wouldn't be hesitant at all to move if it wasn't a contract position. When I spoke to them, they sounded like I would have a good chance of being converted to a full-time employee and I'm optimistic that that will happen. However, there is always a chance that I can get terminated at any time, or they choose not to transition me into a full-time employee. So realistically, I would be taking a chance if I decide to move closer. Airbnbs and short term rentals are also an option, but are pricey from what I've seen. That being said, I think that might be my best option, because locking myself in for a year and getting terminated doesn't sound like a smart move.

77,"Jobs with the least ""restriction"" in terms of roles.",1564436977,"One thing that annoys me about my current job (industrial maintenance) is that we're very restricted in terms of who can perform certain jobs.

I'm in the mechanical maintenance department, so I'm not allowed to perform any electrical work despite having the same qualifications as my counterpart in the electrical department, because there's a separate department for that. I took night classes for welding certifications, but I can't weld because there's a guy for that. I took 10 weeks of machining classes, but can't do any machining because we have another guy for that. I'm perfectly capable of performing any woodwork I would need to do my job (building stands for assemblies and whatnot), but can't because we have a separate department for that.

81,Is My Engineer an Idiot?,1564434186,"Hi... long time lurker, first time poster. 

I work in a lab environment where we have a bunch of test cells that get cooled with a chilled water line. 

These tools are connected to the a water loop that our engineer controls. 

Our tool specifications say that we have to have a pressure differential between the supply line and the return line of 25psi to get our required flow rate of 4 gpm.

We have pressure gauges at each of the supply sides and return sides of our tools. We can see that the pressure on the incoming side is about 40 psi. But, on the return side, we can see that the pressure is only about 38 psi. So, we are only getting a pressure differential of 2 psi. 

We’ve asked the engineer to increase the pressure differential. But, he tells us the same thing - he can’t change the pressure. He can only change the flow. But, we think this is bull crap because we have see the supply side pressure higher before (60 psi) and the return side is closer to 40 psi - still not within our required range). 

If he increases the speed of the pump the pressure goes up. So, isn’t he changing the pressure?

We recently had pressures that were too high (80 psi). The engineer said the problem was that the pressure reduction valve on the city incoming line had failed and that was leading to the pressure being so high. Ever since then, our operating pressure is way lower and now we can’t get the rated pressure differential. 

He said that with the pumps turned off the pressure in the line is about 25psi. 

Who’s right? Can’t he just turn up the speed of the pump? He says he controls the speed of the pump by changing the differential presssure... if he’s changing that, why does he say he’s only controlling the flow? He says that our tools define how much pressure is in the system. He keeps saying that they are like resistors. And that the more resistors we have, the bigger the pressure differential will be. 

Is he right? If not, how can we fix him? He’s kind of hard headed.",AskEngineers,False,LabTech175,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cjhe3i/is_my_engineer_an_idiot/

At the moment one tube would extend to its limit and ""pickup"" the next tube and pull it along until that tube is at it's limit and picks up the next tube, etc. I'd rather have all the tubes extend at the same time so that the overlap of each tube is constant. If that makes sense. Any ideas how to do this? 

I hope that description is not too confusing.

17,Switching to Aerospace after working in different industry?,1564353019,"Hey All,

I got my BS in mechanical engineering and worked in the automotive field for about 5 years now. But I've recently changed my mind about continuing in automotive and would like to switch over to the space industry. I understand that there are mechanical engineering jobs in the space field, but I want to work in areas not generally covered in mechanical engineering like propulsion and flight controls.

My feeling is that going back to grad school may be the best way to approach this goal. By going back to school I would be able to network with people better connected to the space industry and learn the relevant coursework not covered in undergrad or my work experience.

Is this a reasonable plan to go straight to grad school or would I need to go back to undergrad to get the relevant info and experience?

Our theoretical and mathematical background is strong, but we feel the lack of practical and work-oriented preparation.

Artificial intelligence excites me, arouses my interest and makes me feel alive, and my degree thesis also concerns this subject. However, I have a doubt: I am not a computer engineer and my programming culture is limited, I will have to fill in some gaps but I will never have the solid knowledge of a degree in computer engineering. Do you think this could limit me in my career? Is it risky to change branch and invest everything on a new path?

i have always wondered if it would be a good idea, and or, practical, to build a house with a fireplace and chimney, large enough, and with a built in ladder, that a full grown man could easily, and effectively, climb up to the roof from the fireplace itself. 

i am not talking about sticking a pre built ladder into a fireplace/chimney, i am talking about building a house, with a fireplace/chimney, that has a ladder built into the concrete of the fireplace/chimney itself, built like that.

i suppose that this concept originated from the idea that Santa Claus comes down from the chimney to give presents, but the idea has always stuck in my mind, 

and so i ask r/askengineers, in your technical experience, and beliefs, what do you think about the idea that the fireplace and chimney, 

1: can be large enough for a full grown man to climb up and down

2: facilitate a ladder built into the back concrete wall of the fire place and chimney itself

3; that the chimney can be structurally stable enough to support it's weight, and the weight of the man climbing inside of it. 

4: that the ladder of the fireplace and chimney can remain structurally stable even under the constant heat and fire of being used as a fireplace

5: that the chimney, will have a chimney cap, to keep rainwater out, and that can be locked and unlocked from either in the inside or outside of the chimney cap,

6: and that the fireplace itself, and be used as a fully functional fireplace,

If it is working based on radiation principles, surely the fan doesnt cause more heat to be transmitted due to the heat being transferred via radiation and not through convection.

54,How do you build a low cost 1ppr encoder (or turn an existing one into a 1PPR version)?,1564253415,"Yes, 1ppr.   


I am building a belt-driven system which needs angular position tracking. I have a 600ppr incremental encoder currently doing this, but sometimes the system misses a few pulses and becomes inaccurate by almost 10 degrees (due to the sampling frequency). All that is fine as long as I am able to keep track of when the system comes back to 0 degrees. It is a racing simulator, so it's not a big problem if it gets a relatively small angle offset like that, as long as the 0º is still according to reality. For this reason, it would be perfect if my incremental encoder would have the Z channel (which hasn't). 

Is it possible to buy, say, another 600 PPR disk (or a lesser resolution), close 599 of the slots somehow, and attach a photosensitive module to do the same as a ""1 PPR"" encoder would?

I also thought of using one of those cheap 20ppr encoders, opening them, closing 19 slots, and using that. Is this ok? What would be an appropriate way of ""closing"" those slots?",AskEngineers,False,TheDootDootMaster,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cilbik/how_do_you_build_a_low_cost_1ppr_encoder_or_turn/

I've had a converted bus for over 4 years, and the past year a nonessential electrical problem has been plaguing me and I can't for the life of me track down the source.  Something component-y is disabling the gas pedal when it thinks the back door is open - it used to be a transit bus, so it makes sense why it exists... except the back doors aren't in use anymore.  The problem will sometimes flare up in the middle of driving, where all the sudden the bus will stop accelerating and the pedal will be disabled.  Sometimes, like now, it does it when I need to relocate the bus or risk getting it towed in the next couple of days.  Hoh boy.

The other thing is, the alarm doesn't think the bus doors are actually open - so something's triggering it *without* throwing the sensor.

I have spent many many hours trying to pull fuses, switches, and plugs over the past year, to no avail.  I need some help, ASAP.

I know that the school world is much different than the work world. I can't really find exactly how the two are different but that is what I found through doing my research. Unfortunately, not much can be learned through the sources I have visited, which consists mostly of Quora, Reddit, Youtube, and blogs. I know that these sources are not what you would call ""primary sources"" but I could not find much better. I am more interested in the personal, practical experience, rather than the theoretical experience. If you have any recommendations for a book, a documentary, a movie, or anything that would really allow me to dive into the what exactly a career of engineering looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

If you do not mind, I have a few questions for you, the engineers.

1. How different is school from work? Is it similar?
2. Do you have to continuously learn a lot of theory in your day-to-day? Do you have to do an extensive amount of thorough research each time you have a new project? Or is that something an engineer mostly does in the college days? Reading a lot, especially books, gives me a lot of anxiety as I am too detail-oriented and really sometimes over analyze things; namely, I would sometimes try to read between the lines even when there is nothing to read there. It is my biggest concern, so please give me as many details as you possibly can about this aspect of the job..

11,QUESTION: ASTM A312 and A376 (ELI5),1564114094,"Hello! I was wondering if there was any engineers working with stainless steel tubing that could explain this to me?
This is the first time for me ever working with SS and using ASTM reports. Currently I am verifying vendor material reports to make sure that their results match the ASTM standards so we know it is safe to be used. 
I have just a few questions. 
1. First, vendor reports list multiple specification sheets when they send in the report for the tested material, and it’s all together in a single line, for example ASTM A312/ASTM A376/etc. Since my focus is only on the ASTM’s, how do I know which one to use since it lists multiple? 
2. Likewise, when it comes to their types, they’ll say 304/304L. Does that mean it shares characteristics of both? Or that either typing works?
3. Finally, last question has to do with the chemical composition chart, (which I will link at the end). So for ASTM 312, there is no specification under OTHER of how much of a percentage is allowed for other materials. An ellipses (...) is what shows no analytics or amount reported required, but there’s nothing there either, just an empty row. Does that mean I am to assume that there should be nothing? And if there is an additional element (say cobalt), we shouldn’t use the tube? This kinda loops back into my first question as well, since 376 says I can have additional elements, but not 312.
I am really really sorry this post is long, I’m just very confused and want to do this right for my employer.

I'm going to graduate school for either mechanical or aerospace engineering immediately following graduation. My research interests lie in combustion instabilities and propulsion reheat systems. I have a research assistantship in a propulsion laboratory and hope to work in thermal fluids and propulsion after graduate school.

My weakest subject, by far, is circuit analysis, and although you wouldn't assume so, working in a propulsion lab can sometimes require novel use of electronics.

The project requires us to design a robot that can throw a football, essentially a robotics arm, and enter into a robotics competition.

Should I pursue this project or wait for a project that's based more in thermal fluids?

I ask this because my school doesn't let us pick projects 🙃 Someone just asked me to be apart of their group because they're already working with a professor on this project over the summer.

 - Wind turbines at their modern design operationally peak at 32% efficiency
 - Water energy capture systems rely on steam (nuclear/geothermal/conventional), and hydroelectric energy is geographically limited.
 - All energy conduction and transfer incurs an inherent loss due to the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics

20,Advice on asking for a raise,1564096770,"My company has been ramping up lately, and it is pretty clear we do not have enough engineers to handle the workload...so I wasn't surprised to find online job postings. I've been at the company for 3.5 years and received two ~10% raises. But both were within my first 1.5 years. So it's been about 2 years now.

I plan to sit for the April 2020 PE, and getting that would be seen extremely favorably. However, I do not want to wait that long to ask for a raise. I have been averaging 47 hours per week for the last 7-8 months, which means I am effectively payed about 14% less per hour when compared with a 40 hour week (I'm salary - no overtime pay). Though ""technically"" our salary is based on a 44 hour week so that works out to about 5%. They like to remind us of that when things get busy.

I genuinely enjoy working there and want to advance. But I feel like I am being taken advantage of. I am largely independent - it is standard to have two engineers on each of our projects, but I am given sole engineering responsibility on most of the projects that I am assigned. That means I am sort of ""cross-trained"" in both of our engineering disciplines (the only person out of the ~8 engineers). Our VP oversees all engineering work - so no one is totally independent anyway.

I've never asked for a raise before. Should I just be right to the point ""I've looked at my time sheets and noticed I've been averaging 47 hours per week. I do not see this decreasing anytime soon because of the work we've recently been awarded. Can we discuss my salary?""

- Do I ask for what I want, or should I ask them something like ""can you guys do anything for me"" and let them make an offer (or not).

- I am hesitant about asking for a raise based on extra hours during a busy time. Does it come off as me trying to fleece them? In their eyes, maybe it could be ""well we are going to slow down eventually, then we'll be overpaying""

- I made an excel sheet with my hours and shows the ""stats"" mentioned above. Should I bring that and use it as justification. I make about 77k now, and feel like asking for another 8k.

After 1 year of unemployment, I finally got a job in Austin in a very niche industry. My current role is related to civil engineering. I basically do visual inspections of buildings/property infrastructure and write technical reports with condition assessment and a 25-year financial plan for maintenance.

- Is it wiser to go into industry to get your graduate school paid for, or to go straight into graduate school if you know you want to?
- Is there any difference between going into a Masters and then a PhD afterwards versus going straight into a PhD?
- What are ways I can continually pay off my student debt while I’m in graduate school? I understand that grad school will cost money, but I hope to be earning more money at the time to begin paying off my education. Is this feasible and possible?

31,Hydrostatic Pressure Question (Simple),1564078201,"So here is the problem https://imgur.com/a/vYyvDsy

This is straight forward and I'm assuming the P would just be ( P= [density * gravity * height] + P_o ?

But P is not the pressure of the gas, it is simply the pressure acting on the gas, is this correct? So P, is the pressure under which the gas will exit the valve at the top of the red tank. Increasing water level in black tank would just increase the pressure acting on the gas, it wouldn't man the gas is being compressed in to a smaller volume

If I were to say inject more gas through a valve located at the bottom of the red tank (the gas would bubble to the top), the volume that the gas occupies would increase (the water level in red tank would go down and water in black tank would go up, the gas would NOT be compressed and occupy the same volume), the pressure increase would come from the additional difference in height between the 2 tanks. I understand that this is what happens. Does this mean that effectively the pressure of the gas itself in the red tank is always the same (1 atm) given that injecting more gas through a value at the bottom would just mean an increase in volume that the gas occupies?

Would there ever be a case where by injecting more gas through a a valve at the bottom of the red tank, the gas is compressed at the top of the red tank without the volume (water levels ) changing?

I'm just trying to wrap my head around this and I hope i was clear in my explanation. The gas is at no point being compressed here correct. The amount of gas and the volume it occupiers is always proportional here ? The gas is always occupying the maximum space it can without being compressed. If I were to open the valve at the top o the red tank the gas would escape and the two water levels in red and black tank would try to equalise right?

32,Suggestions on what to do next.,1564076891,"Hello fellow engineers.
I have a question about my current position and wanted any ideas I can get.
In my current position, my title is project engineer for a small manufacturing company . My duties go from R&amp;D testing, to design tooling, to “fix equipment” to visiting new customers to offer our products.
I started along side 3 other engineers in the R&amp;D dept. 5 years ago. Along the way, one engineer quit and I got his duties. Another was fired and I got his duties. Then an engineer from the mfg department quit, then I got some of his duties. Then one of the R&amp;D lab technicians passed, so I gotta fill a gap there. Then the boss had a medical emergency and remaining engineer took that responsibility and passed some duties to me.
Anyway, the worst part is not getting more responsibilities, it is that the pay did not go up as expected. 
By now I have been so sick of all this that I cannot see myself continue here.
I thought with all these skills, I could apply to other positions in the area and go to a better position.

36,Gear ratios and star wheels (indexing),1564071069,"Hi Folks, 

&amp;#x200B;

something I though would be very simple has me stumped, and it pertains to gears and gear ratios. 

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario: 

I have one star wheel (indexing table) which has pockets along its circumference, used to position bottles along a circular path. I want to use another (smaller) star wheel in conjunction with the larger one, to demount bottles and feed them onto a screw conveyor. 

The following link perfectly demonstrates what I'm attempting to do:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY5\_QwMEIhA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY5_QwMEIhA) 

&amp;#x200B;

The gear ratio of the gears is currently 4:1, so the larger gear drives the bigger star wheel and the smaller star wheel is driven by the smaller driven gear. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologise if this is a little confusing but here's an image of my CAD model.  [https://i.imgur.com/7ZzqW8j.png](https://i.imgur.com/7ZzqW8j.png) 

&amp;#x200B;

The driving gear and the driven gear match up perfectly, and despite the fact that the star wheels are exactly the same (same number of teeth, same diameter), the pockets do not line up as I need them to.

I'm currently designing a duct for a fan silencer. This silencer is to have a ""pod"" in the middle where the fan's hub is located, [like so](https://www.wpmgj.com/portfolio/close-up-of-a-silencer-and-internal-pod/). To increase the airflow pressure after the noise, the duct's diameter should widen toward the end. Now our sheet rolling facilities are a little limited, and making the outer casing cone-shaped would be difficult, so I had the idea of instead making the center pod cone shaped, with the thin end facing away from the fan. 

So here's my question: Would a cone-shaped center pod (getting smaller towards the end) have the same effect on airflow as a cone-shaped casing (getting bigger towards the end)?

56,Is engineering education inherently flawed? So many people on this board make it seem worthless.,1564027413,"There's two avenues of this question I want to explore:

1. So many people on this very board talk about how engineering is 5% what you learn in school and 95% what you learn on the job.  That school is really only good for teaching you how to think, but you don't really need to know all that formula crap.  In that case, is 4 years of college really necessary?  What is the worth of the traditional engineering degree?  Would you hire an 18 year old or 22 year old that didn't graduate with an engineering degree but seemed like they could pick these things up on the job?  The actual process of getting the degree seems so arbitrary in light of all that.

2. I fall under the category of people who were greatly disappointed with actually working as an engineer.  I actually like the theoretical and mathy part of engineering.  Everything from the career fair posters in high school to my college classes and labs made me feel like that was what engineering was.  That I'd be the next Faraday or Watt, sitting at a desk late into the night, deriving equations and calculating obscure phenomena that I would be able to cleverly put into a design that would do something the world had never seen before.  

Call me a pretentious nerd, but I *liked* that idea.  I was annoyed when the bros in college would downplay this math stuff we were learning, cause their dad's friend told them they just needed to get through it for the degree and would never need it again.  Then I graduated, and realized that for 95% of ""engineering"" jobs...they were right.  I job hopped for years where the most math I did was filling out a time card.  I slowly realized I was just doing businessy bullshit with powerpoints and spreadsheets, with a hint of a technical flair.  And I was pissed.

As almost everyone on this subreddit can tell you, ""that's just how it is"".  There's not enough ""fun"" jobs for everyone.  Doing high level design like that is something reserved for experts over a decade or two into their career, who have paid their dues and mastered the basics of their industry.

But then my questions is...why is the typical 4 year engineering degree so weighted towards that type of work?  It almost seems cruel.  It's like a MLM scheme, where you start off by showing the person what they *could* have.  And then say that you have to basically be an indentured servant for 20 years before you can actually be trusted to do that.

Why not have undergrad be 1 year, and barely have anything like surface integrals.  Then you work for 5 years.  Then you get another year of more difficult math and engineering classes.  Then another 5 years of working, etc...  At least I would have had an idea of what I'd be getting into in the immediate term.

I’m an automation technician with 4 years post degree experience and got offered a new job today which would mean switching from a 12hr shift job (days &amp; nights) to a Monday to Friday role which would be a huge plus. 

This company approached me on LinkedIn and we arranged a phone interview and face to face interview. In it naturally enough, salary expectations came up and I said it would have to at least match my current one or beat it as I’m happy where I am. I got the offer today and it’s ~8K below what I currently get. I am happy enough to stay where I am for the time being but getting off shift is a goal for me in the foreseeable future. In actual fact having heard other salaries for other roles there I expected them to beat my expectations.

The relay turns on again after the breaker is reconnected. I thought this is strange, if the relay is powered by the same source that it is monitoring, isn't that dangerous? In the even of a fault, the current will be high and the relay will be the first to get damaged, if so how can it send a trip signal to the circuit breaker?

I asked the staff isn't this design flawed? But he told me high current is harmless to the circuits of the relay, only high voltage will damage the electronics of the relay.

76,I don’t feel like an engineer. I’m embarrassed. Does anyone have resources that I could use to teach myself engineering skills/language?,1563983001,"I know I’m going to sound like a dumbass. 
Bare with me.
I’m majoring in Mechanical engineering, going into my last year. I started off knowing absolutely nothing about engineering &amp; hated physics (because It was hard for me to understand conceptually). I did like  math though, especially calculus. 
Anyway, I came in with no “engineering skills,” so I purposely made myself take a coding class to learn python (just an intro course) and I took a machine shop class (learned how to use the mill and the lathe- although I wouldn’t voluntarily ever go back and use them because they still terrify me/ I’ve forgotten a lot of the steps/rules). 

Anyway, I also took a machine elements class that taught all about machine parts (bearings, gears, etc) and we built an RC car (in teams). My teams car, of course, ended up not working right before the race &amp; failed to run. 

But, in all of these mechanic-y type classes, I still feel like I wasn’t able to absorb anything. It’s like my brain just isn’t meant to think mechanically or IDK! 

I STILL DONT KNOW ANYTHING about mechanics! I learn and then just forget. So I don’t know anything about building something- what parts are needed (like gears, bearings and whatever else) and how engines work or generators or just anything like that. I feel like a total failure. 3 years of college and I don’t know anything. And I always felt, in my mechanical engineering courses, that maybe I shouldn’t have majored in engineering because my brain just doesn’t seem to absorb or grasp any of these mechanical processes. Maybe I should’ve gone down a less hands-on route...like biology.

I just don’t feel like an engineer. I do like engineering because of the creativity and problem solving involved. 

But I’m just so frustrated that I don’t have any real engineering knowledge or skills, and I feel so stupid. I’m doing an internship this summer and we were each given projects. One of the guys built a type of sensor from scratch!! I could never!! I wouldn’t even know how to start. 

All I designed was just a container that catches sand and filters out water (through mesh sheets)- the welders here will build it and then I can test it out. But it was so easy to design because it was just a box! I didn’t need to think about machine parts or anything like that- just dimensions. 

For these reasons, I feel that I have to work in something non-engineering after I graduate because I don’t want to embarrass myself / reveal to other engineers that I am ...not really an engineer.

PS I’m a total FRAUD! I have a 3.9 gpa which would make you think I really learned everything (which I might’ve in the moment) but it’s all gone! I know nothing now. :(((((

***Basically, I just want to think more like a mechanic.  I want to be able to talk to an engineer about valves &amp; bearings &amp; engines &amp; pressures &amp; fluid flow &amp; heat transfer- all of which I took classes for but just learned/forgot everything!!!! What book or resource could I use that would teach me all of this in a simple way, that could make me more like an engineer? Should I just watch YouTube videos of people building parts? Maybe what I’m missing is application of principles I learned?***",AskEngineers,False,dollarinoz,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ch9tex/i_dont_feel_like_an_engineer_im_embarrassed_does/

I'm an EE by trade, so I'm not sure what all is the right terminology.

I understand how the cyclone separator works and how the centrifugal fan works, but I'm curious about the exhaust airflow after the air leaves the impeller. The original vacuum had vents on either side for air to exit the enclosure and I see other commercial centrifugal fans redirect the exhaust to one side. However, generally speaking, is it possible to exhaust the air perpendicular in direction to the impeller/parallel in direction with the intake without significant loss of power? I'm 3d printing the design and don't really want to design in a bunch of holes in the enclosure wall with the way I'm planning on printing it.

82,Changing Roles and Aerospace Industry Sector at the Same Time - Feasible?,1563975376," 

Hello!

I was hoping someone could provide some advice on how to change my current situation. I am currently an analyst (CFD &amp; FEA/Stress) at an engineering services company in the aerospace (gas turbine) industry. I have been trying to change roles and get into the commercial space sector for about a year now, but have had little luck getting interviews. I have a decent variety of experience, which seems to make me under-qualified for most positions that I find.

**What I want to do:** I want to get out of engineering services; current job security is questionable. My ideal job would be something more along the lines of project/design engineering on propulsion systems. Something less focused on just analysis, and with a larger variety of day-to-day functions.

**My experience:** Bachelors and Masters in aerospace engineering. \~ 1 year as sales engineer, \~2.5 years of FEA/Stress analysis, and \~0.5 years of CFD. No relevant extra-curriculars or internships from college (I was dumb).

I think my best chance to change sectors would be to find a position that plays to my FEA/Stress experience, but I don't want to get stuck in analysis. I know I'm the kind of person that gets bored in a position with limited scope.

**The questions:**

1. How do I leverage my variety of experience to make me stand out in an industry where ""relevant"" experience seems to be the most valuable asset?
2. Is it realistic to try and change industry sectors AND job functions at the same time?

86,Rough design of a axial flow pump used for thrust,1563966587,"As part of a prototype I need to design an axial flow pump that will provide thrust to a submerged device. Further design will be done by a PE with expertise in the field, but I need to get 90% there in order to prove the concept. As it happens, I have never touched pump or hydrofoil design, so please bear with me and my ignorance.

[This](https://imgur.com/XYGbYdZ) is the main idea of the pump. Water goes in from the right, powered by a propeller inside the casing, and comes out to the left via some radial outlets. I want to maximize thrust.

OD of the assembly is 50mm, and at this moment I'm designing for a 45mm propeller. I have some control over the interior taper angle, but for machinability considerations I should stay above 25 degrees. Since higher than that would mean less axial thrust, I believe it should be as low as possible, so 25 degrees. The fillet diameter at the base of the outlet can be larger (i.e. can be blended into the motor casing more than shown in the figure), so that is something I plan on maximizing as well.

However, now comes the part that I don't quite know, but only have a very rough idea. My intuition says that the [sudden constriction at the outlet](https://imgur.com/J3fefG8) may create some issues, so I was thinking of increasing the wall thickness [within the casing](https://imgur.com/dydU07g) to create a chamber where pressure buildup is ""nice"" (linear?) and then maintain a constant cross section until the outlet.

**1. First of all, would this have any chance of improving thrust?**

**2. Cross section should be computed normal to the water flow?**

**3. What are the dimensions that I should be tuning in this design?**

**4. Would some exterior (overhung) guides [help improve](https://imgur.com/TjEfc9v) flow?**

9,Transferring or looking for new options?,1563926679,"Hi everyone,

Currently  I’ve working as a grad for the last 1.5 yrs (doing Geotech and bridge  work at a big company +1500 employees). I’ve decided that I want to  pursue a career in transportation engineering and hence I am looking for  career options to achieve this.

At  the moment, my local office that does not have projects related to this  field, so I am thinking to talk to my manager to see what options do I  have to transfer to another office that gives me those opportunities. I  have also started to look at other companies just in case (the town  where I live is small so not many opportunities in this field here). I  am planning to complete two years here and then transfer/change.

My question are:

1. When  talking to my manager about transferring options, do I let him know  that I am also looking for opportunities in other companies? Reason is  since I have only had one job, the only work reference I have for new  applications is this current one and he might get contacted for  referral.
2. I  might have an interview with a government transport entity for their  emerging talent programme. As far as career development, do you guys  think should I pursue staying with the same company (provided I can  change to a transport field) or pursue the other role starting from a  grad role again but in a entity that is much more related to transport.

14,How can I calculate if my steel is strong enough for the load?,1563915305,"I'm trying to construct a desk for a home office, however my knowledge of metal and load is somewhat limited.

What I'm trying to establish is if the frame I want constructed is strong enough to take the load of my desk. This doesn't need to be any fancy calculation, even a good yes/no from someone who knows these things would be fine

As in the images below, the desk is an L shape. Along the outer edges, its 2.1m along the shortest edge and 2.52m along the longest edge.

As can be seen in the 2nd image in the album, there is a 1.9m span where I need to make sure it won't sag. I'm basing this roughly on that a person should be able to sit on it without causing any issues.

The desktop itself will be made from either a 40mm veneered plywood or a 40mm full staved Oak kitchen worktop.

The box section for the frame is made from 75mm x 25mm steel. On the longest space, the section across the front of the desk is laid flat, so that it is only 25mm in height.

Do you think that this piece of steel that spans 2.5m left to right is enough to support the 75cm deep desk that will sit on top of it without flexing? If the question isn't clear, I've drawn on the 3rd image where my concern lies

I was just wondering if anyone had advice on what would be a decent path for getting a job that involves CFD/FEA and thermal design. (or if it is even possible at this point). Should I be going for experience in a somewhat related industry, or personal projects directly related to thermal design?

&amp;#x200B;

I have just graduated with a B.S and M.S. in Petroleum engineering a few months ago, and defended my thesis around February. There really aren't that many jobs in the Petroleum engineering industry that involve simulation (outside of reservoir simulation, geomechanics, 1D flow through pipes, and some other topics that I am uninterested in). Most job postings involving CFD are in mechanical/chemical/aerospace, so that's what I've been applying to.

Over the past month, I have basically just been applying to every entry level CFD role possible, just to gauge my options. I have landed no interviews for thermal simulation jobs, and there really aren't that many entry level positions in my main area of interest (electronics cooling).

I also understand my bachelor's in aerospace engineering (no internships) would set me at a starting salary of $50 \~ $60 (with no relocation benefits). At this point, I've been pretty burnt out after college losing the starry eyed desire to make something as an engineer but the wages also hurt. Granted I know money shouldn't be a priority but personal financial issues since my youth have slowly skewed my vision throughout college.

49,Advice in field change,1563858957,"Hi everyone, 

Currently I’ve working as a grad for the last 1.5 yrs (doing Geotech and bridge work at a big company +1500 employees). I’ve decided that I want to pursue a career in transportation engineering and hence I am looking for career options to achieve this.

At the moment, my local office that does not have projects related to this field, so I am thinking to talk to my manager to see what options do I have to transfer to another office that gives me those opportunities. I have also started to look at other companies just in case (the town where I live is small so not many opportunities in this field here). I am planning to complete two years here and then transfer/change.

My question are:

1.  When talking to my manager about transferring options, do I let him know that I am also looking for opportunities in other companies? Reason is since I have only had one job, the only work reference I have for new applications is this current one and he might get contacted for referral.

2. I might have an interview with a government transport entity for their emerging talent programme. As far as career development, do you guys think should I pursue staying with the same company (provided I can change to a transport field) or pursue the other role starting from a grad role again but in a entity that is much more related to transport.

In the beginning of April, I accepted a job offer dealing with nuclear/Navy work. This means I need a Top Secret security clearance, and the process has been so ridiculously handled that my slated start date is looking to be late December.

I’m not super attached to this job. I originally wanted to go for a master’s or PhD in aerospace - which I’m now looking at a bit more seriously, since this job is looking less and less likely. I’ve also been throwing a ton of applications at aerospace &amp; defense companies in the meantime.

So now I’m in a position where I’m not doing anything; I have to either wait for this job to start, for another job offer to arise, or for grad school to start. None of these will happen in at least 3-4 months.

Any ideas what I should do with this “waiting” time? (Do you know any companies that do fall internships? Nonprofits? Short-term abroad opportunities?) I haven’t found much, since I don’t have student status anymore. I should note: I’m working part time in a lab, but it’s a job I can leave at a week’s notice.

I’m considering BME because I have an interest in pharmaceuticals, and considering energy engineering since the courses sound incredibly interesting.


I assume getting one of these concentrations is largely useless and should be achieved for my own benefit, but are there any companies or areas that would value it? My last internship, for example, was at a leading space &amp; defense R&amp;D lab.

I went to comm. college for 2 years to figure out what I wanted to do and get some Gen Eds out of the way. While there I was a CIS major but I switched to engineering when I transferred 2 years ago and have about 110 credits now. I ended up having to retake calc 1 and physics 1 but have passed them both and made it through calc 3, but that set me back a little. I'd like to graduatw ASAP as I'm almost 23 and want to start working and move away with my SO who graduates in the Spring 2020. I originally was planning to go for a Mech concentration but I would likely have to do an extra semester or two and wouldn't graduate until 2021. My college offers a BS in Engineering with no concentration, which would get rid of around 8 classes (I haven't taken any of them yet) I would have to take if I went for the ME concentration. If I drop the concentration I can likely graduate in the Spring of 2020 with all of my peers and SO. 

For some background, I've had a part time job as the shop technicians only assistant at my school and have gained a lot of design and machining experience there. I am also currently living on my own doing a full-time  paid internship across the country at a control systems company in Colorado for the summer. This internship and school job have  given me a huge amount of experience doing both field work and desk CAD stuff and I have a pretty good resume at this point compared to my peers. 

My main question is, how important is the ME concentration at this point? Is it worth spending an extra semester, or possibly two, getting the concentration, or can I just graduate with a BSE?

- Regular engineers vs consultants, regular engineers start of with a little higher base salary but pay stagnates for a longer period of time. Where as consultants start off with a little lower base salary but depending on performance they have the potential to make a lot more. 
- Create a sizeable client list and when you have enough experience in the field create your own firm and deal with clients directly.

Should I study again I am 3 and maybe graduate closing on 40 years old, my life is RUINED because I decided to study this almost useless field.

I dont get Environmental Engineering, if it is useless who decided that this be an independent branch. Atleast, make if a specialization of Civil, why and who was so dumb and stupid and good for nothing who made this field an independent field of its own. Just close every single Environmental Engineering department around the globe and put it as part of Civil Engineering and ask the Environmental Engineers who already graduated to do few extra courses so that they are ready for the real world.

I am very confused about this field, I really dont know what to do anymore. I want to work and do something with my life but nothing is helping, it is the biggegst regret of my life and a cause so far of my misery. Should I study again, it is hard to start at34 or 35. Which Vile human being made this a field of its own. A lot of people say it is a good needed field a lot says it is absolutely useless. I dont what to do. I have posted thousands of times on Environmental Engineering. This is an issue because I do not know how to sell myself anymore.

86,Advice for the future. Is Offshore Engineering a good choice?,1563818829,"Background

I'm from the UK (North East) and have recently finished my degree in Mechanical Engineering. Before the degree, I served my apprenticeship and spent 4 years working in a company which was primarily oil and gas (~85%) but also featured defence and aerospace.

I'm hoping to keep the ball rolling and continue onto Masters, but I'm not sure which course would be the best to pursue. 

My original plan was to go back to oil and gas, obviously pays the best, and in the North East there isn't a lot of other options. I also wouldn't mind working offshore, on the rigs in the North Sea. The problem, since 2014 oil and gas has slowed and it seems like a dying trade, so I'm worried about doing a Masters in this area only for it to become redundant.

Aside from that, I would like to get into renewables, it certainly seems like the world is trending that way, but the UK market has slowed down due to a lack of government interest, and I there's a lack of opportunities for renewables in my area.

​

Master Courses

Mechanical Engineering MSc

This is the safe bet, just more of the same, but I've got slight trepidation because I'm not specialising in any way. A bonus of the course is it covers vehicle drive, which could be particularly useful as there is a Nissan plant in the area, which is a huge employer locally.

​

Offshore Engineering MSc

This course obviously has a focus on oil and gas offshore platforms, but it also includes courses on marine systems to produce renewable energy. I'm strongly considering this course because of the included renewable modules; I feel that it might provide the best of both worlds, and leave me less at risk

​

Pipeline Engineering Msc

This is a risky bet, purely pipline engineering for oil and gas industry. With oil and gas slowing down I would guess there's very little need for pipeline engineering, let alone a graduate.

​

Subsea Engineering and Management MSc

Again this seems a risky bet, as it is subsea in oil and gas. Again same risks as pipeline. Also the teaching of this course seems to be different from what I'm used to.

​

Note: All courses are accredited by the Engineering Council and achieve the required educational requirements for Chartership

​

My Thoughts

Currently, my head is a toss-up between Mechanical Engineering and Offshore Engineering. Mech is the safe bet and can't go wrong with the qualification. Offshore could potentially open doors to a lucrative industry without leaving me entirely at risk of being overly specialised in a (possibly) dying trade.

I included Pipeline and Subsea as they were the careers I planned on going into before the collapse, but since the market still hasn't recovered I think it's too risky. There's been a lot of layoffs in the north sea already, so even if new opportunities did open up I'd be bottom of the list with my lack of experience.

Any thoughts or advice is much appreciated. I'm trying to gauge what wiser heads think is the best path to take.

I want to get better at doing projects and why not slowly build up to that as a goal lol. So the idea is to have water be heated to around 65 degrees C and then have a small volume of water (a couple mL) to hit the pest up to a metre away. I have a few ideas I wanted to evaluate and want your suggestions and thoughts:

1) Electrolysis: What if I ran a current through my vessel which would heat up my water and also create hydrogen/oxygen gases to pressurize the vessel and use that pressure to eject water at a high velocity hitting the target at a distance. Probably have the smaller vessel to do the electrolysis and then recharge using the larger one after a shot is fired. I got this idea from looking up water heater DIY on youtube. Thanks my fellow brown people. I don't really think it's entirely safe with those gases even in small quantities and it'd be worse if I was asleep and my sentry decided it was time to start a fire...

2) Hot nozzle: I use a pump to push water out of a long but small diameter nozzle which shoots water at high velocity. But        I have some method of heating this nozzle to the right temperature and the contact of the water with the nozzle is enough to have the leaving liquid be around the right temperature

3) Simple: I preheat all of the water in my reservoir to the temperature I want and keep it hot using temperature sensors. The reason I might want to avoid this one is because of the constant heat loss and energy efficiency. I suppose to fire the water i can use another hydraulic pump or something. 

I'm new to robotics but I have an idea of how to do the sentry but not so much when it comes to ~~frying~~  firing the gun.

15,Full time post-grad job as an extreme introvert,1563768998,"My older brother got his civil engineering degree 1.5 years ago and has been searching for a post-grad job ever since. My parents told me the other day that he was labeled as autistic at a young age, and they never accepted to use that label all these years considering how much generalization and pressure he would receive in society.  I always had a hunch since he is far from a good conversationalist (hard to start any convo even at home, no small talk, prolonged stuttering in the middle of pronounciation). Meanwhile, his intellect and work ethic would be very dependable (he would do almost anything a manager says with immense attention to detail). He has never needed to attended a special needs class his whole life, as he has enough common sense judgement to get an engineering degree, be a safe driver on the road, and work as a tax accountant, and as a team lead at a food concession.

At this point, he has been living with my parents and I while continuously getting turned down interview after interview.  Most interviews come over the phone, and it's usually either the stuttering, or his endless blurb of irrelevant details to the job (i.e. easily 2 full minutes talking about how he would need to put aside his part time job to travel 5 hours to Toronto to attend an in person interview) that burn him. He also doesn't seem to learn from these misteps even after my parents or I remind him of some guidelines to stay on track. His notion of receiving a phone call from the employer is that he can put aside the rest of his job search entirely and it will be smooth sailing from there on out.

Through this entire time my mom has pushed him into some part time occupansies (aforementioned food concessions, tax office, post office) and a web development course. He refuses though to get too involved in any of those (especially tax accountant) because they're not engineering, and as such, does not think of any transferrable skills worth mentioning in job applications. I myself am studying civil engineering (finishing 3rd year) now so would spend up to 5 hours some relatively chill weekends sitting by his side to guide him into highlighting concise and relevant details in applications (specifically surveying, AutoCAD,  highway transportation), instead of his endless clusterf\*k of run-on sentences in his resume. With work experience related to the field, most importantly he has 12 months worth of Project Management internship experience working at the Canadian federal government. However, I don't get the impression that he particularly enjoyed it there, or would want to / do well in such Project Management positions due to the high communication demand / nature.

17,Got an internship,1563763096,"Hey guys,

I will be starting an internship tomorrow working for a city. It's a year-long internship and I'll be working full-time until end of summer. The thing is, I'm a mechanical engineering student by degree. I noticed personally I'm actually a good candidate and got a few interviews before this one I landed with mechanical-based internships but they didn't end up working out due to timing and even a position cancellation. I'm also intrigued with a couple of other fields including civil and biomedical which is why I applied for this one to get perhaps experience in the civil side. Plus, I feel blessed to get an internship after several denials. But, I've sharpened my interview skills and resume as well as my exit strategy which actually made a huge difference!  

My question is, to engineers and people with internship experience, is this position worth it? I'm willing to walk away from this if it tends to lean away from this complimenting my education. Here are some of the tasks I will be doing, it's a ""zoning internship"":

 Conducting field inspections to verify compliance with a number of zoning approvals Sending correction orders for noncompliance with conditions of such approvals Entering documentation into a data base Researching property information and preparing summary spreadsheets Providing customer service Reviewing plans for single family dwellings for compliance with zoning and design standards Providing development review for basic storm water runoff practices Assisting with administrative functions for storm water management regulations Assisting with wetland or floodplain procedural tasks

I need to pull a vacuum on a balloon full of small-ish particles, and then I need to seal off the vacuum in the balloon as/before I detach it from the machine. The valve I need would have to: 

1) have some kind of a mesh filter on it to keep the particles in the balloon and not in the pump (this could probably be added through some other attachment, so I'm less worried about that), and 

2) it would have to hold the vacuum as it was detached from the pump. (It doesn't need to be incredibly strong, it just has to last reasonably well for a couple of days). 

The seal could be made even tighter after removal from the pump, but no big gains in pressure should happen as it's removed.

* connected
* returning correct values
* the sensor that should be connected

how can i test if those  criteria are fulfilled?

i know that some sensors have the deviceID and manufacturerID saved in some register so i can compare those.

for the other two criteria my current  approach is to just try and read the data and compare if they are within an range of expectation/ if it can be read from the sensor.

How is this done on professional level?

30,Why don't trucks use CVT's,1563741031,"So I was reading up on CVT's on the weekend, and it seems the biggest advantage is the vehicle can sit in its optimum torque/power spot and just pull with the minimum variance of rev changes.

This means the cars are more fuel efficient essentially having a single infinite gear ratio.

Which makes me wonder, why don't trucks use CVT's?

Surely if a truck can run more efficiently, that's a good thing, most companies are going to automated manuals for the efficiency gains, as they'll often do better in gear selection than a driver, as the motivation is different, drivers often aren't concerned about company fuel, they just want to get there, and if it costs them fuel, who cares?

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated with my Bachelors in mechanical engineering and was in my schools (Virginia Tech) accelerated masters program for aerospace engineering. Ive had some great experiences with internships, design teams and research doing a little bit of everything and learning so much in the process. Some coding in Matlab, manufacturing, design, using 4 major CAD programs, internships at large defense companies and smaller companies, work with aircraft, satellites, testing, helicopters and nothing has really stuck with me as something that got me excited to go to work everyday and felt like a ""passion""

&amp;#x200B;

I am doing my masters in aerospace because that is the industry I wanted to work in most and am planning on doing research and focusing on autonomous systems with controls and dynamics and all that fun stuff. But I have seen a lot of aerospace engineering jobs just being desk jobs with more paperwork than solving problems. I think ill like the controls  more than design work where myself and the other design engineers seem to spend most of there time making drawing changes and dealing with quality and getting approval for small changes and that's definitely not something I want to do. Maybe its just because its at a large defense contractor that this exists but I saw similar work at the smaller company I worked for too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love working with my hands, im good at math and physics in general, and I enjoy being challenged and solving problems which is what got me into engineering in the first place. I also enjoy learning and doing new things and being the guy who ""wears a lot of hats"". One thing that seems to be the most passionate for me is research done in exercise science, specifically on endurance sports and running. This is just because I am a big runner and triathlete so I actually read a lot on the topic. But I have no idea what kind of jobs exist in that field and what sort of experience will set me up for that. So if anyone has any experience in that aspect of engineering id love to hear what you have to say. But Im not a fan of desk jobs and working in a depressing cubicle everyday but I dont know what kind of hands on engineering exists besides testing which ended up being very monotonous from my experiences",AskEngineers,False,wolfgang__1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cfrwci/going_into_final_year_of_aerospace_masters_and/

I've been scared to ask for help here because I know my degree isn't helping one bit. My degree took me 6 years because I switched from accounting (no fun) to computer science (bigger mistake) at a state uni to systems engineering at my local university. I am from texas Btw.


I've read the insignificance of a systems degree but due to some financial restraints, I returned back home to finish my degree. I enrolled myself to receive a manufacturing/mechanical masters program at a state university and I just completed my first full year.  

I work part time as a cash controller specialist through my school years. It has helped me financially for my grad school. I have no engineering experience, other than being the head of EE's assistant. 

I am lost. I've applied since graduation of my bachelors because I wanted a job and not go to school but I couldn't find anything. I returned back to school because I couldn't find a job. I applied this summer everywhere in Hope of grabbing a job. Not one interview. I returned back to school because I felt my degree was worth shit to me. 

My gpa was a 3.2 in Bach and a 3.3 in grad. I don't know what other details you might need but I can answer. I honestly don't even want to start on my thesis because I would rather work. But I can't find a job anywhere. I've applied to every possible entry level job and I only got one offer for a contracting job as a engineering tech for 18 months. I didn't think it was worth it to take it because I felt as if I wouldn't be able to find a job after or near those 18 months.

If I work as a cyclotron engineer I would still live in the expensive Bay area, but making $41/hr.  In addition school would have to dropped.

I have been working with this company for 8 years now, I recently transferred to a new department that I really like and honestly, I needed a new challenge.
My previous manager(s) all loved me, we had a very good relationship and they always trusted me. I am a hard worker and honestly an overall good engineer. I believe I am also very good with dealing with people (colleagues, customers, managers, etc...)

Some background on the new job... This is a new team, my manager is a nice guy, smart but he doesn't know the details of my new job. He told me to work with my colleague who is a senior engineer and learn from him. I was very excited since I really needed a mentor in this new area, but quickly things took the wrong turn. The senior colleague is absolutely clueless, he knows how to BS his way through things but he really has no clue about this domain (or any other domain really, he's just a poor engineer with 20 years of experience).
Since I really care about my work, I started reaching out to our colleagues overseas for advice and technical questions, but my manager has mentioned multiple times that I need to reach out to my mentor colleague first. I usually acknowledge his comment and move on, but I feel he is starting to realize I am avoiding this guy. My main problem is that everytime I talk to the mentor, he gives me really wrong advice and answers (like obviously wrong), and I have to go get the right answers and somehow explain to him and my manager why I ignored his advice. At some times, I feel like I just wanna walk straight to my manager and let it all out, I wanna tell him the guy is really clueless, and he is slowing me down. I have always been good at what I do, and I am afraid I won't be good here because of this situation.
I don't want him fired and I don't wanna hurt his career, but I want to explain to my boss that I am not OK with mediocre work. I wanna be the best version I can be of myself.

76,Second master's degree vs graduate certificate in HFE,1563641336,"Hi guys,

I am working as a biomedical engineer with a master's degree in bioengineering. 

I have only been out of school and working at my current job for about a year. In my current position, I am responsible for a lot of our human factors and usability related tasks, but we work with a human factors firm for the majority of the real work. I mostly just help keep things organized and in schedule since I don't have any real human factors or usability experience (aside from working with my current company's product in hospitals while I was in grad school). 

I really enjoy human factors so far and am considering going back to school in some capacity to develop my human factors skills. 

The biggest limiting factor is that I want to continue at my current job, and the university in my area does not offer any human factors related graduate programs, so I would have to do something online. 

So I have a couple questions:

1. With already having a master's degree in bioengineering, does it make sense to get a second master's in human factors?

 If so, does human factors vs. human factors engineering make a difference (I've seen programs for both)?

2. Would a graduate certificate be as valuable as another master's degree? Obviously the master's is more in depth and intensive, but my end goal is the steer my career to be able to be a human factors engineer. So with my current education/experience, I'm not sure which makes more sense. The master's is obviously more time consuming and expensive, so I would only want to do that if the reward is greater in the long run for a degree vs a certificate. 

3. Would an online program in this area be frowned upon?

4. Finally, does anyone know of any good programs (degrees or certificates) that are offered online in this area? I've found an online degree through Wright State and a certificate through Penn State.

I'm just confused because I thought i knew university is the right choice, like that im an ""academic"" guy from an ethnic minority and poor background to go to uni make money and make my mum proud and all that yadayada if that makes sense?  but that doesn't seem the case, first of all uni is like 30k debt in the uk  and sufficient engineering experience is lacking once you graduate so you struggle to find a job, looking at some jobs online they all ask for experience, the ones that ask for a degree state: \*or appropriate experience \*. But also some figures state people who graduate from a good Russell group uni (like me aspiring for ucl) earn a lot more money than their apprenticeship counterparts, but this was a general figure not specific to engineering so idk. Ive been doing a summer workshop thing at UCL this past week where Ive had to read a bunch of scientific articles on chemical engineering and molecular dynamics and that bored me so much which made me think if uni is actually right for me.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest fear about apprenticeships is: its specific the skills arent as transferrable as a degree so less wider prospects, I really want to move away fom the uk as soon as possible, its my first priority i dont like it here its not for me and id like to go to a country which pays their engineers better, (i love canada). Im not sure how true this is but are degrees more recognised by international employers, will doing an apprenticeship therefore mess up my chances of being considered internationally and be stuck in the uk forever?

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a vacuum chamber, its pretty neat and I seriously underutilized it (any suggestions for cool things?) To re-pressurize the chamber I remove a cap from a fitting that looks a lot like this one.

 [https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTPP9mCUFKA5DkDet4mayEJ7igV4eVCHfuVMDpArjp3AQiYwbFc4w](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTPP9mCUFKA5DkDet4mayEJ7igV4eVCHfuVMDpArjp3AQiYwbFc4w) 

I can get exact specs if need be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the question: When I first remove the fitting the rush of air going through this hole is relatively quiet, I assume at this point the velocity of air is the greatest.

I have been learning a lot  about micro-grids and the ""smart grid"" after being inspired by this  excellent blog post ([http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange](http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange))  and there are clearly some great applications of computer engineering  to this problem but many other solutions I am having a hard time finding  so please link/suggest me something and don't be afraid to be specific.

94,Disillusionment with Programming: A Rant &amp; Call For Help,1563581984,"For some background, I graduated from a state school in Bioengineering and will be pursuing a Master's in Chemical Engineering towards the end of August after working for a year. As a BioE student, I managed to pass my CS courses (intro to C++ and Matlab, mostly) with some difficulty and mostly went through the motions without concerning myself with a visceral understanding of the material.

&amp;#x200B;

The school which I will soon be attending offers ""free"" Coursera courses, and one that looked interesting to me involved data science. I figure if I won't be learning anything for another month or so, I might as well start learning something tangentially academic in the meantime. There is an assignment in that class involving creating a function that will determine the mean of a vector. Typing in what the name of the function should be into Google reveals the exact code one could use to pass the homework assignment, posted by someone who had previously taken the class.

&amp;#x200B;

This led me to identify a common problem I have experienced with my own CS education, which I feel can best be explained by comparison with a similar field of study: mathematics. When doing math classes, I get the feeling that there is a lot of forced repetition in the coursework on problems that are very well defined. For example, spending a week only calculating the derivative of polynomial functions, with homework that amounts to solving a few dozen of such problems, so that the next week is only spent practicing the Product, Quotient, and Chain rules was common practice when I went through Calculus I. In this way, the heavy constraints allow one to truly develop an understanding of how one aspect of the subject works before moving on.

&amp;#x200B;

My experiences learning computer science thus far seems to be the opposite: I see very little that these classes offer in terms of repeating the working out of a specific type of problem, and instead emphasize understanding the components of code. For example, I have had many CS assignments involving only one problem, typically with multiple segments, requiring the student to use for-loops, if-else statements, and conditionals. The difficulty is not in understanding how these control structures work on their own, but rather in making them all interconnect and work with each other to solve a problem which is typically difficult just to define in the first place. I've never seen a computer science instruct students to work separately with if-else statements one week, then conditionals the next, only allowing the two to combine in week three.

&amp;#x200B;

Teaching Calculus I the way CS is typically taught would be like having students only learn the concepts of a limit, derivative, and antiderivative, just to then be expected to prove the fundamental theorem of Calculus within two weeks as a homework assignment.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, and most absurdly, is the ease with which the answers can be found online. The answers to simple, freshman-sophmore level CS classes are so abundant on Stack Exchange and other forums that it is downright difficult to fail to find the aforementioned answers (not that you would want to, since doing such a thing would spell certain death come midterms and/or finals).

&amp;#x200B;

Now we have a system in place where \*\*maybe\*\* understanding the concepts of a limit, derivative, and antiderivative leads us to look up a walkthrough online of how the proof of the fundamental theorem of Calculus is supposed to be derived, and upon regurgitating that proof during homework or on some sort of examination, we are given a certification to state that we have mastered this material. Surely I'm not the only one who thinks this is nuts!

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, this has made me disillusioned with continuing the course. Perhaps this is why I’ve had difficulty pursuing CS outside of required coursework. It seems like unless you're the kind of person who has a voracious, unquenchable desire to learn this material (and God bless you people, it's amazing the stuff you come up with), you will not learn it properly and will instead copy-and-paste code snippets found elsewhere to complete necessary tasks, at which point I can’t help but wonder “What’s the point?”

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who have been in a similar situation, what advice would you give me? Is it possible I am a special case and that not many other people have this experience?

95,"Optimize air flow in a hot black 4"" pvc pipe?",1563579707,"Hi Engineers,  


Looking for thoughts on whether or not air can be moved faster through a pipe.  


I'm building a food dehydrator.  The dehydrator box is in the shade.  I'm putting large black pvc pipes in the sun that will draw air through the dehydrator box.  I'm using heat from the sun, to heat up the black pipe, which then causes air to move out the tops of the pipes.  It works.  I'm wondering if I can make it better by further increasing the air flow.  


Summary:  
Box with a hole in the bottom and side.  
Black pipe stuck in the hold in the side. (like a jeep snorkel)  
Black pipe gets hot, air escapes upwards, this pulls in cold air through the bottom hole in the box.  


Can I optimize air flow in a smooth 4"" pipe so that it will move faster?  (without using fans or additional pipes to increase compression or volume)

For example, a cylindrical tube that is 1"" in diameter, in a hole that is 1.1"" in diameter. The tube is free to move inside the hole, but I want the contact to be able to prevent the tube from escaping the hole. 

The model I am running currently is failing to constrain the tube inside the hole, and thus the model fails due to the tube flying out in space due to rigid body motion. I have tried a LOT of combinations of contact settings with pinball radius, contact stiffness, initial offset and adjustment, adding weak spring elements to guide the tube in the hole, etc.

I have to design a custom reducing tee for this 55 PSI Oxygen pipe system. It is for 3/4'' splitting into (2) 1/2''. For some reason, my boss wants the 3/4'' inlet to be on the branch side of the tee, and (2) straight outlets are 1/2''. My instinct is telling me that is not the way we should do it in term of pressure drop, but I am not sure how bad it can get in the real-life application? Does anyone have any idea whether it is acceptable to place the inlet in the branch of a reducing tee?

Edit: It has to be a Tee. Y splits are not being considered at this time due to some specific difficulty.

43,Help with a 12v motor with a ton of torque?,1563505347,"I need to find a motor that I can control with an arduino. It should be fairly small (maybe 2""x2"", height isn't an issue). The biggest consideration is the amount of torque needed. I don't have a way to know this and so I want to just experiment so I am looking for a recommendation of motor specs to start with. This motor will be turning a screw ""leg"" on a table to adjust the table level. The weight of the table is something like 500lbs, 4 legs. The leg is basically a threaded rod, I think it's 3/8"" coarse thread. 

I can not change the leg thread (although I can replace the piece, but the threads have to stay the same). I don't know what kind of turning force I need, I assume it has some calculation to do with the force of gravity and the torsion that is needed to overcome the friction of the threads? I didn't do well in school :) 

I would think I would have to mount the motor shaft directly to the threaded rod as I can't envision a way to turn the rod any other way. But I am open to all options. 

The rotation speed can be as slow as I want, speed is not an issue. I want to control it with an arduino, so I think it should be a stepper motor? I'm not sure, there is some degree of accuracy needed but precision isn't necessary. 

Can anyone just point me in a direction of a motor? I don't even care if we know it has the right torque, I am happy to test and see.

49,"""Your degree says you can engineer. Specialty doesn't matter.""",1563493909,"I heard this today. The topic was that every student in my social circle at uni is double majoring. About half are taking two engineering degrees, mostly Mech+Aerospace or Computer+Electrical. The other half are doing pairings like Computer Engineering + Computer Science or Chemical + Math. 

We asked an adviser about it and they told us that collecting degrees is usually a waste of time and money unless you're advancing from a BS to an MS or an MS to a PhD. That the real employable skills that your degree represents are the problem-solving and analytical skills, and that once you have one engineering degree, you've proven you can grasp the material properly and thus can train into most other engineering jobs.

They claimed to know chemical engineers that now work on the electrical systems of aircraft, and computer engineers that do civil engineering work, etc. They said that unless you were aiming for research or something very niche and specialized, you could always pick up another engineering discipline on your own later.

Part of the logic was that your degree only really matters for your first job. After that, your resume is what matters far more. So your fancy double majors and triple minors ended up forgotten. So it's better to pursue higher degrees because they take about the same time as picking up lateral degrees. You can spend 2 years going back to school for a chemical engineering degree as a civil engineer, or you can spend those two years getting a master's in civil engineering and likely do better, even in pursuit of chemical engineering jobs.

A secondary point was the importance of extracurriculars and clubs. The advisers implied to us that it was far, far better to join a club like formula racing, concrete canoe, a robotics competition, etc, and get experience working with a group to achieve a goal than to pick up a second major or minors.

So, my social circle is a bunch of workaholics that spend long hours trying to hold down 20 hour semesters in order to get 2 degrees in 4 years. But now we're hearing that the far better approach would be to settle into a cozy 15 hours max and spend the our free time on personal projects and clubs in order to gain experiences to put on our resumes instead of extra degrees.

(Sidenote - doing all this on mobile so obligatory apology for the format)

• I’m going to be a senior at 17 this coming year, and I’ve knocked out a bit of classes for engineering (~80% of the gen-ed courses, math up to diff eq, hopefully physics with calc 1 and 2). The next step after high school is to (hopefully) get National merit or Provost and go to UCF. I have high enough ACT/SAT scores to, just need to get the other requirements done. I want to go to UCF because of two reasons; I’ve grown up on the campus, and because of their music (especially percussion) program. My plan is to get a bachelors (possibly a masters) in mechanical engineering (or material/industrial if I go the accelerated masters route) and go down a career path in instrument design. I have a couple people that have either graduated or are about to graduate from their engineering programs and have spoken quite well about them. However, to do instrument design, I want to be at a school where the staff has connections with designers in the field and just also have a good music program. UCF has both.

The HR generalist says that participation in these events are required, even though they were not mentioned in the job posting or interviews. I only dicovered this mandatory nonsense after I signed my offer letter. I skipped three events since I already feel perfectly ""enriched"" as it is. The events were ""the world's largest intern mixer,"" a tour of the facility's roof, and a ""Toastmasters"" seminar regarding public speaking. 

After I skipped the Toastmasters seminar, HR sent me an email basically saying my internship would be in jeapordy if I continued to blow off all their enriching and enlightening programming. Now the kicker: HR is tellling me and all the interns we need to drive ourselves, during work hours, to a low-income high crime rate Milwaukee neighborhood elementary school and sort books (United Way initiative).

In the UK they don’t let you resit exams 100% but instead cap your mark to 50% and have negative marking. Don’t get me wrong.

There is ongoing construction on the street outside, changing water and hot water pipes but that has been going on longer than I can recall the sound.

I’ve got so much knowledge from engineering  design, I’m amazing at maths, I know fluid mechanics, solid mechanics,  programming ( matlab and C ), material science, electronics, quality  check techniques... and in masters I’ll learn FEA softwares such as  Ansys and CFD... and I’ll these for what ? 40k a year after like 5-10  years ?! So I start from 25-30k a year. So you tell me how’s that fair ?  I feel like I wasted my life, don’t get me wrong I love my course and  mechanics but as an engineer the amount of \*\*\*\* we have to learn and make the amount of stress we go through during our course, the reward is just not good enough ! I’ve been taking to this girl who apparently has a cleaning “ company “ , it’s just her, she literally goes to people’s houses and cleans it and she made enough money in the past year to  buy a brand new Mercedes!!!! Ofc in few years her business will grow up  and will be a proper company. She couldn’t even do 9x8 and this is not a  joke she legit took 2 mins to find the answer!! Now you tell me how’s that fair ?! Why go to uni when you can make tonnes more with a business, I’m planing and Aiming to  open my own firm with the marketing company I’m working for now, and If  I succeed I’ll be making tonnes of money which a poor mechanical senior  engineer would dream of with all that knowledge and years of  experience. A chick on Instagram is making 10x more than that pooor  engineer by showing her body, she doesn’t even have to get naked !!  Now again I ask you what’s the point of uni and difficult courses like engineering when the reward is absolutely nothing to compare with other careers ?! No point of uni and when our society doesn’t reward knowledge anymore.'

9,Need advice on Contracting Position-- Leave Salaried for Better Work for Career Learning?,1563392433,"Background: I'm currently a salaried engineer at a large aerospace company, with good pay out of school (74K), solid benefits after being hired post graduation in 2018. I'm currently in manufacturing, and while there's always more to learn, I'm ready for my next step. Current company is facing a potential Union strike which could literally have me cutting parts on lathes-- Long story short I'm ready to move on. Prior to graduation, I've co-oped at NASA JPL, Raytheon, and Textron Defense Systems. I only have a Bachelors, and ultimately would like to go back for a Masters in Aero/Astronautics and get back to the space industry.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an opportunity to work at one of the best R&amp;D firms in the world, but in a contracting role. This is a mechanical role where I would get the design/implementation/test/analysis work that I'm looking for while working on projects that excite me. I hope to take experiences from this role and turn it into a full-time position here, or somewhere like JPL. Questions for the industry:

1) My goal is to use this as a foot-in-the-door opportunity and potentially get a full-time position down the line. Is this a realistic avenue to getting into some of these elite companies?

2) Is it worth giving up my benefits and stability for much better work environment and long-term career relevancy? (This aspect is a no-brainer IMO)

3) Will it look detrimental career-wise that I took a contracting position? Does anyone even need to know, since resume will still say ""XXR&amp;D FirmXX"" rather than ""XXcontracting company no one knowsXX"" ?  I know I'll be seen as ""2nd class"" in the work environment, but I'm confident I can change that after working with the team overtime.

&amp;#x200B;

11,How would you deal with an obstinate machinist?,1563391681,"The last few projects I've worked with this machinist, Tim (not his real name), I've had to rely heavily on his expertise. When the methods Tim has prescribed fail, he denies the methods he recommended I use. This has happened on at least 3 occasions. 

He’s also claimed to be incapable of tasks only to reverse that position minutes later when a supervisor was present. At this  point, I’m fairly positive he’s been telling me incorrect methods to shift blame for promises to management that he knew he couldn’t deliver. Consequently, I’ve put months into helping him with projects, and while they don't finish on time because of these issues, I've always found a way to deliver usable, accurate results.

A few weeks ago, I requested his help on a project for the first time. Tim said he didn't know how to go about turning the part. When I laid out the simple and obvious procedure (I have a background in operating manual lathes/mills), he suddenly had “safety concerns”, which is a trump card at our company and he knows it. When I proposed solutions to mitigate the safety concerns, he got angry, shouting, “Do you want to turn the parts? Go ahead!” before stomping off.

When I brought it to the administrative staff, they shrugged. “He’s an excellent machinist with 30 years’ experience. If he says it’s not safe, then it’s not safe.”

14,In which field should we start a company? Give us your thoughts,1563389361," 

Hello fellow engineers.

I want to ask for your advice coming from your experience in the world of engineering.

Next year I'll finish my Masters in Eletrical Engineering and I'm looking to build a company.

I   have two friends (both finishing Electrical Engineering with me) that   want to be involved in my project but the problem we are facing is : **""Where to begin?""**, **""How to begin""**, **""Should we begin?""**.

We   all know that the field of Eletrical Engineering as a lot of   specializations such as Energy, Telecommunications, AI Systems, etc...   But the main problem we are facing is **""Where to begin?"".**

I   know that there are consulting companies that would help us try to  find  a common goal and reach for it but, we lack funding. We are all   non-working students that have a dream of building something of our own,   and we want to start as soon as possible.

So the question that I have is:

\- ""If you were going to start a  company, today, 17 July of 2019, in which area/field would you start?""

I'm not asking for your ideas, for your own projects ideas. I'm asking for your answer, for your experienced answer.

We really don't know how big is the market and which problems the market is facing in each field.

**Example:**

\-   When it comes to smart agriculture, we don't know if we should start  an  irrigation system, a greenhouse monitoring system, a weather system.

\- When it comes to home security, we don't know if we should start a locking system, a vigillance system or a tracker system.

We have absolutely no idea in which field we should invest our time in.

Personally,   I would go for the animal field.  I love animals and would love to be   in that field, but as an eletrical engineer is quite dificult to find a   common ground in such contrast fields.

Taking into account your experience as engineers can you give us some of your thoughts regarding this issues?

Rather than show multiple orthographic views, I simply attached text with a leader to the object which read (0.25) THK. The part will be manufactured on a CNC waterjet here in the shop. Though it's part of a larger assembly, our shop checks components on a piece by piece basis, so it is not dimensioned in the final assembly view other than a few locating dimensions.

This isn't the first time this has come up and has been on my mind for a while. I know that general best practice is to show a part in as few views as necessary to convey all meaningful information.

18,When should I explore opportunities elsewhere?,1563385348,"I’ve been in my engineering position(design mostly) for almost 2 years. I was hired directly out of college and was lucky enough to have this position be close to home. However the last 3 months have be quite chaotic in my department. We’ve gone through some managing changes and it seems like there are too many people with power pulling me and people on my team in different directions. A clear example is I am working on a project (project 1) that has a deadline approaching, then suddenly another project(project 2) for another manager becomes more important and gets pushed in front of this. Once the manager of project 1 finds out his project will now be late he pushes that I get his done and then it becomes a power struggle as to which managers project I should work on and I have no guidance from my direct manager. This has been the daily routine for about 3 months and has become increasingly stressful and caused me to lose motivation in my position. 

I love what I do at my position but do not think I can continue with this constant pull in every direction and have no support from my superiors. Another note that has discouraged me is they have posted a position on my team with much higher pay but will have the same job responsibilities, my pay is currently below average for an ME. 

A last note, I am unable to go to a different position due to the size of my company (fairly small) and there is minimal growth I see for me here.

20,Is it worth going to get my masters immediately?,1563385174,"Hello everyone, I am going into my senior year this fall. I'm getting a BA in mechanical and a minor in aerospace.

I am fully set on going to industry, I don't want to be in acedamia. I really enjoy the design aspect of engineering and like actually building things. 

This summer I have been doing a research position and it has got me thinking about my masters. I do want a master's at some point, I want to move up the ladder. Making money is somewhat important to me, I enjoy the freedoms it gives and the things it lets me do. 

I have heard obviously that getting a master's can put you in a different pay bracket and make you more marketable to company's. So is the ROI there for it? I've talked with people that went to industry right out of school and got a company to pay for their masters. I've also talked to people that are going to get their masters right away. 

I think I'd like to get my masters in either business administration in the hopes of being in management some day (for financial reasons) or get in in mechanical engineering because I enjoy the design part though I haven't looked into this enough yet to know what I'd like.

This is an auto-dimming LED circuit.

When I flip the switch, the current flows through the transistor and capacitor and combine to light the LED. As time goes on and the capacitor charges, the current through the control wire of the transistor lowers which causes the current through the transistor output to lower and the LED eventually dims out. If I flip the switch off then on again the LED will stay unlit because the capacitor is still charged and will not allow any current to flow through it, and therefore neither the transistor or the LED. 

If I make a parallel connection around the capacitor (connecting those two open wires at the left with just another wire), I'm creating a way for the current to bypass the capacitor and the LED turns on and off with the switch. I understand all of that.

However, I've also found that making that parallel connection discharges the capacitor. If I remove that extra wire so the circuit is the same as in the beginning, the LED will then do the same as before; stay lit and then slowly dim until the capacitor charges again. Since the LED stays lit for a while, that means the capacitor also stayed discharged while the parallel wire was connected.

I'm not able to figure out why this parallel connection causes the capacitor to discharge. The battery is still connected so it not that the capacitor is needed for it's voltage. What's causing the discharge and why does it stay discharged while there is a parallel connection?",AskEngineers,False,strwrs12,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ceewwf/whats_causing_the_capacitor_in_this_circuit_to/

There is a low level float switch that is wired directly to the controller.  I haven't had time to investigate the programming yet to see why the program allows it to run dry.  I pointed out to my boss that there should be an interlock (relay) electrical preventing power to the pump when the tank is low. He defended the design stating the controller prevent it from going dry, which it clearly doesn't, but that's a different battle.  

So my question is on this small tank would the interlock be a ""good practice"" thing or is it actually a regulation? Knowing the difference will affect my approach of how to present this.",AskEngineers,False,HSDad18,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cebs6p/is_a_motor_low_level_interlock_required_or_just_a/

42,Stagnating as a graduate engineer and I'm not sure what to do.,1563357174,"As the title suggests, I'm currently stagnating at my current job and am lost on what to do. 

After graduating with a bachelor of mech.e with a very subpar GPA, I spent almost 16 months looking for a job and ended up working as a contractor for an assembly plant as an engineer. Unfortunately, the work I do has very little to do with engineering and I've spent 2 years inputting data into excel and putting together basic reports. I'm basically a glorified admin.

I have asked my boss for further challenges but since it's a very large company, we have specialists to do the technical work. I have also asked if my company provided any training but as I'm still in a contract role, it's not available for me.

I have made a list of options that I can go with but some of them are unachievable right now.

1. Find another job. Due to my lack of good experience and low GPA, I have not found any success in this so far after hundreds of applications.

2. Go back for a Master degree while working. I considered this but after researching it quite a bit, I've concluded that Master degrees in my country (Australia) are really just visa baits and not useful for someone wanting to specialise.

3. Work on a portfolio. Probably my best bet, I'm currently trying to find the time as I work 50-60 hours a week due to the nature of the job.

48,Feeling guilty and troubled after internship,1563329289,"Sorry for the long read, but I really would appreciate it if you guys could provide some advice as I really do not know what to do. I’m currently a college student studying engineering (Not from the US).

I finished my very first proper internship at an engineering company (HVAC industry) a couple of  months ago but am troubled over stupid mistakes that I made 1 or 2 months into my internship. My job scope was to be sales support for the sales engineers and included filling out project equipment schedules after AHUs were customised according to the project requirements. 

I had neglected the base height of the AHU units (100mm) and consequently in the dimensions column of the equipment schedule typed in heights that were 100mm lower than it actually should be. I also made stupid mistakes on the dimensions of the VRF units, keying in Height x Width x Depth dimensions as Height x Width x Length. I only found out I had been doing keying in the inaccurate dimensions about 2 months later in my internship after deciding to look through my predecessor’s work files. 

During the initial stages of my internship, I had asked my mentor to check through my work and to correct me for any mistakes but he seemed to have missed out on my mistakes on the dimensions so it probably went unnoticed. He also told me that the schedules given were those still in the early stages of the projects where there was a likely chance of many revisions happening. Would it be the right choice to let them know about the mistakes that occurred so many months ago? Would my mistakes heavily impact their work or any safety or cost concerns? Are those a major mistake that I should let them know about? As far as I know, the completion of the project can take 2 years so the projects would not be completed yet. I still have some of the project files saved in a work thumbdrive too as backup. 

At the same time, I am also worried that this would leave a horrible impression of me for letting them know this late. Since this internship was a graduation requirement for college, I wanted to also make a good impression and pass the evaluation and I also thought it would be awkward to let them know I had been doing it wrongly for the first couple of weeks of the internship. On hindsight, I’m afraid I screwed up even more by dragging it out and not letting them know. I’m also afraid that something might get screwed up along the way if nobody notices the mistakes. It’s not very pleasant either if the client discovers the mistakes…. There is a separate file that describes the specifications for each AHU unit more in-depth but I’m not sure if anybody really checked it either. I had already made some mistakes here and there during my internship, some of which my mentor pointed out, some which I’ve informed him about but those were mistakes regarding tasks that I was presently working on at that time, not mistakes that I had made in the early period of the internship. I guess I’m just not cut out to be in the engineering industry.  

 After I left, the staff in my department have a generally positive impression of me and my mentor also bought me a farewell gift as a token of appreciation. This has been bugging me for a long while now but I was able to put it aside as I started a busy school semester almost right after the internship. I am aware that dragging it longer makes it worse and am open to constructive criticism. I hope to gain some insight on this so that I can make a decision (whether I should let them know about the mistakes made earlier on), close this chapter and move on with my life.

-hands on work, always making adjustments and taking the bird out for test flights

Cons
-not much aerospace work to be done 
-might not be able to apply myself as much as I’d like
-sometimes struggles to have enough work and hours
-broader spectrum of engineering (might be a blessing or curse)


Position 2: re-entry vehicle analysis

I just graduated college with a BS in Civil this spring and went on a job hunt. My first interview was with the FDOT and I got the job! I was also in contact with another private company, but they were taking a while to get back to me about an interview, so I just signed the offer letter with the FDOT. Day after I sent that over, the private company calls and sets up an interview. I went and interviewed just for the hell of it... and actually ended up really liking it. And now they're in the process of sending me over an offer too! I think they would be a better fit because that position is entry level engineering whereas FDOT is more of a technician kind of thing (I only needed a high school diploma for the position). Also the pay is better. 

But I feel really terrible about even thinking about quitting the FDOT *before I even start*. And I'm worried that this would reflect poorly on me in the professional world because I feel like this would burn a bridge with the FDOT.

60,Need Engineering career advice - job as a Process Development Associate II at small but growing biotech vs Systems Engineer at Fortune 500,1563310412,"Here's the summary: I have employment Counter offers - one is a $65k/y + $15k sign on bonus + stock to stay in Tampa, Fl (Associate II) at Biotech Startup vs $83k/y in Miami, Fl, (Engineer II) at Fortune 500, which to choose?

&amp;#x200B;

So I have received competing job offers and I am having trouble deciding which one is the wisest choice financially and most importantly, career-wise.

To give some background, I have a Master's in Biomedical Engineering (and a B.S. in Chemical Eng). After my Bachelor's, I gained a little over a year in Engineering experience, then moved on to obtain my Master's. In February of this year, I began working as a ***Contract*** **Process Development Associate I** at a growing Cancer Immune Cell Therapy Company in Tampa, FL. The position is not strictly engineering, but more late-stage biotech start up type work, which has me doing a lot of biology based experiments in the lab, writing reports, and interacting with Biotech execs from my company in a lot of meetings (I occasionally give presentations in these meetings as well). The company is building a manufacturing facility in Philadelphia to be completed in \~2 years (they use Contract Manufacturing Facilities to make their cell therapy product now) So There is a lot of growth happening here.

However, I just received an offer from Beckman Coulter in Miami, to work as a Systems Engineer II building diagnostic medical devices. This job is definitely more in my field of study, and is really interesting as far as type of work goes, and opportunity for learning new skill (they do a lot of coding/software dev, automation/robotics). It's a large company, also, which seems very attractive to me for a number of reasons, including an interest in moving to some of the states they have facilities in. However, my current employer hit me with a very attractive counter offer when I told them I was going to accept this new job.

So, here's the salary details:

Beckman Coulter Offer (in Miami, Fl):

Salary: $83,000

5% Bonus, and $3000 to relocate (and I'm not extremely stoked about relocating to Miami, but I'm open)

&amp;#x200B;

Current Employer's Counter Offer (in Tampa, Fl)

Salary: $65,000 (which supposedly equates to about $81,000 in Miami, when compared to Tampa, based on some cost of living calculators online)

10% bonus, and $15,000 sign on bonus,

PLUS stock options to buy 1200 shares locked at the current share price of $25/share (so, I'd have 10 years to buy $30,000 in stock from a rapidly growing cell therapy company; I know you may question the stability of a small biotech company, but I assure you that it is very likely to continue to succeed - the stock is very likely to continue to grow)

&amp;#x200B;

On paper, it looks like the offer in Miami is worth more in dollar amount. However, my big hang-up is cost of living in Miami. Based on my internet searches, it looks like 65k in Tampa, FL is roughly similar to 83k in Miami, FL. However, I would have the title of ""Process Development Associate II"" in Tampa, whereas I would be ""Systems **Engineer II**"" in Miami, which I feel like is a more valuable title that will have more earning potential in the future (plus I get to actually do engineering, and not just small/pilot scale biology work)

&amp;#x200B;

71,Two offers from different defense contractors -- seeking advice,1563302323,"Hi folks,

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, I received two job offers from two different defense contractors, let's name them \[Company A\] and \[Company B\]. I am a recent grad and have no professional experience.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Company A\] gave me an offer about 2 weeks ago with only 3 days to answer, so I accepted it on fear of not responding in time (this was because \[Company B\]'s interview wasn't until next week. Just today, \[Company B\] extended their 'conditional offer' to me (the condition being that I need to undergo a security clearance first, and I would be good to start in September if all goes well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have an offer I accepted with \[Company A\] but I want to work with \[Company B\] since their benefits, pay, and job role is a lot more appealing to me. But I do not want to sit around for 2 months with no work waiting for \[Company B\], with the addition of it not being a sure shot because \[Company B\] says the contract may change and they cannot GUARANTEE a position come September. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I am facing: \[Company B\] is going to start the clearance process for me in a few days, whereas \[Company A\] has not. I am afraid that while working at \[Company A\] that they will start the clearance process with me and see that \[Company B\] has already started the process. Is there anyway for me to work at \[Company A\] for the meanwhile \[Company B\] finishes the clearance process and extends an offer in September?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry it's a lot of text, but please let me know if you need additional details or have any questions. I'd be glad to answer and take in any advice that I can. I'm not sure if others have been in the same situation, but I figured I would shoot my shot on here.

I'm an American high school senior going into the college application process, and I have a few questions about accreditation. I'm attracted to the UK university system more than that of the US, as it focuses directly on your major the entire time you're in school instead of spending the first few years shilly-shallying around on further general education. This also means that a UK bachelor's degree takes three years instead of four, and a master's only takes one additional year. However, I'm not sure how a UK degree would be received by American employers. So here's my question for you: how does UK degree accreditation compare to US accreditation?

Two years ago I did four weeks of work experience in the summer as part of a scheme here in the UK called a 'Nuffield research placement'. As part of this placement, you're placed in the R&amp;D dept. of a company which is roughly to do with what you're studying at the time. You do something specific to the company and write a report about it, then present a scientific poster that you make at an evening with other people who had a placement. 

So I kept in contact with my mentor but I hadn't spoken to them since I started university around a year ago. I got an email recently asking 'how's it going, is university treating you ok?'

I've typed out a response to their question, but I'm also aware that at this stage I should keep options open for internships and similar work experience opportunities. On my last day there, there was mention of future internships and summer jobs. However, this was two years ago and I've not mentioned it since. I've mentioned things that I've struggled with and the things I've excelled in. 

My questions:

How do I maintain a friendly but also *professional* dialogue?

How much do I open up about potential weaknesses?

How do I talk about strengths without sounding arrogant?

How do I approach the topic of work experience and internships for next summer?

1,[Advice] Winter job for someone looking into ME or CE?,1563257592,"Hi everybody, I've done some searching on this and other subreddits and have some ideas, but was just curious or looking for ideas I haven't read yet (but, sorry for another 'help me with my career' post). I'm working as a wildland firefighter during summers at the moment, but I don't think I'll stay with this profession forever, though may do it for several more years. Don't have a degree. I'm looking for suggestions or advice on entry level jobs that are loosely related to Mech or Civil (thinking like: machinist, construction) that I could get during my off season of Nov-May to just kind of get a feel for the fields and what I'd want to do in them.

I'm 24 right now and have been seriously contemplating going to school for something along the lines of Mechanical or Civi, either associates or bachelors. Grew up always building things, playing with legos, k'nex, erector sets, taking things apart, building forts, etc. I always wanted to be an architect as a kid. I'm very hands on. I like to figure out how things work. I took one AutoCad class in highschool and it was super fun and I excelled in it. From what I've read getting a bachelors in either field is a lot of math (my worst subject in school, for lack of focus and support at home, not specifically bad at it or unwilling to work hard at learning it) and on the job a lot of theory and office type stuff which is not really something I'm wanting to do, at least for the foreseeable future. Mechanical Engineering Technician has been the biggest thing that has stood out to me, as it seems more hands on and you can do a lot with it, in regards to an associates degree. Also, I don't want to throw away money on a degree if there's a job that pays well with no degree or apprentice path for something I would like. I'm very set on making decent money and trying to retire early-ish, or at least be financially independent, which seems you usually need a degree to get a job that makes that type of money. Forest firefighting will not do that for me as fun as the job is. It's also tough to have any life outside of work for six months with it, which I do not like.

I guess I'm just seeing if anyone here has any insight here to an entry level job or something that would give me a good overview or glance into these fields and help me figure out something more specific within them to aim for. I know I'm still relatively young, but feel like time is ticking for starting a career like this. Things like carpenter, ironworker, mason, ship engineer, mechatronics, civil engineer and drafter all kind of stand out to me. I'm unfortunately one of those people that wants to do everything as a job. I think I've had close to 20 jobs in the last six years, all of them slowly kind of helping me learn the things I don't like to do, haha.

I am most interested in electrical flight hardware - flight computers, radar, thermal sensing, navigation, RF communications, etc. more than physical/structural engineering 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are - 

&amp;#x200B;

Would CE/EE be better than Aero for my interests? (I am in a school with a phenomenal CS/CE/EE track and doesn't offer Aero at all, so I would move out of state) 

&amp;#x200B;

What will the job outlook look like in 3 ish years?

&amp;#x200B;

What are typical jobs like in aerospace? Are they mostly doing mathematical proofs? I am a hands on type of person

&amp;#x200B;

6,Transitioning to engineering after graduating with a B.S. in Chemistry?,1563244467,"I just graduated with my B.S. in Chemistry last May. I did very well (I graduated with a 4.0), but I haven't had to take math beyond Calc III because my emphasis was in biochemistry. I was planning on going to medical school, but for various reasons I'm feeling less and less enthusiastic about that. Entering college, I was actually really afraid of math and science and didn't anticipate I did as well I ended up doing--I started off as a bio major, pre-med and switched after taking organic chemistry because I really enjoyed it and found it intuitive. I did take two semesters of calc-based physics and really enjoyed electricity and magnetism. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering engineering for many reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I love learning and studying. I was actually a bit sad about graduating. I know I want a job where I'm constantly learning and being challenged. I need a technical job. 
2. Chemistry is not very lucrative--I've really enjoyed it but I'm not willing to put in the effort for an MS or PhD and make no money. Also, I would rather work in industry than in academia, which is where I think most chem jobs are. 
3. My dad works in medical devices in San Diego (he has a BS in Mechanical Engineering and an MBA). I've always been in awe of him and what he does for work--he has various patents from when he used to work at Bausch &amp; Lomb. 
4. While I've loved a lot of my chem classes, I've also loved a lot of my more physics-oriented classes, namely Thermodynamics, Quantum Mech. and (like I said) second semester physics. Mind you these courses I took from the chem department so I'm sure they're watered down and have a heavier focus on chemistry-related concepts than those offered by physics or engineering department. 
5. Honestly, I can't apply to med. school until this next spring, I'm not sure I want to do and my current job using my degree is absolutely miserable and boring as all hell, so I'm feeling a real push to get back in classes this next fall.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hesitant for a few reasons, though, and not sure what discipline of engineering to pursue.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I'm inclined towards biomedical engineering since I think it'd be the easiest transition from a degree in chemistry, but I'm afraid of the job prospects if I don't go into medical devices and I'm not willing to relocate (I live in Salt Lake City and will most likely stay here while my boyfriend goes to law school). 
2. I'm not sure how much money I'd need to put into taking prerequisite courses as a non-matriculated student if I pursue engineering; I would really like to go get a Master's in an engineering field, but I don't know how realistic that is. 
3. I still am fearful of how well-equipped I am to actually go into engineering as just a chem major. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the areas of engineering where I'd be most interested are those that relate to medicine so I may very well end up in devices if I pursue engineering....... I find neural engineering really interesting from what I've read. I've always had a strong interest in our brain and nervous system--that was a big part of what pushed me into medicine. I'm also interested in prosthetics and drug delivery.

11,Structural Engineer stamp required for fixture shop drawings?,1563239770,"I work for a large custom fixture company in the US as a drafter. We build a lot of large, unusual, complex fixtures out of a variety of materials, we're not just a regular old cabinet shop. We build out retail spaces, bars and restaurants, museums, trade shows, etc. We've done some large ""lobby art"" pieces and things of that nature. I am not an engineer, nor do we employ any licensed PEs at our facility. Some of the drafters are engineering graduates, but did not become PEs.

Often when preparing shop drawings, we'll send out our drawings to a licensed structural engineer to review the drawings for safety. Most recent example is a lighting fixture that's hung in a client's lobby that's roughly 20 feet long by 12 feet wide and weighs upwards of 600 lbs. We show attachment details and supply him with the architectural plans, and he verifies the integrity of the fixture we're building and that the existing ceiling can hold the load.

There's been some internal disagreement recently on what HAS to be stamped, what SHOULD be stamped, and what's a waste of time and money. Our engineer usually takes about a week to turn around a set of drawings and the cost can run upwards of $1500, depending on complexity. Sometimes this added cost and time is a significant hurdle for our budget and fabrication timeline.

Is there some code or guidelines we could use as a starting point of best practices? Everything I can find seems to be regarding architectural modifications that are not usually within our scope (changing means of egress, altering fire rated walls, etc.) Our own rule of thumb has been anything overhead and anything freestanding that's over 8' tall should get stamped. We're located in Oregon, but build fixtures for all over the US. Do we need to research local code requirements for each jurisdiction we work in?

1.) Am I right to assume that the only pump that must operate on the filter is just 3.785 L/H?
2.) If I were to use a pump that has a flowrate of 120L/H, how can I decrease the flowrate in order to prevent breaking the filter?
3.) What are your suggestions to improve my plan?",AskEngineers,False,BulldogJeopardy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cdgp21/need_help_on_designing_a_reverse_osmosis_filter/

45,Can anyone help with thermal simulation in Fusion360??,1563185306,"Hi all, as a personal project I am trying to simulate a large chip sinking heat into a small plate, which then conducts it to a much larger heatsink which then radiates it away. The idea is that this would be happening in a space environment, so there would be no convection and all the heat would be transferred away via radiation. The chip is using up 15W of power, which I have divided by its area to find the heat source value.

&amp;#x200B;

I have used Fusion360 to model it as a cuboid sinking heat into a metal plate, which is sinking heat to a larger metal structure which radiates it outward.

I have set the inner surface of the chip to 0.003 W / mm\^2 heat source, and all the other surfaces to radiate with an emissivity of one.

I am getting very strange results, so I am sure I have done something wrong with the thermal set-up.

I'm working on a project where I have to design a cold gas tank (nitrogen/compressed air) which purpose is to generate a specific Force when a valve is opened. The final application would be to use this system to move away an object from another using this force (for example, a rocket booster after separation from the main rocket)

I have freedom to design it however I want (if I want to link one tank to several nozzles or whatever, I am free to do so. If I choose to have several smaller tanks I can etc...). Now my knowledge in fluid mechanics isn't the best so I'm a little lost now that I have calculated the force I need to generate.

Does anyone have experience dealing with similar problems ? Would you know the formulas involved in the tank design to generate such a force once the valve is open ? I guess it would involve the internal pressure and volume of the tank and the characteristics of the gas used.

My final goal would be to have as many functional characteristics as I can toward a solution that could work : the architecture of the solution, the size of the gas tank, the pressure and so on.

Since we're in the early design phase, and since I'm having him keep to a budget (the project was his idea, but I'm using it as a platform for teaching some basic engineering practices), we don't want to buy full-scale motors or props until we are reasonably sure that the concept is even potentially feasible.

So I think I want to do some scale model tests to narrow down the list of motors and prop design, but I don't know if motors scale linearly or not. I've not worked in this area, so I don't know if I'm phrasing this right, but if I do scale testing with a particular prop design and a motor that spins at a certain rate, produces X amount of torque, and consumes Y amount of power, can I expect the numbers to scale in a predictable manner when moving up to a bigger one if the other elements are kept constant?

This is a question I happen to get a lot and I find it difficult to answer convincingly. I am an engineer myself, yet I feel slightly embarrassed when I can't explain in layman's terms, why we should care about the environment. But before I can answer the question simply and concisely, I need to understand the issue deeply. I realize there probably is a sub-reddit dedicated to this topic, but I am asking here, because most engineers attack issues in certain ways that I can understand and follow - a more scientific or even practical orientated mentality. With that being said, I would like to get an understanding of the following (and more!):

* What exactly is the ""climate change""? (what is the physics and the chemistry behind it)
* What molecules are the worst and why? Is it just CO2 and/or NOx?
* Why are we (the world) even in this position to begin with? Have we been here before (thousands/hundreds years ago)?
* At what point in history did climate change become a topic?
* What are the consequences? 
* Where do we see the consequences in the world?
* (Related to the above) Are the temperatures going to rise? Are islands around the world going to disappear? Why?

There are probably many more questions to be asked, and I challenge this sub-reddit to ask them and let's help each other to understand *why* we should be worried (if we should?)*.* I encourage you to send links to research papers,  documentaries, videos, websites, your own knowledge etc.",AskEngineers,False,Rvisgaard,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cd15ca/why_should_i_care_about_climate_change/

93,A Struggling Engineer in Need of Advice,1563091926,"Hello, I made this throwaway account for somewhat obvious reasons. 

I feel like it would be of most value for me to ask the engineers of reddit about the current situation I’m in, because honestly I can’t tell what to make of it. 

First I guess some background information on myself. I am a Civil Engineer who recently graduated. I have been working at a private firm for 5 months now that does a lot of commercial and industrial site design work. I’ve also had 4 years of internship experience at other places before this. 

The issue I’m having is that this job is causing me so much stress and anxiety to the point where mental breakdowns are almost a daily occurrence. I know stress is normal and to be expected in any field, but this just doesn’t seem right. 

I’m really going to attempt to be as objective as possible here, so here’s just some general concerns I have. 

-Literally no training time. In my interview I stated I had very limited experience with CAD. First day I was asked to draft up a plan set due by the end of that week. All my CAD knowledge to this point has basically been learned through trial and error. 

-Often times when I do CAD work for my PM, and he isn’t satisfied, or if it’s taking too long, he will just give it to someone else (says I’m wasting the clients money). I can’t recall one experience where I’ve sat down with him and went over things I did wrong. 

-11-12 hour days (6:30am-5:30pm)  are common for me. I’m not trying to kiss ass or anything by working so long, I literally feel like I have to in order to get anything out on time. 

I could go on, but i don’t want this post to be 10 times longer than it already is. I’m more or less trying to give a general idea of the situation rather than listing out negative experiences. 

I guess my question is what is a typical work load for an engineer who’s just getting started? What expectations did PMs seem to have of you? Is there a certain pace that is common or ideal for new engineers? And does this sound like an unhealthy work environment, or am I just having trouble adjusting to it?

98,Recommended Reading Materials on Electric Concepts and Power Systems,1563077238,"Hi everyone! I was hoping to get some advice and input about any recommended books about electric power distribution systems, and basic electrical concepts.

I currently work at a major Electric Utility/Power Generation firm and find myself lacking in basic knowledge.  I’ve been with the company for two years so far and have been on the corporate finance and strategy side of things. While I’ve learned a lot from shadowing engineers and field crews in my spare time, I still find myself lacking some pretty basic knowledge. The extent of my formal schooling in electricity is my high school science class, a basic electricity and magnetism class in undergrad (largely forgotten), and a circuits class I took in graduate school on a whim. Ive been able to piece together a good deal of how everything works, but I haven’t had a cohesive education on power systems; everything has come piecemeal from different sources.

To better round out my resume and experience, management suggested I take a field centric role as an operations supervisor. Even though I’m a finance guy, I’ve decided to go for the opportunity, and training will be provided. I find the operations side fascinating and am eager to learn. Having said that, I feel like I have a lot of ground to cover and want to get a more formal understanding of things. I feel completely unprepared for the role.

Since this company offers full tuition reimbursement, I brought up the idea of going back to school part time to get a degree in electrical engineering, but management told me that it wouldn’t really be worthwhile or necessary. According to them, a formal electrical engineering education is too theoretical and won’t give the kind of operational knowledge that they want me to obtain. Furthermore, it’s not like I would ever be an engineer or designer. This move is intended to give me operational experience, and then after a few years I’d probably go back to the corporate strategy side of things.

In shadowing engineers or our union workforce, I get tons of great information, but I don’t always understand the “why” behind things, which is infuriating. So basically, I’m hoping you guys could please recommend a few books that could supplement my learning. I don’t mind technical or math heavy books, but please keep in mind that i don’t need super abstract design or engineering knowledge. I’m thinking more along the lines of basic concepts, and an overview of the different types of grid equipment, distribution systems, so I can be conversant and familiar with the different issues faced by our teams.

8,THINKING ABOUT BUYING A NEW CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM? HERE ARE SOME TIPS,1563066580," 

**Brands:**

Most standard brands available today are Rheem, Trane, American Standard, Carrier, Bryant, Lennox, York, Amana and Goodman. Other Brands such as Maytag, Frigidaire and Tappan which are manufactured by Nordyne. Non standard brands such as Florida Heat Pump (FHP), First Company and Mitsubishi.

**Sizing:**

It is very important that you purchase the correct size system for your home regardless of the size you currently have. What I mean by that is, don’t just replace with the same thing you have now. It could be mis-sized and causing you problems that you are not aware of such as short cycling (causing humidity problems) or over working (shortening its life span).

Today’s systems are different in design then your older system. In order to achieve the higher efficiencies, they have installed a TXV valve which regulates the flow of the refrigerant. These keep the units from working inefficiently but do not allow for deficiencies in sizing.

The best way to properly size your new system is to have your contractor do a Heat Load Calculation also known as a Manual J. If not, as a general rule of thumb, 500 sq. ft. per ton of a/c living space for a single family home (example 2000 sq. ft. of a/c living space is a safe bet at 4 tons) . Factors may vary depending on exposure of home, how many windows and type, attached or free standing home, single story or 2, inadequate insulation in attic and leaking ductwork.

Your contractor should also check your ductwork in the attic to make sure it’s sized properly for the new system. Don’t assume or let him tell you it’s fine if he hasn’t looked (red flag).

**Seer Rating:**

Acronym for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. The higher the SEER rating the lower your electric bill. Some utility companies offer rebates based on the SEER rating. 13 SEER is the minimum rating allowed by law and can go up to 21 SEER or higher depending on the brand. Keep in mind that the higher the SEER the more costly the equipment. For a single stage unit (I will explain about this later on) 16 seer is about the highest and probably the most popular now because of price.

**Types of Central a/c systems:**

Split systems, package units and water source heat pumps (less common and usually in high rise condos). A split system has 2 units, a condenser outside and an air handler inside. A package unit has both in 1 on the outside. A water cooled unit has both inside and is connected to a water source.

**Single Stage vs. 2 Stage:**

Single stage system is the least expensive and the more common system. It uses one compressor in the outside unit (condenser). A 2 stage system has either 1 compressor that changes speeds or 2 compressors that change back and forth according to demand. A 2 stage unit also has a variable speed air handler. The benefit to the 2 stage system is better humidity control, better air circulation and quieter operation.This system will keep your home feeling more comfortable over the course of a day because it adjusts to the changing environment of your home. Factors such as outside temperature, direction of the sun as it relates to your home and humidity will be compensated by this system.Also check your old thermostat.You might have to replace it and [get a new one preferably programmable type](http://thermostatonline.com/) that support your system.

**Types of Heating:**

Heat strip, heat pump, gas furnace. A heat strip is a coil in the air handler that heats up like a toaster. The air blows over it as it goes through the air handler. A heat pump uses a reverse cycle on the compressor to produce heat and can be supplemented with a heat strip for additional heating (used in cooler climates). A gas furnace gets its heat from natural gas and is used in colder climates.

**Refrigerant Line Sizing:**

These are the the copper pipes that carry the refrigerant (or freon) back and forth from the condenser to the air handler. There are 2 lines. A liquid line and a suction line. They must be the correct size according to the manufacturers specifications. Make sure that your contractor checks them to see if you have the right size for the new unit. Don’t assume they are correct even if you are replacing with the same size a/c. They may never have been correct. Under sized lines cause premature failure of the equipment due to low lubrication of the compressor and will lower the SEER rating that you are paying for. If a contractor does not check these (red flag).

**Rule of thumb.**

1.5 to 2.5 tons minimum size is 5/8 and 1/4 up to a 50′ run.

3 to 3.5 tons minimum size is 3/4 and 3/8

4 to 5 tons minimum size 7/8 and 3/8

**Electrical Specifications:**

Electrical wiring also needs to be sized properly. Don’t assume because you lived in your home for 20 years and your a/c has worked fine and you’ve never had a fire that it’s ok. Breakers also need to be sized properly. Again, don’t assume that what you have is right or safe. Make sure your contractor checks this without you asking. if not (red flag). Rule of thumb for air handlers

up to 30 amp breaker #10 wire and you can use a 5 kw heater

up to 45 amp breaker #8 wire and you can use a 8 kw heater

up to 60 amp breaker #6 wire and you can use a 10 kw heater

Rule of thumb for condensers

Varies by size and brand but wire sizes and breakers listed above are the same.

**Manufacturers, Utilities and Government Rebates:**

Manufacturers have rebates usually in the spring and the fall. The higher the price of the equipment, the higher the rebates (typically up to $1200). Keep in mind that the dealer absorbs half the cost of the rebate, so it gets built into the price to the consumer. Here is a link for state, local and/or utility incentives in your area [http://www.dsireusa.org/](http://www.dsireusa.org/). Power utilities may also have rebates for repairing ductwork and replacing insulation in the attic. Federal Energy tax credits ended on December 31, 2011 but legislation is in congress for new tax credits.

**Hiring a Contractor:**

Your local power utility company may have a list of participating contractors for any utility rebates. Better Business Bureau is good if you take the time and check how many complaints a particular contractor has (too many and red flag). Angie’s list is also good. The best way to find a contractor is by word of mouth. Ask your neighbors, friends and co-workers. If they’ve had a good experience, they will surely let you know, if not then you know which contractors to stay away from. Get 3 estimates. If you do your research and call reputable contractors, then 3 should be enough. Too many will definitely get you confused. Make sure that they leave you a written estimate with all work to be done as well as model numbers and prices. If all these things are not on the proposal or if they tell you that they don’t pull permits for the job then beware. Most cities require permits even if your replacing with the same thing. This is to make sure that your contractor did all the work according to code and that your home is safe.",AskEngineers,False,terjupi84,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ccx289/thinking_about_buying_a_new_central_air/

10,How does torque affect slip ratio.,1563061612,"Hello. I am programming a vehicle simulation at the moment and i have trouble combining the torque and the slip ratio.

The longitudinal force a tire creates is a [function of the slip ratio](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAMyu.gif). A tire produces the most amount of force at about 0.06 slip ratio. When i apply a torque on a wheel the slip ratio will increase and produce a longitudinal force.

I use the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_ratio) definition of slip ratio. I am aware that this definition is unstable at low speeds and even undefined at velocity of zero but i dont think this is a problem with my question.

**Here is my question:**  
What is the slip ratio if i apply a torque T to the tire? 

**Here is why i am confused:**  
My approach is to just accelerate the tire as if there are no other forces. This will increase the angular velocity and now i can calculate the slip ratio. But i dont think this really works. Here is an example.  

Here are the relevent values of my tire:  
inertia I=1.  
radius r=0.5m.  
velocity of the axle v=10m/s.  
angular velocity omega=20rad/s.  
torque T = 1000Nm.


I can apply the torque on the wheel first and then calculate the new slip ratio. If i do this the tire will accelerate by T/I -&gt; 1000/1 -&gt; 1000rad/s/s. So after, for example, one second the new Angular velocity is omega = 1200rad/s!!.

Now my slip ratio is omega\*r/v - 1 -&gt; 1200\*0.5 / 10 - 1 -&gt; 59. 

If i set my timestep to 100ms i get.  
omega = 120rad/s.  
slip ratio = 5.

if i set m timestep to 10ms i get.  
omega = 21rad/s.  
slip ratio = 0.05.

I feel like calculating my slip ratio should not be dependent on timestep. At most it should be more precise as the timestep becomes smaller but it should not be linearly dependent on it.

So how can i calculate the slip ratio in a way that is NOT dependent on timestep?",AskEngineers,False,Psychoscattman,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ccw87y/how_does_torque_affect_slip_ratio/

**SHORT VERSION:**  2-3 years out of undergrad with B.S. in Biochem. Have been working in a high profile biophysics/biohem lab full time. I'm on a great projectory (stacked experiences, high impact paper, made up for low GPA, some connections through PI) to getting into top tier Biophysics/biochem PhD programs. Always have had interest in space exploration/engineering. Loved physics/good at math. But also loving what I'm currently doing. Now torn between going to a top program for PhD in biophyics/biochem or starting over and becoming an engineer in possibly a mediocre program. Wondering if i'm just romanticizing the space exploration/engineering route? Is the job lackluster (i've seen many different opinions when looking around)? What are some ways of getting into engineering for non-engineers? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

Graduated from a University of California in Biochemistry  2-3 years ago with a GPA of 2.97 (so close to 3.0...) and major GPA of \~3.3. Since graduation, I have been working full time in a biophysics/biochem lab at a top tier research university with a young rising star PI who has published many high profile/impact papers. The work experience has been awesome and the unbelievable training I've received from my PI/other lab members, in addition to co-authoring on a high impact paper and another smaller paper, has landed me on a great path to (hopefully) get into a top program in biophysics/biochem and/or related field.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always loved physics, was good at math, and had an interest in engineering and loved space exploration. The thought of working in the space industry has always given me rush of excitement and thrill. After not being able to join the college of engineering (CoE) at my university as an undergrad (didn't know i had to apply for the CoE from the beginning and i could not transfer over), i decided to go down the Biochemistry route (i also loved chemistry as a kid). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now 2-3 years after graduating from undergrad, I am looking into Biophysics/biochem PhD programs. However, my interest in engineering came back after watching some NASA videos and as I looked into engineering programs, i found that it was not too late. I found things such as Masters in Engineering programs for non-engineers (Boston University LEAP program, although it may be too expensive and far away for my own liking). Or even going back to community college to take engineering classes (and aim to do very well) and then applying for more traditional Master programs in engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now torn between these two choices. Biophysics/Biochem still greatly intrigues me and I have been loving what I do. Though there are small caveats such as the research sometimes being less tangible (but still very interesting) and that PhD programs will take 5-6 years before starting my career. It would also be hard to give up the Biophysics/biochem route especially when I'm en route to (hopefully) getting into a great programs/school for possibly getting into a mediocre/okay engineering program, AFTER a year of course make up at local community college (unless i find an accelerated master's program for non-engineers in California).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering to myself, is this engineering dream just a dream? Will the job itself be less fulfilling than I imagine it to be? I've been doing a lot of research around sub-reddits and see many people say the industry is too slow/bureaucratic/feels like being a small cog in a big machine and a lot of paperwork, which is turning me off a bit. Though I'm sure there are exciting parts too. 

I wonder if i am giving up on something great I currently enjoy/have for something i'm romanticizing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way i'm still very interested in both paths and would love advice from people who have similar experiences. Or if you're an engineer in this field and have a comment or two, that would be much appreciated as well!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

What are the best ways for a non-engineer to get a degree in engineering? Community college, then apply for traditional masters? Masters for non-engineers? Are there other options? I also read you should never pay for a master's in engineering. Should always look for companies to fund you, though I don't think that's an option for me.

How much does the university from which you get your engineering degree from matter? I am a bit worried I will only get into mediocre programs. 

Has anyone had similar experiences?

How is the space industry as a mechanical engineer (as of now, most interested field) or in general?

I've never really had a physics class and I'm trying to learn but at the moment I'm spit balling a game idea that I suppose could be classified as racing meets fighting. I guess there's no actual racing but a huge component is the light physics I would be adding that takes into account acceleration, weight, momentum, force of impact, etc. Think human sized mech suits duking it out.

So I'm playing around with stats of the player and I want the player to have a pretty open experience into how their loadout will perform. Like for example, a player would be choosing its chassis, outer plating, upper servos, lower servos, battery, heat management, etc. Maybe some of this information isn't exactly needed to understand my question but let me rephrase the question. If a cybernetic arm with a static energy input into the system is throwing a punch versus swinging a sword, would the speed in which the attack gets executed be proportional to the percentage that the sword's weight is in comparison tot he maximum load the arm can handle.

20,Want to get into engineering,1563049890,"Hey y'all. I recently graduated from college with a BS in Natural Resources. I wanted to start off in college as an engineer, but if I'm being quite honest, I knew I didn't have the maturity, mentality, or confidence to take on an engineering degree at age 19. My university has an atrocious math and physics department (they were close to losing their accreditation if I recall correctly), I was scared of failure and I knew my mental state back then was too fragile for a degree like this. I love working with my hands and figuring out problems and building stuff and taking it apart. I feel like I am more mature now and I have the confidence that I can pass math and physics classes if I take them somewhere like at my city's community college (I didn't know I could transfer credits until my sophomore year.) I'm also in a much better place mentally than I was 4 years ago. I knew I wanted to study engineering for sure the summer before my senior year, particularly either mechanical or environmental, but it was waaaay too late to change majors, and I simply did not have the money to tack on 2-3 years to my almost completed bachelor's degree. 

So I'm wondering if there's any way to get into engineering at the point which I am at. Do you guys recommend looking for a Master's program that would just require a few prerequisite classes, like Calc I-III and DifEq, plus some University Physics?

The first one is 8 inches AC fan and draws 40W at max speed, 33W at half speed and 25W at minimum (it barley blows at minimum).

The other is a 10 Inch DC fan that draws 20W at max. Blows about the same as the previous one between max and half speed. while having a much lower power draw.

The 10 Inch DC fan is very old and has the capability to be battery operated, its motor is very small (like 10 times smaller than the AC fan), also the back of the AC fan gets warm to the touch with all the airflow going going around it. So I started reading and found this paper:

Assuming the motor is operating at non maximal capacity and the tension on the belt is higher than current torque output.

Can the current of the motor be used to sense this or would a tension type sensor on the belt provide feedback to the motor? I'm really not great with motors and just need to start from somewhere.

While a capacitor in parallel with a DC source in a steady state would be perfectly fine, it wouldn't even draw current regardless of the capacitance, it's actually totally unsafe in the transient state, since the capacitor essentially resists to the variation of the voltage, if the voltage is forced to go from 0 to any value immediately, it would draw, by definition, a current value nearing infinite.

But what about an AC voltage source? It technically should start at 0, and at that point it's already safe, steady state has the current 90 degrees ahead of the voltage and the transitory state should only be an exponential whose value is the maximum value of the current at t=0, but negative, then it heads towards 0. I think the math checks out, but, well, I want to know if this is even done in real life or if it's considered too dangerous or something.

I don't mind that it would be rather loud, I don't care that it will be pretty rough on the impact drivers internals, and I don't really care about the effective range; this is purely a novelty idea.

This isn't really a PC question so much as best way to optimize what is most likely a bad decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I host LAN parties in my garage and have 7-10 of air-cooled gaming PCs available to guests. To free up space, I've moved them to the plenum/crawlspace above my uninsulated garage in a hot climate. Obviously it gets super hot up there and the PCs typically are running near the edge of safe temps. I have recently come into possession of 4 inline ventilation fans (\~390cfm) designed for 6"" ducting, as well as some ducting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it more effective to run ""cold"" air from outside (shady side of garage) to near the air intakes of the PCs or to exhaust hot air from the garage? Or split the fans and do both? I  want to choose the most efficient path as budget (for enough ducting) is a huge issue. I'm not concerned about power cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

* For the sake of this question, let's assume moving the PCs out of the stupidly hot space is not an option. 
* There is no existing exhaust in this crawl space
* The PCs are currently on their sides with CPU HSF facing up

48,How to handle job offer from customer (consultant)?,1562971215,"I’m currently employed as a consultant with a large engineering firm (call them Company A). I started working for Company A right after my master’s degree in 2018. For the past year, I’ve been deployed at a customer’s office (let’s call them Company B), working directly with their R&amp;D department. A while back, the department boss at Company B called me into a one-to-one meeting and told me that he is extremely satisfied with my performance, in addition to the fact that I get along well with everyone in the department. He told me that they are going to open a position in the department during autumn, and that I’m the top choice for that position. I was very flattered by the praise, and the fact that they considered me their top choice. 


However, I’m a bit torn on how to approach this. I’m very happy with my current job at the Company A.  My boss at Company A has told me that they consider me a top asset and have me in consideration for senior positions relatively early in my career. The salary increases have also been good (10% increase this year).

I know from speaking with employees at Company B that their salary increases are rather mediocre (2-3% per year). Furthermore, most of the people employed at the R&amp;D department at Company B are substantially older than I am, and they’ve been working there for a long time in the same position. These two factors make me think that Company B is a place where careers go to die. However, the people in the department are extremely skilled and experienced, which makes it an excellent place to learn best practices during my early career.

The boss at Company B hasn’t given me a formal offer yet, since the position is going to opened during autumn. I’m assuming that their offer will include a pay raise compared to Company A, in addition to other benefits that I know Company B offers (e.g. more PTO and bonuses).

My current thinking is that I can leverage the job offer from Company B to gain an advantage at Company A. Perhaps by getting a pay bump, or by gaining a senior position earlier than otherwise planned. However, I’m a bit afraid that Company A will consider me greedy or manipulative if I use the job offer from Company B to leverage benefits for my current position. Furthermore, it feels a bit disingenuous to “fake” interest in the offer from Company B only to obtain their offer and leverage that with Company A.

I want to make a small scale tunnel (that could easily fit in ones room) but I'm not sure where to start (also, due my current spot this project might let me show how much i really want to do meen/aero, which is a current issue). 

I do know some stuff about aero and I have taken up to diffEQ math (for science courses no fluids, just mechanics so far), which i assume is important. Now, I know you can't explain it all here but I'm assuming I don't need to go through all the aerospace material that one would learn in 2-3 years of undergrad lectures.

What material is directly relevant or would I have to go through to make this happen? Topics that you could list out maybe so I could learn my way through them? (please?)

For example, I know boundary layers are a major issue and knowing where they might happen as well as how severely will greatly affect the actual design of the tunnel...and vice versa... but i don't know how I would be able to calculate this, as well as any theory that would support doing a certain calculation over another.

58,Early career advice question!,1562951169,"Firstly please go easy on me I understand I might be expecting more than I’ll realistically get. 

Hey all. Im a recent mechanical engineering grad. I enjoyed my education and liked the technical stuff, but I had a few internships that kept me inside behind a desk, often with not enough work to stay busy. I also didn’t love going through complicated situations and calculations during work, so didn’t love the really technical stuff that I wasn’t very confident in. Because of this I sorta thought I needed a career change. I am now working at a software company and interfacing with clients and not using any of my technical skills (been here 4 weeks).

I know 4 weeks isn’t enough to feel a company out and I’m sorta still in training, but I really feel that in my gut this isn’t where I belong and I won’t be happy here. I have a couple related questions.

1. I’ve sorta narrowed down what I want for my long term position. I think I want to end up doing some field work and some office work, and interfacing with people in a less formal way. Because of this I see myself in a sortof construction project management position. Are there any positions that come to mind when you hear: flexible hours (come in early and beat traffic, get work done, leave in 8 hours), comfortable and not overly formal environment (right now I have a pretty strict formal dress code, I’m not really into that or the environment that comes with it), interesting and not incredibly technical work (think more conceptual and less calculation types of work)? Do you think there’s anything I’m really skipping over?

2. Because this job is so new to me and I’m getting the feeling I won’t last here all that long, what are your thoughts on how long it is appropriate to stay here before leaving? I have heard at least a year, but if asked in an interview why I’m leaving I will say I spent some time here and I could tell it wasn’t what I wanted to do. So why would it only make sense to stay a year if I knew immediately I wasn’t a good fit. (To be clear, I do not by any means think it’s acceptable for me to leave now, I need to stay for some time until I completely feel out the position).

To tell you a few things about me, first off I am talented in almost anything in engineering, I’ve always tinkered, I love being hands on with technical design as well has having knowledge in skills such as Welding and machining. I’ve worked on high risecondos as well, doing HVAC. I’m also very proficient  with design programs such as CAD, Inventor, solid-works, civil3D. However, I come from 2 parents who have had successful careers in oil&amp;gas sales management and medical tech sales. My sister is completing her accounting MBA from McCombs at UT in 5 years. I believe I as well inherited the talent for business because I am very well spoken, charismatic, creative, and hardworking.
My downfall is that I’m not a stellar student, my worst subject growing up was math and it shows. I’m not even through my Calculus sequence yet and I’m excelling in my entry CE courses. Even though I have struggled immensely in my undergrad so far, I still continue to pursue my passion for engineering.

I have always had a end goal of doing engineering management, director, President/VP or starting my own company before I get up there. 
The Big $$$ is important to me, it doesn’t buy you happiness, but it can buy you peace of mind and the opportunity to chase your passions. I love racing dirt-bikes, jacked up trucks, and always told myself as kid I’d have that shiny red Ferrari. ( I do plan on doing a lot of saving and investing in my 20s and early 30s for that delayed gratification).
My parents worked hard to get where they were at and made sacrifices to provide me the best chance for success no matter the cost. I wanna make them proud you know and be able to do the same for my future family. Maybe a little sibling competition in there  as well.

38,"Need to get 36V from 12V from 2 power sources, apparently cannot join in series to even get 24V",1562814784," 

Hello fellow redditors

Long  story short I built a CNC machine (entirely from gantry table to  electronics) following the instructions of the book ""CNC Robotics"" by  Geoff Williams.

My  problem is that it is extremely slow, as per the steps I followed I  connected the stepper motors to a PC power supply to provide them 12V  each.

My stepper motors are rated to up to 48V @ 4Amps, the CNC circuit boards can handle up to 36V @2Amps each.

My  current setup is the following:I have 2 PC Power sources, each power  source has 2 terminals, each terminal has 4 wires (5V, Ground, Ground  &amp; 12V).

I'm using 3 out of these 4 terminals to feed each of my circuit boards.

I  figured, given I have 3 terminals, if I hook up the 12V cables in  series I could get 36V, however, when I tested it out, I got 0V from 2  terminals of the same power source, I'm guessing I pretty much short  circuited it, which I half expected this...

Weird  thing is, when I connected in series the 2 terminals from different  power sources I still got 12V: I was really expecting 24V here, not sure  what happened, I connected the +12VDC of the first terminal to Ground  of the 2nd terminal and I connected my multimeter to the Ground of the  first terminal and Positive of 2nd terminal, I guess when it comes to  power sources connecting in series like this does not fly?

Anywho...  how could I get 36V, do I need transformers? if so this is kinda  advanced for me, any nudge in the right direction would be appreciated.

This is my first engineering position. The company branch I work for engineers fire and life safety systems for industrial use. 

Recently I have been getting frustrated due to the companies political structure and values. Mostly I dislike the morality of the engineering department. I was assigned to work on a project where the head engineer passed away. I found that he never recorded any of his hardware test data. Due to this I assumed that their was no testing done because no data was anywhere to be found.  My manager wants to spin the board with only small changes based on the schematic then release even though there are many notable issues with it. I said this in a public meeting (in a frustrated tone which I regret) and my manager yelled at me in front of the whole room. I felt terrible for the rest of the day. 

Before this happened we were in a design review for the companies multiple branches around the globe. The head of engineering asked “why do we even have these meetings they just waste time, does anyone gain anything from these?” I responded with “yes, it’s inspiring and innovative to see what our other branches are working on to see what our next NPI could be” apparently this was funny because all the managers began to laugh.

I'd like to keep the arduino in the base so it has constant power and isn't too exposed to the heat, and I want to put a small screen and some buttons on the side of the kettle. The main problem with this is that I don't have an easy way to connect the two; the kettle's heating element receives power from the base through a circular plug in the center ([like this](https://www.hamiltonbeach.com/power-base,-2-prong,-polarized-990242900)) so that you can just set it down facing any way you want and it'll be fine, but this gets a lot trickier if I want to add more connections.

I've thought of maybe having the pin connections (buttons, SPI for the screen, etc.) as concentric conductive rings around the central plug on the base, but that seems needlessly complicated, all I have is a computer science degree, not electrical engineering.

Im making 12k/yr which isnt much, but I still live with my parents so I dont have many expenses (I live in South America so its pretty common, it also takes longer to graduate).

I work a 9AM to 6PM in the office, plus a rotational ""on call"" period (you still go to work but for the whole week if something breaks out of office hours, they call you to check the status of equipment and decide how to deal with the situation, sometimes you get calls at 3 AM and have to quickly fix issues. Its about 6 extra hours during that week). We do a round robin with the other OAM engineers (Im the only one who is still in school) to split it.

Originally there were 6 OAM engineers and 2 quit, the company only hired me as a replacement. That was May last year. 
A month ago, another colleague quit so now we are just 4 and there are no signs of a new hiring any time soon. I feel we are understaffed, many times having to stay after 6 with no extra pay or benefits.

I want to quit before classes start in August and look for a less time demanding job, but because of the vacations my coworkers already asked for, I sort of have to stay until September 20th (or else I really fuck them over).

First a little background: Mechanical Engineering graduate May 2019. Shy and very introverted.

I am desperately looking for a job. I had an interview at socal gas in march and havent heard from them since.

I have a final round interview coming up at Kiewit for a office/field engineer.

Yesterday (while I was on a phone interview with Kiewit) I received a phone call from Raytheon. This phone call was from a woman asking me if I was interested in a position I didn't apply for. (I applied for a mechanical engineering position) She said the position is a whole life engineer position. (I linked the job description below) I told her yes and she said she would contact me next week to set up an interview.

Today Kiewit called me back to invite me for an in person interview as soon as I accepted and hung up Raytheon called me and invited me for an in person interview.

Seems like the good lord is really trying to prevent me from working for Kiewit.

I am hesitant about going to the interview. The way I see is ... I can make a lot of money in construction and can grow pretty fast. Although I am starting in a position that doesn't really use my degree I can use it as a stepping stone to make work my way into HVAC, Edison, DWP, even the city ... where I ultimately want to be. 

My questions are:

What would you do? 

God forbid either market crashes which one would go first? Construction or a department of defense contractor?

Would it be easier to jump into construction from aerospace or aerospace from construction if the either market would take a shit

Have you ever heard of this Whole Life Engineer position? I have an understanding of what the position entails but what does the position actually do? ( the word software is thrown around a lot and I absolutely hate hate hate coding)

Raytheon has a pretty crappy reputation as far as growth goes. Does anyone have some insight about this? (worried because I am such a shy person. ..... if a telemarketer calls I will stay on the phone to listen to their whole speech because I am just to shy to be confrontational)

Here's the situation. I was suppose to be graduating this fall, but I wasn't able to get a seat in Senior Design this past semester. My friend had an internship here in NYC for the Department of Ed as IT (paid, 16 an hour). He suggested I go for it. I figured since I have to wait to Spring 2020 to graduate now, maybe it would not be a bad idea. I wasn't able to really secure internships during my studies.   


The issue is this. It requires 15 hours a minimum a week. It's not a lot, the issue is my schedule doesn't really work. I'm currently stuck in school Mon/Wed's 9am-6:30pm with a gap, and I have max commute time of 3 hours a day. The job's available hours a day is 8am-3pm. It would be ridiculous to commute 1-1.5 hrs back home to work an hour, then come back to school 1-1.5 hrs to travel, then come home again. Tu/Thur same issue. Friday is the only free day.  


My current schedule I am trying to get rid of the 9am class cause its not even a class I want to take. I have two track electives to take and senior design (also a liberal art), and I wanted to take electives that interested me, but if I do, the work load will be a lot (not sure if doable with the internship. I read it's 20+programming assignments in the semester along with projects). There's another class that's more laid back, ""Numerical Issues in Scientific Programming"" which doesn't peak my interest much, but again its more laid back of a workload.  


I also currently work as a Tutor.  


I've also heard IT doesn't really look good for engineers on their resumes. Not sure if there's a lot of truth to it. Also my friend said he really didn't even do much, there was nothing to do unless a teacher had an issue connecting wifi or something like that.

My issue is that even if I do get the job, I'm still fully intending on leaving to go back to school in a year, so I'll only have 6 months of experience in power and a year of embedded systems - I feel like if I do this I've basically wasted all the time between my schooling since I'll hardly get any real experience at either company. I'm also worried if I do this that I'll be seen as someone who jumps ship every 6 months, and that might turn some employers away.

Why not incorporate piezoelectric materials in the design of suspension joints of cars, like struts, shocks, springs, engine mounts etc

Or why not even tires? Put some piezo elements in the treads. You could have a dozen piezo discs touching the ground at the same time per tire (piezo discs are small) which would add up nicely and feed power back to battery to help prolong charge.

Altogether by being in the suspension and tires I believe it would be a significant amount of electricity and cumulatively assist the battery’s charge.

Quartz is a piezoelectric material that is quite abundant and cheap.

Galfenol is not piezoelectric but generates electricity under a magnetic field and extreme stress. Galfenol ideal for incorporating into shock/struts or brake caliper design by engineers to add to battery power?

83,Advice on get a job almost two years after getting my diploma,1562765308,"Really need some advice on this, so any input on my situation would be relevant. Apologies for the long read in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've graduated anywhere between 18 months and 24ish months ago. I am not exactly sure when my official graduation date is, because I defended my final year project in May, but had to do a resit in August, and got my diploma at the end of November that same year(bachelors MEng). Again, not exactly sure what my official graduation date is, so I'd appreciate if someone could shed a light.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, after defending my project successfully I was absolutely burned out and in complete state of dread that I've failed my degree. This lasted until the middle of June, at which point I started to face more pressing issues - almost no money, no job, no prospect of a graduate job considering I didnt even know what my diploma would be (ended up with a 2:1, only didnt get compensation for a first because of the resit that was 1/24 of the total credits for the year).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At that point I was struggling to even get a reply for non skilled jobs and I was really desperate. Around middle of July I started working nights in a warehouse and stayed there until the end of the year.It was literally the only job I got an interview for. The job was absolutely devastating, extremely labour intensive,55 hours a week and I had to cycle for an hour and a half every day to and from work.Last 9 kilograms during that time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the following year I had to take a month off after quitting because of exhaustion and tried to get into the graduate job hunting process again , but the measly savings I had were quickly running out and I found myself jobhunting for any type of job again without much success.Realistically I spend a 5 weeks recovering Jan-Feb, and 6 or so weeks trying to refresh my knowledge from university(managed to even build up a small portfolio of CAD drawings, but had no success with applications, not that I was confident enough to send out that many resumes). At the end of April that year I started another warehouse job, nights again, better conditions. However, in July my partner had to leave me alone in the flat so she could finish her degree, and after she came back in October she struggled to get a job. Essentially I was the single earner in the household until around Christmas and had to face all bills and rent alone, meaning I was doing quite a lot of overtime. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Got laid off 10 days ago from the current warehouse and now I am trying to make some sense of what has happened this past year and a half and how this could impact me. In all honestly, time flows differently when you're working nights and it is just now that I realise how much time has passed....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So the big question is - is there any hope for finding a graduate job? Assuming I make it to interviews ( currently revising/doing aptitude test training, etc) do you think hiring managers will be understanding to my situation or will this massive gap be something I wont be able to overcome?

&amp;#x200B;

Before you ask - no internships. Applied and got offers in my third year, but didnt have 2-3k for flights to China...

Wasnt able to actively seek out opportunities in the final year because I was really struggling. The previous two years I had to work part time nights and this impacted me very negatively  in the fourth year, because I've had to skip classes due to work in years two and three, which meant I had to work extra hard to pass my exams and finish my project during the final year. In the end the hard work did pay off, as my project received excellent marks and got an ImechE award for it, but thats about the only positive thing I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

No interships;

Had to get shitty jobs after graduating;

 1.5-2 years have passed;

How fuck am I?

It just seemed like there had to be a better way to take the edge off the heat inside which is hitting well over 80*F.  This got me considering doing a recirculation system off of my well water that comes out of the ground well, faithfully at 36-37*F.  The concept is simple and nothing new.  Run a recirculation pump on a loop, through a radiator that would blow air through it, thus transferring heat to the cold water in the loop.  When the water hits a temp where it no longer is efficient to use in the loop it would be either dumped into another pressure tank, or back into the existing tank, whichever makes the most sense.  If in another tank, to keep temp differences separate, a one way valve would make sense, creating a separate closed system.  Obviously with this kind of temprature difference you are going to have condensation.  This actually works out in my case as I suspect I can use a catch pan below the radiator that would have PEX tubing out to either a drain, outside, or to a container to be later used for watering plants or disposal.  This would serve as a good dehumidifier, which I also need.

One of the major downsides here to water coming out of the ground so cold, is that you cannot efficiently use an on demand water heater.  I suspect that water being heated up in this loop system would greatly increase tank #2 (if feasible) to temps well above 50*F, making it possible and efficient to use in an on demand water heater, further saving energy.

The main issues I can see with this system would be:
How often the well water is cycled into the pressure tank(s). 
Finding a radiator material that is drinking water safe.
How much waste energy can be stored in X amount of 36-37*F water?

Any engineers care to lay down some math on this one, in regards to water temp/volumes and possibly energy efficiency?
