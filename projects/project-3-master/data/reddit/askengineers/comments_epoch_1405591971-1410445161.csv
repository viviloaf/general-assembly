0,How to get out of the cycle of non-engineering jobs?,1410444408,"I am originally from City A (Midwest). My family owns a business in that city and at some point, I'd like to take over. It is a relatively small manufacturing operation that employs about 35 people but has a good hold in the market which it serves. While in school, I worked at this business as an engineering intern, sales/tech support, and a production coordinator. As an engineering intern, I did menial tasks that mostly consisted of replacing old, hand-drawn prints with electronic versions (CAD, Alibre, some Solidworks). I also helped us achieve our ISO 9001 certification while I was there (mostly documentation and compliance related).  

I graduated from an accredited university in City B (also Midwest) in 2012 with a 3.25 GPA as a BSME. As I mentioned, I want to run my family business in the future, but I also really want to get real-world, outside experience. I knew that I wanted to move to Chicago when I graduated so while in school I was searching and applying for jobs there. I rarely heard back from companies and couldn't get my foot in the door anywhere. I needed to keep working to keep myself afloat so when I graduated, I returned to working at my family-owned business. I kept applying for jobs in Chicago but I hit the same wall.  

After about a year of no luck, I decided that my location not being the same as where I wanted to work was hurting me (i.e. he has the same qualifications as this person but he's not local); even if I was willing to relocate on my own dime--which I was, fully--it was a road block. I reached out to family friends and contacts and landed a job in Chicago working at a motor repair shop as a purchasing agent and doing inside sales. 

I've had that same job for a year and it's been good experience. However, now that I've learned the position and become proficient (as well as streamlining everything that I can), I'm bored. I'm still not in an engineering career and I can feel that I'm drifting further and further away from that opportunity. I want to learn new things and apply all the interesting subjects I learned in school but I feel massively underutilized at this point.  

How the heck do I get back into it? I've started applying to jobs but I'm afraid the fact that I'm two years out of school with only tangential experience is going to hurt me in the career search when I'm competing against others who have direct experience and entry-level applicants that are fresh out of school.

5,I'm Designing a Speed-Sensitive Speed Bump and Need a Pneumatic Damper That Can Hold the Weight of a Car.

Unfortunately, we've hit a bump in the road (ha) recently and are having a difficult time finding a device that is both capable of supporting the weight of a car and has a way to regulate the speed at which the bump compresses.


Currently our design consists of two .25'' steel plates attached to a spring/damping system that will regulate how quickly the bump is allowed to collapse.

(Here is a quick sketch I drew up: http://imgur.com/JMWYjvr)


That damping system is where we've had issues. What I'm looking for is something that is not dissimilar to something you'd see on the back of a screen door (http://imgur.com/R3I2ngD), but I really doubt that anyone makes something similar that is capable of holding up a car (4000 lb).

I'm not too familiar with the Mechanical Engineering specifications for this type of a equipment. 

The reinforced concrete has several ""pedestals"" of varying heights supporting the equipment. Two of the foundations (the shorter ones), give the appearance of lateral shear failures. Delaminations are present in the concrete. No embedded corrosion of the reinforcement. Compressive strength was specified at 4000 psi, Core samples extracted came back at 5000 psi. The structures are less than 10 years old.

That being said, I see failures like this in foundations a lot with vessels and poor slide-plate design. In this particular structure, all anchor bolts and connection details had no slide plate or slotted bolt olds, essentially restricting lateral movement of the compressor. The shortest foundations, thus the ""stiffest"", appear to have picked up the loads, and subsequently failed. I have not done any calculations regarding the lateral capacity of the foundations (not in our scope). 

That being said, my first gut was thermal expansion and contraction, based on experience with vessels foundations. The client indicated to me that the compressor runs 24/7 and varies in temperature from 150ºF to 190ºF and has very low vibrations. My inquiry is in regards to Mechanical Engineering specifications for Compressor foundations/Vibrations. Are slotted bolt connections/slide bearing plates permitted with this type of a equipment?

I have a custom made PS4 controller that I want to take apart to replace the joysticks. The problem is, the company that put it together changes out one of the screws to a ""security screw"".

It took me two days to figure out what the screw was - it's a ""pentalobe"" screw. The problem is, the internet seems to relate everything to the iPhone, but this is the FEMALE version of the screw - not the male version. Almost like I need a socket to remove it, but I can't find anything.

50,Analysis on a Table,1410179120,"Hey everyone,

I'm designing a table and it seems like I am overcomplicating the hand-calcs to see if it will fail.

Lets say I have a simple 4 legged, square top table. How do I check how much weight the table can hold before it fails? How can I check how much the top plate will deform (sag) under a load? What equation do I use to check if the legs will buckle if they are simple square cross-sections?

For the first calculation, I was simply going to see if F/A was less than the max allowable material stress, but this didn't take the thickness or legs into account, so I thought maybe I was doing that wrong.

For the sagging, I was just going to treat the top of the table as a simply supported beam and make large assumptions.

For buckling, I had heard about Roark's equations, but they seemed extensive for my project.

51,How do hybrid supercars deal with the warm-up and cool-down processes for the combustion engines?,1410164640,"For as long as I've read about cars, it's been beat into my head that piston engines need some time to warm up and cool so the metal expansion and lubrication get into optimal operating ranges and not cause damage.  Some cars, namely recent BMW M offerings, even had a reduced redline until all things were up to temperature.

My question is how cars like the new Porsche 918, McLaren P1, and BMW i8 deal with the thermal cycles.  They are designed to run on electric mode at slow speed and deliver full power from the engine at a jab of the throttle.  If one were driving a 918 from a cold start on a near freezing day, would it just fly to 8500rpm cold at the stab of the gas or are the some aids to help that?

Then I went down to 717ohms which gave me 1388mV but then at 420 it jumped up to 1536mV. I have randomized my measurements and retaken them. I let it cool down for 5min (although it didn't feel warm) just in case. It didn't change, It always went up to 1536mV. The current seemed fine, it increased on a constant base. At 420ohm it was 3.67mA The potentiometer can have a maximum load of 200mA and 0.125watt, my calculations tell me that with a 1.5v battery I can have a minimum resistance of 18ohms, which is far away from the 420ohm.

91,Is it possible for a speed bump in a 50km/h zone to cause the foundations of a nearby building to fracture over time (from shockwaves created by the impact of car tires)?,1409970276,"Today a stranger struck up a short conversation with me, and this was the gist of it:

**Stranger:** Installing speed bumps causes nearby buildings' foundations to fracture over time.

**Me:**  Really?  How?

**Stranger:**  It's all the impacts from cars.  The shock waves spread out and affect the buildings.

**Me:**  So they travel through the dirt...?

**Stranger:**  Well, *where else would they go*?!

And then he walked away.  

My first thought about his idea was ""How in the bloody hell could a car's tires hit a speed bump so hard that the shock wave could pass through a few inches of asphalt and a few feet of dirt and remain strong enough to affect concrete foundations that happen to be touching the dirt?!""

I don't like to make assumptions, though, and thinking about the problem made me sort of curious.  I did some Googling when I got home and couldn't find a shred of information on this.

So, these are my questions for you:

Is it possible for a speed bump to affect the foundations of a building (whether the affect happens over time or immediately)?  

If so, is it a common problem or does it only happen with bad designs or in extreme circumstances? 

If not, would you please explain why in ELI5 terms?

This part is no longer available, so I am trying to source an equivalent component.
The markings aren't clear, but the capacitor seems to be rated at 4 Amps, and is used on Uk mains at 240 V rms (=340V peak).
What capacitance is required?

A little more information:
The capacitor is slightly different to the one in the diagram above:
Each end has a live, neutral, and earth lead.
One end connects to the mains lead and the other end connects to the motor brushes and field coil (in parallel).
I'm guessing that the 3 wires should pass straight through the component, and that the capacitor should be across the live/neutral.  (A multimeter indicates a short between live/neutral at one end, and no connection to live at the other end).
The component body is 26mm diameter and 50mm long.

The motor is 2kW.  It has a commutator (and so is thought NOT to be an induction motor).
Since (not counting the earths) 2 leads go into the component from the mains, and 2 leads come out to the motor, this doesn't sound like a start or a run capacitor (which would only affect the windings).  
I'm guessing it is either:- 
- to align the voltage and current phase, to give the optimum power factor.
- or to suppress high frequency noise sent back to the supply.

So I need advice on whether to accept a position or keep applying. And how accepting this position might impact future positions. Thanks in advance for any advice!

TL;DR Had job in automotive industry. Moved and currently unemployed. Received contract offer for another automotive company but not in the direction I want to take my career. How does accepting affect future opportunities?

Background: I am a mechanical engineer and graduated in 2012 with my BSME. I had been working in the automotive industry (Detroit) for 2 years. Cars are cool but I didn't really care for my position and never really saw a long term career there. I just moved across country to be near my family and for my SO to have better work opportunities (we moved without jobs when our lease ran up). I have been unemployed for 1 month now and my SO and I live at my parents for the time being. I do have student loans and a car payment but I have funds to last at least through February. I have interviewed with 4 companies now and hopefully a 5th next week. I even received an offer but turned it down since I was really under-qualified.

Today I received an offer for a contract position (6-12 months, not sure at the moment) with possible full time placement. It is still in the automotive industry and the position would be mainly analytical work looking at warranties. Any hands on work would be mainly looking at returned parts and determining problems. I'm pretty capable of doing this work and it would give me experience on a new part of a vehicle. It would also be a 1 hour commute (without traffic) each way and probably 1.5 hours once we get our own place. The job sounds interesting but I would really like to get into a more product development role especially in the medical device area. This position would be a nice pay increase (and hourly) but with little benefits (minimum healthcare, 401k but no match, few vacation days).

My concerns: I'm worried accepting this position will make it harder to find another job outside of the automotive industry in the future. I'd really like to get into product development or the medical industry and this is even further from that than my first job. Does accepting this position make it harder to get away from this in the future and into what I actually want? Should I hold out and keep looking for a job? Accept but leave if I get another job (which I hate to do, especially for a contract position)?

We are running an interactive show, and one of the effects we want is to have a small piece of paper drift from the ceiling on command, which is about 10 feet high. We were thinking of sandwiching a small piece of metal between two pieces of paper and attaching it to the magnet.

We are using 30 gauge magnet wire, which is *very tightly* wrapped around an iron rod about 4"" long and 1/4"" diameter. We tried 22 gauge, but it didn't work very well.

We ran into some problems though:

* It can't be on a battery. Getting to it is a huge pain and we can't have it go out in the middle of a show. We have it on an AC adapter plugged into a dimmer pack (120VAC @ 15amps), which lets us not kill people and easily turn it on and off through the show control systems.

* It gets hot. A 6V @ 500mA adapter didn't create a strong enough magnet. At 12V @ 900ma, after 15 seconds it got to 250F on the infrared thermometer before I unplugged it.

* It needs to not be a fire hazard because there is mostly fabric below it. We would be fine putting it in a wooden or insulated metal container of some sort.

So that's the challenge. Also if we can do this without an electromagnet that would be fine -- the only real requirement is to have the paper fall on command.",AskEngineers,nalandial,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2fgu8l/how_can_i_make_a_small_electromagnet_that_can/

As a personal goal, I've always said I wanted to earn £100k a year, and from what I've been told / seen in the last year, that just isn't achievable.

I've even discussed this with my boss - we've become good friends - and I've said openly that I feel really ungrateful for feeling like this because I know I'm well paid but I just can't shake the feeling of wanting more money (or at least the ability to achieve my goal eventually). He doesn't feel adequately rewarded either.

Don't really know what I'm asking here - but this has been annoying me for a while now and maybe it just helps to stick it on here and get a bit of discussion going.

I am attending a really good engineering school in Canada but I am planning on attending another school for my masters so going up to them and asking them will be kinda hard. I have had 'offers' from my professors but I am interested in going somewhere else new.

I am interested in heat transfer/energy systems but I don't know what to tell these people on the email (I will be attaching my transcript and resume - I've had 5-6 internships). 
Let me give you an example: I like eating (engineering) and my favorite food is pizza (heat transfer/energy) but I just don't know the finer details of growing a cow to produce the best cheese for the pizza (bubble formation in a high speed shock wave fluid).

I also feel silly saying 'hey I really liked those 2 heat transfer courses and the x-chapter was my favorite...so can I do research for you?'


How do I approach a prof through email to get them interested in giving me a position? 

My plan is to short like 3-4 profs and go through their research and if they have openings listed somewhere and just make an email but I also don't want to waste his time.

2 of my internships were in engineering sales, so I should be an expert at this....but for some reason, I am intimidated when it comes to sounding smart against a man who has spent more than a decade studying something that I barely know but want to learn.

40,Quick Structural Design Question,1409759804,"Hey everyone,


I am building a steel stand that will be supporting a large metal block.


I've designed the stand to be made up of 4 steel plate legs welded onto a base plate, with a top supporting surface welded to the top of the legs that is essentially a donut-shaped plate (basically a circular surface with a smaller circle cut out of the middle). 


I need to run a few calculations that I am unsure about. 


First: how do I check that the top plate and stand as a whole will not fail under the weight? The legs will be steel in compression, so I'm not worried about that. But I am concerned the top plate will fail. I have calculated the contact surface area between the metal block and the top plate, and I know how much to block weighs.


Second: How do I check if the stand will topple over if the block tilts a few degrees while on the stand? My only thought was checking center of gravity in AutoCAD while tilting the block manually.


Third: Since there is nothing supporting the middle of the block, how do I check if the plate and block will sag towards the middle?

57,How can I best prepare myself to study engineering?,1409700081,"Hello all. So a bit of background, I'm twenty-four years old and I've been serving in the Navy for four years as a Chinese linguist. Thanks to my training at DLI, I'm only one CLEP test away from attaining my Associates Degree in Chinese. I have almost two more years left on Active Duty and I've decided on going to school for Computer Engineering on my GI bill. It's been about 6 years (not counting DLI Monterey) since I've been in school full-time and I want to hit the ground running when I go back to college.

I've been writing software in Python at work now for almost a year; it's something I really enjoy and I try to find ways to challenge myself to become better at it every day, so I feel that I am preparing myself well in that regard already. 

In high school, I studied up to pre-cal and I've using Khan Academy to brush up on my math and get my feet wet with Calculus. That being said, it's been a while since I've taken a formal math class, so that's really what I'm most concerned with. I've always been pretty decent with math, but I've learned not to rely on talent when trying to become proficient in anything non-trivial. Are there any other resources or books in particular that you would recommend?

I was married briefly and after our annulment, I realized that family and romantic interests are much lower on my priority list than what they had been. I tend to live in my head, and although I have a relatively vivacious personality and get along well with people face-to-face, I wouldn't consider myself a social butterfly. What I'm trying to communicate is that I'm ready and willing to spend a significant amount of free time over the next couple years preparing myself for my education as an engineer. 

From looking at different curriculums for undergraduate Computer Engineering programs, I'm getting the impression that I should focus a lot of my efforts on studying Calculus (multivariable and differential), Physics, and Electronics. Do those seem like solid subjects to focus my time on?

Also, something else I've realized over the past few years is the importance of mentorship. Thankfully, I have a couple really good mentors in programming at the place I work, but for the other subjects I mentioned, do you have any suggestions as to how to find good mentors?

On a slightly different tangent, I've realized over the past couple years that the world is rampant with critics and often scarce in solutions. I feel the intel community, in particular, is full of people who complain without having a solution. 

Often, it's because they don't have the social skills to navigate an organization; who are not able to communicate their vision to other people and motivate them to share in that vision and make it reality. Sometimes, they lack the technical skills to bring their ideas to fruition they can't -for one reason or another- bring that talent to their team. Others simply lack any imagination for anything beyond being criticizing the system they're a part of.

My reason for wanting to be an Engineer is that it seems to me that being an Engineer involves the creativity, the technical and social skill, and the drive to make ideas reality. I desperately want to make the world a better place and to be challenged, and I think I might have the mind for it. If there's anything I haven't thought of or if you have any tips on what I mentioned, I'm all ears. Thanks, guys (and gals).

I'm looking for tips and resources on how best to prepare myself to go to school for Computer Engineering in two years.

64,New engineering grad career help,1409680579,"Good afternoon,

I am finishing up my dual BS/MS degree from a US university. My study is in EE with a focus on Integrated Electronics (Analog Design). I am a foreign student and have had difficulties with finding co-ops in a related field (most positions I applied to required US citizenship/Green card). I will be searching a full time position soon. 
My career goal is to be an Analog/Mixed-signal design engineer. Most of the design positions I looked at requires certain years of experience in the industry or a PhD. I have neither. What types of entry level position should I look for where I can climb up the ladder to be a design engineer?

Also, I have thought of applying to the UK as well. I won't need a sponsor to stay in the UK, but I have heard from my friends over at UK about the lack of jobs there. I'm open to any location as long as I can get good experience as a new grad.

66,Mechanical engineer 1.5 years out thinking about new career,1409678870,"So I graduated in December of 2012 with a BSME from the university of Missouri (go Tigers!). I started my current job in March after a few months looking for work. My GPA was not very high due to working 30+ hours a week and graduating on time, paying most of my expenses myself. My final GPA was in the 2.3-2.4 range which made some career paths difficult/unattainable.

I accepted a position at a fluid equipment distributor here in my home town of Kansas City. My job title is Applications Engineer/inside sales, so most of what I do is equipment sizing (pump curves, head calculations, product knowledge) along with pricing, quoting, and direct customer interactions along with supporting our outside sales staff.

Our company is on the smaller side (10-15) which has its ups and downs. My salary is decent (around 50k), but not great by any means. I do like everyone I work with, and my boss has been good to me with extra perks-company phone, company truck, etc.

But I feel it has been long enough that I should start looking around. I don't dislike what I do, but just feel the need for a change and to see what else is out there. Currently my boss's plan is to move me into outside sales shortly and have me hire/train my replacement. Not a bad option to stick with, but not sure if I really want that life. I see our sales staff struggling with getting new accounts and dealing with all sorts of BS and dumb people. Most of our business is municipal on the waste water side, so the people you deal with are not really the smartest/easy to work with. Maybe sales engineer of a different sort would be something I am interested in.

Obviously I would enjoy a job that paid me 100k+ And would let me do other things in my free time without working me to death.

One thing that is difficult is the fact that there are just so many options out there. Manufacturing, consulting, sales, design, etc.

Also I wouldn't mind just quitting my job, and taking 2 months to travel Europe and some other places, but I would need to save up for a bit.

Location is not too important, except I hate the cold lol.

What are your thoughts with my situation? Recommendations? Money is not the main goal, but it is a decent factor.

TLDR; Mech engineer 1.5 years experience in fluid equip/sales looking for new gig. Open to lots of options.

87,Is a thermal shock sometimes necessary for a Die-Cast Aluminium IM Rotor??,1409584969,"We've recently had some of our Die-Cast Aluminium rotors pre-commissioned by another company. After doing a Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) they found an imbalance in one of the rotor bars. The other rotors that passed the test, were subjected to both light and heavy loads. This rotor with the imbalance however, was only tested under light, no-load conditions. Their argument was that no further testing was required, as it is clear that the rotor was faulty.

Since the rotor cage was assembled with a molten metal die-cast, the possibility of inter-bar short circuits in the core increases. It is my opinion that this rotor needs to undergo a thermal shock (full-load current run) in order for the rotor bars to expand axially and break apart any possible short circuits between bar and core. The expansion rate of aluminium is a lot more than that of the core and would result in movement between the two parts.

It operates in the UHV regime (10^-9 mbar) and so has to make use of CF flanged connections with copper gaskets. Unfortunately we also need to regularly vent the chamber and open it to atmosphere.

Rather than using a CF connection for the flange that will be opened most often, we have decided instead to use a QCF connection (PDF WARNING: [information here](http://www.technoport-jp.com/pdf/VACOM/qcf_chain%20clamps.pdf)). Although QCF is a lot more convenient than CF, unfortunately, in part due to the geometry of our system, we have difficulty consistently getting an even, tight seal around the ring.

One idea I had was that perhaps instead of sealing by hand, we could attach motors to the two bolts of the XS100 chain and apply the 35Nm torque quickly, consistently and reliably.

5,Electric skid-steer hotrod concept,1409499195,"I have linked to a bunch of youtube videos, so if you don't already have the Reddit Enhancement Suite plugin installed you may consider using that because it makes it convenient to open them inline.

Hello, so I have this idea for an electric skid-steer hotrod/street legal racer that I have been thinking of for awhile, and I wanted to run it by you guys in case you have any feedback or think your background may apply and can give me ideas for making it work.  Possibly you will just say that it won't work at all for various reasons.  I think I know what those reasons are and have ideas for getting around those challenges but obviously I am not a mechanical or electrical engineer so am very excited to hear what you guys think.

The idea is that a lightweight electric vehicle can obtain very impressive acceleration and speeds.  For drag performance of very lightweight electric vehicles, videos like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqlyG-HIB5k inspire me.

Performance of tracked vehicles is inspired by videos like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_iup2jXQqI

Of course this is not a tracked vehicle, rather a skid-steer with rubber tracks, but similar hopefully in the amount of traction versus normal tires.

This electric skid-steer hotrod will have tracks rather than wheels.  It could basically just be something like over-the-wheel tracks like this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV8kigj8otU) but a key part of the idea is that a big problem race cars have is maintaining traction while going around corners fast, and having a rubber track fully on the ground rather than just tires touching in certain places would provide a great deal more traction and therefore allow the machine to corner much much faster.

Obviously normal skid-steer vehicles are slow.  They have heavy wheels.  This concept doesn't share any of the normal skid-steer vehicles operating principles except the idea that there are two tracks or sets of wheels that move in sync.

My idea is to simply attach wheels to the motor directly, then put two more wheels in back that have no motor but simply are ""along for the ride"" pulled by the track.

I plan to put two of these Warp 9 motors (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXmelRFPLtQ), mount wheels directly on them, get some Lithium Ion batteries (not a huge amount) and also an ultracapacitor bank or two like this one http://www.maxwell.com/products/ultracapacitors/docs/hq_48v_ds10162013.pdf.  The ultracapacitors can discharge a much greater amount of power at once so they could allow for a boost of power needed for acceleration, especially from a standstill, while allowing for a much smaller number of batteries, providing a much better power-to-weight ratio than just using batteries.

This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P5tmXbta6U demonstrates some of the capability of ultracapacitors for powering motors.

The idea is to build a very small and lightweight chassis out of something like carbon fiber, or something similar but much cheaper.  I actually believe it might be possible to use plain old FRP to build a safe rollcage.  Not easy to engineer using that material, but could be much cheaper if you can figure out how to make it strong enough.  Or maybe just some kind of hybrid material like BMW is using for their new electric vehicle rather than ""pure"" carbon fiber.

The display will be heads-up.  Maybe something simple like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0gjQEpUuUs perhaps using teleprompter glass so it will work during daylight.

Its a high-tech hot rod so I would like it to have high-tech racing stripes.  I am thinking it would be great if you could take flexible OLEDs like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU2nG9qy6vs and make them longer or put them together to create a display on the outside of the car.  Could be flames or some kind of warp effect synchronized with the movement of the vehicle.

The control system could be as simple as an Arduino Pro Mini as used in this example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2VTNoRaiJ0.  The input could be something like this Logitech Extreme Pro Joystick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzQUnkL6RNw integrated with the Arduino like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4o_gnQixr8

The body could be inspired by something like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ujiVgXSVkc

I'm interested in working with/creating electrical devices, be it computer chips to moving robots that assemble cars and as a result am having trouble choosing. From my google searches I've found that mechanical, mechatronic and electrical engineers all play a role in these devices and machines.

8,Can light traveling through a fiber cable heat up water.,1409496029,"Hello everyone,

I was thinking about solar power plants and I was looking at [this kind](http://www.finetubes.co.uk/uploads/images/gemasolar-2011-2_low_res.jpg) As they are great they take up a lot of space, cost a lot, and the energy has to travel to get to where it is needed (resulting in a loss of energy). 

I remembered a company that makes solar collectors and pipes the light into your house via fiber optics to light your building. Here is a link for the [this](http://www.brightenyourhome.net/Hybrid-Solar-Lighting.html)

My question is if you had enough of the solar collectors around say downtown in some large city. You have all of these fiber cables running into some building that has a turbine and water tank. Could this be used to produce energy and would it be efficient? I am thinking you have a lot of room on top of building you can put the collectors, the turbine doesn't have to be a big because you can build many of these around the city so you have less energy loss and during a disaster less places will be out of electricity. 

So it this something that is doable or am I completely wrong here? Thank you. ",AskEngineers,mawkishdave,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2f32fo/can_light_traveling_through_a_fiber_cable_heat_up/

T/Fw

1. I get it now, thanks everyone for your responses.

20,Looking for materials/tools advice for making very durable small bags,1409422618,"I've been making a hobby out of fabricating my own freeweights lately.  Kettlebells are rather straightforward when made from concrete and copper tubing, but I'd like to look into making 'soft' kettlebells, i.e. small bags of steel or lead shot.  



The idea is to fabricate a bag no larger than a gallon milk jug that can reliably hold 30-70 pounds of dense granular material (more on this in a moment) while being swung, lifted, or dropped.  To make such a bag, I figure that I need to research the following aspects:


1.)  Choice of fabric.  High tensile strength, abrasion resistance, and low flex loss are important, but just as important is the ability to attach pieces of it together without expensive tools, either via adhesive, thermal bonding, or sewing.  There are some sailcloth materials out there that look promising, like Spectra, but I don't know how to sew Spectra.  Very thick hemp canvas might also be good, but I don't know of any suppliers. 


2.) Choice of tools.  Given a certain fabric that can be tailored, I need some solution for making very strong, flexible seams with it.  I don't want to buy a sewing machine for this project, but I am willing to buy hand tools or adhesives.  I also have access to a regular sewing machine.



3.) Ballast.  Dense material is preferred, but I want to avoid hazardous things like lead dust, or lead shot if it will create lead dust over time and usage.  Steel shot is an option, but if there's a source in the US for something that's cheaper or more dense, I'd like to consider it.  Maybe there's a cheap and dense type of blasting media I could use.



If anyone has advice or suggestions for materials or suppliers, I think that would help a bunch.

27,Wheel Aerodynamics picture,1409380140,"So I've been trying to wrap my head around the aerodynamics in terms of air flow around a wheel. Unfortunately, I'm not very knowledgeable on physics, but I think I'm pretty close.

I'm trying to visualize a model that can use colors to show where air speed is highest. For now, I am including both rotational air flow and forward movement. This is for a rolling wheel.

So I made an image with two different options.
The simple one is a linear gradient, which assumes that air speed increases in a linear fashion.
v= velocity of the bicycle, and the axle is locked to the frame, at 1v. The point of ground contact is 0v since the wheel contacts the ground and the ground isn't moving. Therefore, the point at TDC is 2v.

1v is represented by R127 G0 B127. (median)
2v is represented by R255 G0 B0. (peak)
0v is represented by R0 G0 B255. (ground contact)

What I'm still trying to wrap my head around is what happens to the velocity at the points between TDC and center. 

I think I know the answer here, but I'm trying to account for all of the major factors.

So option #1 is a linear increase:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/45969744@N08/14892537677/in/photostream/ (ignore the layer text)

Option #2 is a curved increase that attempts to reflect the increase in velocity increasing with Pi as the distance from center increases. It also adds in the velocity of the cycloid (forward movement). Examining a 180 degree rotation, going from BDC (velocity = 0) to level with the center as the midpoint, the forward movement is just 13% over the same time (equivalent to 210 pixels compared to 1361 forward after it passes the midpoint). At the midpoint then, wind speed from forward movement should be 13% of peak. So I adjusted the color gradient so it is 13% of 256 (83) at the midpoint via curves. I had to create a custom curve to somewhat match what I thought the cycloid would represent and to prevent the native curve from clipping to black too early. This much is guesswork, but should be fairly close. The way I did the math worked to show the expected results. There is a tiny area (or just one pixel) that actually shows the peak values for Red and Blue.

Image here:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/45969744@N08/15079996235/in/photostream/

If you load these into photoshop yourself, you should be able to use the info box to pull pixel information and RGB values through the entire circle (sorry, it's not full res, the original is 4500x3000, let me know if I should upload those, so there may be some JPG compression artifacts). You should notice that the curved variant has a strong tendency to approach mid value (R127 G0 B127) and the edges in the top half have a stronger Red Bias.

I would love to hear what I have done wrong here (and please be specific if I have done something dramatically wrong or ignored something that would make a &lt;5% difference). I want to get this as close as possible, but it's still just a mental exercise.

I am currently a masters student in mechanical engineering looking for an internship next summer in the petroleum industry. I am not too particular about what specific position, reservoir, pump design, drilling etc...

My undergrad research is involved with optimizing renewable energy technologies such as solar panels and geothermal heating to work in residential homes.

I chose this field because I enjoy working with energy systems. Petroleum has recently sparked my interest and I was wondering if my undergrad work in renewables will hurt my chances at getting into a position in the petroleum industry.

A little extra info about my experience and projects:

- developed a non traditional heating and cooling system for a large HVAC company (TRANE) which did not involve using a condenser.

- Optimized solar panel arrays for residential homes

- A few company competitions where a 2 person or more team was challenged to create innovative renewable energy technologies. The winners received intern positions and were almost guaranteed full time positions afterward. We made it to the 2nd round of 3 total. All were international competitions.

- Had an internship that turned into part time work while I was in school as a process engineer. Our plant ran 24 hours throughout the weekdays and I took on large projects to help improve production.

- Created an energy model for one of the local campus buildings. This work was also used to help start the LEED certification process for that building.

- Created multiple energy models with the Dept. of Energy software, both as class projects and as volunteer work for the community (energy auditor). 

I am hoping that my work involved with the renewable energy sector will not hurt my chances at getting involved in the petroleum industry. What do you think?

I was wondering if anyone has gone through an interview with them to provide me an idea of the types of questions they ask.  It’s not a formal interview; I’m interviewing over the phone, but I feel like they may ask me stuff regarding safety (H:V for trenches X feet by X feet, etc.).  I figure they’ll ask about my experience but would like to know other potential questions.  I really want this job so I won’t lose my skillset (currently working for a major supplier of planes and weapons for the government) and it would be more money starting off and every two to three years afterwards till I retire.

46,Recommendations for Heating Elements?,1409320871,"I have come to you guys for recommendation for a container that would hold near boiling salt water.  I thought I had my heating set up all perfected, boy was I wrong. 
I am heating approximately 115 pounds of water to 90 C, my containers are 10 inches tall and I have filled them all up to the 6.5-7 inch mark.  The rectangular fiberglass containers are covered with matching lids and in my set up I have a fiber glass rod that stands in between the container and the lid, supported by the walls of the container.  The heating element is attached to the center of the rod with tape and hangs by the intersection of the cord and the plastic enclosing material that is supposed to protect the circuitry of the heater.  The heating element itself was attached via the power cord into a temperature controller  and was set up to have a hysteresis of 2 degrees and turns of the heating element when it reaches to a temp range of 88-92 C.  Meaning that near constant operation of the heating element is required.  

In my set-up the plastic enclosure was sitting underneath the lid and I believe that the steam and salt in the water contributed to the heaters shorting.  Especially since the steam condenses at the lid and falls back down through the circuitry. The plastic case melted, and the heaters stopped working.  
I was wondering if a longer heating element would work better as then the circuitry could be kept away from the water,  I would make a hole in the lids and rest the base of the elements over the hole.  Do any of you have any recommendations for immersion heaters, other alternative heaters or even alternative set ups?
The heaters I am currently working with : http://www.toolplanet.com/product/Stark-Water-Boiling-Heater-Element-90001/home-equipment
One of the problems I had with the heater was that the insulation inside the plastic incasing has been damaged for all 5 elements I have purchased and many of them had improper connections  (loose connections, i.e. ground not completely attached, had to resolder).

54,ME/EE Career/Educational Advice Needed,1409263028,"I am a 24yo practicing mechanical engineer at somewhat of a career/educational crossroads, and am looking for some advice on how to proceed. My story (warning: this is long):

I graduated in 2011 with a BSME from a state university. I worked hard, got good grades (actually did learn and understand the material, wasn't just learning for the tests, etc.), finished at the top of my class, and loved what I was doing, so I thought that graduate school would be a great option for me. In the summers during my undergraduate studies, I had worked in the research lab of one of my professors, and due to the interesting work and the reasonably good working relationship we had developed, I decided to pursue an MSME with this professor immediately after graduation. I was able to apply a number of my undergrad course credits to my graduate work, leaving me more time for research, and thus was supposed to be on the fast track to finish my MSME in one year. We also had a new professor join the department, and due to his similar research interests, brought him onto the project as a co-adviser.

For my project, we were developing a more budget-friendly and marketable version of a special materials testing system. The particular system we were developing is currently only commercially available from a very small number of companies, typically is not an off-the-shelf product, and thus comes with a very hefty price tag. Our machine started as a senior capstone design project some 4-6 years before I started grad school, so the hardware for the system (frame, hydraulics, electrical box, etc.) had been designed, ordered, and partially assembled. My goal was basically to finish assembling the machine, develop the software and control system to run the machine, and show that we could use it to collect new and useful material data. Seemed like a reasonable goal at the time.

Throughout my first year or so of writing software and designing the control architecture, I gradually started recognizing a number of serious problems with the design of the machine. It started with smaller things, like incorrectly sized load cells. Stupid mistakes, but fixable. However, I gradually realized that a) good servohydraulic control systems are extremely difficult to design and program from scratch, b) quality off-the-shelf controllers for such hydraulics systems do exist, though from limited sources, and most importantly c) the hydraulic system that had been designed and built for our machine was not well-suited to closed-loop control (nonlinear, slow/lagging response, etc.). A professional would probably have known this right from the start, but my and my advisers' (they aren't controls people) inexperience resulted in me learning it the hard way. In spite of this, I decided to stay on board for a second year to try to address the problems, expecting that it would result in a better quality thesis. Over the second year, however, I really wasn't able to make any significant progress. My original adviser was very busy and thus relatively removed from the project (conferences, meetings, classes, and a 9-month absence to serve on a government board). My coadviser, albeit a nice guy and a good teacher, is not an especially great adviser. He wanted this machine to be able to do everything the big machines could, but wouldn't spend any money to upgrade the hardware and do it right, despite my recommendations. He is up for tenure in the fall, yet will be graduating his first student in September (3 others, including myself, got jobs without finishing). He also took 4 years to get his master's and 6-7 for his PhD, so I think being a student forever seems normal to him... In any event, I got fed up with the lack of resources and guidance, yet unchanging expectations to make the machine work well, so I got a job in September of last year and have been working full time since. I work locally and thought I would still try to finish my thesis, but to be honest I don't feel comfortable finishing it because I don't think there are nor will there be enough quality results to be sufficient for a master's level work. Plenty of ""future work and improvements,"" but no real results other than my realization that our machine sucks. My focus has therefore been on my job, and my unfinished degree has kind of fallen by the wayside.

Fast-forward to now. I have an OK job at a struggling startup. The pay is average ($60K/yr; $55-70K + full benefits is more typical in my area) and I have no benefits other than health insurance, flex time, and vacation. While I am very involved in the work and have certainly made myself valuable to the company, the work isn't especially challenging and I don't really feel like I'm using a lot of what I went to school for. I'm doing a lot of 3D design as well as designing and building electrical control systems, and am realizing how much more I enjoy doing electrical/controls and system automation/integration work than the typical CAD, machine design, etc. work that ME's do. However I also miss a lot of the systems modeling and actual control design (Matlab, Simulink, etc.) that I used to do in school, and really have no expectations of doing any of that at my current job. Basically I'm realizing now that I probably should have gone to school for EE... In addition, I am up for annual review soon, and any raise I get would likely be minimal due to the company's current financial struggles. So I am really at a loss for how I should proceed; here are my options as I see them:

1) Power through and write my MSME thesis. This is the obvious solution, but as I said, my thesis work is shoddy at best. The thesis is either going to be a) this is why our machine sucks, or b) fluffing it up to sound like it works better than it really does. Neither has real results and neither is at an acceptable level for a master's thesis, in my opinion. I also feel like the thesis-master's is the least useful of the advanced degrees unless you're going for a PhD after. It's more work than the non-thesis ME degree despite being looked at the same way by most employers, yet doesn't make you much more qualified for most industry jobs than someone with only a bachelor's. At the same time, it doesn't really qualify you for many research jobs because the PhD is typically more desirable or necessary. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how I see it.

2) Take an additional class and get a non-thesis ME degree (Masters of Engineering). I believe this only requires documentation/short report of what I did, as opposed to a full blown thesis. I think this is the quickest and easiest solution but haven't decided how it will affect my career options, i.e., if it will limit me to less-technical career options much like the position I am currently in, or if it will keep me from branching into more of an EE position.

3) Try to roll my existing graduate credits into a non-thesis EE master's program. This would require more coursework and probably wouldn't be paid for, but would be more in line with my interests and potentially have the most desirable outcome.

4) Jump ship. Screw the degree. Pack up and look for a new job that is more in line with what I want to do and what other people my age are receiving for salary, benefits, etc. Maybe even find a company that will facilitate my ""career change"" to EE by paying for my additional classes to get the non-thesis MSEE. I do worry how an unfinished degree will look on my resume when looking for jobs, though, so I am admittedly hesitant to consider this option.

I'm frustrated and confused because I know I have the intellectual capacity for high level technical and analytical work, which you typically find in research settings, but I feel like I wasted that potential on a shitty, dead-end grad school experience and set myself back 3 years, not counting the time it may take to catch myself back up. I certainly learned a lot (the hard way), which really is what's important, however it's quite difficult to talk positively about a miserable project to someone that might hire you.. I also had such a terrible grad school experience that I've really been turned off to the idea of a research, but this is likely where I will find a job that is sufficiently challenging and analytical. Perhaps it would be different elsewhere, but I don't know for sure.

I realize that was a lot of words, but I'd like to hear thoughts from other practicing engineers about what you would do in my situation. Thanks for reading, and any advice is greatly appreciated.

TL: DR - I got kind of screwed over with a shitty MSME project and took a full time job without finishing. I can't decide whether to try to finish it, change degree programs, or just keep working and look for a different job. Advice requested!

I am in a position where I have to make a lot of ""aged"" paper for prop purposes and my current process is too slow for the volume I'm doing.

The current process is:

* Make strong, hot, black tea.
* Submerge paper in tea for X minutes (where X is usually 2 - 15)
* Remove from tea bath.
* Manually dab the paper with a tea bag to add aged mottling.
* Air dry.

The end result is a piece of aged looking paper with a mottled appearance.

I'm looking to mechanize.

Thoughts I've had so far:

* Color dyes to match the tea - Leaves a perfect colored finish. :/
* Conveyor belt - Must be fine mesh so the belt doesn't leave lines where tea/dye accumulate.
* Submerged conveyor belt?
* Mottling with a ""mottled"" stencil pattern
* Drying oven at end of conveyor
* Keeping paper flat instead of curling through heat/wetting is an issue.

Are there any machines that do something similar for other industries? Or any patents/ideas which might be helpful in building such a thing?

I am an engineering student interning at a start-up medical devices company. I am in charge of optimizing a micro-injection needle.
We want to create a customized needle, and I'm currently looking into fabrication technologies.

However, it is quite hard to find a technology that is capable of the required precision (&lt;10µm) and creating structures of 6 millimeters high. 

The ones I've found so far are plasma etching (in silicon), X-ray LIGA and wire-EDM. These technologies would probably be used to create a mold, which would be filled by micro-injection molding.

My other question is more detailed.

My plan is as follows, I have a 12KG weighing television, and I want to mount this from a wall sitting at a guesstimated 40 degrees angle.
I know that I'm going to have to grab me some pretty damn beefy stepper motors to make the parts I want to move move.

What I'd like to know is what kind of material I'd best use, will thick aluminum or will I need steel instead?
What can I do to prevent the parts from sagging because of gravity? Can I use springs for any arms I might design?

And in general, any tips on how to go about this?

86,What cool and fun engineering projects are there for high schoolers (10th and 11th grade)?,1409107093,"Howdy! I am an aerospace engineer with no teaching experience that decided to take on a whole new adventure. I am about to begin teaching an intro to engineering class at a private high school. The school's rough outline of the course is to teach about 10 different engineering disciplines to the students. The goal is to give the kids an overview of what different engineers do and how an engineer goes about solving problems and collaborating as a team. Each discipline is allotted 3 weeks during the school year and will have a speaker come in to talk to the class and hopefully a fun project to do.

The disciplines are:

+ software

+ electrical

+ petroleum

+ mechanical

+ industrial

+ environmental
+ chemical
+ civil
+ biomedical
+ aerospace

So engineers of reddit, what is your discipline? What is a major/important thing(s) to cover in your field? And do you know of any high school-level projects (maybe even simplified college projects) that will get them excited about engineering? Decent size projects, 1-2 weeks long, can be done in or out of school or both.

Ideas so far:

+ pasta/toothpick/balsawood bridge/cantilever/boom/tower

+ water bottle rocket

+ balsawood rubber band plane
+ raspberry pi/arduino led project
+ lego mindstorm project

88,Pressure regulator question - Concerning flow rates,1409099620,"I see that pressure regulator curves show different flow rates, but I am confused by this because I was under the impression that the flow rate would be an ""output"" of the force/pressure balance across the pressure regulator. 

For example, assuming the inlet to a regulator is 500 kPa, and the outlet is 25 kPa. The flow rate through the regulator is 25 m3/hr. 

Say we want to increase that flow rate. Wouldn't we then have to increase the inlet gas pressure? If we increase the inlet gas pressure to 700 kPa, then wouldn't the poppet close a little more to maintain the 25 kPa outlet, and then this would decrease the gas flow rate? So then isn't the flow rate just an ""output"" of the pressure relationship across the regulator?

I think I'm getting a bit mixed up with the relationship between flow and pressure. If anyone can shed some more light on this it would be greatly appreciated.

I've been working with my company for almost 3 months now immediately after graduation this past May as a Process Engineer and it's been going well so far. It's not what I had envisioned doing as a job since I'm more interested in design/analysis, particularly wanting to get into commercial aviation.

I just got forwarded an email today from my University's career service center about a job opening with the FAA and they wanted resumes to be able to start scheduling interviews on Thursday. It seemed really appealing and more aligned with the kind of work I wanted to get into so I sent my information to them. Turns out that 1 hour later, they called me showing interest and scheduled an interview with me this Friday.

I wanted some opinions on what my future would look like working with the FAA. Having a job with the government and understanding its nuances is nothing compared to working for a private company. While I'm not exactly expecting a job offer from this interview, I want to think about these things in the event I do get an offer.

Are salary negotiations possible despite that fact that the FAA compensates with pay bands?

Are there opportunities to move up towards higher level positions? I briefly looked at their retirement plan and it's nothing like a 401(k) that I'm used to knowing.

I come from a family of mostly engineers, but I’ve always had a difficult time getting a picture of what work is like on a daily basis due to the substantial amount of specific technical knowledge involved in their work (which I know basically nothing about) that I don’t understand yet.

Is there anything I can do to get an idea of what work might actually be like before I spend years studying to fully understand an engineering field?  Whenever I ask about questions about their work, I’ll often be told I need to take a few more years of classes for them to be able to begin to explain it…  **I suppose I’m seeking two things - what work is like on a daily basis (generally) within different engineering fields and what makes something worth working for** (besides the monetary compensation).  I tend to be motivated by the future as opposed to the present, so having a goal that I’m enthused by is vital for sustaining interest.

I was working in another field previously, but I ended up finding after a few years that the work wasn't suitable for me at a fundamental level.

23,"Building Gymnastics Equipment in backyard, would like someone to check my design.",1408933002,"Hello All,
So I am currently modifying my Behemoth of a pullup-bar and am adding floor-anchored cables and a second bar (which will have a custom built Dream Machine (gymnastics pulley system) attached to it).  

I have come to ask about the stability of my hypothetical structure. The reason I'm builing this is to be able to train the IRON CROSS.  My current setup isn't wide enough to allow me to stand with my arms to the side, so I must make a new bar without side-supports directly next to it.  

I have made some rough sketches of what I intend to build and was wondering if it looks safe/plausible.     

**NOTE:** *Dream machines work by feeding the cables that attach to your rings directly through a pulley that is connected to a belt that the user wears (pictures below).  It essentially cuts your weight in half, allowing you to train positions that you'd never normally be strong enough to even get into.*



First, this is what a Dream Machine/Rings pulley system looks like: http://imgur.com/a/s9KiW#3

This is what an Iron Cross on rings looks like: http://imgur.com/a/s9KiW#2

Here is what my current Pullup-Bar looks like (it is about 11.5 feet in height): http://imgur.com/a/s9KiW#0 

Here is my **rough sketch** of what I want to build: http://imgur.com/a/s9KiW#1

Now here is the HEART OF MY QUESTION:  **What kind of stabilizing structure should I add to my triangular brackets to quell lateral motion?**  
I am sure that this rig would be able to holdme up in the air, but when I descend into the deepest part of the cross (when my arms are parallel to the surface of the earth) my hands will be pulling the rings wider than the structure itself is.  

If anyone needs better drawings or new pictures, i'd be happy to take them.  Thank you very much for even reading this.  

EDIT: I realized that I drew cables grounding the structure in the sketch but never explained.  I dug  (4) 5-foot deep one foot thick holes  around the structure and filled them with concrete.  I then sunk in metal poles to each pillar of concrete so that I could later attach a cable to each metal pole to help stabilize the wooden structure itself.    My question is more about the lateral motion of the hypothetical brackets than the ability of the guide-lines to keep the damn thing up.  

**TLDR**: How wide should my new horizontal support bar be ideally (I'm guessing that it should be a little more than my wingspan) and also how should the brackets holding the bar to the two upright wooden pillars be shaped to not shake uncontrollably when I do movements on it?

25,Most efficient way to move fluid laterally?,1408918341,"Say I have two parallel, unsloped, equal-level channels full of water, not too far apart, which I want to keep in continuous recirculating motion by pumping from the downstream end of one channel into the upstream end of the other.  Ideally the flow is as uniform as possible in both channels, and assume the maximum speed is slow enough that turbulence in the channel is negligible. How do I keep this water moving at a given minimum speed in most parts of the channels with the least expenditure of energy?   

I think the size of the pipes between the channels should be reasonably large, to permit the least restriction of flow.  If the pipe is smaller than the channel, conservation of mass would seem to require that the water in the pipe needs to flow faster than the water in the channel, but the kinetic energy used to accelerate the water in the pipe to this higher speed seems unlikely to be recovered.  

All the pumps I've ever seen, however, produce a narrow, high-velocity jet of water at the outlet. Isn't there a more efficient way to slowly transfer a large volume of water through a large tube without first squirting it at high speed through a tiny nozzle?  Or is that really the most efficient way to produce pressure further along the pipe?  If it's not, why do even very fairly powerful pumps have relatively small outlets?  It is just because people usually don't want to lay huge pipes?

An afterthought -- If the water arrives at the downstream end of the channel with some leftover kinetic energy, it might be desirable to recover some of it and use it to accelerate the water back the other way -- perhaps there's a way to couple a waterwheel in the downstream end of one to help drive an impeller in the upstream end of the other?

31,How do I design a concussion free hat?,1408897844,"3 years ago, I had a concussion that took me out for 3 months. One year later, I had another concussion that took me out for 6 months. Since then, I have had ~10 minor concussions from small blows. I don't think it counts as ""real concussions"", but I get all the symptoms and have to stay in bed for 2 weeks. I have a theory that I get the small concussions, because my head never gets enough time to fully heal.

At this point, I am very tired of getting sick all the time. So I feel it's time to start wearing some protective headwear. 

I don't want to walk around with a bike helmet all the time. Too heavy, too silly-looking and offers more protection than I really need (it's just to protect against small blows such as door frames, someone banging his head into mine etc).

I am strongly considering buying a nice hat (e.g. like the one Jack White is wearing: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JUVJCnG2d2A/UZNjuxileUI/AAAAAAAACCM/8UOBp_Amcbw/s640/HAT+47.png), and wad it with a material like foam rubber.

61,Brushless DC motor not spinning -- just vibrates back and forth.,1408665214,"Hello all. So I had an old CPU heatsink fan lying around in my electronics box and decided to take a look at the brushless motor powering it. I removed the fan and the pcb from the housing and was only left with the stator and case with the magnet around the inside of the case. [**Here**](http://imgur.com/a/XBEVB) are some pictures. And [**here**](http://www.formfactors.org/developer%5Cspecs%5Crev1_2_public.pdf) is the datasheet for the fan. 

From my understanding, the case with the magnet around the inside of its wall is supposed to move in a circle because that is where the fan was attached. The stator was soldered stationary to the pcb. So now that I took the motor apart I hooked up the two leads of where the magnet wire is connected to a 1.5V AAA battery. The stator now just makes a jerking back and forth movement as I disconnect and connect either the ground or +1.5V lead from the battery. I took a short video to show you what the motor is doing which you can see [**here**](http://tinypic.com/r/e04pzc/8). *Sorry the video ended up uploading upside-down.*

My issue is figuring out how to fix this. Why is the armature or the case not continuosly spinng as the battery is connected to it. Please bear in mind from the  datasheet I have linked to for the fan. From page *9* on that datasheet the fan has an operating voltage of 12 V +-1.2 V. Could it be that my 1.5V AAA battery is not supplying enough voltage to keep the stator moving so it's just jerking back and forth? 

Any input is greatly appreciated. Thanks for any and all help. ",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2e8agx/brushless_dc_motor_not_spinning_just_vibrates/

74,Dimples on bicycle wheels - discussion.,1408606014,"I'm doing some research on this topic for personal reasons and I'm finding a few things:
#1 - mythbusters.
#2 - airplanes.
#3 - cars.
#4 - golf balls
#5 - bicycle wheels (specifically Zipp)

Mythbusters - relates to a car with a static, non-rotating shape. Most experts I've read seem to feel that their results are questionable. Or at least explainable by things other than ""dimples are better"".

Airplanes - the fuselage is smooth for minimizing drag along long surfaces, with the tail providing a smooth transfer and a fairly small section of trailing edge turbulence and drag. Air speed is much, much higher than bicycle wheels, so not applicable. Wings on the other hand are designed for control of lift and drag is a necessary component of this.

Cars - Lexus, Ford Focus mirrors, etc... and I believe Mercedes has dabbled with dimples on forward edges. None have any significance because they are also static shapes. F1 is a different story as well since the shape is naturally much more conducive to minimizing trailing edge drag, so it's not worth it to try to reduce surface drag. ""Dimples"" and other turbulence/vortex generators are used near trailing edges, but typically for reasons of increasing downforce, which increases drag.

I did read an article on racecarengineering.com and it had an odd claim that suggested that F1 techs don't understand the aerodynamics of wheels as well as Zipp ""engineers"". I find this highly questionable, and it makes little sense after reading some of the other things written by Zipp's ""engineers"". Among my favorites have been ""wind tunnel data"" that compares wheels of various rim profiles and types with... no two wheels with the same or similar profiles. Not surprisingly, they discovered that the Zipp Discs came out on top. They didn't make much of the fact that no other discs were used.

But none of this appears to apply to a bicycle wheel. Most of the testing I have seen is wind-tunnel based and doesn't seem to pay a lot of attention to the fact that a rotating wheel is *much* different from a simple shape in the wind. 

I would love to see a visual representation of how static air reacts to an oncoming (and rolling) wheel in terms of peak air speed. I'm having trouble visualizing how to show that as a moment.

I see two different types of bicycle wheel. One with a rim (say around 50mm profile) and spokes, the other being a disc.

From what I can see, on a disc, the highest possibility for turbulence lies just behind and below the top of the wheel, where the wheel's forward momentum is close to double the land-speed of the bicycle.

The area just behind the forward top section of the wheel is full of spokes, so is already full of turbulence. This suggests to me that the strongest impact on trailing edge drag would be a texuring or VG on the tire, not the rim. Having a wider, bulging rim profile would seem to make dimples more useful than on a narrower rim, but this is more because the wider rim is by nature less aerodynamic than a narrow rim. On the trailing edge as well as on the leading edge.

On a disc wheel, the same circumstance exists, except there's a lot more surface area to create surface drag. To my mind, this means that it's closer to resembling an aerodynamic F1 car, which is better with smooth surfaces

Additionally, air flow encountering a rear wheel on a bicycle is already very turbulent due to most of the bike and rider being in front of it. Would a dimpled surface be better there or a smooth surface?

I'd like to hear some actual engineers weigh in on this. I've discussed this with engineers in the past and I find it fascinating, but hard to find definitive, substantiated answers that I can actually attempt to use actual math to verify.",AskEngineers,eschelar,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2e5t7o/dimples_on_bicycle_wheels_discussion/

Thankfully, I was offered a position as a design engineer in new product development at a medical device company. While my first plan was to become an engineering professor, my second plan had always been to be in R&amp;D, so I was thrilled. I was also thrilled that it wasn't a job in the auto industry as I also have never been that interested in cars, but growing up in Michigan, things get shoved down your throat. 

Anyway, I've been at my job for almost 3 months and I'm starting to get really bored. It's not just that I can't be trusted to really do anything yet - I understand that - it's that even the work that the other engineers are doing seems almost trivial. Maybe it's just the stage of the project (we're in the last engineering build before pre-production), but all the problems seem really small. Like, I pretty much instinctively know how to solve these problems despite knowing nothing, it's just a matter of running the tests and making sure we have all the materials to run the tests.  Yet everyone is freaking out over some of the issues. Obviously it's mainly because of timing, but frankly, timing problems are boring. 

Am I just being a little bitch and need to suck it up? I guess I had hoped that there would be more interesting problems to solve opposed to one's that have likely been solved many times over before. I fully expected to not really be involved in the interesting parts at first because I know nothing, but I figured my team at least would be solving interesting problems. 

Overall it's not a bad job. And I am learning things, but they all feel very logistical in nature. How many test techs do we have, why is the manufacturer not making these correctly, etc. Is most of engineering mostly logistical?

85,Are there any specific engineering careers that use math at the calculus level (or higher) on a frequent basis?,1408551953,"Before I considered engineering, I really wanted to major in mathematics or applied mathematics. Unfortunately, I was scared out of doing so by people in my life who convinced me that those majors were dead ends. Being a naïve high school graduate, I listened to them. I decided to major in mechanical engineering instead, which was considered a ""safer bet"" and still required a propensity for mathematics to get by. Frankly, I was just glad I was learning more math (even if it didn't extend past diffeq and linear algebra into real analysis territory).  

Almost every class I've taken as a mechanical engineering student has been interesting, but I was most invested in those classes that really tested my math skills. I always regarded this as a good sign - if my undergrad classes required so much math knowledge, then a job as a mechanical engineer must utilize math frequently to solve complex engineering problems, right? The prospect of using math on a frequent basis and getting paid for it really excited me. 

Then I participated in my school's co-op program. Through this program, I worked for an industrial gas company and an airline. For the industrial gas company, the most complicated math I had to do was create a spreadsheet that converted the dimensions of a distillation column structure from Imperial to metric units. For the airline, I did no math whatsoever - I created engineering documents that instructed hangar maintenance on how to repair &amp; modify parts of aircraft. That was certainly cool in its own right, but the lack of math really made this job a chore after a few weeks.  

I've asked a few of my friends, who are either meche students with internships under their belt or full-time meches, about just how much their work utilized math past basic algebra. Not one of them had to do any work that ventured closely into calculus territory. For me, that is a bit daunting. 

So now, I've realized a bit too late that most mechanical engineering careers focus more on real-world problem solving that does not require a lot of math. That's cool and all, but frankly, that's not what I want to do. I want to math so hard, from mathematical modeling to optimization to *anything*. I've been looking into applied mathematics graduate programs, but I really do not want to attend graduate school and bury myself in more student loans until I pay off some of my undergrad loans. Therefore, I'd really like to look into math-heavy career tracks that I can obtain with my MechE degree.

I spent there for 7 months and working 12 hrs for 6 days with a wage of $14/hr. I quit my job there to go to grad school in NY. During my grad school I got an internship as a Field Engineer for 2 months for a HVAC contractor. Two years later, got my Master degree in Mechanical Engineering and one month after graduation I got a job working for a small construction firm doing HVAC and piping design. I've been working for my current employer close to 9 months now. I feel I'm not doing any engineering related stuff and wasting my degree. I spent every single day on AutoCAD laying out piping design and recommending pipe sizing base on a chart and so on. 

 I'm very passionate about science and math and I focus my master on courses on solid mechanics!  My dream job is to go to the Aerospace industry working for Boeing or Pratt and Whitney or any aerospace company doing the latest technology. Given the current circumstances, I'm located in NY most these jobs are located either in the West coast or south of US. 

So I'm an ""engineer professional"" with 2 years (more or less) of experience in construction industry, but no experience at all in Aerospace industry. How bad it is for my prospective employer seeing my resume since I don't have any related experience? What to do to look out-of-state jobs? What else I can do? Thanks in advance for any suggestion or advise.

He lists the formula he uses but I wanted to attempt to adapt his math but the formula is something like Edeliv=½cDρADv² and Edrag=½cDρADv²

97,How do I get the most pressure out of this water pump?,1408465039,"http://imgur.com/a/mIvO2

I recently bought this water pump to use for watering plants. It said on the package that it pumps 3000 liter/hour, and I thought that would be enough for getting the water to move around my greenhouse. 

What I didn't think of was the design of the pump itself. I want the water to travel around a hose with the inner diameter of 13mm, and then spray out from small nozzles creating a mist. 

But the exhaust of the pump is 45mm wide, and when I tried to make an adapter that went from 45 to 13mm, it didn't have enough pressure to move the water up and around the hose. Even when I plugged the exhaust completely I could see that the water went out from the sides/intake of the pump, meaning that everything went in from one direction and out the other, and not through the exhaust.


My question to you guys are now: how can I make this pump use it's power to move water through a 13mm hose with the highest pressure possible? 

I hope you guys understand what I want, and feel free to ask any more questions about the pump if needed! Thank you!",AskEngineers,Helgess0n,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2dzsod/how_do_i_get_the_most_pressure_out_of_this_water/

3,How to stay busy at work?,1408457024,"I've been working as a Manufacturing Engineer for almost 3 months now. My company provides precision bar grinding services as well as supplying the materials for the customer should they choose to buy from us. We also do distribution work for certain grade metals since our mill suppliers do not want to deal with smaller orders. So far, my company as well as my co-workers are somewhat laid back and have generously given me the time I need to be acclimated since I just graduated in May.

The issue I'm finding is that while I'm learning the process a heck of a lot (even working on the machines myself 2-3 days a week), it's difficult for me to stay busy doing ""engineering"" work that I was used to in college. I get small jobs every now and then to keep an eye out for to follow the process and fix some issues, but that's not enough for me. I'm trying to think of some improvements that the process could use but I'm coming to a blank.

I envisioned landing some design/analysis engineering work but that didn't follow through and I took up this job because I desperately needed something right after graduation. The best I've done so far is design a casing for one of our machines to reduce air pollution/humidity by using a free CAD software for concept design and I'm in the middle of prototyping it. But I still feel like it's not adequate enough to be considered engineering-quality.

How do other Manufacturing/Process Engineers stay busy? Is your workflow large enough that requires constant monitoring and you're in production meetings quite a bit?

4,Statics of load-bearing structures,1408451499,"Hello,
    
so my mom and her boyfriend bought a house and are currently renovating it. I got asked to double check the statics of a load bearing double-T girder, but honestly my statics class was 3 or 4 years ago and I'm wondering if I oversaw something crucial.
    
Thing is though, it's not meant to be a full calculation o the entire statics of the house, just a quick check of whether or not it checks out. 
    
First off, I was using [this](http://i.imgur.com/KQSC5zy.jpg) sheet of a 100mm girder for further calculations and took some S235JR values off the internet.

&gt; Vertical 

So we want to put 2 girders in the wall to support the new one in the ceiling. I think this part is relatively easy with:

    F = Re * A = 235 N/mm^2 * 2600 mm² = 611 kN
    m = F/g = 62.3t

I don't think much went wrong here tbh.

&gt; Horizontal

So, here it got slightly more complicated as you can imagine due to the static line load on the girder. I took a value of

    σ(b static) = 330 N/mm^2

off another sheet and took the

    I(b y) = 1670000 mm^4

off the one I linked. Now, if my knowledge isn't terribly off the allowed momentum should be:

    M &lt; σ * W

with

    W = I / ((b + h) / 2) = 1670000 mm^4 / 100 mm ) = 16700 mm^3

leading to

    M &lt; 330 N/mm^2 * 16700 mm^3 = 5511000 Nmm = 5.511 kNm

since it's a continuous load I should be able to calculate it with

    M = q*l^2 / 8

so the maximum theoretical load on a girder of 4m length would be

     q = 8 * M / l^2 = 8 * 5.511 kNm / 16m^2 = 2.755 kN/m = 2.755 N/mm

---
I know that there are certain security margins etc, but that's something we can take care off later. Like I said my main concern is that I'm more the electronics &amp; aerodynamics type of guy and just took out my old formula book so I'm not too sure if it checks out. Right now it's most likely to use 2 120mm girders for the ceiling anyway, but it would be nice to know if the math for a single 100mm girder is correct.

6,Career change advice - finance to Mech/Aerospace?,1408424069,"Hi AskEngineers...

I'm finding myself at a bit of a crossroads recently that I'm hoping you guys can help me with. Long story short I'm looking to make the jump into engineering, am trying to decide if it's for me and would appreciate any insight. Long story long, though...

I kinda stumbled into my undergrad degree (Advanced Mathematics - I was good at maths at school and I had to study something, so why not), graduated with good results (First Class Honours - I'm Australian) and kinda fell into finance after I graduated, not really necessarily giving too much thought to it (which I'm sure is the same for a lot of naive, fresh faced grads). Fast forward six-and-a-half years and I'm sitting in the same job, earning pretty great money it must be said (north of $140k) but ultimately bored out of my tiny little mind, with the shrinking market I'm in and the tedium of the work bringing me down. I've done some soul-searching and have come to the realisation that in hindsight, Engineering would have been a pretty obvious choice of vocation for me. I'm passionate about science and enjoy maths, and I kinda get off on learning stuff and the way things work. Given this fact, I'm evaluating the wisdom of making the jump over. (I also have an interest in data and data science, as an aside - and I feel my skillset would be a good fit for this area - but am still in the learning stages here, and ultimately feel like my dream role in engineering would be more fulfilling than my dream role in data science for me, but that's a slight aside). 

At the end of the day, I'd love to go home satisfied that I've done something that has tangible output - that's contributed to the world in some way. The dream job would be to work for Boeing or NASA or Airbus on the cutting edge, developing cool shit and sending people into space and building planes and that sort of stuff, but clearly this may be slightly unrealistic. 

So I'm interested in probably Mechanical or Aerospace for the above reasons, and evaluating avenues to make this happen given my circumstances. I've done some introductory stuff on EdX/coursera etc. and am still interested after completing them, so feel like I'm on the right-ish track at least as far as interests are concerned. Australian universities have recently started to offer a Master of Professional Engineering, which is basically a three year Engineering qualification with a touch of business for gruaduates looking to change career. It has ""provisional"" certification from the Australian Engineering body (waiting until the first student cohort graduates to see how the grads turn out before giving it full certification I understand). I think this would be a reasonable avenue for me to go down should I decide to go for it, but I'm slightly concerned it'd be looked down upon compared to a standard engineering degree, especially if I need to expand my horizons and look overseas. Studying overseas is also an option should it be necessary, but I think it'd eat into my not immodest but not massive savings pretty quickly, so wouldn't be ideal.

**TLDR: 29-year-old Australian professional with 6 years of unrelated experience looking to leave cushy (but soul-destroying) job to take the leap into the unknown. What do? Thanks in advance for any suggestions or insights.**

7,Container for a resin bath,1408419601,"Hey all,

I am in the process of designing my own 3D printer. The big thing will be that I am planning to utilize UV cured resin and a 405 nm diode instead of plastics as is common in RepRap printers. At the moment, I'm aiming for an 8""x8""x8"" build volume. I would not expect to print something actually occupying that whole volume, but the 8"" extents are what I'm after.

I am looking at [a design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snOErpOP5Xk) where the print is 'pulled out' of the resin. This is a bit more complex than [an alternative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsqL4uRLdJ8), but it has distinct advantages in terms of resin and bath size required. I am thinking of something similar to the first video in terms of orientation of the build plate and laser.

The problem I am having is the basin to contain the resin. It needs to be passable to 405 nm light, and also resist marring of the glass. My initial thought was something like pyrex baking dishes, but the bottom of those probably aren't too flat, and may not have the greatest surface finish, which would cause refraction of the laser. You can see in the video that he seems to be using some sort of single-piece glass container, but I have had zero luck in locating something similar.

I have toyed with the idea of buying a piece of glass and making a container, but that will inevitably involve machining glass. This is a problem when I'm trying to design in a way that you don't need specialized tools to manufacture this - especially if the glass will likely mar over time. It also likely would not be liquid-tight, which is an issue as resin would drip through onto the moving parts below.

So, /r/AskEngineers - what would use use for such a bath? I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can point me in the direction of existing suppliers if they know of any, but if anyone has a proposal for an alternate design, I'm all ears to that as well.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2dy83g/container_for_a_resin_bath/

12,How Do You Answer Specific Questions About Existing Designs from Friends/Family?,1408390899,"Greetings all!

I'm currently finishing up my civil engineering bachelor's degree and starting my master's degree.  My friends &amp; family are very supportive and I love it.  But sometimes, they ask questions about why something was designed such a way and I really find it hard to answer.  Oddly, if I were to have designed whatever they're talking about, I'd have an answer for them, but because I don't know what design decisions were made when whatever was designed, I can't answer their questions.  I don't like looking like I don't understand the material.  And with so many people jumping on the ""colleges are a waste of money"" bandwagon, I also don't want to misrepresent my university as having taught me nothing.

So, how do you guys with more experience handle such questions?  I'll give some examples (most are usually transportation related):

* Why are these stop lights so long?
* Why haven't they done anything about all these crashes at such-and-such curve?
* Why did that house fall off the mountainside?  (We recently had a house built on a mountainside collapse.)

As I said, if I had designed the intersection, I could explain why the traffic signals are the way they are.  Maybe there's no induction loops.  Maybe there are pedestrian considerations that aren't obvious.  Maybe the traffic signal is part of a corridor and somewhere else a train interrupted the signal timing and it's resetting itself.  There are so many answers.

Similarly, if I had designed the curve or the house, I would have specific information on the issues at hand that would allow me to answer their questions.  But I feel so silly sometimes just always giving the answer of ""well, I didn't design it but here are some possible reasons why...""

It frustrating!  LOL.

Question: While the engine can apply a torque to the tires (there will be frictional loses in the components up to this of course) how do I go about estimating the peak torque without slipping? I've looked at rough data specs on michelin and other manufacturers websites and they all generally provide load/speed ratings, but I don't see anything about friction coefficients under certain conditions.

I'm aware that as downforce is applied to the tire (via aero/mass/etc) the grip of the tire will increase, but I'm looking to estimate what I can expect to handle in order to maximize acceleration.

Thanks.

My kitchen windows open using a lever: pull-down, they come down, push back up and they go back up. However, it has become quite stiff over the years, and due to a kitchen re-design my mum can no longer operate the lever by herself (it requires bending over a kitchen sink from a distance of around a metre away, with the window itself about 1.5m off the floor - and my mum is quite short.)

I'm thinking of automating this for her, fitting some sort of contraption that will open and close it for her by moving the lever - operated using a simple switch which dictates which window she wants opening and closing.

In terms of space, there is not much at all. I can provide photos if you want to take a closer look at the room available.

So, what would be the best way to go about operating the lever automatically? It would need to opened and closed maybe 2 - 3 times a day. Is there a particular design, or a contraption that already exists that I could fit, or would it require me having to build something?

72,Converting strain gage readings to (approximate) torque,1408109620,"I've got four strain gages mounted on a wrench in a full Wheatstone bridge configuration. The wrench is essentially an I-beam and I'm modeling it as a bending beam. The strain gages are wired up to an amplifier and an Arduino. Everything seems to be working correctly. The amplifier's gain is set to put the readings in a usable range and the displayed voltage increases logically as I apply force on the end of the wrench. The strain gages and amplifier are being run off of a +5 V source.


However, I'm having difficulty getting the math to work out. 
Here's the progression of equations I'm using:


I'm getting a voltage, V1, out of the amplifier, so let's start there. This voltage is the difference between the two strain gage outputs, multiplied by the gain of the amplifier.


V2 = V1/gain (converting to the actual voltage difference)


strain = V2/GF (GF is a constant of 2.14 as designated by the manufacturer)


stress = strain * E (E for cast iron wrench is approx. 24.5E6 psi, which I'm converting to psf)


M1 = stress * Z (Sectional modulus, Z, is approximately 0.51 in^3, which I'm converting to ft^3)


F = M / L1 (converting moment on strain gages to vertical force on end of wrench, L1 and L2 are in feet)


M2 = F * L2 (converting force to moment on object gripped by wrench, this is the applied torque)


The problem with this progression is that my outputted torque is huge and increases quickly as that original voltage increases. Based off of my estimates, it seems like that initial strain is way higher than it needs to be. If there's a small 0.003 voltage difference between the strain gage outputs that's equivalent to ~1400 microstrain. That can't be right.

I have always tended to be unnecessarily (well, necessary for me) detailed in my approach to understanding the world (I am diagnosed with OCD and ADD-PI).  When I was in high school (2004-08) I would often end up wasting time trying to decipher trivial parts of the drawn-out explanations used by textbooks in their effort to make the book seem more ""friendly"" (plus I'm a slow reader, which made things worse).

Frequently, a lengthy explanation could have been boiled down to just a few clear points.  **I found it easiest to comprehend when they clearly defined a purpose, what was trying to be accomplished, how a particular concept worked** and of course some examples...not sure if that makes any sense to anyone.  I feel like a lot of textbooks lead me on pointless tangents without clearly defining upfront what's expected and what parameters are truly necessary to understand when solving a problem.  Most people seem to be better at recognizing this while learning, so they avoid placing too much importance on unimportant details.  In short, what textbook authors often assume will be intuitive for the average person, I typically find unintuitive; this goes for most things, not simply learning math.

I have someone I can consult on a daily basis for clarification/questions, but I think I would mostly be learning on my own, it seems to work better that way when learning new things in my case because I interpret things in a slightly odd way and form my own initial relationships between concepts based on observation.  If I get stuck when learning something, I usually look it up online and then if I'm really desperate, ask a human...does this make sense to anyone?

However, this year they changed the position a bit and now I'm expected to go out into the field, which honestly isn't in my interests. If I had known, I feel like I would've considered other options before accepting the job because I'm not interested in working on a rig. Also, my masters doesn't count for anything in this company either. 

Even though I'm still going through training and certifications, should I start applying for jobs in refining?  Also if I do, should I even mention my involvement with my current company? My internships weren't oil related and this is the only oil experience I have except for some classes. However, I'm worried how poorly it looks for a new grad trying to leave a company after a month.

1,At what point does a cell-tower reach saturation and service loss?,1407982406,"Forgive me if this is awkwardly phrased.

Have you ever gone to a concert or a festival or any even where there is a large concentration of people in a small space, only to find that there is no cell phone reception?

Does anyone know roughly how many devices a cellphone tower usually can handle? I know a bit of Cisco and they recommend you not exceed 500 clients on a given network. (It's at this point you'll start to see service degradation due to all the constant network broadcasts)

5,Issues with putting windows into concrete foundation wall,1407960670,"First of all, I'm asking this out of academic interest since A) My business partner and I disagree and B) our structural engineer is on vacation for another 3 weeks and can't provide an answer.  
  
My business partner and I own a multi-family residential apartment building.  It is wood-frame, 3 story walkup plus basement built in 1965.  The footprint is roughly 40' x 80'.  
The three story wood frame sits on a suspended slab over a full height basement with full concrete foundation walls.  The basement consists of mechanical rooms, laundry rooms and half of it is a underground garage.  The ceiling height in the basement is 8'6"" with a concrete slab floor.  
  
We want to add a basement suite which would require putting several windows into one of the concrete perimeter foundation walls (the short, 40' wall).  
My business partner is of the opinion that this is relatively easy, simply a matter of cutting the openings and re-enforcing the frame with a steel sill, posts and header to carry the load.  
  
I am of the opinion that this is not feasible, as the foundation wall carries the weight of the suspended slab and the three floors above it, so ""cutting"" several 2'x3' openings will potentially seriously compromise the integrity and can't be permanently shored up with some engineered steel window frames.  
  
What does r/engineers say?  Is this a ""simple"" process of cutting some openings, slamming in an engineered steel frame to take the load of the missing concrete square?  
  
Or, is this a nightmare of a job that will require shoring the entire foundation wall, excavating it, removing it and essentially re-pouring it with window openings formed into it?  
  
Just to re-iterate, I'm only asking this because I won't be able to get a real life opinion for three weeks and we are going nuts arguing about it.

Cold bending isn't allowed with 5 feet of a ""joint"" on a main, but there is no spec in the standards manual regarding services.

12,High output (4-6 MW) short duration (&lt;30 second) UPS solution?,1407931067,"I work at a factory. We have a continuous flow process. All of the equipment involved will reset of there's a loss of power for more than 20 cycles or so, causing loss of process control. This means all material inside the process has to be disposed of, at a cost of around $15,000. Last weekend, we had an 84 cycle interruption in service - inconsequential to a home user - reset all our equipment. 

It got me thinking what sort of solutions there may be for very high output short term UPS solutions. I said 30 seconds in the title, but honestly even 5 seconds would cover over 60% of our outages. We'd need something with very quick switching, or even constantly online, however - a protracted switchover is just as good as useless for us. We don't have any generation capability, or plans / room to add said capability, so riding out an extended outage isn't really the goal.

I'm vaguely familiar with flywheel UPS solutions, and think that's probably the only feasible option. One option would simply be to protect the whole plant, in which case we'd need around 6 MW of output - However depending on system cost it may make more sense to re-wire and only cover production equipment, excluding HVAC and other systems which can brown out for a few seconds. This might take demand down as low as 3 MW. 

I was curious if anyone had any experience these systems, and had any insight on technology / implementation / vendors / rough costs (it'd need to pay for itself in &lt; 3 years to get approved). 

Note: I am a production manager with an engineering background / degree, but am not a part of the engineering team or capital projects - I just deal with a multi hour interruption in operations over a second of power loss, and am trying to think of a permanent fix. Thanks!

I forgot to mention earlier that I was looking for a rectangular container.

Furthermore, I was fearful of the glue that is used to hold the seams -- I considered going over them with epoxy glue, but I don't know how much I trust myself. I have considered ceramic (planters), but containers I have seen happen to be as expensive as the polymer ones on the market-- so that was also abandoned.  I was also recommended PVC, but maybe I didn't search hard enough but that I couldn't readily find. 

I was looking at HDPE and PP tanks from reputable companies, but I had decided that they were a bit expensive and ended up ordering a standard grade PP storage container (that was made for solids).  I do not have much faith in it holding to my requirements. So I am still searching for alternatives. 

Edit:  Will be heating up water- more specifically salt water (at the solubility limit, ~36%) , was going to have a set up with a 1500 W immersion heater and a temperature controller, with the immersion heater being made to hang such that it was centered in the container.

55,How can I condense a lot of steam quickly?,1407716592,"I'm in the feasibility planning stages on a solar-collecting water distillery. I have this idea in my head that I can just boil seawater in a trough solar collector and condense the steam to create distilled water. I'm not particularly concerned with efficiency, mostly just simplicity, cost, and safety.

I've been searching around online for stuff like this but it doesn't sound like anybody has done it for distillation purposes. They mostly go for power generation or water heating, and everyone is quick to point out how quickly a hobbyist like me with only entry level mechanical engineering background will get maimed and burned by exploding equipment and steam. My only defense is that the steam I want to generate doesn't need to be of high temperature. In fact, the cooler the better, hopefully no hotter than 120 C.

I just need a way to remove the energy of the steam at least as fast as it's being added by the solar collector. I know I'll need a condenser, but would a steam engine or turbine sink some of that energy too? Would a turbine even run with low-temperature steam?

Now, this would be simple enough to do with an Arduino and a servo but I'm looking at mechanical means. My idea is to take a standard pendulum clock and swapping the normal pendulum for a double pendulum, the veritable poster child of a chaotic system. The clock would have to fulfill two criteria: (1) It has to keep time reasonably well in the long run (2) It has to have a variable period.

82,Interview of an Electrical Engineer for a project,1407512301,"I am a second year in electrical engineering. In one of my courses I must write a proposal concerning a good idea that I think should be implemented or at the very least considered. I have decided my topic to be the integration of solar panels into Montreal's bike path network, mainly replacing the asphalt with the panels.

The panels themselves are:
-modular, (decreases time of maintenance)
-the cells are protected by a textured tempered clear glass material
-each panel would produce 52 watts
-each panel has heating elements in the glass (powered by the grid), which only turns on when there is a chance of snow or ice
-the panels are 12 by 12 feet

If someone would be willing to answer all or some of these questions it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance :)

So a few caveats, this is going to be built with a super low factor of safety and not to any code anywhere and as cheaply as possible with an emphasis on modularity. 

Here's what I'm thinking, take a traditional wrought iron type spiral staircase, and build a base for the pole to sit in that would grab the bottom 6-10"" of the pole and would be about 2' wider in diameter than the outside dimensions of the stairs themselves.

This base then becomes weighted by about 200 lbs of dumbbells.  Combine this with the fact that the top stair is secured into the side of the second story and I think it should hold a 180 lb person walking up it normally (not running) just fine.

I did terrible in HS, graduated a year late with a 1.0 gpa. I'm not an idiot, I went to between 17 and 23 schools leading up to the 9th grade. But I stayed in school and made sure I graduated. I even went to an alternative school, turned 18 and enrolled myself back into the public HS so I can graduate with a non-alternative HS degree. I barely made it but I finished and walked. 

A couple years ago I enrolled myself in community college. College was always my dream but had no way to pay for it (poverty). Anywho, the placement test put me in BASIC MATH, BASIC!!!, thats adding, subtracting, long division and fractions! I'm going into intermediate algebra this quarter which is 3 classes up on the quarter system. Next class is intro to CALC. 

So there is the premise of my question, I am worried that its too late, did any of you start from an educational pitfall? I quickly and easily understand Mechanics and systems but the math worries me. Not that I don't understand it as it comes. I worry that the math involved in being a mechanical engineer is equivalent to a famous musician being able to play their instrument. They start young, put in countless hours and many years building themselves up to a point of seeing a music career being a viable option. 

Is math something that I'm too late on. Do I need to engorge myself fully into math until its so natural I can pull all formulas from memory or can I move up the math ranks, relying solely on the act of learning and doing the work to carry me through all the rest of college successfully. I just want some perspective on how to treat the upcoming school years so I can structure my life and future plans accordingly.

In summary, If you start college with basic math skills, how should I treat math. Should I drink it for breakfast, eat it for brunch, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner and midnight mayhem? Should my life become all about math. Being able to think mathematically in all aspects of my life, just short of the skills wielded by a mathematician? How much catching up do I need to do?

10,Why hasent the job of crane operator been automated yet?,1407374101,"Hello all, especially robotics and automation people. 

I heard awhile back that port crane operators make pretty good money (70-100k+) and it got me interested. I keep watching documentaries on shipping container ships, 18 wheelers etc and they always talk about the time constraints on the crane operators. Even with the the really big ships they dont seem to be able to use more than 8 or so cranes meaning unloading takes a good 20 hours or so. It just seems like the kind of thing that inevitably will go wrong and when it does would soak up hours of everyone's time involved and perhaps more importantly the equipment involved (ports, ships, other trucks that move containers etc)

It just seems like the kind of job automation could only help. Is anyone familair with the problem and whats stopping it being automated? My only guess is that with the variable weights to shipping containers and possible shifting of weight it could throw off a pre-set algorithm. I'm pretty sure sensors and modern computers could more than tackle the problem though. Maybe im wrong?

I mean those container ships are huge and enormously expensive, im sure when a crane operator messes up and drops a container on a truck wrong and it causes delays the costs escalate in a hurry.

For that matter with megastructures like the Yangshan deep-water port why let trucks driven by humans ferry goods away from the unloading area and over the donghigh bridge? Why not have some kind of conveyor belt or automated rail system that automatically shuffles containers the 20~ miles to land? Or at any major port such a system would help cut down on time involved greatly I'm sure. I'm sure you mech engineers could work that out, even with the weight of shipping containers involved. My best guess is that humans are ""good enough"" and the time/money savings by automating it havent made sense yet. I still feel like it would be a desirable thing though just to avoid potential delays in the load/unload process.

---

According to literature it says 1L of liquid oxygen supplies 860L of gaseous oxygen, so that was the conversion I used. Side question: how was this number determined? The density of liquid and gas oxygen, respectively, is 1141 kg/m^3 and 1.429 kg/m^3. The quotient of these densities is approximately 800 (not 860, so I'm confused).

21,Am I screwed for my security clearance? Help.,1407300471,"Hi engineers, so I feel like I'm in a sticky situation with getting my secret security clearance. Section 27 of the SF86 states that I have to mention any incident in regards to unauthorized access to an IT system in the past seven years. Unfortunately, I was involved in hacking into my HS computer network during my senior year. I was never charged with anything but the issue was brought up to the police and an agreement was made with my HS. There was a form I had to sign, and I'm guessing its in some record somewhere.

I'm entering a position which requires an interim clearance. I'm worried that explaining the hacking will cause my interim clearance not to go through. The result would be I wouldn't get the position. On the other hand, I'm worried that if it did go through I would eventually fail to get the full clearance if they dig up the hacking thing. Although at least I could appeal.

What should I do? I really feel like I'm screwed in either case.

We've checked with the mods, and they've okayed us to post here. If you're skeptical, please ask questions or feel free to pass us up.

My wife and I, both chemical engineers-in-training quite fresh out of university, (2013 and 2011 respectively) have come up with an idea for a business to help junior engineers (eventually aiming to be a resource for more engineers and possibly branching to other career types) keep their skills up through use of industry standard programs (HYSYS, ValSpeq, and the like). These programs are not available for personal use, normally, and most people haven't got a personal use for them, so we spend some time at work re-learning these programs if we've seen them before, or we spend time learning them altogether.

The reason that we're posting to /r/AskEngineers today is that we're currently running a feasibility study on all the P.Eng. and EITs that we know, and with more information we have a higher chance of being considered by the owners of different engineering software. (The idea is ""We've had x responses from X engineering specialty and your program was mentioned yy% of the time. We'd like to help improve adoption by providing tutorials and access to junior engineers entering the job force"")

As stated above, we'd like your help in filling out this survey (we're not collecting emails or anything else unless you want to add it in the comments/suggestions area of the survey). We also don't have any type of monetization in place on the site, and we don't plan on ever running ads.

The link to our website is http://www.eruditeo.com/ and the links to the surveys are

1. www.eruditeo.com/survey for professional engineers
2. www.eruditeo.com/eit-survey for engineers in training

We do also have facebook and twitter, but we haven't really used those yet. If you'd like to follow us on either of those, feel free to search but we're not going to throw extra links in here. (There are links on the website to our facebook and twitter though)

We'll be here to answer any questions or feedback that you may have in the comments of this thread or the comments of your survey response.

We'd also like to sincerely thank anyone who's taken the time to read this, and we hope that with the help of our engineering community we can really start to help junior engineers get their first/second/n^th position at a faster rate than is average now.

Please feel free to spread this to any other engineers or engineers-in-training who you think would be receptive to this, we're really aiming to gather as much data as we can in order to move forward with our idea.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2cql1g/feasibility_study_for_entry_level_skill_website/

31,Designs for extracting exhaust from a chimney to use in a heat exchanger that won't result in any pressure build up in the chimney at all?,1407247546,"I think the title explains it decently. I'm not asking for ideas from scratch don't worry, I'll give you a few of our ideas in a second. Ideas without experience are always tricky though, so hopefully someone here can give some feedback and criticism, or suggest something that has evaded our imagination. 

Basically we have a chimney that is exhausting a lot of hot air to the atmosphere. We are going to use this hot air in a heat exchanger so all the energy doesn't go completely to waste. It is a decently sized chimney, 18.2 meters tall. Preventing *any* pressure build up in the chimney is more important than the efficiency of the system. So, either the system needs to be open to the outside for any extra air to release to the atmosphere, or some part of the design must account for the possibility of excess. 

We have two main ideas right now. One, which I kind of like, is to have a smaller diameter cylinder lowered some distance into the top of the chimney. The second cylinder would have a fan to move the air, and the clearance between the two cylinders would allow any excess to release to the atmosphere as before. The second idea is to have the second cylinder above the first, with either enough space in between to allow the excess air to go to the atmosphere or a little overhang to collect all the air and the rest could shoot out. A third would be to have a few holes in the second pipe that could be controllable to open and close them to regulate the pressure, however there would have to be some type of pressure sensor to know when to open or close them, which could be a little complicated. 

This design is not very intense or critical. We just want to utilize any heat possible, but efficiency is not as important as it just working at all. Efficiency can always be improved after we've had it running at our plant for a little bit and have been able to observe the behavior. If anyone has any criticisms, suggestions, examples, or anything else it would be appreciated.

I want to design a submerged check valve that is placed on an outlet on the bottom of a tank. The check valve would consist on a hinged, floating, perforated plate. This plate, being perforated, would allow water to pass through it, but would keep larger objects in the tank. The plate would remain shut in place by its own buoyancy (a lip would prevent it from floating all the way beyond the horizontal position). 

With the increase of head, suction at the outlet would increase at the point that it beats the plate's buoyancy, dragging it downwards into the outlet and therefore opening the outlet so larger objects can pass. Restoring the initial head would make the valve float back into shut position. 

I need to understand what forces are in play and what equations should I use to design these devices to fit tanks of different dimensions and different tank flow regimes...

34,Suspending a hoop from two poles: weight of pole bases?,1407211548,"I am constructing a sculpture/interactive art piece that involves suspending a hoop from two poles. 

After a series of design/build-type decisions (i.e. were not exactly ""planned"") the components involve: 

1. Hoop: three sections of 1/8"" x 1/2"" bent steel, encased by a ~15' length of vinyl 5/8"" clear tubing. The diameter of the circle is roughly 56"". By my calculations, it weighs a little under 4lbs. (I don't have a scale).
2. Poles: 36"" tall curtain rods inserted into 7"" cubes, made of 3/4"" plywood. 

My intent was to suspend the hoop at four points (the 45° angles on either side) and fill the hollow boxes with concrete. Now that I am at that step, I am afraid it won't be enough weight to hold the hoop, or, rather, prevent the poles from tipping over. 

Will this be enough? People are supposed to jump through the hoop, so it needs to be able to sustain some jostling.


**TLDR: I want to know if pouring concrete into two 7"" cubes, 9' apart, will be enough weight to suspend 5 lbs.  If yes, by how much? If no, how much weight do I need to add?**

Anyways, as the post suggests I am fresh out of college and I am having some concerns about my first job. When I was hired on, I was shown a rather large list of all the projects that were currently being worked on. I was told there would be a lot of work and that I would be exposed to a lot of variety within my field. Two months in and there has been a lot of down time. Of the projects that have been coming in, I have basically become the CAD tech; in that, I am really only putting together sheets and filing papers. I understand that this is part of the learning process and I have no problem doing this work in order to see the entire scope of a project. That said, I was led to believe I would be doing actual design as well.

To be a little me specific, I was hired to work in a newly established office and after being told of their desired office structure I found upon my first day that the office is currently staffing one extra EIT. I also found that I am the one with the least amount of experience. My fellow EIT's are getting more work than me because they are more 'experienced.' I attempt to request work and I am regularly given busy work as a result.

This company has mentioned to us in meetings about financial loss and for the past three weeks there have not been any new projects coming in. All of this said, the company I work for is a mid sized, very conservative company that has often told us towards the beginning that patience is important.

I feel like I should still be concerned for my job and that I should consider keeping my eyes open. That said, this company has offered me a good salary, benefits and the like. I want to be ethical but I also want to enjoy going to work everyday and not be fearful of my job.

36,Wiring up an old fire alarm switch as part of a light,1407207958,"This seemed like the best place I could find to post.  Basically, I have this box that has a non latching push button switch (normally depressed all the time by the face plate), and 2 contacts you can screw wires into.  The (cut) wires that came screwed into it were 14 gauge.  What I wanted to do was wire this switch with a wall plug on one end, and a light socket on the other, so that when I threw the front of the switch down, it would release the button and complete the circuit, turning the light on.  

I'm in North America, so my electricity is 110 V.  I plan to use a 40 watt bulb, so I calculated that it would draw 0.36 A.  

On the switch, it has these three lines listed:

* 25A - 250 V
* 75A - 125 VT
* 1A - 125 V.A.C.

So I thought, great, I can use this with power coming straight out of the wall because it's less than 1 Amp and 125V AC (first mistake?).  I took a lamp cord, screwed each of the wires onto the contacts, and screwed the two copper wires coming off the contacts into a lamp socket.  I put a bulb in, and plugged it into my surge protector.

Picture of the setup:
http://i.imgur.com/ztYSfx7.jpg

At first, the bulb wasn't on.  I turned the lamp socket switch forward a notch and the bulb came on.  This surprised me, because I figured the fire alarm switch would be a ""normally closed"" switch, i.e. it would only complete the circuit and set off the alarm system when you pull the face plate down and the button comes back out.  Since the face plate was depressing the button, I didn't expect the circuit to be able to be completed. After that, I picked it up to take the pressure off the button, then it blew a fuse.

What happened?

* I missed something blatantly obvious that I need to add to the circuit to make it less dangerous and terrible
* My switch is faulty
* I wired something incorrectly
* It's because I didn't put the insulating sheath back on the socket
* Something else

40,Are there any examples of air-breathing supersonic aircraft where the plane can be driven faster than the exhaust velocity?,1407182996,"A debate flared up among friends recently where it was argued that there are some aircraft that fly faster than the speed of their exhaust. By that I mean, specifically, the exhaust velocity is lower than the free stream velocity.

Intuitively, it doesn't seem like it's possible. Indeed if you delve into the generalized thrust equation, it is not possible. Thrust is equal to the mass flow rate at the exhaust times the velocity of the exhaust stream minus the mass flow rate at the inlet in times the velocity of the inlet stream.

F = mdote * Ve - mdotV0 * V0

From what I've read, jets operate lean with dry thrust A/F ratios of about 50:1 and ""wet"" thrust (afterburner) A/F ratios of perhaps 20:1. That means that the thrust equation can be further approximated to;

F = mdot(Ve - V0)

Using that equation, it's clear that it's impossible to develop any thrust if your exhaust velocity is not greater than the velocity of the air stream right before it enters the intake. However, the above equations are only true if the pressure at the exhaust nozzle is ~ambient. If the pressure is significantly above ambient, another term must be added to the thrust equation. The absolute pressure at the exit of the exhaust less the ambient pressure times the area of the exhaust nozzle exit:

F = mdote * Ve - mdotV0 * V0 + (pe - p0)Ae

So, using this modified thrust equation, it certainly seems possible for net positive thrust to be developed even if the exhaust velocity is lower than the free stream velocity given a very large pressure difference. It should be noted that this condition can only develop in a so called choked flow nozzle.

My question is, are there any examples of jets that operate in this regime? Further, is it possible for jets to develop thrust in this way but they don't because it's optimal to size the nozzle to equalize the exhaust pressure or it is detrimental to operate with nozzle choke. As I understand it, rockets develop a significant amount of thrust this way but only because it is not feasible for their nozzles to be appropriately sized because of drag, control and CG constraints.

You can find my reference for thrust equation here:

I have an application where I need to measure DC current. The current can range from single digit micro amps when idle and can peak at several hundred milliamps when active. Im looking for equipment that will give me current plots of the system transitioning between idle and active at sub millisecond sampling rates and capture accurate current readings (error within 1 micro amp or so when idle). Wake ups can be well under a millisecond so a fast sampling rate is important.  The idea is to use it in automation so ideally I'd like to be able to read the data onto a PC over USB. What's the right kind of equipment to use in this case? I've experimented with some DMMs but have been unable to get the right blend of speed and accuracy - either the error margin is high when the system is idle or the readings are accurate but the sampling rate is slow and wakeups get missed. Are there DMMs I could pick up that would get the job done? Is it better to go to an oscilloscope with current probes ?

56,Low frequency sound from small driver - carry over long distance?,1407128459,"From what I've gathered as a bit of a diy electronic hobbyist with an interest in sound, the smaller the size of an acoustic radiator (like a speaker diaphragm) in relation to the wavelength of the sound it produces (in the low frequency ranges) the shorter the distance that sound will travel. This is why the deep bass from a pair of headphones is only audible when they are placed directly on the ears, while the more directional high frequency sound is audible from far away.

My question is, are there any ways to overcome this to a degree, in order to make a compact speaker that can produce the bass of music and have it audible from a couple of metres away? I assume not, otherwise there would be such products already in portable battery operated speakers, and boomboxes. Still, I have to ask, since sciences continually advance.

0,Rising HS Senior who needs to figure out college finances,1406854533,"Well I'm a rising HS senior who will be majoring in EE/CS (or CmpE) at either UMCP (my state college) or UIUC (way more expensive but higher ranked reach school). I know this sounds naive, but I think my PG education will probably consist of a MS in EECS and a MBA. Anyways, I have a couple of questions aimed at engineers.

1. ~~Do employers care about school rank? UMCP is known well in the DC area, which is pretty much a second tier silicon valley. UIUC is ranked 5th in the nation, but it's located in freaking Illinois, so I'd probably be relocating to Cali or DC anyways. Would a DC area employer give preference to either college? I'm wondering if UIUC is worth the extra costs compared to in-state UMCP tuition. Location of jobs is swaying me towards UMD, but idk.~~ [The cheaper school]

2. Most colleges have a BS/MS program, but should I have FULLTIME work exp. before grad school, for the MS EECS? Would it create a problem when applying for jobs if I have an advanced degree but only summer internship work experience?

3. ~~Does any non-academia employer care about a MS w/ thesis vs MS w/o a thesis?~~ Nope

4. Do employers care about relevant minors, or should I only minor in something for personal enrichment since employers would just skip that line on the resume? Basically could a minor improve marketability?

5. UMD has a rigorous ECE honors program where you have to take several honors versions of already hard EE classes and have to conduct undergrad research. The honors program varies college to college and even major to major, so would an employer or a grad school care about a guy having an honors citation? It's a lot of extra research and work down the drain if no one really cares. 

6. Like I said UMD has a BS/MS program which would save me time + money, but does my Master's program's prestige matter? What are reasons for going to a prestigious graduate school?
  
Sorry for all the questions, but I really need figure out how much I'll need for my education and at least a basic idea of what path to take.

Hello guys,
Before I inquire about my project, I would like to know I'm in the right sub. If I'm not, please feel free to redirect me to one that would be more appropriate.
  

A while back, I got into blowguns. I created a 3.5' long shaft of 3/4"" PVC pipe, and I fashioned small darts out of nails and paper... It worked quite well, and I had lots of fun with it.
Now, I'm looking for more power. I'm looking to create a semi-automatic, hand powered air gun that will act like my blowgun. I was thinking of hooking up a bicycle pump to an air reservoir. From there I would fit it to some kind of valve (would a butterfly valve work?) and on the other end, a length of 3/4"" PVC.
  

I would pump up the Air Reservoir with sufficient air, release the valve, and hopefully watch as my dart travels with lots of force and accuracy.
  

My questions are:
*How much would the budget be for this type of project? Including the pump, valve, PVC, fittings, etc. *Will it work? This is just a concept right now, I don't even know if it's possible. *What parts will I need? I already have the 3/4"" PVC pipe, but what kind of valves/PVC fittings will I need?

In a nutshell, I am trying to design an 8' screw conveyor about 3"" in diameter with an inconel shaft as a drive for the motor turning the screw.

Right now my approach is to mold 5"" cylindrical modules of castable ceramic with ~5% quartz fiber added. Once the ceramic is set, I am machining it to the screw shape with driving teeth at each end to connect the modules so they all spin in unison. The ceramic I am using is pretty strong and wont chip, which is what I need---the fiber definitely helps.

12,Linear Sliding Mechanism for an expandable cabinet.,1406824481,"Hello,

I am designing a cabinet with metal frames. Its function will be to house control panels. The weight can range from 600 to 1200 pounds.

Expandability - The cabinet should be expandable. For now I am shooting for only one wall to be expandable. (i.e. if we want right wall to be expanded 1 foot to the right, 4 out of 12 bars of frame should have a sliding mechanism. Yes, the sliding extension will have its own leg to take the distributed load. 

Material  - First I was thinking of making the frame out of square tubings but my colleague suggested we should go for the c channel shaped sheet metal. Apparently 10, 12 or even 14 GA Sheets can be really strong. But I have not done the math yet. 

Mechanism - Right now the design is such that we will have 2 sheet metal c channels. One a little smaller than the other.the smaller one will slide into the bigger one. appropriate holes will be provided to secure the extension with nuts and bolts.

Frequency of use of the mechanism - This sliding mechanism will only be used once or twice for future expansions. So it repeatability is not a factor here. 

Strength of the mechanism - For all the life of the cabinet the load will be on the connection bolts (joining the 2 channels) and on the sliding mechanism. So the mechanism should be as tough as possible.

So can anybody suggest any sliding mechanism with above mentioned properties which is available is market or can  be manufactured in our shop.

When I worked with engineers before many of them were great engineers but they would only solve the problems they were given (solicited) to do. A couple of times people were creative and thought of something brand new and asked if the client would be interested in pursuing the new concept design and run with it but this was not often. Those people as well generally did not invent off the clock. I am looking to find out how many people invent of their own volition that are engineers? I am looking for both yeses and nos. A statistic is what I am interested in finding.

Also by inventing I do not mean that you have to be able to sell it. That would not be inventing, that would be selling a product.

I also do not mean that you have to have a patent on it. That would just mean you have IP protection for your invention.

I also do not mean that is has to have never been invented before, it just means that you invented it before you knew of anyone else inventing such an item. Calculus is claimed to have been invented by Newton however it was invented before that in other parts of the world but had not spread. It was just something invented by multiple people because that is just how logic and our minds fit things together.

---

To those that think you have to have a company or team to invent things... no. No you do not. Many people invent at home and thus we have many awesome new things coming from those things. I have invented often throughout life. It isn't as hard as people claim it to be without a team. Even complex things. It just requires knowing how things work.

To those that think it costs a ton of money to invent things... that is just wrong. It costs however much it costs to build that thing. Hardware stores are great places to get parts. Amazon.com is as well. An invention is only as expensive and complicated as you make it out to be in relation to how complex and expensive it has to be at its minimum. Many things can be built for low cost. Many things are expensive. It is much like asking how much does a house cost. Or how much does a car cost. It all depends.

A perfect answer would have the power settings (volts/amps) and the amount of time (to heat up).

I am a recent college grad with a degree in electrical engineering. I landed a job straight out of college without breaking a sweat. I currently work for a power design firm in Chicago where I sit in an office all day and perform calculations. I am constantly bored.

During school, I spent two summers interning in a power coop. My favorite time spent there was when I would go out with the lineman on an emergency and get to watch them work. The time seemed to fly by whenever I was out in the field.

During this internship, I spent a couple months in the field surveying. Despite being a fair skinned kid walking corn fields in 100 degree heat, I really enjoyed it.

This is why I am considering making the switch to a lineman. Have any of you heard of someone doing this before? Does a degree in electrical engineering at all help my possible lineman career?

I hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting here - it's my first time.

I'm currently on a Co-Op semester that is one month away from ending. I'm working with a power electronics company about half an hour away from home. Through a fervent recommendation from my boss, I am being offered a second semester here directly after this one, despite it costing the company more.

I also have an offer from a research laboratory at my school working on rehabilitation robotics for stroke survivors.

In terms of my ideal future career, I'd personally be OK with either research or product development.

I graduated in biomedical engineering in 2012 and focused in biomechanics and product design.

I've worked with a large number of areas like programming, electrical work, manufacturing, etc. 

My first job out of school is a mix of engineering and marketing. I work with a large company that creates 3D modeling software and basically help to get their software out to schools.

45,What's going on with this motherboard's cooling?,1406688273,"Hello friends. I had the idea to install the motherboard of my old laptop inside of a different enclosure, so that it would fit in a certain space better. Nothing complex, just mounted the motherboard on some standoffs inside of a wood enclosure, and made sure to make the appropriate holes where needed so that I could access ports, and allow air circulation.

**The Problem**: This enclosure and the motherboard had been mounted vertically - so not exactly by design of the laptop's manufacturer. I did not think this would be an issue, as I have seen people mount laptops vertically behind monitors and in other situations.

After using the laptop for about 15-30 minutes, it would unexpectedly shut down. I later determined that this was a thermal shutdown. The laptop would, on moderate load, idle around 85degC and get up to about 95degC before it shut down.

I tried a number of tests to see what would be causing this, including leaving the enclosure wide open to the air, thinking this should provide plenty of cool air. The problem persisted.

I removed the motherboard from the enclosure, placed it horizontally on my work bench to investigate further. 

**Findings**:
I found that the laptop, while oriented horizontally (natural), would show normal temps, and idle around 60degC. No thermal shutdown, even if maintaining 100% CPU time for several minutes.

Immediately after re-orienting the laptop vertically, in open air, the temps glided up to 85degC while idle. With normal use, the temp would reach 95degC at times, and eventually shutdown once reaching the magic temp.

**So my question is**:
I'm not *really* looking for a solution yet, that is for me to figure out as my next challenge. I would simply like to know what is happening here, in terms of thermodynamics and common computer cooling. 

My guess is that there is some type of liquid in the copper heat pipe that is not able to do its job while oriented vertically?

The remaining oil/water(and some gas) mixture is then sent down to a low pressure separator to separate all three (rate at 80 psi).  The oil and water go to tanks and the gas is sent down a low pressure line.

So, I asked today what would happen if the high pressure gas made it over to the lower pressure separator.  I know we have pop-offs and other safety features that protect our equipment.  I was told that nothing spectacular would happen, the high pressure gas would just fly through our low pressure facility and head on down the line.

I've come across this claim in Michael Ashby's *Materials Selection in Mechanical Design* (4th edition):

&gt; The elastic energy stored per unit volume in a block of material stressed uniformly to a stress of [;\sigma;] is

&gt; [;W_v = {\frac 1 2} {\frac {\sigma\^2} E;]

&gt; where E is Young's modulus. We wish to maximize [;W_v;]. The spring will be damaged if the stress [;\sigma;] exceeds the yield stress or failure stress [;\sigma_f;], the constraint is [; \sigma &lt; \sigma_f;]. Thus the maximum energy density is 

&gt; [;W_v = {\frac 1 2} {\frac {\sigma_f\^2} E};]

&gt; Torsion bars and leaf springs are less efficient than axial springs because much of the material is not fully loaded: the material at the neutral axis, for instance, is not loaded at all. For leaf springs

&gt; [;W_v = {\frac 1 4} {\frac {\sigma_f\^2} E};]

&gt; and for torsion bars

&gt; [;W_v = {\frac 1 3} {\frac {\sigma_f\^2} E};]

I guess I don't understand this. It seems to me that an axial compression or extension spring is effectively like a twisted type of torsion bar -- extending or compression it still involves exerting torsional forces on a cylinder-shaped piece of metal, and it would still have an (unloaded) neutral axis. Correspondingly, an axial torsion spring is like a twisted type of leaf spring, still being subject to bending forces, and still having a neutral axis (although possibly even worse than a leaf spring, because most axial torsion springs have coils with a cylindrical cross section, rather than a rectangular one, so material is actually concentrated toward the neutral axis).

You have access to 17th century technology.
You have access to magically treated fabrics that are comparable in strength to nylon but are fire retardant.
The atmosphere of the planet is thicker so air pressure at flying altitudes is normal (no-one lives on planet surface).
You have access to magically treated versions of metal ores that weigh less than air. We'll say 1 cubic foot of a magically treated metal ore provides about 250 lbs of lift.

Brainstorming a bit I thought a ship would need to use a combination of the treated ore and a gas-containing envelope. The ore would need to be of an amount that the ship still had a positive weight. The air in the envelope could then be heated or cooled to regulate the remaining weight and to allow for the vessel to ascend or descend. I'm not sure about propulsion. I suppose they would need to use sails just like traditional ships. One interesting thing is that the ships could potentially have sails underneath the ship and on either side.

http://two66.com/render/render_168.png

This is the linkage in its current state. I ran a few positions to make sure the steam selector fits inside its housing. As you can see the pin that moves the selector is fixed to the position of the piston.

I tried to find a simulation program to input the linkage into and test if it works, but couldn't find any.

My main concern is that since the linkage is fixed, that when the piston starts moving the selector switches too early causing the piston to stop moving.

The inside of the pistons are 7cm in diameter and 30cm long. 1cm wall thickness.

The other concern i have is pressure. I know nothing about how strong certain materials are. I plan to use stainless steel, because i was told it is easy to weld.

The boiler has 2cm thick walls and small pipes inside to move the hot air through it.
Those pipes are 1.6cm in diameter and have a 0.3cm wall thickness.
There is a tank for resupplying the boiler with water. It only has 1cm wall thickness.
All the pipes linking the boiler to other parts are 1.8cm in diameter and 0.3cm wall thickness.

How much pressure would the system be able to withstand? And is that pressure enough to move the pistons with how much volume they have?

I also don't know if all the valves and other parts will hold up or even work.
The valves i made are just screws that screw into the pipe at a 90° angle, restricting the flow.

I just have a few questions:

**1.)**Do you enjoy using CFD?

**2.)**How did you get started with it? Did you learn it during a masters program or did you learn it through your company?

**3.)** Do you think it is worth it to go into a masters program just to learn about CFD and obtain a career that involves the use of CFD or fluid mechanics in general? Or is this not reasonable at all?



_________________________________________________________________________________________


Hello! The reason for these questions is I plan on working as an undergrad in a CFD lab for the next two years, then to move into a masters degree in mechanical engineering (area of specialization would be thermal sciences).

After a year of searching around for career paths to take, CFD is finally something that I found that I was extremely interested in(not sure why), and am currently reading a CFD intro book geared towards undergrad students. I think that a career involving CFD and other areas of fluid mechanics would be something that I will enjoy.

Also, just a little more info, I am an undergrad student in petroleum engineering. I am willing to move away from the petroleum industry if I enjoy working in the CFD lab and enjoy my masters degree enough(hopefully I can get into a masters program). Though I am unsure if moving away from the petroleum industry with a B.S in Petroleum is possible, so I will speak to my department advisor when the semester starts back up.

  I had an interview today with a certain large corporation for a position titled manufacturing engineer, and I believe the day went as well as it was possible to go.  However, the impression I got from the veteran engineers there was that I would not be doing much in the way of mechanical design work.  I am a mechanical engineer by degree and by trade - I submitted my application to this job in a fit of 'apply to all the jobs I am qualified for' on this corporation's site, since I have been trying to get my foot in the door of this industry for years (I finished my Bachelor's in 2012 and my Master's in 2013).  Now that I have the door open, though, I worry that I'll be stuck as a manufacturing engineer for at least the next few years, when in fact the reason I'm leaving my current job is to find a place where I can grow more as a mechanical design engineer.

I felt like this didn't drive the importance of the technique home for the students, and now I'm thinking of having them using shitty buttons for this particular lab so they can use analog and digital debouncing and compare the difference by looking at an oscilloscope (obviously wont matter for digital implementation, but they can see the noise w/o || capacitor) / consider the monetary cost of having the extra analog components at a large manufacturing scale.

74,Does anyone here have experience with lightning protection systems and/or galvanic corrosion considerations?,1406588593,"I am an Electrical Engineer who is currently designing a lightning protection system for a large generating station. The system consists mainly of air terminals, interconnecting copper cabling/downleads, and ground plates. The generating station is very close to the ocean (ie - it is on a point therefore three sides are within a couple hundred feet to the ocean). The large majority of the design thus far is using all copper/bronze/tin materials however I'm having trouble making a decision on whether to use copper or aluminum while bonding to galvanized sheet metal.

The metal in question is found on large exhaust shrouds and there are about 25 of them in total. I've been speaking with several different engineers and electricians however I'm having trouble with getting a solid consensus on whether to use aluminum or copper to bond them. 

General opinion on copper: 

1) Copper eats away zinc coating on galvanized steel

2) Salt water eventually erodes the unprotected steel 

(Note: These shrouds were all painted when the plant was built 30 years ago however the paint isn't in the best condition. Most areas will also have a layer of paint between the cable and the bare metal.) 

General opinion on aluminum: 

1) It won't react with the galvanized steel

2) It will not hold up in the harsh oceanic environment

Basically, it comes down to if I would rather see the copper lightning protection last for many years however it may cause rusting on the exhaust hoods down the road OR if I use aluminum, it will not cause rusting in the hoods however the lightning system will degrade faster and may not provide the same level of protection.

There was a very large tree growing maybe 2 feet away from it and the walls are cracked only at the mortar joints (they are not bowed).  There are some very small roots coming into the room through one or two of the cracks (edit- I do get some water leaking in).  I have recently cut down the tree and removed the stump.  The 8"" blocks have 3 small cores.  I would like to just fill them with grout instead of tuckpointing them, as I don't know what has happened to the outside of the block.  The real solution would be to cut the cores out of the blocks and add rebar but I think that is really excessive being that the walls are not bowed, and I do not know if rebar would fit very well in such small cores.  Not to mention how miserable doing all that would be in this tiny room.

Would adding fiberglass strands help at all?  Should  I do anything to the cracks so the grout doesnt drain out?

81,Setting Up a Conveyor Dispensing System,1406578908,"Hey there, engineers!

I'm looking to set up what is, in my opinion, a really simple dispensing system. It would use a conveyor belt to slide the containers along, dispensers to eject the material, and some sort of optical eye to indicate when to stop the conveyor belt and trigger the dispenser.

In order to tie all these elements together into a loop, I'm mostly looking into a PID system or Fuzzy Logic system.

Here's a basic sequence of events that I'm hoping the completed system can do:

1) Conveyor is running and the containers slide along.

2) The sensor detects when the well in the container is underneath it and tells the conveyor to stop running.

3) Once stopped, a dispenser ejects material for a specified amount of time.

4) After time has passed, the conveyor runs once again until the next well is underneath, and the loop repeats.

I've already got the conveyor and dispensers, so I really just need a little guidance on the sensor (photoelectric or fiber optic, possibly), and getting a PID or Fuzzy control system set-up.

Any sort of advice or guidance on the subject would be greatly appreciated!

2,What bachelor of those? Want a Masters in Petroleum Engineering,1406492070,"Hello. I'm 23 years and I'm starting my bachelor this year (hopefully) and I have to pick soon. I want to be a petroleum engineer. It sounds really interesting, the pay sounds great, and spending a couple years on an oilrig, 2 weeks on 2 weeks off also sounds pretty neat, so I can travel the world in my sparetime. But I don't want to spend my whole life on an oilrig, I also want a good office when I settle down. My dream is to climb the corporate ladder, lead a small team maybe, one day hopefully be a director. I'll likely be getting a bachelor in Finance once I begin working, that should be the most beneficial, right? Or would it be better to spend 3 years on a phd. in Petroleum?

But anyway, to get a masters in Petroleum Engineering, I'll need a bachelors. They say it can be one of those, ""or similiar"", as long as I'll get ""solid skills in thermodynamics, physics, analytical and applied mathematics""

Bachelor of:

    Civil Engineering

    Electrical Engineering

    Physics and Nanotechnology

    IT and Communications Technology

    Chemical Engineering

    Mathematics and Technology

    Environmental Engineering

    Mechanical Engineering

    Softeware Technology

How much does it matter what I get my bachelor in? Will those affect my future work, if I get a masters too? Which one would best be paired with my master,? climb the ladder fastest? Or should I just pick whichever one sounds most interesting to me - because most of them sound interesting. Pay is no concern, all of them I get paid fully and a small paycheck too. 

I have also heard just taking a Chemical Engineer is the best choice for working in an oilrig, so I'll always have something to fall back on.

6,How to select components for an astable multivibrator (oscillator)?,1406480693,"Hi, I'm making an astable multivibrator as a little do-it-yourself project. I based the design off of this picture:

[http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/tim20.gif](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/tim20.gif)
 
From this site:
[http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/astable.html](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/astable.html)

Instead of 6 vdc as the website assumes I have 110 vdc. I bought all the components online and made a prototype. However, I'm not an electrical engineer by any means, so I just guessed at the size of resistors, capacitors, and type of transistors. I assumed the power consumption was going to be high so I bought high power components (ie sand resistors). To test it, I used two simple 40W light bulbs in the 2 output positions. When I plugged it in both light bulbs lit up but the two smaller resistors began to smoke and then quickly burnt up (both lights then went off). I'm assuming I have the wrong size/type of components. Any recommendations on component selection would be extremely helpful. Thanks!

Here are the components I used in my prototype (names match the picture in the website)

* R1,R4 = 20 ohm 22W power resistor
* R2,R3, = 1.5 kohm 15W
* TR1,TR2 = TIP112 Darlington transistor

17,Closed loop phase change renewable energy power plant?,1406424179,"Hey I have an idea for a renewable energy power plant to be located in areas of large elevation/temperature changes.

Basically it's a closed loop pipe filled with a phase changing liquid.

A looped pipe runs up and down a mountain. Heat exchangers at the opposite ends and a turbine in the middle.  At sea level the liquid is vaporized via solar energy, the vapor rises to the top where it is passively cooled by the environment and a sun-shaded radiator, liquifies and runs back down the pipe.

I'm not sure how much power could be generated in this way.  I don't know whether the turbine should be located in the vapor or the fluid return, or both.  I don't know what the working fluid should be - ammonia, distilled water, etc.

If a large enough thermal mass could be built, I imagine it would go on working past sunset.  I also though about using a municipal composting site as an additional heat source.

Lets say that sea level temps are 25°C and the temperature at elevation is 5°C.  How big of a pipe would you need for a 25MW plant?  Is this even feasible?

26,Converting heavy weight lifting energy to electricity?,1406349871,"I am a fairly dedicated hobby weightlifter, and I often think about if there could be any way to generate electricity during these workouts.

If you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da4fH86_MKc) you'll see very heavy stones being placed on top of 5 foot+ tall platforms. My thought that if the platforms could be ""unlocked"" and the weight of the stones could press it down in a piston-like motion or something, then electricity could be generated simply from the weight of the stone. Then once the platform lowered down enough, the stone could be rolled off onto a mat from a low height, the platform could be raised up manually and locked into place, and then the whole process repeated as many times as possible during the workout.

I see this as a more plausible way of generating electricity because most discussions I've heard about using exercise equipment to do this is just people talking about doing 30 minutes on an elliptical machine and thinking that's a workout and expecting it to generate lots of electricity. But this is heavy weight we're dealing with here. Each stone could weigh anywhere from 100 lbs to 500 lbs.

My father is an engineer who owns his (very) small but (very) successful engineering firm (not in my area of interest, and doubtful that he will pass it on to me anyways) so I have been brought up in the mindset that corporate companies are inefficient, bloated, and office politics are bullshit.

I like many aspects of his job (mostly the freedom he has, and his employees are the same way so its not just a function of being the boss) but right now I am working a co-op for a very large military contractor company, and like my *work* (as in the topic of interest) better. I deal with corporate bullshit on a daily basis (don't work too fast or you won't have any work) and see both the negative drawbacks and the positive aspects of large corporations.

Right now my career goals are:

* Location- I want to be in a location very friendly to young professionals. Likely an urban environment far away from where I grew up, I would even love to go somewhere abroad.

* Money- Obviously money allows for more freedom on what to do outside of the job, so that is a top priority.

* Coolness factor- I want to work on cool things like rockets, engines, race-cars, etc.

My GPA is good enough that I can be very competitive to places like Boeing, LM, etc, but I don't want to get lost in the mess of thousands of employees dealing with the ties of corporate work.

Rules weren't set in stone, cool projects stemmed from the fact that often you would have to do something outside of your job description (because no one else was hired to do it), and time was pretty liberal as long as your work got done.

**So tl;dr**, just refer to the title. What do you prefer, and why?

41,Concrete post tension question. Ever hear of bird caging??,1406291057,"Hi, I am currently an intern for a construction company and I have been assigned the task of recording elongations for a post tensiong operation. The project is a fairly large parking garage and the PT system uses encapsulated individual tendons. 

Yesterday I was following a stressing crew around and noticed some of the tendons started to ""unwind"". It didn't take long for my supervisor and an inspector to take a look it at and they were both puzzled by it. I have provided the link which shows the worst tendon. It is located within the slab and is at an intermediate location (meaning that it will be rolled out further and stressed again once new concrete has been poured). Also the bird caging occurred about 20 minutes after it was stressed.

50,"Aircraft bolts (AN, NAS, MS etc) are heat treated to crazy high yield strengths (120,000psi+), and are obviously structural. Why isn't the rest of the structure this strong?",1406246590,"A good comparison is a steel tube fuselage (like 4130 chromoly), because the density of chromoly and an AN bolt are similar (as opposed to an aluminum fuselage for example). 4130 yields at around 60,000psi, or half that of the AN hardware bolting it together. What is the drawback of the 120,000psi hardware, and why isn't the rest of the steel structure heat treated to the same yield strength? If it were, you could get away with much thinner members, which would lower the mass of the fuselage (in this case by literally half).

EDIT: To re-clarify my question: You have been building aircraft with a material whose yield strength is 60,000psi for years. Hypothetically, the industry unveils a new material which is twice as strong in yield: 120,000psi. Why do you not choose to use this higher yield alloy? This is equivalent to my question. I understand there is a good reason why this is not the case. I am trying to understand what this reason is. To relate this question to aluminum: pure aluminum has a yield strength of about 10ksi. Over history, through alloying and heat treatment, this yield strength has been increased by about a factor of 4-5 (2024, 7075, and 6061 alloys being very popular, of varying heat treatments, namely T3-T6). This increase in yield strength is why all aluminum aircraft are built from these alloys, and not pure aluminum. Nobody will argue that these alloys are used instead of pure aluminum because their yield strength and mechanical properties are higher, that is a fact. In the case of my question, an alternative heat treatment of steel will double its yield strength. This is analogous to the example of aluminum, however instead of choosing the higher yield material (that was unanimously decided during the history of aluminum aircraft structural development, by using heat treated and alloyed aluminum with higher yield than pure aluminum), steel aircraft structures are built from lower yield alloys/heat treatments. Why is this the case? What deficits occur during the heat treatment process to 120ksi?",AskEngineers,MareSerenitatis,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2bn9e3/aircraft_bolts_an_nas_ms_etc_are_heat_treated_to/

I work for a mega-corp engineering company at an operational site doing engineering work for a client. My project is built around completing about 30 packages that are somewhat similar work. We are about to finish off the 3 pilot projects, then do a similar process for 2 dozen more units. My site manager wants the estimates etc by next week.

The problem is that last week my old boss (from when I was based in the main office) called me up and offered me a job at the company he moved to. I said I was interested (they main city office for my company has been decimated by rough times, about 90% of the engineering staff have been laid off, I was moved to site to keep me busy). I was amazed that I'm being headhunted in the first place (there is a brutal horrible situation in my city for engineers, it has turned from a massive boom to a total crash in the last year and there are a lot of unemployed engineers running around)

60,"Idea for ""wake up lamp""-product. Possible to make?",1406203842,"So I hope this ended up in the right subreddit. I have an idea of a product that could replace the typical alarm-lamp a lot of people spend a lot of money on. I'm not really too worried about the whole patent thing, this is mostly something I would make for fun.

What is a wake up light? A huge, heavy, expensive lightbulb with 20 levels of dimming and a built in clock and speaker. It's used creating a false sunrise feeling by slowly increasing the amount of light for instance 30 minutes before you want to wake up. When the alarm goes off you will have gotten used to the lighter environment and you wake up feeling rested and ready for the day.

My idea? Everyone has a light by their bed and everyone has a smartphone. I want to create an adapter where you connect your phone by micro USB and 1-2 lamps that you wish to use for waking up. The adapter is connected to a power outlet. The phone gets charged through the USB cable and runs an app that controls the amount of voltage delivered to the lamps, effectively deciding the strength of the light.

Why is it a good idea? You take away half the cost by not buying things you already own. You can choose your own design of the lamp, not restricted to a PHILIPS space-lamp. Your phone already has a speaker. The touch screen is a better control device than the clunky ""buttons"" on a normal night-light. You can choose to wake up from radio, your favorite music, specially made ocean-songs downloadable from the app, whatever you like. You would have a much larger choice of options - strobe light, a blink if you get a notification on your phone etc.

Competition? The LIFX bulb seems like a fantastic product, but it's not specifically designed for this, and as far as I know so far doesn't support waking up at a specific time, only egg-timer type waking. It's also controlled by wifi which should theoretically be more expensive than a simple USB port.

What do I want to know? Would it be complicated controlling the voltage through an adapter like this, and how small/cheap/easy can it be made? All thinking happens through the phone so it only has to send a bit stream of values between say 0-256 to say what fraction of the max power it should use, or just a value when it changes between two strengths.

62,Science and Engineering is often mixed up in the minds of people. It was in mine. Now I know I think more like an Engineer.,1406175631,"I'm 42 years old and always had a fascination with science.  I am always trying to figure how things work because people always hand me their broken stuff to fix.  Broken computers, appliances, even broken relationships and fixing misunderstandings among people.  

Yet I'd always hit the same brick walls when talking to science lovers online; a roadblock of me ""thinking different""; having multiple answers to the same questions when they wanted a single =.

Over the past week, I've read the ONLY two books I could find in my library about a philosophy of Engineering; The Essential Engineer and Why Things Break, plus I found a PDF scan of ""Definition of the Engineering Method"" - only 76 pages but the view on Heuristics was mindblowing to me.

In all three cases, they explained the differences between science and engineering by making a very clear point that science - and math - is *not* the foundation of engineering.

Getting things to work using whatever your state of the art is, in the time and resource constraints that you are working within - THAT is what's key.

In Definition of the Engineering Method there is a great line: ""Apply Science when necessary"", and the trip to the Moon is shown as a classic example of where Science is ignorant but Engineers plunge ahead because, well, the President told them to and gave the funding and resources to do so.  The deadline was 1970 and they did it.

THEN science came afterwards to come up with theories.

Eye opening.  Completely eye opening.  I avoided Engineering because of the public opinion, ""Oh they're weird people"" - well I'm weird and think different.  ""Oh it's all about math and CAD and science"".  Well, I can't draw.  I do programming and I have a love of science (physics especially - it's hard not to love physics).  But I failed Calculus and had no interest in learning the symbols of higher math - as by then, I was well versed in computer programming, having gotten BASIC at 11 years old in the early 80s when all that stuff was ""new"".

Point being: the Engineering mindset is something you can have that is distinctive from a Scientific mindset or a Religious Mindset or a Humanities mindset.

it's different.  I always called myself a ""hacker"" (in the old fashioned Unix good sense)  Well, engineering is hacking reality to accomplish new things with the very human constraints of time, uncertainty, lack of resources, etc.  There's more than one way to solve every problem and you do the best you can with what you know and what you have to work with.

77,Unusually high deformation of copper washer,1406136214,"Hey, I'm an intern at an diesel pump company and I am in the fuel feed/supply pump section. As a project while I'm there, they wanted me to look at reasons for leakage from a screw plug and then some possible solutions to it. So the screw plug sits on a copper washer which deforms to produce a good seal. The screw plug is a M26x 1.5 hexagonal bolt and the copper washer OD is 29mm and ID is 26 mm with average thickness of 0.95mm 

I feel the copper washer isn't deforming enough and I wanted to see how it deforms using FEA and force calculations. When measured, the copper washers usually deforms to 0.87-0.91mm thickness. The tightening torque for the bolt is 80 +-20 Nm.This large a deformation is something I cannot explain by theory(hookes law or roarks stress equations) or by simply FEA as the required force I calculate is around 800,000 N (which obviously seems too high). Does anybody have any idea where I could be going wrong and what I should be looking at.

78,A new product: am I on the right track?,1406135567,"Software engineer of 8 years here.  I recently developed a concept for my first (mechanical) consumer product and I was hoping those more knowledgeable than I can point out many things I am surely overlooking.  Bear in mind this is mostly a hobby project, but it's one I'm approaching with the dual intention of bringing it to market, and learning as much about the mechanical engineering process as possible.

The device as a whole is fairly simple--handheld, ~4 machined parts (CNC; nickel/aluminum alloy with steel interior), a honeycomb PTC ceramic heating element, a lithium ion battery and a basic PCB controller.

The PCB part is easy enough as I have played with my fair share of arduinos &amp; pi's, but when it comes to the electrical engineering required to power the heating element (efficiently and safely) I'm far out of my depth seeing as I have no formal background of any sort in the field.

At the moment I have the core mechanical components designed in AutoCAD Inventor and am beginning to test out flow design for basic pressure/airflow modeling--I presume the next steps would be basic thermodynamic modeling for consumer-safe surface temperatures after which I can contact my manufacturer for a proof.

Worth noting; I have also purchased a Makerbot Z18 (both as a learning tool and to test ergonomics before an expensive proof...) although I am completely new to the world of 3D printing and have no idea what I am doing.  Seeing as the plastics supported by the extrusion head don't support temperatures that would operate safely with the ceramic heating element, is it worth pursuing prototyping this way beyond basic testing?


**Some more general questions that don't necessarily fit into the above**

- For the purposes of developing consumer products, can anyone comment on the SolidWorks vs AutoCAD ecosystems?  I'm still very new to object design as a whole so it makes sense to learn a tool that will integrate best with what I am trying to accomplish.

- Are there any unique concerns relative to the materials I wish to use for the final device?  The proper K factor I should use when trying to model the material?  Also does it seem as though 1.5mm would be a sufficient thickness for the shell with a (fairly common) nickel-chromium alloy?

- Seeing as I have 0 background in electrical engineering, what is the best way for me to learn about integrating such a power source into a basic PCB configuration?  An equal balance of theory and practical application would be ideal, but I'm open to learning anything and everything an electrical engineer would consider important/relevant.

It occurs to me that a helicopter the size of a 737 would be an awesome firefighting vehicle.  Imagine the firehose of retardant that it could fling out!  I assume there is a physical reason that such a vehicle cannot exist?  My only guess would be that perhaps rotors that large would spin supersonically at the tips and thus be too unstable, but if that were the case, then why not multiple smaller rotors?

I feel like something exists in a 'standard design library' somewhere but can't think of what it would be called or where to find it.

To add a bit more detail the part would be held in place with something like an elastic band and when release would retract (out of the way) with it.  And it's going to be in the ocean of about a year so it needs to be simple and disposable (if it corrodes).

EDIT: Great suggestions by all but I suppose further clarification might be in order:

This application will be for a release that would hold a rotating drum against its end stop.  It moves longitudinally along its axis when it rotates which we want to ensure will not happen until it reaches deployment depth (about 500m).  At that depth an acoustic release will be triggered to release the drum. (There is much more to the overall design but this gets the gist of it)

Where this mechanism comes in is the connecting to the drum temporarily to the frame until the link is released.  The entire attachment would then need to get out of the way to permit the drum to travel along its axis.  

This will only happen about once a year and the expense to deploy the device is sufficient that the entire mechanism could be replaced between deployments assuming the costs were not too high and the parts were reasonably available/replaceable.",AskEngineers,1enigma1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2bf4ip/q_can_you_think_of_a_mechanism_that_holds_under/

I'm building a catalytic hydrogenation apparatus, and my pressure vessel has these specs : 316L stainless steel (16GA or 0.0625"" thick), 8.75"" high and 6"" diameter. It has a flat top and bottom (not ideal for pressure service, I know) and very good (robot-made) welds. The fittings are rated to 500psig. It will be operated at room temperature (22C, 72F)

I'm planning to use it at around 5atm (~75psig). A straightforward application of Barlow's law gives a unit stress of 3,600psi on the vessel walls, well below the ultimate tensile strength of 70,300psi and the 0.2% yield strength of 24,660psi.

However I'd rather not blow myself up because I didn't pay enough attention to my Resistance of Materials class back in college. So, is there anything I overlooked?

But you're always second to those finance guys. Everyday I read my finance websites and watch some CNBC it's part of my daily routine. Everyday I invest in the markets. I always try and read up on investment strategies, I read up on the daily lives of those who work on the street asked my friends who work there as well. It's madness and I love it. 

I feel like I'm young enough to make the move but don't know where to start or how to market myself.

From [this site](http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/getting-a-finance-job-from-engineering/) my positives:
* They won’t doubt your quantitative skills or your attention to detail.
* Depending on your experience, you can prove that you can work long hours relatively easily.
* You have options outside of investment banking that other professionals like lawyers and accountants don’t have access to.

Which is pretty much true. Plus the fact that I work at a good place now doesnt hurt. I'm making 85-90k now, should I expect a pay cut?

Any advice? Maybe you know somebody who has made the transition?

If I had the capability to fully control the direction of thrust of my aeroplane's engines, would I still need wings?

AFAIK, the primary role of wings is to ""rotate"" the backward-facing thrust to include an up-ward component by tilting the wing in an attack angle.

From a first-year physics perspective, taking the plane in its entirety, the only thrust-generating component are the engines, and the rest can only re-direct it.

So: if I had 100% directable engines, would I need wings?

Is there some trick to wings which make the current setup more efficient than rotatable engines?

30,How to calculate acrylic sheet deflection under load?,1405909446,"I'm building 16 computer networked scales as an inventory tracking educational demo. [I'm using these load cells.](http://i.imgur.com/bEOwvNy.jpg) You bolt a platform to the top and the bottom of the bar. The top connects to either the left or right side only, then you attach the bottom to the other side. When you put something on the top platform it causes the load cell to deform/bend causing a change in resistance which I measure using an amplifier and an analog to digital converter.

Because the project is educational I want the internals of each scale to be seen. My first inclination was to use 4.5mm sheet acrylic for the top and bottom because it's cheap, and I can laser cut it to the shape I need. I just need to make sure that it will work for the given load, and how much it will sag/deform so that I can accommodate it in my design.

What I had imagined is a plexiglass platform, 300 mm square of 4.5 mm thick acrylic. The load cell which is 150mm would be centered. This would mean the first mount point would be offset 80mm (75mm + 5mm) from the edge, with another mount point 15mm further inward. This would would mean that there is 205mm of acrylic suspended over the load cell unsupported acting as a lever. The load cell is 12.7 mm wide, and the mounting holes are I think .7 mm.

The load cell saturates at 7kg, but I figured I would want a tolerance of 150%, or 10.5 kg. 

* What load would the plexiglass experience? 
* What is this load called so that I can Google for equations in the future? 
* How do you find the physical properties of materials? 
* How much will the acrylic sag?

I was pressed to get these pumps sized due to lead time. Anyways, we didn't have a pipe route planned yet, so I estimated what the pressure drop would be by sketching out isometric drawings of what the anticipated pipe runs would be. 

It turns out my pump differential pressures are about 20% higher than what's required and my pumps put out about 30% more flow than required for the heat exchangers they service(we also didn't know what the heat loads/ required flow rates would be when I sized these pumps, so I had to estimate). 

All these pumps will be on VSD drives and will have some sort of actuated valve downstream to add (or reduce) the pressure drop on the system (all systems are closed loop). 

Can someone confirm that adding partially closing off a ball or butterfly valve to increase the pressure drop in the system will cause the pump flow rate to decrease? And if these pumps are on VFD's, I can scale back the speed and reduce the head and flowrate? In other words, tell me I'm not screwed and I will have some hydronic balancing to do in the field? These pumps are already in production at the factory.

53,What is turnover frequency in audio equalising context?,1405791983,"I have been pretty curious about this. I came across this term while browsing the specifications of this headphone amplifier: http://www.gspaudio.co.uk/voyagerportableheadphoneamplifier.htm

For this audio amplifier, it has an equaliser switch (named contour) which equalise the audio signal by a specific manner. Under the specifications tab, it shows that for the ""contoured"" equaliser that the audio amplifier provides, it shows

&gt; ""Contour: +9dB at 45Hz and 20 kHz, Turnover +3dB at 260Hz and 2.85 kHz""

I can understand the first where it means turning on the contour switch will ""connect"" a separate portion of the circuit that results in a boost in power at 45Hz and 20kHz. However, what does ""Turnover +3dB at 260Hz and 2.85 kHz"" mean? 

What exactly has changed in the volume when it says turnover frequency at that 2 points are increased by 3dB? In what way can I replicate such an effect in the frequency range using hardware? How about software equaliser, can it be done using a software equaliser to boost the power of specific frequencies to result in the same effect?",AskEngineers,Ratix0,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2b59kd/what_is_turnover_frequency_in_audio_equalising/
54,Designing a deep-space telescope for Hard SF story,1405783740,"Hey all - 

PSU Computer Engineering student here - also an avid SciFi reader/writer.  I have a story that I think is of real value, and would like to develop it and maybe try and get it published!  

The story approaches Hard SF but isn't terribly high intensity.  For this reason, the tech needs to be reasonable but can still be a little fanciful.

The story takes place in ~2300 and relies on an extremely powerful telescope - one that could monitor the activity of a city, town, or even individual people from 4000 light years away.  

The telescope needs to be part of a mobile ship or station (it can't be a permanent geographic or orbital fixture).  

The telescope also needs a sweet-ass name.

Anyways, imagine you are the lead of this far future design team and have unlimited resources at your disposal.  How would you piece together such a telescope?  I have a lot of ideas, but as a lowly Computer Engineering undergrad, I really just have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to telescopes or aerospace.  Or anything, really.

However, the simulation software is in a completely different branch of science that the staff typically works on.

* I want to buy a good gift for the engineering department to show my gratitude and appreciation, but don't know where to start.  I thought about buying some plants but didn't want to dump the upkeep on them.  Office supplies or anything related is out of the question, as this particular group gets whatever they want if they request it from the company.  I don't really know where else to begin.

If anyone has had a similar experience in the past where a parting member of the team did something nice or gave a gift upon leaving, please let me know.  Ask any and all questions you might have, I welcome all ideas.

88,Hypothetical: What would it take for a schmo like me to get a satellite into orbit?,1405634684,"Project: Get an optical telescope into some Earth orbit that would be useful for taking pretty pictures of stars and stuff.

I want it to stay up there for several weeks, if not months or years. I want to be able to communicate with it to point it in different directions. I want it send pictures down to me on Earth. What would it take for me to do this?

I'm speaking hypothetically, of course. I picked an optical telescope because sometimes I'm an amateur astronomer. But I'd like to keep this generalized. I'm not actually considering this. I'm just wondering what level of knowledge and funding and materials it takes. I read about people launching high-altitude balloons and model rockets and things. Also ham radio people get satellites up there sometimes by hitching a ride with other launches. It makes me curious what people outside of NASA, SpaceX, and defense contractors could be capable of.

Assume I have all the money necessary.

* **How much money would it take?** Tens of thousands, millions, billions?

* **Can the materials needed for this be bought by just anyone?** Especially the fuel. Do you need a clean room and advanced manufacturing processes to have a chance, or can you build it in your garage?

* **Could I hire people to work on this?** Is there a market of aerospace engineers that can be hired and would be able to do this? Is technology at a point where hobbyists can consider this?

* **Or could my friends do this?** Suppose me and my friends aren't professional engineers but do semi-relevant hobbyist stuff: astrophotography, electronics, ham radio, model rockets, etc. (This isn't me, and I don't have these friends).

* **Are there regulations on putting objects into orbit?** Beyond interfering with the FAA's domain.

* If this is all crazy, **how long until something like this could be feasible?** And if part of this is possible for me, which parts?

Note: I'm assuming this is a ridiculous notion. But I don't have any idea *how* ridiculous it is.",AskEngineers,LogicalTom,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2azsg9/hypothetical_what_would_it_take_for_a_schmo_like/
89,Thread forming taps,1405629287,"My boss asked me to research roll forming taps, I'm assuming these are the same as thread forming taps. My boss seems to think thread forming taps require a different kind of machine to use, but it my research it seems like the only thing we'd need to purchase is the tap and it would work in a milling machine. Is this true? He seems convinced that thread forming taps won't work with just any milling machine.

90,Need help to somehow connect roofing brackets,1405627177,"So I have a very strange problem,


I am working for a professor at my university for the summer. We are building a water loop for research purposes. Part of this loop includes a very large globe valve which sits horizontally (about 35 inches length). What this means is we need a way to support the globe valve.


My suggestion was just to build a simple support of two plates connected by bolts that could be adjusted to go up or down easily. However a previous student had the professor buy a bunch of these ""roofing brackets"" and the Professor is absolutely adamant about using these roofing brackets to support this globe valve. He likes that they can be easily adjusted and have been approved by some quality control team.


So he wants me to somehow use two of them in tandem and create a ""bridge"" the globe valve can sit on while still being able to adjust the height of the roofing brackets. Which sounds easy until I sat down to draw something out to connect them and realized how difficult it is. If I bolt or weld the two tops of the roofing brackets together it removes all degrees of freedom and you cannot adjust the roofing brackets height by changing their angle... not without either stretching or compressing the metal between them at any rate.

Here is a very simple diagram I threw together (the exact same roofing brackets are being used):

I was wondering about using curved bolts on one end that can be loosened when you want to adjust the height. Because to adjust the roofing bracket height you must adjust the angle which causes a lot of the problems. However this idea does seem sort of hokey to me.

I am wondering if /r/askengineers has any ideas or experience with this sort of problem before. 

tl;dr I need to connect the two roofing brackets without sacrificing freedom of movement (up and down) of the bridge between them.",AskEngineers,KingofRiders,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2azf3u/need_help_to_somehow_connect_roofing_brackets/
91,DC Servo Motor Under Impulse Load,1405621845,"So I'm trying to spec a DC servo motor for continuous position control, and it will be subjected to impulse loads while positioning.

I am a mechanical engineer by trade, but I need someone with more experience with electric motors to answer this question. The motor will drive a ball screw type linear actuator for the positioning, and I have run all necessary calculations to determine what torque the motor will have to resist to maintain its position. My issue is that most motors are rated with a stall torque, such that if it is running at a given rotational speed, it will stop when working against a torque equal to or greater than the stall torque.

My question is, if the motor isn't running continuously at a given rotational speed, but has power applied to it for positioning (very small movements), how can I determine if that motor will resist the torque applied from the impulse load on the actuator?

If you have any questions or need more information let me know. I can't decide if I'm over-simplifying or over-complicating. Part of me wants to believe that if power is applied, then the motor resisting motion until the stall torque is imparted in it is valid, but then I second guess that, thinking that inertia of a moving motor has to play into torque resistance.

95,Is bioengineering worth it?,1405611085,"Hi r/askengineers!!

I'm about to start my junior year at an ABET accredited engineering school.  I've chosen to major in bioengineering and this up coming semester I'll be starting to get into the meat of my major classes.  However, I am having a problem convincing myself that bioengineering is the right major for me. However, I am reluctant to change majors because I have worked very hard to be accepted into the bioengineering program.  

My schools bioe program is not specifically biomedical engineering like most programs are.  There is a biomed track that people can pursue.  I am going to pursue the biological track because I want to work on making things more environmentally friendly.  Though after some research online it seems like the only jobs there are for bioengineers are in the biomedical field.

I'm not sure that bioe is the best major for me.  If I switch majors now it will put me very behind schedule in regards to graduating on time.  Should I just stick bioengineering out for the last two years and if I can't get a job doing what I want go to grad school for either CHEMe or Civil/Environmental?

All of my friends and family say that I shouldn't worry and that if I graduate with bioe I will be fine.  They also attribute a lot of my fear to the fact that bioengineering is still a fairly new field and because of this it's hard to find info on.

What do you think? Will I be able to get a good job doing environmental type work with bioengineering? Will I even be able to get a good paying job?  Do you think bioengineering is even worth finishing?

I'm starting to think it isn't.

Please help!!
