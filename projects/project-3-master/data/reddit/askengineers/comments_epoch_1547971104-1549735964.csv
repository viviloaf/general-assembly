1,Could use some advice choosing between internship offers,1549733622,"I’m a mechanical engineering student in the midst of a career change from corporate finance and accounting. I used to do financial analysis and modeling for manufacturing companies before deciding to go back to school. 

I’ve had two internships with Lockheed Martin doing mechanical (fatigue) testing, but being in my junior year of the degree plan and having only one summer before I graduate, I thought it would be a good idea to try for an internship supporting a design group, especially since my CAD skills at the moment are extremely limited. 

I tried like crazy to get a design internship at Lockheed and finally got an offer yesterday for their space systems division in Colorado (I applied to this position last fall). However, I already accepted a summer internship last month with a natural gas terminal company in Houston since I had already been rejected from so many other design internships, and wanted to be sure I secured something for the summer different than mechanical testing so I can expand my skill set. The natural gas terminal  internship seems like it will be heavy on project management vs. true engineering tasks, but it seems that it will offer more responsibility for an intern/entry-level engineer than Lockheed would. Based on my research, the natural gas terminal company would likely offer $10-20k more per year in starting salary, which I would assume is due to the nature of their respective industries. 

Do you think it would be detrimental to my career to not have a design/CAD-heavy experience on my resume before jumping into a project management type of role? Would you rather start your career with a company that makes products that are more interesting to you but would likely offer a significantly lower starting salary and slower career progression due to the large seniority-favoring bureaucracy that exists? 

My ideal career path would be to grow into a project management role with a company that makes truly interesting products, such as Lockheed, but as an older student it’s somewhat important to make up for “lost time” in my engineering career, but on the other hand, it’s been drilled into my head that every mechanical engineer needs industry design/CAD experience and I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot by missing out on that. 

I have 4 more days to decide, and I’ve changed my mind probably 4 times since I was notified about the Lockheed offer. 

Any thoughts on my dilemma would be appreciated and would help me along with this tough decision. Thanks!

17,How do I know if engineering is for me?,1549690758,"  

Hello! I am a high school senior and I am seriously considering engineering but I am very nervous.

One reason I am hesitant is I don’t know if I am good enough for it. I have always loved math, science, and programming during high school and therefore began looking into engineering. I’ve always seen engineers as some of the brightest students and am doubtful I could ever work/learn properly alongside these students, but more importantly stay up to speed with them. Every time I ask the engineering students around me about their opinions of me getting into engineering, they always insist I am underestimating the difficult despite me *never* indicating I thought engineering was easy. I took an intro to computer science class and absolutely loved the little programming we were introduced to. Additionally, I'm in Calc 1 right now and I absolutely love it. Are there any courses I can take in college that might ensure I may do okay in engineering?

Additionally, how did you all decide on your field of engineering? I’m stuck between electrical and industrial at the moment. I leaned towards electrical as circuits were the most interesting aspect to me during physics but once again, when I asked those around me about electrical engineering I was told to “forget about it” because it was too hard for me. Additionally, I really leaned towards industrial engineering as I liked the idea of working in risk management (i.e. hedge funds) as I really liked that aspect of finance and also looked into getting a Masters in Financial Engineering. 

Also, is it impossible to have a high GPA? Once again, please forgive me if I come off as an idiot asking these questions but I was asking because I’m really interested in the research aspect of engineering and was really looking into getting a masters program. I’m coming out of high school with an AA degree with a pretty rough GPA (3.5) and wanted to try to keep my GPA reasonable during the next 4 years and was wondering if that was possible. I must also note, I spend hours and hours studying as throughout my years in high school I’ve had to resort to teaching myself. I’m graduating #6 in my school and while my stats are decent to an extent, I’m not the best test taker (I got a 1390 on the SAT and many of the upperclassmen around me have been shitting on me saying it clearly indicates I’m not cut out for engineering) but that’s a flaw I’m currently working on perfecting. Pretty much what I’m saying is that I’m willing to commit many hours to my work.

Once again, I apologize in advance if I sound uneducated about engineering, I must remind everyone, all those around me refuse to actually give me valuable information that might help me decide whether or not engineering is right for me.

I'm having a bit of... how would you say it?  A crisis of faith in myself. This post is gonna be somewhat long and rambling and for that I apologize.

Some background: Graduated with a Materials Engineering degree, spent a little less than 2 years working as a pseudo engineering assistant manager on a big project in a big corporation.  It was interesting but I was doing no less than 70 hours a week and it was killing me (being hourly and getting overtime was pretty awesome though). Then I got a job as a mechanical/materials engineer for a small company.  40 hours a week has been great.  I learned a whole bunch very quickly, but almost immediately the engineers senior of me were let go.  I've been here for 5 years now and for 4 of those I've been the only engineer. This has had its pros and cons.  Pros: I've had to learn how to solve every problem myself, and have become quite resourceful.  I've engineered solutions for larger companies that we contract for and they've all been successes. Cons: I've been limited to what I can learn online or books I've purchased, also the inevitable mistakes along the way.  A few times I have had to admit defeat and tell my superiors that certain things are beyond my ability, but there's been no movement to enhance or augment my abilities (no money for that kinda thing).

This last part is what's getting me right now.  Since I haven't worked on a team or with people with more experience, I have no idea where I fall in terms of experience or skill level.  I don't know if there are some fundamentals that I've been missing out on and stuff like that.

The last couple years I've felt like I've stagnated and am no longer learning.  I've been looking at jobs but the doubts of my own abilities are causing me a great deal of anxiety.  What if I get a job and it turns out I can't do it or even the basics? My current position is boring , but stable.  I think after 5 years I've outgrown my salary, and am looking to advance in experience and pay.  (and before you say it, raises are completely out of the question, another reason I have to move on.)

I guess my question is really has anyone else experienced doubt in their own abilities?  How did you deal with it?

Any career advice going forward?  I obviously can't waste any more time here.  Should I be forthcoming about doubts in my abilities at a new position?  Or should I strive for an entry-level job to start from the ground up?

The material is advertised to use ""nano damping technology"" which I assume is marketing speak for a viscoelastic material. The problem I ran in to with these is while I don't doubt they provide the level of protection they're certified for, they're essentially 7mm thick sheets of rubber when I'm walking around, with regards to how easily they build up on themselves. I eventually got tired of having to go to the restroom to fix the placement and bought a different brand of more rigid knee protection with the same certification. These aren't going to be stealthy, but they'll easily pop into place if they move. 

After a bit, I got to thinking about whether there would be any additional protection from using both sets, the thin, pliable material on the further from my knee in the pocket and the more rigid armor closer to my knee where I can easily move it into place if needed. The resulting sandwich of materials would be human knee, foam reinforced with whatever the armor company uses to reduce impact force, viscoelastic sheet, covec pants liner, denim. I'm not asking how much difference the would be, I understand I'm not providng enough information to get that kind of answer.

I graduated from college back in December 2017 with a degree in mechanical engineering with no prior internship experience. I worked in the machine shop for the engineering school of the university  for a semester and had capstone experience. Due to that, I took a job as a mechanical testing technician with an aerospace material testing company about 2 months after my graduation due to me needing a job to pay the bills after graduating. During my time here I’ve been casually applying to actual engineering positions outside of the company and have been interviewing whenever I get one.

I tend to feel like I’m working tirelessly to become relevant in my job and learn new skills every day. It has brought my morale down when I was given an average rating in performance reviews. 

I enjoy learning and keeping up to date in technology, but I hate figuring out the intricate details of using that tool/skill in a day to day setting. I really love designing the application and then driving it’s strategy. A different leader in my current role thinks I should stay my path and eventually become an engineering director/tech lead, but I can’t imagine how long I’d have to spend under this pressure and stress to reach that status.

Am I in the right role and should I keep at it until I eventually become a technical lead? 

Or, does my skill set along with my strong soft skills described above fit more of a Technical Product Management role? Should I look at a Amazon Solutions Architect role where I help companies drive cloud architecture and cloud migration strategies?

Are any of you familiar with the career path and growth opportunities in Product Management and it’s corresponding salaries?

38,Need Advice. I was hired for a different role than the one that I have been put into for my new job,1549652036,"I'm a new hire in the Defense industry. I interned last summer  for the company that I am now working for full time. At the end of last summer, I had a new manager interview me for a different team and ultimately introduced me to the team I would be working with and gave me an overview of what I would be doing. It was a software engineering team and my title for my job offer was software engineer.

Fast forward to today, I get to my new job and I am in a different team (same product) which was formed in October, which is a systems engineering team. I absolutely did not want to start my career in systems engineering, and the fact that I was entering a software team is the only reason that I accepted this job. The only software I'll touch in this roll is maybe writing test scripts to run integration tests.

I've been trying to keep my head up, but I'm absolutely furious about this and am struggling to focus on the job because I hate what I'm doing and the type of work that is given to new hire systems engineers. It's taking every ounce of self-constraint I have to not start applying to other companies.

Has anyone been through a similar situation? If so, what did you do. Right now my plan is to try to  make it at least 6 months or a year if I can manage it and then get a new job asap.

40,Obtaining P.Eng experience with Project Management Job in Ontario,1549649905,"Hi,

Currently I have 3 years of experience as a project manager managing construction projects in Ontario. I know there are currently four categories when applying for licensing in Ontario: Application of Theory, Practical Experience,  Management of engineering, communication skills and awareness of Social implications of engineering. Currently I believe I will have a hard time with the Application of Theory portion of the work experience requirements.

I have resently been approached by a start up who is looking to bring me on. They have a solid product that based on my experience I think can do well. The problem is that they have never hired anyone outside of the original 3,therefore I would be employee number 4. They already have funding and current contracts (according to them) that they have enough run way for the foreseeable future. 

My background is strange to say the least. Graduated with a degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering, worked in manufacturing as an engineer for 5 years. Last year I left traditional engineering for a continuous improvement consulting position. Over the past year, along with Consulting, I've also been doing some data science/analysis work that I've enjoyed. 

My question is...

Title: Operations and Support Analysis 

Job Description:
- Assist customers in driving continuous improvement within their facility and understanding their data.   
- Drive improvements in data availability and visualizations for new/existing customers.
- Develop Adhoc reports for customers, based on request.
- Drive continuous improvement within the software and data availability, based on customer feedback and best practices.
- Assist in on boarding, training, installation, and initial support of new customers.

-Salary
-Health Care allowance (annual amount) (note: they all have spouces with health insurance so they just use theirs... Their first thought when I asked was to goto the state... I told them no) 
-Other benefits (vacation)
-Travel (preferred, willing, needed; transition to next employee, etc)
-Quarterly goals and associated raises
-Anything else either of us thinks of as important between now and then

I just don't want to miss anything when I put pen to paper for an offer.

52,Experince with ceiling heating,1549629511,"Hello everyone,

Me and my colleagues are working on a project which includes ceiling heating (hot water pipes) mounted in plaster in living rooms, bedrooms, etc. We have no personal experience with it and we also cannot fully wrap our brains around it because the power output of the ceiling heating should be fairly low in comparison with standard convective radiators.

&amp;#x200B;

**One of the rooms has following configuration (designed by architect, not me):**

**Area of the room, A = 20 m\^2**

**Stefan-Boltzmann constant, SB = 5,37\*10\^-8**

**Emissivity of the plaster, E = 0,93**

**Temperature of the ceiling, Tc = 273 + 28 K**

**Temperature of the surfaces, Ts = 273 + 22 K**

**P = A\*SB\*E\*(Tc\^4 – Ts\^4) = 670 W**

**P per square meter = 33,5 W/m\^2**

&amp;#x200B;

If the heat losses of the room are equal to calculated power output P, then I don’t see a bigger problem with it. My question is:

If any of you ever encountered similar setting. How did it feel? Was the air cold because IR radiation doesn’t interact with it and it’s only heated from the warmed furniture? How did the furniture felt? Was the floor warm enough for bare feet? Was your skin too warm or too cold? What happened when the heating was suddenly switched off? Was everything suddenly colder? How did you feel when you were sleeping? Was only your face warm while your body was cold because it was technically shielded from IR radiation by a blanket? Was the ceiling/joints cracking due to thermal expansion? Etc.

I’m more interested in personal experience and I will be grateful for any shared experince. Thank you.

64,Double Majoring in Engineering and Physics for Watchmaking,1549596679,"Hello! 

I recently started my freshman year where I have chosen to complete a 5-year program in which I will major in both Engineering and Physics. I aspire to become a watchmaker, which, as I understand, requires a great degree of mathematics and dexterity in order to ensure accurate timekeeping of the movement. My question is as follows: Do I need to major in both or could I just get away with Engineering? I feel as though physics ties into the engineering of certain aspects of the movement, such as the balance wheel or other gravity-affected components. Am I correct or should I abandon physics and opt for a 4-year program? The extra year for a second major may be worth it, but I am honestly unsure.

Thank you!

The office basically has (really had) all disciplines A/E in house, but the engineering side of the business has been dwindling for some time with no new work coming in. Apparently, just before I came on, there were lay-offs on the engineering side and the general morale is low as engineers have been making exits on their own.

I fear that I will be part of the next round of lay-offs. I've been advised by a co-worker to dust off my resume and start looking for work elsewhere.

My question is, is it more attractive to an employer to have one long engineering workplace experience (5 years or so) or several short experiences at different places (like the two 6 month internships or other shorter ones during the gaps between semesters).

74,Question About the Difference Between RMS Range and Peak Range Sensor Outputs,1549584509,"Here's the situation:

I'm working on writing a test plan to test a loop powered, 4-20 mA vibration sensor.

I'm working with a vendor that my company utilizes often that does vibration testing of motors. This company has 80g peak accelerometers and data acquisition and software to produce all of the displacement/velocity/acceleration time histories and frequency spectrum. All I'd really like to do is show up, place one of my vibration sensors on a motor that they have recent vibration data and do a side by side comparison. I'd like to examine their peak velocity values from their time history data, observe the current output of my device when operating under the same operating conditions, calculate the corresponding velocity, and ensure that my device is producing a value within a reasonable margin of their measurements.

Here's the question: When comparing data and writing this test plan, do I need to take into consideration the conversion from Peak values to RMS values. The velocity meter that I'm testing is has an RMS measurement range of 0-0.8 inches per second and proportionally outputs 4-20 mA.

As a practical example with values to explain what I'm trying to determine.

Say I look at my vendors data and observe a peak frequency of .707 inches per second. I need to determine what current I expect to read from my circuit when my sensor undergoes the same test. Since a peak velocity value of .707 inches per second corresponds to an RMS velocity value of 0.5 inches per second, should I expect my current to be 14 mA? Or is the conversion not necessary and I should expect a current from my circuit closer to 18 mA?

75,Inconsistent behaviour from stepper motor,1549583951,"I've been building a macro focus stacking rail. It uses a stepper motor which turns a screw pushing a carriage forward on a frame. The carriage has a camera on it. The intention is to be able to move it a small amount \~10µm with each step and take a photo with the camera.

It works somewhat, but, to my surprise, the motor sometimes steps backwards. In the linked video, the motor should be driven forwards at a constant rate, but instead, it stays still at some points, and at other points, it jumps backward or forwards.

(The video has a very dead dragonfly in it)  
[https://youtu.be/3bJgzb5\_gL8](https://youtu.be/3bJgzb5_gL8)

This is the first time I've used stepper motors. So I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing, although I would have thought it would be pretty simple to move it one step forwards every few seconds. The system uses a nema 23 stepper motor, an A4988 driver, and it is being controlled by an arduino uno compatible board. The driver is supplied 12 volts (which I think is a little low, but my application doesn't require a large amount of torque, and I didn't have any higher voltage capacitors). I'm also using microstepping, which I think might be part of the problem. I want to be able to move 1/8th or 1/16th of a step - I don't actually care about the accuracy I just want it to be small. The step command is held high on the for 1 msec and then held low until the next step is needed. I'm quite sure that the four wires are connected correctly, as when I change them the stepper just buzzes and judders.

When I move the stepper quickly, the motion seems to be smooth - although it might just be that the effects are small. I'm not sure if it is meaningful to try to move a stepper motor by a single microstep, or if you need to move a whole step using microsteps. I haven't been able to find very much information - although it is probably that I don't know where I should be looking.

It's a little bit frustrating as it seems to work very well 80% of the time. I half thought I should abandon microstepping and design a small gearbox - but that will probably just turn my electronics problem into a mechanical one, hahh.

It has some other odd behaviours, I'm not sure if microstepping is the only or main issue.

5,Pressing a stiff chocolate mixture into silicone mound,1549552394,"Hey, 

I think Reddit has become my go-to source for aggregated human knowledge. There really is a subreddit for everything. I have a challenge I’ve asked a few different types of Engineers about and so far I haven’t found anything that solves my unique problem.

It’s to do with chocolate and moulds. I need to get chocolate into a mould, quickly and with minimal spillage. But the problem is that regular chocolate flows quite nicely into a mould once melted and then, if done properly, sets perfectly. 

What I’m trying to do is get a very stiff mixture of 50% melted dark chocolate and 50% dry powder ingredients to flow into a rectangular chocolate bar mould. 

The problem I have is that it’s about as viscous as unmelted ice cream. It will move and form as you apply pressure, but it sure as hell won’t do it on its own. It needs to be pushed and smoothed and pushed and smoothed and pushed and smoothed to fit into the silicone mould. Once it dries, it’s exactly as I need it – a consistent mixture of chocolate and powder that, on the outside, looks like a unique chocolate bar. I just need a way to press these in quickly because this is quite simply the most time-intensive part of my amateur “manufacturing process” 

Some ideas I’ve had are to use a warmed up, flat steel or aluminium press to push the mixtures into the mould, but then I need to consider that the silicone mould may deform under the pressure, and I’m concerned this won’t allow the mixture to spread evenly through the mould.

I’ve also heard of using a roller to smooth the mixture into the moulds but then I worry about there being way too much spillage out of the sides. 

Really hoping someone can come up with a unique solution. Thank you for reading.

In my research project, I now have to regulate a pump (power 0-100%) and a valve (totally closed, 0%, to totally open, 100%) to establish a given pressure on a water pipe. (My project is quite broad and this is only one of the sidetasks that's a bit outside of my area of expertise.)

The problem here is obviously that there are two variables that I can manipulate independently. In practice, there are some extra considerations; e.g. I don't want to close the valve too far because the system will clog too easily, so I want to regulate over a large range mostly with the pump, but on the lower and upper ends I need the valve (if it is too far open, the pump cannot generate enough flow to make the pressure, and I don't want to run into 100% pump flow too soon.)

So currently I basically draw an arbitrary curve that maps an input from 0-100% to two outputs (pump power and valve position) based on my ""feeling"".  But I feel there must be better ways to approach this problem? What should I use to decide on this? 

Also there is the problem that the two responses (pump and valve) are not equally fast: the pump response is near-instant, whereas the valve takes 90 seconds to go from 0 to 100% (of course the actual regulation demand will be much smaller than 100% in practice). So depending on where on my arbitrary curve I am, the system will respond very differently. How do I best handle this?

Any advice, also reading material, or hints on how this might be an XY problem, are appreciated.

36,How to best 'filter' temperature for heat exchanger fouling model,1549484751,"I am working on the design and creation of a device that essentially reads temps from all ins and outs of any basic heat exchanger. The main goal is to make calculations on the fly that will essentially tell the user the change in thermal resistance that results from fouling. I have done a few trial runs and my biggest issue comes from temperature control PID loops. Any given temp or even LMTD will go up and down at some random interval because of one of the temperatures being controlled. Because of that the output Rfouling value is going to change constantly in a completely inaccurate manner 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I can get a best fit line over the course of a set amount of time and calculate along that line, but this is iffy on accuracy because of the extreme slopes seen in the temperature (UHT system). I tried calculating mid points between two slope changes and that does not work because of any sort of outside disturbance, also creates a change in slope, and filtering out these changes makes the larger changes shift giving in accurate data. I think this may be the best option if theres a way to filter out anything but the PID loops correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some other useful things to know: 

* We can assume constant flow rate of both fluids (not true but the problem is there with or with out it) 
* In Python on a Raspberry Pi with 4 temp compensated T type themocouples 
* Not that it matters but the trials I have done are co current flow in a shell and tube with high protein milk product steam heated and the steam temp is that which is controlled 
* Data is being collected ever second, however I do not need resistance to be given out ever second, every minute is my goal
* The specifics of the PID loop cannot be given to the program, it needs to work on any type of loop with any speed or be able to pick out the parts of the loop and use them which the latter is obviously much more complex. 

All in all, I do not just want to make a best fit line, and do not want to just average every 100 points to dull out the data, but pick a correct and representative point to make calculations around. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. What are future career prospects within aerospace like and where is the industry headed in general?

3. Where is research headed now in CFD/propulsion and what is relevant now that is going to be needed in the future?

I am a grad student in geotechnical engineering who has a very good research resume, but no industry experience whatsoever. I have been a research assistant/intern/fellow in some role since 2015 (in water resources and geotech) at my undergrad and graduate institutions (both R1 state schools), as well as one large private research lab. 

Up until recently, I wanted to get my PhD,  but I decided instead to just get my MS and try to go into private consulting (one day lol). That being said, I have three opportunities I am currently weighing out this summer, 2 guaranteed and 1 unsure. With my current experience, what role would best set me up for a career outside of academia:

1) continue my current research assistantship through the summer (lots of lab work, I already have this experience on my resume and will be doing it in the fall as well). 

2) accept a job offer I have with the federal government doing disaster risk assessment (I haven’t started this job but it has been offered to me starting next month). The team I would be joining has a lot of experienced civil engineers as well. 

3) continue applying to consulting companies for summer internships (I have not heard back from any yet but I have applied to about 40).

I have talked to career services and they all have told me I have a strong academia resume, but I think I would be a much stronger job candidate long term if I got to perform in a non research related roll. What are y’alls thoughts? I am personally leaning towards the government job,  but I don’t know how this would look on a resume.  Also, I have not yet taken the FE (I know I need to and i will!!!!)

cosmic inflation redshift destroys energy

cosmic inflation create new space

new space has vacuum energy

&amp;#x200B;

HYPOTHESIS 1: expansion red-shift of certain energies(eg photons) has space-energy conservation. space to energy / energy to space conversion is occurring, and if you factor in space as energy there is conservation.

&amp;#x200B;

I roughly calculated the energy the numbers and they fall within reasonable range, but I cant think of a way to test it except correlating expansion rate with radiation energy traversing various regions of spacetime,

&amp;#x200B;

So I while I'm working on that I moved on to hypothesis 2, which is much more of a long shot, because relative velocity redshift doesn't have lost energy, the energy is conserved as momentum. But I figure is one form of redshift involves space-energy conversion then perhaps so do the other types of redshift.

&amp;#x200B;

Hypothesis 2 : All red/blue shifting includes an energy to space conversion. While traveling at high speed if light is emitted forward it is blue shifted and converts some space into energy, emit light backwards and it creates space. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my plan is to arrange a time dilation test by accelerating a time counter.

How much more reliable would it be to use pulse modulation without amplitude modulation?,1549419890,"For background, I am looking for ideas on how to build a satellite internet network with the bandwidth and ultra low latency of fiber optics. An obvious part is having the satellites no further than 1000 km away from the Earth (as the internet can only move as fast as the speed of light). I know fiber optics use adjustments to the flashes of infrared light (pulse modulation). Radio like Wi-Fi and LTE uses QAM on multiple frequency carriers.

I thought about using 1 billion pulses per second with pulse modulation (a pulse every nanosecond). This is to enable 1 billion times more data to be transferred using existing QAM rates and frequencies.

For low power devices like phones and mobile hotspots, I thought about using only pulse modulation with modulation in frequency and phase. Amplitude modulation will be omitted to improve reliability and consistency. The 1 billion pulse per second idea will compensate for using only 2 possible phase shifts over a narrow frequency range. This is to lower the effects of rain fade and foliage.

97,I have ideas for a non line of sight ground to satellite link with fiber optic performance with a small antenna. I'm curious about what issues that may arise and if the ideas are feasible.,1549406249,"For background, I am doing research on telecom systems to look for and think of ways to improve them. I know fiber optics use pulse modulation at an extremely rapid pace and is full duplex. I read research papers about idea of full duplex radio communications. It inspired some ideas.

The distance of 1000 km away from the Earth or closer is a given. This is because the internet can only run as fast as the speed of light (provided there are no other variables). The system will be full duplex with no separation of upstream or downstream by frequency or time slots. In addition to encoding digital values using adjustments to frequency, amplitude, and/or phase; a pulse rate of 1 billion per second will be used. This allows encoding and decoding of values about every nanosecond.

If amplitude modulation is not used but phase, frequency, and pulse modulation (1 billion pulses per second) are; would that make it more suitable for low power devices like mobile hotspots or satellite phones? Would that also lower the effects of ""rain fade"" or foliage? I am asking because amplitude modulation is supposedly the most prone to signal corruption. What are some techniques for preventing collision at 1 billion pulses per second on full duplex? Would this be compatible with the point to multipoint nature of satellite communications? If not, what adjustments should be made? For high power devices, will combining QAM, frequency modulation, and pulse modulation be worthwhile?

He’s an engineer, and I’ve listen to one of his interviews when we got back from US ( he studied and lives there) in my homecountry(Europe ) . Im so intrigued by him .

I'm planning on changing my major next semester to an engineering degree, but I cannot decide which engineering I should go for.

Currently my major is International Operations and Logistics Management. It is a business engineering degree. Even though I love business, I've noticed that I really couldn't care less about Logistics, and that my favorite aspects of my major where the engineering related ones.

Could you give me a recommendation based on the classes I enjoyed and what I want to do in the future please.

My favorite class by far was Technical design. We did technical drawings and had to work with CAD. I was pretty good at it and learned it fast and it was the first time in my life I was so hooked onto something that I forgot eating and taking a break for 11 hours straight.

I also love computer science. I once had to code an Online shop in high school and I loved it. I'd like my major to include programming.

I have nothing against maths. I quite enjoy it actually. We've had calculus 1 to 3 I guess. (all the basics in maths 1, then multivariable, differential equations, complex nr, integration, and Fourier in maths 2). I also liked our statistics class but I wouldn't want to do it for a profession.

I loved our Automation class. Now it was difficult to be honest but every class that is challenging ends up being my favorite. We used Visual components to simulate a logistics process. We had to do stuff like connecting the robots and setting sequences etc.

In the future I want to be able to develop my own stuff. I have many innovative ideas and I'd like to develop my own products. I'd also like to work in an environment where I don't have to strictly go in suits and be formal.

What I'm currently considering is

Mechanical engineering

Mechatronic engineering

Electrical engineering and information technology

Physical engineering

Computer engineering

7,Best Job Resources For Mechanical Engineers,1549393066,"Long story short, I was laid off a few months back. I had a hard time finding a full-time job that paid at least what I was making before the layoff and it was hard. I ended up working a temporary contractor gig doing similar work through a friend, but that is coming to an end. They were very clear this would not lead to a full-time position, so I don't hold it against them. I have been applying and interviewing during my employment here.

 I work in the east coast in New Hampshire/Massachusetts. Usually more in the southern NH border, but maybe northern MA. The unemployment in these areas is some of the lowest in the United States. I always see companies going to job fairs and looking for engineers or company executives talking about how they don't have enough engineers and need to hire.

I do not see this reflected in the industry for job openings. All the big job boards (indeed, linkedin, glassdoor, monster, careerbuilder, ziprecruiter, and LinkUp) all repeat the same few postings. So am I missing something? I'm using networking and available resources as well, and it just seems like it never gets past a phone interview, when I get that far,  despite them loving me on the phone.

40,Bouncing Forward when Dream Job isn't Working Out,1549341642,"I'm seeking advice on how to get over this despondence about navigating my dream job.

&amp;#x200B;

From June to January, I completed a co-op with a Fortune 500 themed entertainment company.  Prior to starting this role I was very excited to begin working in this industry and this co-op helped re-affirm my interest in wanting to continue working in this industry.  Unfortunately, my boss didn't want to extend my co-op for another 6 months, but I networked my way throughout the company to find more opportunities I could transition to.  I took opportunities to work for other engineers on different teams so I could prove to them what I could do, and I thought it was going great.  Our interests were aligning, and they seemed to be pleased with the work I was doing.  Unfortunately, 2 teams I worked closely with said they just didn't have enough work to do an extension, so I left the company with no further job prospects in early January.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been actively applying for other roles in the same industry.  One was a contractor who specializes in animatronics took great interest in me, and was ready to send me an offer letter, only to back out last minute because one of their more senior engineers suddenly became free and there was no need for me anymore.  Recently, I interviewed for another position with the same company I did my internship at, and today I got the bad news that someone else ""with more project experience was chosen"".  Right now, 2019 just hasn't started off right and it's because I feel like navigating my way to my dream job just isn't working out in my favor.

&amp;#x200B;

The themed entertainment industry feels relatively small compared to other industries like aerospace and medical devices, and right now I feel like my hopes for continuing to work in my dream job are lost because opportunities are rare.  It's not that I don't think I can ever go back to themed entertainment, but for my next job I'm just not excited to be working in another industry that I don't have much interest in.  I'm looking into medical devices and aerospace since those opportunities are prevalent in my area, and I used to work in medical devices before my co-op started, but after finding my way to a dream job only to end up getting pushed out of it, I feel this anxiety about having to go back to something that doesn't interest me.

&amp;#x200B;

Liking what I do is of big importance to me, and moving forward I just can't help but feel despondent that I am not going to like my next opportunity.

Stick with me this is weird. I'll post my questions at the bottom. I have a medical condition call chronic idiopathic urticaria angioedema. It is an allergic reaction to physical stimulus. I have solar, vibratory, and pressure urticaria. I'm allergic to UVb, vibrations, and large air pressure changes. It makes my ligaments swell up and push my joints apart, and is severely painful. I'm having trouble driving more than 40mins, and pushing a shopping cart. Memory foam pads, and shoes seem to make driving worse. Thicker socks, and a thin cotton pillow makes it a little better.

TL:DR Vibrations causes severe pain, and look for ways to make driving less painful.

1) What be the best way to dampen the most vibrations in a car? 

2) Is there something I can make to put on the steering wheel and pedals that would make vibrations transfer less, and wouldn't slip? 

3) Is there some type of material I could put on my shoes/gloves that would transfer less vibrations?

4) Is there a way to make a test what range of vibrations I'm sensitive to at home?

5) If I can't mod my car and need a new one. I know each modern car comes out with a long list of technical data that I don't understand. Is there something in that info that has to do with cab vibrations? Is there an easy way to compare this info between cars?

43,Leaving a job due to work culture?,1549332987,"I am currently a few years into my career (mechanical engineer) and am considering leaving my current company due to what I see as a toxic work culture/environment. The boss clearly views the job as the most important thing in his life, and expects his employees to do the same. PTO is lacking (no personal time, and vacation is sub-par). Every minute of the day must be productive and accounted for. Any overtime is seen as ""part of the job"" and is not compensated - not to mention that the standard, minimum work week is already over 40 hours. Although it is a very small company, it doesn't come with most of the typical small company perks.

While I understand that this type of work environment may be fitting for some personality types, I would much rather work in a place that doesn't view its employees as machines from which to squeeze the maximum profitability. Where socializing, or taking short breaks to refresh throughout the day, is encouraged rather than seen as a waste of man-hours. Where some flexibility for family or just life can be accommodated.

Is this a pipe dream, or do engineering companies like this exist?  How can you effectively gauge the culture of the company prior to working there?

I also have a newfound interest in metrology.  I started thinking about how things like flatness could be verified and how engineers of olde might have done it before the commonness of surface plates and precision straight edges.  It got me wondering why a tightened string couldn't be used in this capacity, or maybe to what extent it could be used.  At first it seemed like an obvious solution, but then I realized there's probably always going to be a degree of deflection, and since I've never come across this idea as a solution, I assumed there was a big flaw in it.  So I was wondering how this might be posed as an engineering problem.  Given a known material, length and tension for the string (piano wire?), could the deflection caused by gravity be calculated?  Would holding the wire normal to gravity allow for the idea to actually work or would there still be other factors preventing it from being a useful reference?

I have dreamed of the day I could start a new life on the east coast after receiving both my undergraduate and masters degrees from the same university. However, watching my savings account diminish-requiring me to find part-time work to stabilize, becoming concerned about the growing gap in my employment history, receiving no positive hits in my locations of choice, and the growing six figure debt looming over me, I have gotten a little desperate.

Driven mostly by my feelings of desperation, and the pragmatism of living in an area with a low cost of living, I sent in an application locally. I had a phone interview the next day, and an in-person the next week. I was surprised when I left the interview impressed and intrigued. The company is, techy, young and has great growth potential. Additionally, the opportunity to diversify my portfolio after a few years appears streamlined. The company was acquired last year by a fortune 500 with foreign and domestic assets. All of this led me to accepting a second round interview despite my hesitations..

I learned more about the role, the company's goals and the people who work there in the second round. Most of my initial impressions felt validated. A few days later I was extended an offer.

The company offers a competitive benefits package, an above average salary, and wants to start me in a mid-level roll. I am looking for all this-- however, for the longest time, I have been imagining it to be somewhere new. Sometimes, it was all that would drive me.

As I begin leaning into this, I can hardly keep my body and mind from repudiating. My mind and soul yell at me not to stay in my college town for another couple years. I can hear myself assert that I can have a really great job working somewhere new.

I feel stuck between a life I fantasize about and a great opportunity to begin my career.

Any and all thoughts would be welcomed.

53,I have ideas for infrared laser link that is wireless. What limits would be encountered? What modifications should be implemented?,1549322520,"For background, I did research on fiber optic communications. Over long distances, it uses pulses to encode digital values. This and Free Space Optics inspired some ideas I thought of.

The full duplex system will only use pulses. This is different from radio communications in which waves are encoded using adjustments amplitude, phase, and frequency. The unit will have four IR laser beams and four large photo diodes that only allow the specific frequency range to pass. Two beams will be used 0's and the other two will be used for 1's. This is to allow 2 bits per pulse one way. A solution to interruptions to the beam is to use more than one link.

My concern with adding QAM to this is the reduction of useful distance.

How many pulses per second are possible with fiber optic lines? How would this compare to what is theoretically possible with an over the air IR beam (and after adjuesting for error correction)? Do fiber optic lines use QAM in addition to pulses? Is it possible to make an IR wireless beam system that transfers data in the terabit range and travel across 2000 km (such as from the Aleutian Islands to mainland Alaska).

Thanks in advance for any help/pointers you may have! 

I have a system that consists of a 2x1/16x12"" bar of material supported by 1 inch circular supports on either end. These supports attach to the bar via a {washer-damping material-bar-damping material-circular support} sandwich compressed by a screw. A transducer oscillates the bar via a force normal to the bar/supports centralized at the midpoint of the bar. 

Now, I need to measure how well various materials are at damping the bar after the oscillation is removed and/or how well the systems absorbs an impulse (I have a way to measure the bar's oscillation over time). The way I see the system there are three key components:

1. How heavy the bar is
2. How flexible the bar is
3. How damped the bar is at either end

The biggest struggle I am having right now is how to characterize the damping ability of either end of the bar. I don't really have any restrictions as to what kind of material would be used to damp the oscillation and I would like to try several to find the best stuff for the job. Is there a material property that would be directly applicable for this kind of measurement? A combination of properties? Is there a handy table that has this property(s) tabulated for various materials?

I've not had a lot of linear experiences in my life and I look forward to changing that with a formal academic background. Unfortunately I'm not initiated in the professional world and my social network lacks resources for my inquiries. 

I'm working on an EET AS before using the overlap credits to get a Engineering transfer at a local community college.

I see a developing/expanding market abroad for work in renewables and drones. Lacking legacy infrastructure and rapidly industrializing/modernizing there are financial incentives to get off oil and create new logistical networks. Most if not all of you already know about the many uses of drones in agriculture, surveying, etc. but recently I've seen investment in the use of drones as long distance delivery as well as data transmission. These aspects are generating a lot of interest in countries with large mountain ranges or vast expansive wetlands. My ultimate goal is fieldwork and I'd prefer to work my way into consulting or working directly for companies based around these concepts.   


I'm interested in getting a Masters, as I'm starting the academic game late and have experience in leading projects as well as training individuals. I'm very likeable but do not posses the particular set of social skills to exist inside a fishbowl type environment for years on end. I'm not shy about remote work or harsh environments. I lived in the Interior of Alaska for years without running water. Right now I'm studying component level electronics which is a lot of fun. I want to believe understanding the basic construction will be useful down the road when it comes to maintaining machines and/or power systems.   


The BSEE is a given but are there minors to be considered for power management? For drones I assume a lot of software/coding knowledge, RF... really I'd like to know if anyone who reads this has experience working in South America as both an engineer and US citizen.

69,Should I wait to apply for P.E. or apply now? (Georgia),1549299379," 

I have been looking for a while for a set list of requirements for applying to sit for the State of Georgia P.E. exam. I understand passing F.E. is a requirement, which I have done, however, I am a little confused on the experience part. I read 4 years of experience on a forum. Is this 4 years experience after obtaining EIT?

What is everyone's experience with applying? I graduated from ABET accredited school and have been working under a P.E. here at my current job for 2 years. Also, my internships (also working under P.E.) during college but before obtaining EIT, add up to another 2.5 years.

During both internships I was working under a P.E. and I can obtain the 5 recommendations with 3 being registered P.E. I am considering applying but am not sure if I should wait another 2 years to have the 4 years experience after EIT.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! I am in the Electrical Industry.",AskEngineers,False,IllConsideration0,/r/AskEngineers/comments/an3lvz/should_i_wait_to_apply_for_pe_or_apply_now_georgia/

71,Need career advice - waiting to hear back from interview,1549296628,"I hope this is okay to post here &amp; I apologize for the length (just want to have all the details &amp; background)
 
I am on my first year of my career, graduated on May 2018. I accepted an offer with the company that I last interned with but the position required me to move 10 hours away from home. At first everything was great – I loved my new city, made some friends, &amp; just really enjoyed my position. After about 4-5 months, my mom started having some serious health issues &amp; since I am far away from home, it has been extra difficult for me. This sent me into a deep depressive state. Once the new year started, I decided I would start applying to entry-level positions back home.
 
At one of the companies I applied at, I had an internal referral from a HS friend and within two days I had my first “interview” scheduled. This was just a quick 30 min screening with the recruiter but I was fully honest with her as to why I wanted to move back home (my mom’s health). She told me what the requirements were for the position, asked about my experience in relation to these requirement, told me about their hiring process &amp; asked what I was expecting for salary. The screening ended well with her saying that I would pass to the next phase – a formal phone interview with the position manager.
 
About a week after this screening, the position manager assistant contacted me to schedule the interview with him. We scheduled the interview for 2 days later and he asked about very specific general questions. What was my favorite project, if I’ve had a leadership experience, to expand on my senior design project &amp; he also asked why I want to move back home. When he asked about my favorite project, I mentioned something that is on my resume &amp; he responded with “I’m glad you mentioned that, it was something that I was going to ask you about”. Overall, I thought the interview with him would be a bit more technical but I felt good about it. He ended the call with “Well I’ll talk to [the recruiter] &amp; I’m sure she’ll be in contact with you in the next couple of days”
 
It has been about 1.5 weeks since I spoke with him or heard anything from them. I really enjoy the company’s vision &amp; the description of the position. The HS friend that referred me hasn’t heard anything but she’s also in their marketing department, not engineering. What should I do? Keep waiting? Contact them?

I have dreamed of the day I could start a new life on the east coast after receiving both my undergraduate and masters degrees from the same university. However, watching my savings account diminish, and needing to find part-time work below my degree's market value and my credentials, becoming increasingly concerned about the growing gap in my employment history, receiving no positive hits in my locations of choice, and the growing, near six figure debt looming over me, I have gotten a little more desperate.

I accepted an interview in my area-- mostly due to my growing feelings of desperation, and the pragmatism of living in an area with a low cost of living relative to the quality of life it offers-- and I left impressed by the company. I found the company to be very interesting. It is small, techy, young and has an exceedingly high growth potential. Additionally, the scope of work for the position is skill-laden, challenging, and diverse. Lastly, the company was acquired last year by a fortune 500 company with foreign and domestic assets; therefore, the opportunity to diversify my portfolio after a few years exists. All of this led me to accepting a second round interview despite my hesitations..

The second round interview mostly validated my initial impressions. A few days later I was extended an offer.

The company offers a competitive benefits package, an above average salary, and is willing to start me in an above entry level role given my qualifications. This is exactly what I was looking for-- except almost anywhere else.

As I begin leaning into this, I can hardly keep my body and mind from repudiating me. My mind and soul yells at me not to stay in my college town for another couple years. I hear it telling me I can have my dream of working at a rockstar company in a location of my choice. My mind then begins to make me ask if I am settling because ""things are hard right now"".

98,Determining Material Cross Section For The Layman,1549244262,"Hi engineers!
Looking for some direction here. I'm in the entertainment field, and as a rigger I'm tasked with load calculations for our temporary installations. To sum up our job, we use chain hoists to suspend various types of truss that carry lights and other equipment, and we need to know the load that each hoist(anchor) is putting on the building.

We use engineered aluminum box truss, and the manufacturer provides tables with acceptable UDL and point loads over various spans (Usually up to 40' at 10' increments.) That table also lists deflection. Here's a typical chart: [Load Table](https://www.christielites.com/file_uploads/Spec_378_Load%20Table%20-%2012%20Inch%20Truss%20-%20CL.pdf)


Typical practice in our industry is completely archaic. We generally use some variation of an excel sheet to determine the loads based on distance from each anchor. 

I would like to get away from this and use engineering software like iBeams Pro for Mac. Unfortunately, truss manufacturers typically won't provide their cross-section data, which makes programs like this less useful. Is there a way to calculate the cross-section information with only the chart I posted above? We don't really need to be more accurate that +/-10 lbs in our calculations, but I'd like to be as accurate as possible! Also, what anchor type is most appropriate for this situation? It seems like a roller anchor is most similar to the chain hoist, since horizontal movement is essentially frictionless in our situation.

Is there a Primer you can recommend? I have a textbook on Statics, but it is far more advanced than what applies here.

TL/DR Can I use the given load tables to determine the engineering cross-section to use in beam calculators.

The recruiter is pissed and the local management didn't seem happy when I called for an update. I have reached out once a week and this week will be 4 weeks of waiting on an interview that I was told would come in just a few days.

32,Should I quit the Aerospace Industry to work in Oil and Gas? (Repost ),1549151787," 

Okay Long story short, I intern for Northrop Grumman. I make $27 an hour, however, I am a dual citizen which means I can't get far in the company since I need clearance. There's lots of work for people without clearance but it's not as interesting as the cleared work. My starting salary is projected to be 72-76K a year.

I have been applying to other internships despite working at Northrop and I got an offer for a local refinery, they're paying $40 an hour which is 76k a year just as an intern. But they're only 500 employees and they recently had an explosion, which caused them to fail and they were recently acquired by a larger company known as PBF energy. 

The Oil and Energy industry is risky, I understand that. However, I heard refineries were pretty stable, it was the fracking and drilling that is risky. I am interested in energy and some of my favorite classes were thermodynamics and powerplant design. 

I would like to accept the offer but I feel like It's not is a very risky thing. I feel the industry would crash as soon as I enter it. I'm scared of being laid off. Is it worth quitting my secure aerospace job or is taking a risk in the oil and gas industry worth it? They pay extremely nice and I'm interested in it afraid of the risk.

I wish to remain as **low level (C / C++), hardware oriented and bare metal as possible**. I would like to have a path that has a good amount of research and has a good number of jobs in the market.

I wish to do RF to because I have experience in Analog and Digital Communication (got an A for both modules). DSP also seems a lucrative career to me. Is DSP a good career choice? I don't have much knowledge in RF though like the jobs etc. Are people still hired for designing satellites?

If this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know. I will be asking [r/EngineeringStudents](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents) as well, but was hoping to hear from some professional engineers with experience in these topics.

I am an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering, currently trying to decide whether or not to take up a second degree (not a double major) in Electrical Engineering. All that I have to do for this is to take three EE courses as CE electives. There is no additional coursework as I will technically be taking the same amount of credits either way. I am also able to pick up a math minor by taking just one additional math course.

My instinct on the math minor is to go for it, as I enjoy math and the extra work is minimal. I am undecided on the double degree. I'm just not sure how much sense it makes. The idea of the double degree appeals to me and I am very interested in the content of both the EE and CE curriculum. However, even though it requires no extra coursework, I wonder if those three electives could somehow serve me better as CE courses.

Does  anyone have experience with CE/EE double degrees? If so, how have they served you? How about with a math minor? Would you say these are worth it in terms of career, or simply in terms of knowledge? Any opinions/insight on these topics would be much appreciated.

64,"I’ve received a very good offer, need help to evaluate my adv and dis",1549057643,"Good day to you all!

I’ve been working for a major national oil company in Russia. I’ve been pretty much raised here from 0. I was head-hunted out of uni from UK, and now have experience of a year and a half. My major is a reservoir engineer and I mainly do a lot of modeling as well as make decision on future development of the field and wells. The job is super interesting and I like it. However I overwork like a dog, get paid very little but god do I develop my skills fast. 

We are a daughter of the major and our specific company is not too strong, have liquidity in staff, people leaving on a yearly basis, projects get left without finishing. Staff doesn’t get treated too well, and gets so much work out on them, many break. 

There’s a big but. Because I am very different to others (I speak perfect English, and I think a lot outside the box cus of where I studied) the company is developing and pushing me through the career ladder the fastest way they possibly can. I’ve been promoted 4 levels in a year, where usually it takes a year for each. I bring results, I bring ideas, and I promote our projects to international customers, which was never done before. I’m being sent on many conferences, to every single meeting and blah blah. To conclude, all this is done by the director of the company, he spotted me immediately and is not letting go. He sent me to a young specialist national conference where I got first place, the first time for 20 years in our company. He basically saw the potential in me and is now training me to lead projects. Mind you I am 23, but I learn fast.

Now, recently we went to a meeting where we had a service company promote their products, there were English people, who were translated. Obviously I showed off that I need no translation and everyone caught their eye on it. During the meeting our director said to them “come see us in our office we have a new approach towards your products”. Short-long, they come to our office I show them the way I have modeled their products and potential modeling which can solve million dollar projects (all in development btw). They lose their head, say omg, how, when, where. And a day after they call me for an interview.

The interview was nothing on the technicals because during the previous meeting we spoke on technical terms for like 3 hours. I got a verbal offer immediately and a verbal salary almost 2.5 times (even with my current promotion). The job is about selling their products, out of office 80% of the time, meeting with companies like us and basically promote it all, you know it. This is something I’m very good at, people say I’m born to sell, I can speak to anyone under any situation and it’s the reason why I’m being promoted too here, I get out of any difficult situation. 

Now, my director knows he can’t keep me forever, because I’m growing fast and educate myself, and he knows companies approach me and to be honest gets upset, because my company cannot offer me salaries like others can. He said he knows one day I will leave, but said promise me you will warn me 6 months in advance (he said this literally last week...), because his previous very smart and ambitious colleague left on 2 week notice and things went bad. Still have effects 6 months later. 

There obviously much much more. But the crux is that I’m currently working for a gov company which doesn’t treat people too well, and quality of projects not perfect etc. but I like the progression and I know if I stay here, by 30 I will be making towards very high salary and will be at the top of the company. But I also know with my ambitions and knowledge I can grow fast at the other company, but slower, much slower, and because it’s international company, they probably won’t let me be let’s say the commercial director. Where as in my company, easily. Also big factor, in my company I will always work like a slave and come home stressed, and in other company I will be relaxed, do what I am amazing at, but maybe not see such good career ladder. 

I know everyone says it’s your decision to make, all I want is your opinion guys. I have heard some people say, leave don’t even think about it, some say stay you will be valued and you will get your money later. And if I do decide to leave, it will only be after 6 months, because I cannot let my company down and especially my director after he has been pushing me through all this. Also to add, I gave them my word that the first year of work with them I won’t send no resumes and won’t leave them, I kept my word, and only time I went to interviews is when I was invited, though I rejected many. But I feel like I can’t do this forever.

Thanks!!!

65,Grow in current job or accept job at NASA?,1549056541,"I posted this somewhere else but I think this is a better place to ask:

Really need advice. Right before the gov shutdown I was offered an entry level direct hire position at NASA. The next day the government shut down and I of course did not expect to hear anything back until it reopened. Now that it has reopened and in lieu of the shutdown altogether, is it a good idea to accept a civil servant position? Some more things to consider

* I started my current job 6 months ago with a $5000 sign on bonus, $2000 relocation fee, and they paid for $5000 in tuition for my masters. If I leave I anticipate having to pay back the tuition reimbursement for sure, and possibly the sign on and relocation bonuses

* My current salary is 73k, with bonuses it ended up being 80k. This new position would be a 50% pay cut, my salary would be 45k.

* My fiancé signed on a new job so he won’t be able to move for at least a year

* NASA is my dream job, I want to work in the space industry (currently I am not). I have had previous internships with them and my connections were a large part of why I got this offer. It is with the same department I had interned with.

at my current job there are huge opportunities for growth as an engineer. I am being trained for management type roles and already have a lot of influence in decisions. I feel most people do not have this opportunity in their first job. I am wondering whether I can grow further in this role and reapply to NASA as an even better candidate or for a more advanced position? What is growth and promotion within NASA like or is better to grow outside the company and reapply? What are the possibilities of getting a civil servant offer again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having cold feet about moving to Seattle. It's an incredible opportunity. I've spoken to the Contracting Agency multiple times. Turns out it's an 18 month opportunity but it can be cut short to 12 months if performance is not up to the mark. I still want to make the move and try out the opportunity. I know contractors will not get the juicy design work and effort to prove your worth to the manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am at a crossroads. I am getting design work but it's not substantial. I want to own the overall board project (Schematic design, oversee layout, production) but after a terrible experience with a senior engineer (hard ass) that was supposed to get me up to speed but blocked me from getting the work that I want. Do I attempt to fix things by showing my worth by working hard and asking for projects? Or do I move on from this and go to Seattle?

&amp;#x200B;

Going to Seattle would give me a clean slate. I can start over with everyone. However, leaving from my company in Toronto makes me feel like I am giving up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Toronto - Full Time, pays less, getting design work like bread crumbs. My plan is to ask the manager what he sees me doing in the group. If I'm doing these small design tasks here and there, I'm leaving. I'll have to slide salary matching in there somehow :P. Need a SUBSTANTIAL raise for this to be possible. But I'm weighing design work over pay at the moment. It will be 2 years of working in this group in 6/7 months. The actual design work may not even come until 1 to 2 years later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Seattle - Contract, possibility to convert to Full Time after 18 months, better company, better pay and possibility of design work but I'm not sure exactly what. The manager did mention that it is a system level team that requires knowledge of subsystems that contribute to the overall system. E.g. Multiple subsystems such as Display, Power, High Speed Interfaces (PC. He wants go-getters that ask for work and get it done with quality and accuracy.

Is this still the case? The car i'm getting won't have a GPS so if the fin is only useful for that (other than being better looking) i don't see a reason for the purchase.

Can anyone tell me what type of hardware this is? I am working on a hinge design and can't seem to find what I need. Basically, the idea is that there are two pieces of sheet metal that pivot around this hardware. The hardware has a hole through it for another pin to go through. Both ends are flanged to keep the two sheet metal pieces together. I have looked at rivets but can't find a type that seems to work, or I can't find the right name of what I need.

Is there hardware that can be installed like a rivet - where one end is crimped?

OR is there something that has two pieces and is either threaded or otherwise fastened? 

This part needs to be fairly strong, yet not too tight as to prevent the two bent sheet metal pieces of the hinge to turn.

Here's the situation, I can stay on and my pay will rise to £39000 next year (but I'll be in a job I'm not excited to come to everyday), I also have an offer for a prestigious Civil service position (the Engineering Fast stream https://www.faststream.gov.uk/science-engineering/ ) which might be more interesting or could be the same as what I have at the minute. OR I'm really interested in cyber security and informatics and I've seen an Edinburgh uni MSc I can apply for with a scholarship I could apply for which would pay for it, but this is risky because I'd be giving up an actual job and job security to do it.

48,What are possible career pathways with Engineering Technology degree?,1548911067,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry in advance if this a bit scrambled.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a dilemma with where my career is going. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working in manufacturing for 7 years now. This has been split pretty evenly between doing automotive CNC production work as a Set Up Technician and job shop/tool and die on the EDM side of things, both setup, operation and programming. I also travelled a little bit (6 monthes) doing field service engineering work for a large CNC machine tool company. One area I wish I would have had the opportunity to get into is true 5 axis milling or using turn mill machines.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2013 I graduated local community college with my AAS in Manufacturing Technology, as well as certificates in both CNC Machinist and CAM technologist. I have a few more classes at community college before I am ready to transfer about 90 credits to university to pursue my BS Mechanical Engineering technology degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoy many of the aspects of manufacturing and engineering including machining, automation, and the CNC machines themselves. I find working on the parameters and intricate parts of the controllers and machines fascinating. I like working with my hands but don't want to be 50 or 60 years old and have a broken down body and can barely move like some of the guys I currently work with.

&amp;#x200B;

Here lays my dilemma. What kind of jobs are there to have with this degree (BSMET) and experience? I have read on here and other forums that any degree with ""technology"" at the end is worth the same in the job market whether it be a 2 or 4 year one. Should I continue finishing my BS? Or should I stay at community college and get into mechatronics and other classes that could be applied towards learning things like PLC and the robotic side of stuff and CNC repair? Which skill set would employers find more valuable? 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the metro Detroit area so there seems to be a good mix of job availability, but I have always envisioned working for a large aviation company such as Boeing or Lockheed Martin. I understand I would most likely have to relocate for these opportunities. Will a BSMET degree get me into one of these types of companies doing work that I have mentioned I am interested in? I really would like to find a mix of making good money and doing something that I like. I have found I put in much more effort and an overall better performance when I enjoy my work. I guess I am sick of having just a job instead of a career and am looking for some type of guidance.

I recently graduated with a mechanical engineering Degree. Got a job offer for a control system technician position at Johnson Controls.  I need some advice on if thats a good position to start in. 

Im not very into the hvac industry but wouldnt mind going into the design/consulting hvac field. Would a technician position be a good experience to have for transferring?
I’ve been looking to get into an analysis (FEA/CAD) type of position or some military research facilities which is very different from this job so im worried if i take this it would hinder me from transferring industry later on. 

Currently I’m waiting on a decision for a research position role that would pay more and be in the field im looking for. But theres no guarantee I’ll get it (could be 2/3 weeks until i hear the decision). The technician offer will need to be decided on in a couple of days.

Learning controls and understanding how the utility operates at a low level is a skill I'd like to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on a project that uses MOSFETs to switch heater cartridges on/off for a 3D printer. I have a 24V, 13A power supply with the V+ passing into 4 cartridge heaters in parallel, from the heaters into the drain of 2 MOSFETs in parallel, and out through the source of these MOSFETs back into the V- of the power supply. Here is a diagram: [https://imgur.com/a/baaFb95](https://imgur.com/a/baaFb95)

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if it is not great, I do not have an electrical background and this is all new to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a separate 12V power supply which goes into Vin on an Arduino which switches the gates of the MOSFETs. I have the V- terminals of the two power supplies connected because I have been told that it is important to keep the reference ground equal for all components. I am having an issue where the MOSFETs are getting extremely hot very quickly, and there is only a 14V voltage drop across the heaters rather than the around 20V I expected. It is like the voltage drop across the two MOSFETs is too high.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to solve this I tried connecting a separate cable immediately after the heaters (before the MOSFETs) directly into the ground of the Arduino which resulted in a 20V voltage drop across the heaters and the MOSFETs were much less hot. Thinking about it now, I should not have done this because the voltage after the heaters should not be at ground until after passing through the MOSFETs. Anyway, I tried it again a few hours later and the cable immediately burnt up because of the high current passing through into the Arduino ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know what the problem could be that is causing the MOSFETs to get so hot from my diagram? And an additional question, when the V- terminals and the Arduino ground are all connected together to have a reference ground of 0V, how can I be sure that the high current from the 24V supply that passes through the heaters is going back to the V- terminal of the 24V supply, and not the Arduino's ground? As the Arduino can only handle low currents couldn't this cause problems?

I know the Red Cinema cameras uses lossy compression on its RAW format. I also know Long GOP raises the quantity of calculations required for coding and decoding.

If the codec is HEVC then it's possible to use 12 bits per channel for Long GOP but 14 or 16 bits only allows intra frame. If the device is very small, then it's only feasible to use 12 bit ADC. A workaround is to use logarithmic or gamma compressed ADC.

22,Should I study a BEng even though I would like to work in a technician role?,1548798360,"I'd like to study electrical engineering but i'm not sure as to whether i should go to college and study there for 2 years (which would earn me a HNC/ HND (UK), equivalent to an associates degree in the USA (i think)), or go to university and spend 4 years completing a BEng. I would like my next job to be working as a wind turbine technician.

I can definitely see myself moving into design and innovation within the wind energy sector, and into a variety of other fields (like solar or hydro, and i'd like to work in providing/ distributing power within developing countries eventually), but the main reason for wanting to study it at degree level is that i absolutely LOVE the subject (i was enrolled in college last year but had to withdraw for a personal reason) and studying it at degree level would mean that i'd gain a much stronger, deeper understanding of the subject.

On the other hand, i'm still young (22 and i already have a degree in a non-engineering field), it might be too big a jump into engineering, and perhaps i should study at college, then work, and then go to university to build on that knowledge i've gained through practical working experience. I'd also like to know, might having a degree have a negative impact on my application when applying for a technician role given that i'm arguably ""over-qualified"" - i personally don't think it would but i've heard others say that it could. Additionally, i've heard that electrical engineering at degree level veers to the design side, whereas at college you're taught the subject on a more practical sense, so having a degree might not even prepare you for a practical role (though i suppose that's the case for ANY job, you always need to be trained wherever you are).

The thing is, i am currently working a fantastic job in the renewable energy sector (specifically, recycling and waste treatment) and i'm pretty sure my employer would be willing to let me go to university (there's a university which provide a part-time degree requiring attendance of one day per week) since the degree would actually be of benefit to my work.

This might be more of a mathematics question, but I asked it here because I thought an engineer's perspective might be useful.

On a 2012 Dodge Caravan I found it was actually driving about 50% farther than the MPG and DTE suggest. With more testing I noticed that it was not including the mileage when I'm coasting down a hill and not actually using fuel. I can reproduce the problem by resetting the average MPG at the top of a hill, the average will say 0 MPG the whole way down until it gets a reading below 99 to use in it's average calculation. If I reset the MPG going up the hill, it immediately starts calculating the new MPG.

This throws off the MPG significantly where I live because it is a very hilly area. There are more hills than flat space, so the car is constantly either climbing a hill or coasting down it. The car says it gets 19 MPG average, but counting the miles I actually drive it's getting closer to 30.

I'm currently trying to design a dampening system for electronics in a rocket (relatively low powered, expected apogee is ~10k feet.) As someone who doesn't have much experience in designing these sorts of things, I'm finding it difficult to know where to start. My current plan is to attach a dashpot and spring to both sides of the electronics, but I'm lost as to how to select the parameters for both the spring and the dashpot in order to minimize vibrations. These parameters don't need to be perfect, just a starting point from which to optimize, but advice on ballparking the necessary numbers would be helpful.

Additionally, I'll eventually be getting data on the vibration modes of the rocket, and some flight data of undamped vibrations. How can I go about using these to optimize the parameters of my damping system?

61,"How to DIY an accelerometer to measure waveform of sex toys? (No, seriously)",1548733858,"The title is a weird one, and hey, I guess the project is too, but I'm hoping to get some direction if possible! I already posted this to r/askelectronics and they directed me here—I consider this to be all SFW and above-board, but it is technically an *adult topic* so proceed with caution if you don't want to read about, like, dilds 'n junk. To skip backstory, begin reading at the bolded text. Thanks so much!

\~

So I have no engineering experience whatsoever. I'm employed at a sex toy boutique that focuses on high quality, body-safe products. It's an interesting job and I really enjoy helping customers &amp; working in such a specialized field. Because so much of the work is about product knowledge, I have found myself pretty curious about the mechanics of the toys—how their material changes their feel, how brands vary in construction, what's the difference between motors, etc. I'm sure rotary motors are super basic to you all but I hadn't really explored them before, so I did what any good employee would do: take some cheap vibrators from the free box and smash them open in my living room.

I relearned what I'm sure a few months of eleventh-grade physics taught me some years ago, and figured out that the weight on the motor affects the amplitude of its waveform, which determines how ""buzzy"" or ""rumbly"" the toy feels to the touch (we use these two descriptors a LOT when talking about toys. Generally rumbly/high-amplitude vibrations indicate a more expensive motor and are associated with higher quality toys) while the frequency is determined by the speed of rotation. Okay, cool, gotcha. *BUT*, I wondered, blissfully unaware of how wildly unqualified I am, *what if I could definitively measure the waveform of any given toy?* Now, it's not necessary information to do my job; I'm sure most of my customers couldn't care less. But I love the idea of having quantifiable data for these toys that I could visualize, cross-reference, and share with fellow sex dorks/educators. The only issue is that I have no clue where to begin.

**So, how do I make an in-home accelerometer that can measure the waveform of a given vibrator?**

There are some constraints beyond my ignorance, of course. Sex sells, but I still work retail, so I can't afford to break everything open just to test it. And even then, breaking the toy open would skew the data, since the material that the motor is housed in will inevitably dampen/alter the vibration somehow. I know there are vibration meters that can indicate faults in industrial machinery but those are really expensive and don't seem to fit my purpose. The VibSensor iPhone app was good for preliminary experiments, but weight of the phone itself ruins the data. I looked into an Arduino-based solution, which seems the most promising, but all the vibration sensor modules for Arduino seem to detect only whether vibration is present and they don't actually take measurements. My partner works in IT and does some coding, so if there are more advanced Arduino builds out there we might be able to set something up... maybe. I'm picturing something with one or more sensors that could attach to the toy, but I have no clue if that's feasible. I've also got a macbook, if that's relevant.

Any ideas or resources would be hugely appreciated! I know this sounds silly but I'm genuinely trying to learn.

62,Thoughts on approach to negotiating high starting salary and raises,1548733005,"I was told long ago to always negotiate hard when starting a new job. It's the best chance you have to make the most impact on compensation. So I've always done this. 

I wonder sometimes if it's the best strategy. I've changed companies several times now, and it usually goes like this.

1. negotiate my ass off 
2. get a large pay increase (20-30%) to go to new company
3. get 0% or 1% raise for a few years because I maxed out their pay band and I'm not up front in line for a promotion, others with more experience at same level etc...
4. get frustrated with it even though logically I'm probably ahead of others with savings etc. there's just something psychologically disappointing about getting excellent reviews and no raise.
5. get job offer at a different company
6. repeat

I'm on my fourth company now, just got another sub-inflation raise which spurred this post.The amount of times I've heard ""well, you negotiated really well coming in so""... makes the whole annual review process feel meaningless, would prefer to just avoid them.

2,On a strange pattern of beeps from a low battery heat alarm,1548682539,"There's a heat alarm in my kitchen that started beeping to indicate low charge and, being lazy university students, we didn't bother changing the battery. It became apparent to us that the interval between beeps wasn't regular so, naturally, we spent a few hours that afternoon noting the interval times in seconds between beeps to arrive at the following two datasets (there was a 3 minute gap between datasets) of interval in seconds:

(40, 133, 264, 132, 444, 349, 86, 45, 46, 218, 43, 221, 216, 354, 54, 121, 221, 263, 44)

(41, 88, 483, 88, 90, 132, 43, 352, 263, 354, 923, 1095, 216, 89, 305, 45, 352, 44, 263, 309, 450, 219, 660)

Now at first this may seem almost random, and indeed when plotted no obvious pattern emerges. But on inspection one very interesting property emerges - when divided by 44, the data sets (merged now) become this:

(0.9091, 3.0227, 6.0000, 3.0000, 10.0909, 7.9318, 1.9545, 1.0227, 1.0455, 4.9545, 0.9773, 5.0227, 4.9091, 8.0455, **1.2273**, **2.7500**, 5.0227, 5.9773, 1.0000, 0.9318, 2.0000,10.9773, 2.0000, 2.0455, 3.0000, 0.9773, 8.0000, 5.9773, 8.0455, 20.9773, **24.8864**, 4.9091, 2.0227, 6.9318, 1.0227, 8.0000, 1.0000, 5.9773, 7.0227, **10.2273**, 4.9773, 15.0000)

Where it appears all except the bolded values are within human timing error of integers - in other words each interval is some apparently random multiple of 44 seconds. Beyond that there still appears to be no obvious pattern, either from one beep to the next or the frequency table of these integers - they don't appear to be Poisson though.

Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this behaviour? I don't have a strong enough background in electronics to really theorise on it. One other thing to note is that subsequently over many hours the intervals became increasingly long and erratic, indicating this pattern is probably the result of a failing timing component. Thanks!

1. Select an appropriate RTD temperature sensor for this system – justifying your reasons for choosing it.

3. Calculate the current through the temperature sensor. How is this related to the power dissipation factor of the sensor?

The output from the sensor is to be fed into an A/D converter, which has an input range of 0 to 10V. If the sensor is placed in a remote location, select an appropriate type of amplifier for this system and justify your reasons for choosing the amplifier. Calculate the required gain.

12,What is this grease?,1548658813,"[Picture of the grease](https://imgur.com/cR8wnkR)  


 

I have a puzzle I've been trying to solve for awhile; **What kind of grease do airsoft manufacturer**'s  use in their guns. The manufacturer's (Generally East-Asia factories)  of these guns aren't really known for high QC, so the assumption is that  the grease is extremely cheap, low-quality stuff. The hobby community  always recommends to **remove and replace** the factory grease, but whenever I press them on it it turns out they **don't actually know what the grease is** or what's wrong with it.

So in the picture is a zinc-alloy gearbox out of an airsoft gun and there's, what looks like two kinds of grease:

\-One for a set of **sintered steel gears** with **nylon** bushings

\-One for a compression system with **Nylon** and **Buna-N parts**.

The grease is **very thick** and has a **metallic smell at room temperature**. When I heat it with a butane torch it **melts into a liquid**, but **doesn't burn** and doesn't bubble. There's also very little white smoke, although it starts to have a slight motor oil smell to it.

Is  there any other kind of tests I can do? I remember smelling a tube of  an anti-corrosive grease years ago that smelled similar, but I can't  remember what the name of it is.

50,Searching for non-military aerospace work or alternatives to aerospace?,1548564386,"So I'm in a bad, confusing spot with goals that are nearly not achievable at this point in time. I graduated at the end of 2017 with a BS in aerospace from a great school with a so-so GPA and got a job six months later at a local software company that does aerospace work. The problem is that as a third semester engineering student, I blindly declared my major as aerospace without actually looking at job prospects; somehow, I was ignorant to how defense-heavy the field was until it was too late for me to change my major without having to add at least another year to my education, so I just went with it. Unsurprisingly, I ended up working a job in defense. It's been over six months working there and I am more disenchanted by it with each passing day. Let's just say I am incompatible with strictly working in defense. Guys, I just wanted to do space stuff.

I'm doing a master's program part-time in space systems engineering to move me closer to my actual career goal, but there's still plenty of time left until I complete that program. In the meantime I want to move onto another job ASAP. I'm currently in the midwest but I'd like to move back to the greater NYC area where my family lives because my mental health isn't great having to be so far away. It's not a hotbed for aerospace companies compared to the west coast and southeast, but there are still some opportunities there. The problem with that is a lot of the smaller companies are strictly defense contractors, which I'm trying to move away from. I submitted applications for larger companies that have different areas of work (Lockheed Martin, P&amp;W, etc.) and random startups but I'm still waiting on responses and I don't feel that comfortable sitting at only 30 apps sent.

Now for the questions:   
1) How can I more easily find a non-defense job in the area I want, or what are good industries I could get into with an aerospace degree? My program was kinda like a jack of all trades thing, where we dabbled in software, circuits, robotics, and computer modeling, so I know the basics of many things but not at a level that companies find attractive.   
2) I am interested in doing work with climate data as an alternative and I studied climate on the side at school, so it's actually something I have moderate experience with. I'm just having trouble searching for those types of jobs because searching ""climate data,"" ""climate change,"" or ""climate analyst"" on sites like Indeed usually bring up HVAC jobs or irrelevant jobs that mention the word ""climate"" in the description (such as ""Must be comfortable working in a high-maintenance climate/environment""). What companies in NJ/southeast NY/CT/eastern PA would do this type of work without requiring a PhD? What's an easier way for me to search for a ""climate data analyst"" job without junk jobs popping up instead? I've spent days on Google looking up different keywords and phrases and it's just not coming up with what I'm looking for. Maybe these jobs just don't exist on a level I'd expect them to?  
3) I'm considering taking a Praxis subject test and applying for a teaching license and I've already looked up the requirements for that. It's less of a ""since I can't do anything else"" idea and more of an ""I just want to make the world a better place"" idea and I don't think I'd be a bad teacher. My sister, a teacher of over 10 years, even suggested it. Have any of you engineers out there moved onto teaching instead, if even for a little bit? How did that work out personally?

Sorry for the long post. I messed up a lot as an undergrad and consolidated my points as much as I could.

53,Need to add electrical capacity to ATV,1548562252,"I need to add approximately 38 amps of 12 volt capacity to an ATV for a farming project and am exploring possibilities. I would like input.


The project is a broadcast seeder mounted on a four wheeler ATV. The broadcaster contains a ~20 amp motor that spins a disc which slings seed ~30' wide. The broadcaster also includes a ~10 amp motor which drives the seed meter. I also need to power an agricultural GPS system which draws approximately 2 amps. I would also like to add several LED lights, four 18 watts spotlights would work well.

Other details: this vehicle will be used in early mornings when it is dark. The vehicle will operate in 4 hour bursts every morning. During operation the vehicle returns to a pickup/trailer to refill with seed every ~15 minutes. All accessories listed above operate on 12v. The vehicle will be operating at ~10 mph on frozen but smooth ground. All the above things are mounted on the front and rear racks.

I have a 2012 Honda Rancher available for this project, or I could purchase a different used ATV with a budget of ~$4000.

Since the vehicle is operated at night I would already be drawing the full electrical load the ATV system is designed for; lights and power steering.


So what can I do to power everything?


Options that I am exploring:

- Purchase an aftermarket stator. I haven't looked yet, but I am confident that I won't find something rated high enough.
- figure out a way to connect an alternator to the engine. This would be ideal. Amy hopes for the practicality of this are low.
- Swap out external batteries as required during seed refills
- Add a small generator. I would probably have to make something out of a 2 stroke motor and an alternator. I would rather avoid this because maintaining another engine, especially a noisy smelly one close to an operator, is no fun.
- Create some kind of ground driven alternator arrangement. A spring loaded ground contact wheel.

- Connect an alternator to the ATV's rear axle somehow. I'm leaning towards this option. The current ATV is shaft driven. It would be much simpler on a chain driven ATV.

56,Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Tesla Turbine: Fact or Fantasy?,1548553663,"Hello All,

I came up with the idea for combining a [Solid Oxide Fuel Cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGkzLh14Sh0) with a [Tesla Turbine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3ulwfztFtE) for applications requiring high output in a confined space. I will presume roughly [40 per cent efficiency](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj92YuJ6IzgAhWL0J8KHf3uAmoQFjABegQICRAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F1996-1073%2F12%2F1%2F44%2Fpdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GfPbzlhyGY2ZoFqBwTwxs) for the Tesla Turbine itself. I am assuming perfected manufacturing techniques throughout for the purposes of the theory.

I created a crude diagram outlining the system [here](http://cooper.stevenson.name/tesla_turbine_fuel_cell/tesla_turbine_solid_oxide_fuel_cell.png). 

The design features a hollow shaft (nickel doped graphene?) connected to hollow disks where oxygen is pumped into the apparatus at pressure. The shaft/disk assembly is then coated with an electrolyte material followed by an anode (magnesium or manganese).

Hydrogen is pumped into the turbine's inlet valve shown in the diagram at the top at roughly 8 bar. If my loose hypothesis is correct then as the hydrogen swirls around the (magnesium as far as the hydrogen is concerned) hollow disks it will receive the Oxygen ions moving through the electrolyte creating an electrical current. The current is picked up through the shaft bearing, runs through the load, and returns via the shaft bearing on the opposite side.

The apparatus is cased in a thermally tolerant insinuative ceramic enclosure. High temperature (~500C) is facilitated by periodically igniting the incoming Hydrogen. This, of course, assumes we don't blow ourselves to hell.

Overall, since the hydrogen is under pressure anyway my idea is to utilize that pressure for useful mechanical work. The turbine may also, presuming I'm correct, of functioning as a fuel cell at the same time.

80,"How do I become needed, not just employed? (First post)",1548515730,"I really enjoy this sub so first, thanks to everyone involved. From my experience, it feels like there are two kinds of jobs in engineering. One where you are given multiple responsibilities and projects that if not completed, are your fault, and the other where people come to you, request you to do a job, and it gets done according to your schedule. Two examples from my current job (auto parts manufacturing) and one from word of mouth. 

1) We have an in-house integrator (20+ years EE) who handles anything related to control systems (PLC changes, sensors, wiring, etc.). If we need something, we fill out a form, our manager approves it, and our integrator puts it on his schedule based on first come-first serve/priority basis. 

2) We also have a CAD tech (5 years exp. Associates in Industrial Tech. if I remember correctly) who maintains changes to drawings, makes new drawings based off our drafts, and works on and prints off 3D models. Same process for her as for the integrator. 

3) Mechanical Engineers that have their PE can become independent contractors and review HVAC systems and make large sums in a short amount of time by approving the work. 

Is my generalization at all accurate, or accurate relative to my field? I realize specialization plays into this also. How did you, or others you know, become “needed”?

95,"Are Autonomous VTOL Air-Taxis (aka ""Flying Cars"") as Practical as they Seem?",1548468299,"I've been thinking recently about ""flying cars"", which have received a lot of hype recently (e.g. [Boeing](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/24/boeings-flying-car-lifts-off-in-race-to-revolutionize-urban-transport/), [Airbus](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16961688/airbus-vahana-evtol-first-test-flight), [Lilium](http://www.thedrive.com/tech/24527/air-taxi-start-up-lilium-boldly-claims-uber-like-passenger-flights-will-start-much-sooner-than-2025)). For those who haven't heard about them, the basic idea is that you'd go to a helipad (""vertiport""/""skyport""), and get into a small (1-4 seater aircraft), the aircraft would take off vertically, fly to your destination (maybe 30 miles away) at 150-200mph, and then land vertically at a helipad at your destination.

As far as I can see, most of the potential issues they might face have fairly reasonable solutions:

**Congestion/traffic**: Adding a third dimension for traffic means that there's so much extra room that this isn't an issue (and current roads are 1D in some sense, so we're really adding 2 dimensions). Also aircraft are much faster than cars, so they don't fill up the air for anywhere near as long.

**Safety**: We know from airliners that it's feasible to make aircraft where the risk of mechanical failure is acceptable. The other issue is that there's no way that humans will be able to fly these things safely, especially given that there would be so many in the air at one time. The solution for this is that they'll be autonomous, which (perhaps a little counter intuitively) is easier for aircraft than for traditional land based cars (as my specialty is control theory/machine learning I'm fairly sure that this is accurate).

**Cost**: The cost per flying car is likely to be very high (e.g. $500000), so there's no way the average person will ever own one. However, since they're autonomous/used like taxis, this cost is effectively split amongst dozens of people. Also, these vehicles are electric, which yields much lower maintainence costs than ones using aviation fuel.

**Noise**: Traditional propeller aircraft are too noisy to be acceptable in most areas. But these aircraft are electric, and so much quieter. Also, they tend to have lots of small propellers instead of one big one, which (allegedly?) makes the noise less annoying/quieter.

**Range**: This seems to be the biggest issue at the moment, batteries are very heavy which limits the aircraft range to maybe 50-100 miles at the moment (although battery tech is advancing pretty fast which could change things). This should be enough for crossing cities/travelling to nearby cities though. I understand that there are regulations requiring the aircraft to have enough fuel to stay in the air for quite a bit longer than required, but these requirements are predicated on the idea that the aircraft need to be able to find a runway to land on, which isn't necessary if the aircraft can land vertically. (As a side note, why are almost none of these companies using hydrogen fuel cells instead? Hydrogen has much higher specific energy than batteries, allowing for much greater range. I don't know much about battery/fuel cell tech so I'd be interested in hearing an explanation for this.)

6,EE or CompE(need help deciding),1548449639,"Good day everyone, so I am currently a freshman in engineering(my school doesn't allow one to pick thier field till the second year) and I am looking to go into ECE. However, I do not know if I should pick EE or CompE, overall at my school, there is only a difference of 3-4 required classes between these two degrees( EE have to take advance EM, but CompE have to take a class in data structures, discrete mathematics, and ASIC design). The rest of the degree is electives based(for EE they only have 2- 3 mandatory electives such as a second signals course(both compE and EE take at least one signals course) and a controls course, while CompE have to take courses such as OOP, embedded systems, AI, Computer design and like 1-2 more software engineering courses). Everything else in the degree is electives based(So if I wanted I can take all of the COMPE classes as EE   or vise verse and still get out in four years or less).

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I have talked about the degrees let me state my interests, based on the research I have done the most interesting fields to me seem to be COMM/DSP, controls and machine learning/AI. One of the main reasons I am interested in these fields is that they go well together with my second major in mathematics(one of the major reasons behind my decision for ECE is that people have told me that it has the most math). Now some may say that math double major is a waste of time and I should just do a minor but hear me out I am already done with minor due to advance credit(for example next semester I will be most likely taking either real analysis or Fourier analysis).  Now onto the question about hardware vs software, personally I like software more than hardware but I don't really care either way as long as the job involves math. However one of the reasons I choose engineering over a typical CS degree is that I don't wish to become a code monkey. (Even though I am interested in pure CS).

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing I would like to is that I am interested in doing research or R&amp;D in the industry so I don't mind going to grad school, however, I don't want to spend 10 years on a Ph.D. (I don't mind getting one later but I would rather work for a few years first).

17,H How do engineers define software's reliability and safety?,1548436775,"Hello

A method which is very often used when analyzing the safety of critical software is the Fault Tree Analysis method. Meaning you look at the failure rate of every sub-system/component/... and based on this determine the safety and probability of the system/module to fail.

I would like to know how people are able to determine the failure rate and thus safety of a piece of software on e.g. an aircraft. Let's say you have written software which fulfills all the requirements and have written the tests based on the given requirements. Somebody will have to really check from a software standpoint how safe your software is. Somebody will at the end have to say ""OK this software will only fail 1 in 1E6 times. We have to guarantee 10E5, good job"". How is this 1E6 obtained?

My guess: people are able to tell based on the quality, numbers of years it has been used in general and other factors how safe a component is and thus what failure rate you have. For software you could try to guesstimate such a number by looking at how many years of industry experience the software engineer in question has and how good he is.

I am building a blower, and would like to be pointed in the right direction for control.

I will be powering it with an 18v or 12v battery (TBD)

I don't have specs on motor. @18v it has more than enough rpm for my needs. I need a slow speed for the lighting and initial combustion (5 mins or less), and a high speed for the incineration  (likely 20-30 mins). I will need some practical testing to know those speeds. I would like an end solution that makes use of a control board I already have that has all the timings, safety circuits, etc. It has relays for the initial low speed and the high speed.

I know just enough about this stuff to get me in trouble, I'm more of an AC control guy. 

Should I be using a switching motor controller, or just a simple circuit? I'm throwing this together from salvage, and have a big pile of electronics to tear into, although most wont have much that can handle the high current parts.

72,How to balance gas flow and pressure in nitrogen purged chambers?,1548346781," 

I have an instrument that is technically a humidity controlled chamber. It measures how much moisture is picked up by the sample through a microbalance(Zone 1). Nitrogen gas flows from zone 3 and split into 2 chambers (by a union Tee ) in Zone 2. Finally the gas is vented in Zone 1, each chamber with its own exhaust vent (tubings that vent to the back).

The Problem is that the flow is uneven. or let me rephrase, the flow is even as long as the resistance against the flow is equal for both chamber. with the slightest change in resistance at one of the vents, the flow is completely diverted to the other chamber. This happens if one of the vent tubings got slightly bent, one is slightly longer than the other, etc.. It is ridiculous sometimes

My question is: if I joined the exhaust tubings together at the end (by a Y-connection), would that equalize the pressures and gas flow in the chambers? I'm no engineer but I can't think of a better place to ask

I was hoping someone would be able to give me insight to something I have been scratching my head at for the past few days.

I understand that three phase systems are 120 degrees out of phase with each other and for single phase the phases are 180 degrees apart. This gives a ratio of 2/3 to be exact. 
 
So just as an example let’s say we have a reconnectable generator rated for 20 KW at three phase. Doing the math, reconnecting for single phase allows 13.33 KW output. Reading the data tag also shows this.

What is throwing me off is there have been quite a few generators I have gone to that will have the data tag displaying the same output for both single and three phase connections; e.g. 125/125.

How is it possible that some gensets can maintain rating when switched from three phase to single phase?

BSME here with about 3 semesters remaining. Full of things on my mind that I want to get done before graduating, but uncertain if I should commit. 

Here is a list of things I want to do, but am uncertain about due to the general consensus that it is not necessary: 

1. Get a minor in robotics (or something). Ideally I want a CS minor, but it is too late for me to apply at my school. I want to get a minor to boost my resume, but of course I could just take a single robotics course or learn programming at home. Of course my graduation would be delayed, *but IT IS A CHANCE I cannot have again in the future. *

2. Dual Major in CS. Again, same as above. This would be my first BS degree; I have some extra scholarship I could take a few more courses to dual major.  *not sure if this is a chance I can have again, since I think my financial aid and scholarship is affected after receiving my first bachelors* (I could also just instead consider a masters) 

3. Learning a new language. Career benefits? 

4. Take a personal finance/investment class. I do not need to take it to graduate, but I am interested in investments and since my school is top-rated, I may be getting a better experience than learning outside of school. Or would /r/personalfinance be enough learning for me? 

5. LEED certified? Six sigma certified? I recall full time students get discounts on some courses or certifications. Does anyone have any information on this?

99,Why are constructions in aluminum in general lighter than constructions in steel?,1548296505,"Yes, I am aware that the density of aluminum is roughly 3 times lower than steel but so is both the stiffness(young’s modulus) and (yield)strength as well. It seems to me that if we’re optimizing a structure for a certain stiffness or a certain load the mass should be the same.

&amp;#x200B;

**Simple example:**

A rod with length **L** and a circular cross section with area **A** is attached to a rigid wall on the left side. On the right side we are pulling with a force **F**. What is the minimum weight we can achieve without the rod breaking assuming the length is fixed?

**|-------------→F**

We want to find the minimum mass that results in a stress equal to the yield strength of the material.The mass of the rod is simply the density of the material times length times the area:

**m = ρ\*L\*A (1)**

The stress is defined as the force divided by the area:

**σ = F/A**

The maximum stress σ\_yp is therefore directly proportional to the area A\_min:

**A\_min = F/σ\_yp (2)**

(2) in (1) gives us an expression for the minimal mass m\_min:

**m\_min = ρ\*L\*F/σ\_yp (3)**

As you can see in equation 3, the minimum mass is a constant (**L\*F**) times the density divided by the strength(**ρ/σ\_yp**).It seems like it doesn’t really matter if we put in the numbers for steel or aluminum. The density/strength-ratio will remain roughly the same resulting in the same mass for the rod.

I am also aware that there are tons of different alloys for both steel and aluminum making it difficult to pin-point a specific yield strength for the materials. The strength/density ratio is also called specific strength. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific\_strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_strength)

5,Choosing engineering major: majoring in something you're mostly good at but don't find that interesting vs something you're interested in but not that good at,1548289804,"Right now I'm into my 4th semester (sophomore) of engineering and majoring in industrial engineering. I originally chose this major because though I thought about doing mechanical engineering (since I am fascinated in manufacturing and how to build, design, and create / learn how machines work), industrial engineering had easier math and I'm not that good or confident in physics (since mechE uses a lot of physics). I do enjoy physics and find it more interesting the more I take it though it's hard and my grades are all over the place. Back to I.E., so far the classes I have taken related to the major are work design and now probability. I try to get myself to like probability because IE classes use a lot of probability and statistics but I don't find it particularly enjoyable - more like a chore to learn to build on later concepts. With work design I enjoyed the lab but the class itself was okay (didn't hate it but didn't love it). I do like making things more productive and efficient and aspire to work in manufacturing and with machines but I'm more interested in how machines work and how to build products, not how to make things more efficient. 
So now my question is should I still major in industrial engineering because it's easier and uses way less physics (something I'm not that strong in but enjoy learning) or change my major and take the risk of my grades possibly dropping?

9,[Undergrad engineering student] Just a few questions about manufacturing engineering,1548286946,"Hey,

1st year engineering student here, looking for some advice and hoping to get some questions answered. This doesn't apply just to manufacturing engineers, i'd love to get some input from anyone. Right now I am in a general first year engineering program. I specialize next year for my engineering discipline (eg. elec, mech, civil). My career goal is to work in the industry, earn some experience and network, complete a MBA, and eventually settle as a project engineer in a tech company. (sounds ambitious I understand, but just a general perspective of where I want to be)

&amp;#x200B;

1. I've done a quick job search with glassdoor in manufacturing engineer jobs, and most specifically list having an elec or mech engineering degree for requirements. (I'm in canada FYI, where the top univeristies dont have a specialized manufacturing engineering program, so I'd imagine that most of these job postings didn't really consider the existence of a manufacturing engineering degree) My university is starting up a new manufacturing engineering program this year. Does graduating with a manufacturing engineering degree make you more competitive for manufacturing/industrial engineering jobs? Is there any point in graduating as a manufacturing engineer? Or am I needlessly specializing myself when I could just as easily graduate with a more versatile elec or mech degree? Would I be more competitive if I went to the states where manufacturing engineering is more established?

2. Is there any point in going to university vs. college for manufacturing engineering? Many colleges in Canada already have a manufacturing tech engineer program. Is this analogous to a nursing degree? Where you can earn one at a college or a university but you fill the same jobs. College would be a lot cheaper than university, and if I have the same prospects with a university degree vs. a college degree, I might as well major in elec/mech where the university credentials are weighed much more heavier. (Maybe its different in USA?) 

&amp;#x200B;

3. My goal is to work as an engineer, then slowly migrate into management with a MBA. I love working in teams, and I find that my best performance is as a leader, helping guide decisions and keeping things focused. In your opinion does this path make sense? Manufacturing engineer --&gt; MBA --&gt; project engineer --&gt; CTO? I know career progression will be a lot less black and white, but just a general plan for the future. Any engineers who have taken this path, can you share your experiences? (I've debated between majoring in business vs. engineering but I decided on engineering)

13,Understanding I-V curves and sheet resistance on thin films,1548281417,"I have measured the I-V plot of a thin gold film via the four-point-method. The resulting plot looks like this:

         ^

         |      /

         |   /
         |  /
         | /
         |

Additionally I have measured the resistance of the film with the built in four-point resistance measurement of my instrument. I know the thickness of the film and the dimensions of my measurement. I know the following formulas:  
R_s = pi/ln(2) * U/I  
R_s = Rho/thickness  
R = Rho * length / (thickness*width)  
R_s = R * width/length

where R is the resistance, R_s is the sheet resistance, Rho the specific resistivity and U and I voltage and current.

Now my problem is: the built in function measures 0.5 Ohm. The gradient of the graph is 1.5. The formulas don't fit either (0.0172 Ohms and 0.1845 Ohm/sq)

My Goal is to calculate the absolute resistance of the film (should be 0.5 Ohms)

My Question is:

- Is measuring the gradient of the graph the correct way of getting the Resistance from the data?

- Which U/I values should I use in the formulas? The ratio is not constant.

- Does the plot even make sense? Going from a negative voltage to a positive one, or did I do a mistake while measuring?

22,"Anyone in the MEP/Facilities building industry? Think semiconductor fabs, datacenters, hi-tech facilties engineering. Questions about work-life balance.",1548273790,"I'm a BSME with 5 years of experience in various industries from engineering technician jobs in hi-tech to project engineering jobs in utilities (transmission). I have a good amount of travel experience, and have worked as an engineer overseas for 8 months for a non-US water technology company.

I will be receiving an offer from the 2nd largest A&amp;E firm in the world (yea, the one that bought the 3rd largest a couple years ago). That's not intended to gloat, just to give context. Won't be too hard to figure it out.

The group I would be working with is the global electronics development unit that builds semiconductor facilities, data centers, and pharma facilities. I am being brought on to start in HVAC (I have basic knowledge), but I was told that my resume caught their attention because of its variety. The position and the possibilities sounded challenging and diverse, which I like. Sounds like there is a focus on not allowing people to be pigeon-hole'd, which is also nice. The organization's structure and project methodology sounded well thought out when it was presented to me in the interview (but then again, they *are* trying to sell the position, right?).

Being that their projects are all over the US and the world, travel can become fairly common. Several times during the interview, I got the impression that the people in this unit are ""live to work"" rather than ""work to live"" type folks. I was straight forwardly told that 40 hours/week is not the standard. Rather, 48 hours/week is essentially expected. 60 hours/week maximum (in that they make sure no one ever works over 60 hours/week). 

I am not one to run away from the prospect of hard work, especially if I am rewarded for it. I have also historically been good at my jobs and received glowing recommendations, though they've all been contract-type (never FTE). 

I do, however, value my free time greatly. I have an active lifestyle, value my personal relationships with friends and family, and will be getting married soon (no kids and no plans to have them). My fiancée is ok with me having to travel, and I also enjoy traveling though I understand travel for work is different than travel for pleasure.

I am trying to get input from someone in this industry... 

* How rewarding has it been for you (in whatever way you interpret that)? 
* Do you find yourself with enough free time to pursue your personal goals? 
* How stressful have you found it to work in this industry?
* How common is burnout? 
* Is there a ballpark range for salary expectations for someone in my position (BSME, 5+ years experience \[though maybe 1 in HVAC and 3 in project engineering\])? COI in my area is mid-to-high (certainly above national USA average).
* Is OT usually compensated in this industry (the difference in hourly wage between working 40 hours/week vs. 48 hours/week is not insignificant)? How is time spent traveling from work usually compensated, if at all?

29,Imposter Syndrome-is it ever actually warranted?,1548261160,"My fellow engineers, this sub has been a blessing for me as I’ve realized how many other engineers out there grapple with the same issues. I’ve recently begun a career at an awesome private space flight company, and from my first day have had the “oh shit what have I gotten myself into” feelings.

While I’m not dumb by any means, throughout my undergrad and grad school education I mastered the art of “getting the grade”, and graduated both with a 3.7, but afterwards felt like I retained very little of a deep understanding of the physics and moreso how to solve textbook problems and cram for tests.

I also worked at a large aerospace company and most of the analysis work I did was performed with pre-built tools (like a library of fluid network components, where i just connected them and set inputs) or simple thermal models. I was able to make them sound impressive in my interview, and got good letters of recommendation. And got this job as a rocket scientist.

Now all of a sudden I’m surrounded by BRILLIANT people, who all seem to have a mastery over these subjects. I no longer have the luxury of using prebuilt tools, and instead am responsible for creating such tools. There are even younger engineers at a lower salary grade than me who seem to know way more than i do. 

I know Imposter Syndrome is a very common thing, and the positive response is to just work hard and try to learn as much as possible. How do I get to the level of my peers, without “outing” myself as an underqualified engineer who slipped through the cracks?

The project overall is a DIY-style bicycle generator intended for a teaching environment for children and young adults.

* In an impermeable chamber (chamber A) with 1 vent to atmosphere, there is air, and another impermeable chamber (chamber B), containing propane. At times, the propane outgases and enters chamber A, and mixes with the air. Chamber A is contained within a van.
* The goal of chamber A is to capture any outgassing from chamber B and its related systems, and ensure it flows out of chamber A through the vent, rather than into the van.
* With only 1 vent to atmosphere (rather than 2 vents to create some sort of gas flow), am I unwittingly trapping the propane in chamber A?
* How can I improve this system to ensure constant venting of any propane, to the outside?

* Self-converted camper van, with a propane heater (propex HS2000). The heater is a two-loop system with heat exchanger, and the primary combustion loop is ingested and exhausted out of the van. The secondary loop is the van's internal atmosphere.
* The propane line comes from a small propane tank, in a sealed plastic utility bucket, that has a floor vent to the underside of the van. The bucket sits inside the van as well. Since this is a conversion, this is the easiest way to separate the propane tank from internal van atmosphere. Pre-built RVs typically have a purpose built box, that is flush to the RV on the outside, but juts into the vehicle, and has a large grate open to the outside and a hull penetration with the gas line entering the vehicle.
* The bucket isn't 100% airtight, but airtight enough that since there is barely any positive pressure in the bucket, any propane that vents out from the tank (overpressure if I drive to high elevations, or any leaks in the system), accumulates in the bucket, and ideally vent out of the hole in the bottom of the bucket that goes outside.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make a motor-driven planetarium (orrery), with the planets located with a fairly accurate scale with respect to one another. I've been using the WIP scale of 1AU:30cm,which would make it roughly 1 meter across. But I know next to nothing about how to design a gear system. Most of the calculators and things I read about are primarily concerned with the specifics of size and power transmission, and not accurate output speed. I don't really know where to start.

The planetarium would be more like a large disk-shaped apparatus rather than the traditional bunch-of-marbles-on-sticks-protruding-a-gearbox ( [http://zeamon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Orrery1444.png](http://zeamon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Orrery1444.png) ). Movement would be transmitted from a motor to each of the planets by way of combinations of ring gears, both internal and external. You can see the idea I'm going for here ( [https://i.imgur.com/pIUrDI5.png](https://i.imgur.com/pIUrDI5.png) ). The configuration of the common drive gear and planet-driving idlers shown is just a placeholder.

B) Buying a normal commercial air cleaner unit with a PCO, take the PCO out of it and place it in mine (not easiest I guess)

C) Using a small UVC bulb with a titaniumoxid surface like this: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/Genuine-DAIKIN-Titanium-apatite-photocatalytic-air-filter-FTX-FTK-FVX-CTX-series/173344592629](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Genuine-DAIKIN-Titanium-apatite-photocatalytic-air-filter-FTX-FTK-FVX-CTX-series/173344592629) .

I'm very limited in my own energy and urgently just need whatever works the easiest.

88,Conflicted about career decision,1548159745,"I'm hoping the engineers of Reddit can provide some career advice, or your opinion on my current predicament.

I'm in my late 20's, a mechanical engineer with 4+ years of work experience, all of which is in the same industry. I work as a contractor at a very large company. The nature of the relationship between my employer and this large company is such that I can be moved around to wherever there is help needed (at this one particular site). I was fortunate enough to remain in the same group for a while, doing work that mostly aligned with my experience. For about a year I was in an analysis role, which was completely new to me. It was very technical, I learned a lot, and I really enjoyed it.

That ended when I was moved to a different group with a more urgent need for manpower. Then my job satisfaction took a hit. I was thrown into this role to help with ""project management"" with something I was completely unfamiliar with. And I use ""project management"" loosely. I basically track and report metrics for managers and do other administrative/paperwork stuff. If my pay decreased with this move, I’d consider this underemployment. I feel like most of the skills I've built over the past few years are beginning to atrophy. I'm not learning anything particularly new or useful, other than the jargon specific to the work this group performs, which is mostly logistical in nature. I've been at this for less than a year and I find it draining. That's long enough for me to realize that I do not want to pursue any kind of project-management-type position in my career. Don't get me wrong; I recognize and appreciate the need for good project management. It's just not my preference. And what I've been doing doesn't amount to much.

This is where my dilemma comes into the picture. During my time with this group, I've interacted with the group's manager a lot. He's made it a poorly kept secret between us that he'd like to hire me as a direct employee. But he made his plans very clear. Should I be hired, I would continue working in my current capacity. And I see that continuing somewhat indefinitely, since the group is getting a few new projects and those guys need help in this regard. This group does some technical engineering work, but it's mostly logistics and paperwork.

Now the job opening has been posted, and the manager is strongly urging me to apply. He can't hire me on-the-spot; he still needs to go through all the HR interview stuff. But I clearly have an advantage. In my opinion, getting hired is all but guaranteed.

I'm very conflicted. I can't deny the personal value that working for this large company would provide. Compensation, benefits, career growth/opportunities are all much better than my current employment situation. But I really don't want to continue doing project management work. I'd rather return to design or analysis full-time. I've been job searching, but there really isn't much in my area related to my industry and experience. So my current options are: 1) ask my manager to find me more suitable work in a different group (which isn’t guaranteed), or 2) bite the bullet and apply to this job opening and most likely get hired to do work I can barely tolerate anymore.

Any thoughts are appreciated.

11,Should I change career? [drivel alert][psychologists get in here],1548103643,"I'm an msc engineer, and after graduation I've been present for about two years in various more or less software-related employments (ios and android apps, firmware, data analytics).

During all this time, I believe, that I haven't delivered a single solution. I had either postponing development and kept sucking money until I was fired, or I had invested lots of time in ""research"" and finally said to a boss that it's more feasible to have the app developed by external company. I got fired anyways.

Thinking back, I can't recall that I ever developed a working app from start to finish. I was only able to take an already done bare-bone  and then upgrade it by stealing solutions to identical problems from stackoverflow or github. If the identical problem with a solution wasn't there, I felt that I was screwed. Instead of screwing around with trying to develop a solution over time,  I did a last-minute quick ""workaround"" fix  and hoped that the app wouldn't end with epic run-time crash at some point,  or alternatively, I just said to my boss that it can't be done, or I simply left the problem out and hoped that nobody would notice. Obviously the boss doesn't know much from software development, so it's easier to trick him with such maneuvers.

The hardest thing about work is coming to work and then waiting more than 8 hours so that 5PM rings. Meanwhile I'm half of the time in a lab ""testing the solutions"" (= i'm there working nothing, as bosses and managers don't visit these dungeons), while the other half of time I spent on coffees and randomly clicking trough compiler tabs/documentation pretending that I'm working.

I never understood how my coworkers can bare being on work without even one sigh, or how they can be even passionate about this stuff. How can you be passionate about something that requires you to read 100 pages of documentation, understand few dozens of concepts, take you a week of your time and cause shitloads of frustration so you can get one simple ""hello world"" on the screen, because things often don't work out-of-the-box? Yes it's challenging, but challenge is not a fun, rather a pain in the ass.

I don't know for sure what to how do I feel about programming in general. It feels good to have a job that boosts your social status, it feels good that it makes you someone, it feels good to have a good salary, but the work itself.....huh...I guess it's not really enjoyable. It's like you get paid to make homework from maths for 8 hours per day, which is annoying and apparently boring. If it wasn't for the money, social status and because of the sake of my technical background which i hated, I would probably catapult myself somewhere else. Maybe.

I feel that programming is the hardest job ever, especially if you're not passionate about it. When I open compiler and study app structure line-by-line and trying to explain it by reading documentation while trying not getting lost, I feel like one would need at least 110 of IQ to comprehend that. But I don't have that much of capacity, merely I'm in eighties range or so accordingly to psych test done in elementary school (or about 100 according to various e-tests, but those aren't really legit). Maybe this limitation is screwing me hard and I'm trying to cope with the work seeing it ""boring"" and whatsoever. There must be a reason why in all jobs that I had, at least once I heard that ""this engineer is a dumb ass"" or ""this guy doesn't know what he's talking about"". Other than that, I've heard numerous times trough my life that I suck in logic and in elementary school my worst grades were from math, so there must be something about it.

Thinking about the programming tasks that I actually finished, it was probably lightweight scripting of automation where I spared fellow developers from some copy-paste tasks. Making a script here and there only requiring logic and to know basic API calls is somewhat passable, but building an app with local front-end and online backend requiring knowledge of whole tech stack, and  having to know bunch of design patterns, feels kinda overkill, especially when things go wrong.

Maybe I should have listened my boss from my first student job, when he told me: ""Dude, what if you would try with  graphic design instead?"". Being honest to myself, running Photoshop, placing elements around and making things look polished is the most fun thing that I've encountered in app development.

The only job that I ""excelled"" at was  probably production line work involving soldering elements on PCBs. It was like solder few elements on PCB and finish X-pieces under Y of time and you're done. Withing this job i felt like the biggest mother fu\*ker as job was easy, but the most rewarding was the feeling that I was able to finish what I was doing. Also, the time on work didn't pass slowly, probably because doing practical work usually keeps me busy and focused on the thing that I'm doing.

I have given some thought on how to implement this (I probably won't) and I am sure that a microcontroller and a thermocouple can be used for setting and measuring the temperature. The actual heating would be resistive I presume and the chamber will have some kind of a ceramic coating that does not undergo reactions at the high temperature. The chamber would also have to be surrounded by a couple inches of insulating material so that heat is not radiated out.

I am not saying that I will ever attempt this, but from a logistic and engineering perspective, what would be the most difficult part if one were to undertake such a project? My assumption is that the most difficult step is the creation of a chamber that does not undergo adverse expansion and contraction.

I'm a final semester Aerospace Engineering student and was recently offered a full time position for after I graduate at a large company. I'm having trouble deciding my best course of action for the offer is.

The company who extended the offer has several different divisions. I currently am in an internship in Division 1. The project is all overhead and not incredibly exciting, but challenging and I enjoy the team. The title is Systems Engineering Intern, but I work in Software with other software engineers doing mainly code fixing/adding functionality/scripting. I have expressed interest in staying on after I graduate, and they assure me that I am a good fit, I just need to go to other managers and make them aware as well. I have also expressed interest in joining a development program to one of the board members on the selection committee, and he seemed very happy to take me under his wing and guide me through the process of applying. 

However at the start of the year, their were some budget cuts and several team members on an already smaller than average team were moved. After consulting some online resources, it also seems that Division 1 is not currently hiring for entry level jobs, as I would be filling. Division 1 is historically the most profitable branch of the company and would be a safe bet working at, if they were to extend me an offer.

I was just offered a full time job from Division 2 at a salary that I would consider above average when talking to coworkers. It would be in Software Engineering. The program seems like interesting work and the manager and I have opened up a solid rapport. Division 2 would be about 60 minutes extra commute a day however, and the program is government related.

I have no doubt the transition to the new role in Division 2 would be fairly easy and I would enjoy the work, but for an extra hour of commute a day, not having the same connections, not being able to earn investments in the safer option as I stay on board, and leaving my current team are plaguing my thoughts. I feel the current offer I have will pay more than any offer from Division 1, and I cannot be certain I would even get an offer from them.

35,Are there benefits to a Kalman filter with just 2 velocity measurements?,1548085167,"  

I have a basic understanding of the Kalman filter, and I am quite fascinated by it, but I have a question:

I am interested in the position of an object and have two different sensors that measure the velocity of that object. Is there a benefit to a Kalman filter in this case? Ideally I would like to have a weighted average of the 2 sensors based on a changing covariance matrix of the sensor values. However, AFAIK the Kalman filter just decides how much to trust the prediction or the measurements but not how much to trust the individual measurements. Would it be an option to treat one of the sensor values as the prediction and the other as the measurement and that way let the filter decide which one to trust more?

   
 

It would be great if you could guide me in a general direction here! Any help is appreciated.

Cheers, Mark

I know nothing about the basics of electricity outside of the little research I've done. I noticed that the wall outlets in my apartment are all type A. I will be working from home and have a desktop to setup, however my surge protector requires a type B. So I started taking caution.


1. My first reaction was to buy a simple converter, but then I read that it is extremely unsafe, and to use a different plug (however I don't have that luxury, as all outlets are type A).  
2. If this is acceptable to then plug my surge protector in? I also read that a surge protector without a ground plug is worthless, as purpose for B is for grounding.
3. I was then considering buying a UPS, but this doesn't solve my problem, and that it only serves it's use during constant power outages which I don't believe to suffer from. 
3. So then I started factoring in that I live in a rooftop studio, and probably have all electrical on one circuit(?). Which would potentially cause further energy fluctuations due to a mini fridge and air conditioning unit? (I know nothing)
4. Lastly, I read to worry not that, the power supply on my desktop will filter the power appropriately. Also, that the surge protector will counter the fluctuations with the mini fridge and AC, due to joules(?)

42,Can I call myself a mechanical engineer?,1548069398,"Hello.

I have had a very weird engineering career, as I'm sure a lot of you have. I started my undergrad degree doing civil engineer (2 years), but then changed to do mining engineering. After this I stayed on to do a PhD on ground support, before I got hired at a company that sponsored my research. I was put on to do R&amp;D work.

At this first job, I ended up doing a lot of mechanical design work and learned heaps about mechanical engineering and manufacturing. I did way more stuff in that space than applying anything I actually learned doing mining engineering in undergrad.

I have since changed jobs and been hired as an 'R&amp;D engineering' mainly focusing on mechanical design. I have been working on lots of mechanical problems (like fluid mechanics/pumping, bearing design, fits and tolerancing, bolted connection, stress and frame analysis - both by hand and FEA) and just feel way more comfortable in that space than anything else. 

Which brings me to my question - would it be wrong to call myself a mechanical engineer? I feel like there is always stuff I am learning, and can see all the things I don't know, so I feel like a bit awkward calling myself one since I don't have the 'degree'. Would love to hear your thoughts.

51,Start engineering career or go with once in a lifetime opportunity?,1548049737,"Hellooooo fellow redditors, 

Before I begin, both options are GREAT opportunities for career development, but like many things, there are many pros and cons to each. 

Please help me make the right decision!! I want to go with my heart but I also want to make a smart decision.

Quick summary: I am trying to choose between going to one of the most prestigious universities in the world for grad school or starting my career in engineering at a 500 fortune company that checked marked all the things I want in a company. 

A little more info on me: 

I am a US citizen and I will be graduating from undergrad in chemical engineering this semester. I enjoy technical work and using my creativity and I also enjoy mentoring people. This following bit is important: I do not know what I want to do career wise in the long run. I've had some internship experiences but they were not enough to help me determine what I want to do with my degree. I am open to many options. After my first full time internship at a 500 fortune company, it was a bit of a shock for me. I became depressed and my life felt like it was on a loop. Work, weekend, work, weekend. But to be fair, I think it's because my work was pretty boring and not challenging enough. Don't know. I am also the type of person to be a free spirit and not like any constraints. I do know one thing that I want to do career wise for sure though and that's having a global presence. I want to have an ""international resume"" and obtain a global vision.  


Grad School Option Summary 

After a trip to China this past summer, I had a great idea of a way to postpone selling myself to a company and having a bit more freedom before succumbing to the golden hand cuffs. ""I'll do grad school in China!"" After all, China is handing out scholarships like hot cakes to international students, I've been extremely lucky to not have to graduate with any student loans, and I can travel all around Asia during my school breaks! I even started taking Mandarin courses at my Uni. Fast forward a few months, I got accepted in the #1 ranked school in China and in the top 30 in the world for a master's program in Engineering Management. (The program is in English)

Pros
1. Great school with crazy opportunities and resources
2. The way the program is set up, I have to complete all my courses in Beijing during the 1st year and I can work full time in the 2nd year of the two year program while I write my thesis and it doesn't even have to be in China. This means I can get experience working abroad. I would LOVE to work in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, or Singapore. 
3. I won't have to pay anything because of the scholarship
4. I LOVE getting new perspectives and experiences and the fact that I could experience what a Chinese University is like is so cool, it's not just about being able to live abroad

Cons
1. People have told me this and I really do agree. This is one of the biggest reasons I'm having doubts about grad school:  I think it's pretty foolish for me to pursue a master's degree when I don't know what the hell I want to do career wise. The one way I think I'll be able to find out what I want to really do, is by getting experience in industry first.
2. People have also told me that I am more marketable now as a freshly graduated ChE than what I will be after doing my masters in China. I worry I would not be able to find a job if I want to come back to the States. Not sure if this is true 

 
And so this brings me to my other option ...

Starting my Career in Engineering Summary

I figure this may be the smarter option, but I don't necessarily care postponing this for another 2 years to have the experience of living abroad. I figure working is the best way to start my career as a real engineer but you know what when I'm on my death bed I think I'll look back to the years I lived in China and not care if I started working 2 years earlier. But in the end, I don't just want to follow my heart, I also want to make smart choices not just for myself now but for my future self as well. China option is definitely the riskier choice for career development imo.

Pros
1. I can start getting real engineering experience
2. They offered me over 70k starting salary, hot mama is that hard to say no to. Im tired of being poor
3. I like the location
4. They are global and I could potentially do projects abroad with them
5. I can use this experience to really figure out what it is that I want to do career wise

Cons
1. What if I hate my job and regret not going to China for the rest of my life
2. Don't really see myself going back to school once I start working 


Do you see my predicament now? They are both great options and I want to go with my heart (China) but I also want to make the best decision for me and my career. (Help)

64,Future Employment in Engineering,1548026572,"This is my first post so I hope I can get my thoughts out properly haha.

Currently, I am a freshman in my second semester and I am on a Computer Engineering track. Since high school, I've been committed to going into engineering, but lately I've been questioning myself for a few reasons.

I've noticed that Software Engineering is really in demand and I heard it's quite common for computer engineers to end up working as software engineers. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, my main concern is employment in my late 30's and onwards. What I heard from family and a little bit of the internet, ageism is inevitable and it's common for older employees in the tech industry to get laid off? One of my friends dad, who works at Samsung, suggested that I shouldn't go into Software Engineering because there's ""nothing to do"", and all he does is maintain security and make sure there are no issues. Another one of my friends dad was a software engineer (who also worked at Samsung), and that friend told be that her dad is always studying and keeping up with new technology. That didn't seem to be a problem for me, but she also explained how her dad applied for another job at Google as a software engineer and the interviewers were able to tell that he tried to cram all the new information. Now I believe he works somewhere else as a data analysist or something similar at a different company. To me, I feel like at that age, to work in such a demanding environment is unhealthy, especially when you want some free time to spend with your family and yourself. 

I know software engineering isn't my only option, but does anyone else know what other fields of engineering is in demand? And are there any engineers who are worried about being laid off in the future?

So a little bit about me and my ""plans"":

During my first semester I was unsure about my major because I was worried about being employed in the future. So I considered going into the pre-med track because being a doctor could secure having a job in my late years as well. But I've noticed that going to med school and becoming a doctor just for the salary is not a good idea unless I truly love the process and result of becoming a doctor. I wasn't sure if I was willing to put in the time and effort for med school and residency. But let's say I get into med school and drop out halfway, I would have a hard time repaying the debt and it would be too much of a burden to my family because we don't have that kind of money. So clearly, I like to play it safe and I'm now more concerned about having a job and keeping financial stability in the future. I'm starting to realized that I tend to value mood and free time, rather than rich and luxury. I've considered law, business, etc., but my interests show that I am more likely to be fitted for engineering. If I am afraid of being laid off, I wondered, If I keep my skills sharp and gain years of experience, would getting a higher position like manager better secure my employment? I also heard that getting a higher position will demand more work, and that all ties down to my stamina and health by working long hours. Ideally, I want to have the right balance for work and free time while earning a steady income, but everyone's standard of balance can be different. I don't really know what kind of occupation in engineering offers that kind of benefit and I know I have to put in the work which I'm willing to do. I'm just not sure what I actually want to do because I never been exposed to the actual work I'd end up doing, so I don't know how I'm gonna plan my 40's and 50's. I also don't have a specific interest like automotive, but I do love the idea of improving upon all kinds of things, hence, engineering. I kind of think it's too early for an 18 year old to decide what he wants to do for the rest of his life haha. I know things can change along the way but I feel more comfortable and confident when I have a plan that I can stick with.

I understand some things I said could be biased, but I am open to all kinds of ideas and suggestions. Perhaps the people I talked to and the things on the internet weren't explaining what every engineer does on a daily basis. There's a lot that I don't know which is probably why I'm worried so much and that's really why I'm here haha, I'm hoping there are other people who can  help me out and share their beliefs and experiences.

75,I have ideas for a new digital camera system. I have questions about them.,1548017807,"One idea I have for a digital camera system is to use multiple small variable focal length lenses and small sensors. The idea is that at the same focal length, the images from different sensors capture different perspectives then blend them together for one big picture. It is similar to how the Light L16 does it except the L16 uses fixed focal length lenses.

The zoom lenses will use motors for control. The lenses will include a maximum aperture of f/1.4 and minimum aperture of f/11. The stabilizers will either be optical or sensor based. This will be important for video.

The camera may have a second array of zoom lenses with focus overlapping. The first array at the same focal length will focus on nearby and the second focuses on far away. This is to lower the effects of diffraction and overcome depth of field limits.

The sensors will have phase detect autofocus. This is to ensure speedy autofocus.

The sensors may use either logarithmic or gamma compressed A/D conversion. This is to raise the dynamic range.

The perceived exposure level will be determined by the amount of analog gain applied and metadata. It will support push/pull factor. The raw numbers stay the same while the push/pull factor is metadata that tells the RAW processor how much to raise or lower the numbers for output.

For recording video, the camera will demosaic the images, blend them together, down sample with the bicubic method or better, apply lossy compression, then save to the card. This is meant to be like RAW but with compromises to reduce computing power requirements for the desktop. The lossy codec options include interframe with long GOP and intraframe only. With 12 bit A/D conversion, 4:4:4 chroma subsampling, and the raw color values, the user can adjust white balance and exposure in post. The logarithmic or gamma compressed curve will be temporarily converted into a 32 bit linear curve using a look up table. Tetrahedral interpolation will be used.

How should the lenses be designed for this? How should the optics be made to ensure sufficient overlap from the short end to the long end? What are ways to make the zoom motors compact enough? Would it be better to have the second array to enhance depth of field or stick with one array? Is it possible to make the maximum aperture f/1.4 or higher without significant light falloff? Is logarithmic or gamma compressed A/D conversion better? Is Tetrahedral or Trilinear interpolation better for the RAW conversion?

I have my fort area all planned out, I am hoping someone can help me to nail down the details of my swing beam. I plan to fix one end of the beam to the fort using this [swing beam support bracket.](https://www.swingsetmall.com/swing-beam-support-plate/?gclid=CjwKCAiA1ZDiBRAXEiwAIWyNCwEbmSSHQBHIVarbhfEIHeMiZ42ieL_PBJ6J6N-qXKR0pzDeQUuvvhoCeGAQAvD_BwE) I wanted to have 4 positions for swings, 3 between the fort and the A-frame legs and 1 beyond the A-frame legs ([example](https://www.rainbowplay.com/product/4-position-swing-beam-101/)). I had originally hoped to use a 16' 4x6"" pressure treated beam with the A-frame legs and [this middle bracket](https://smile.amazon.com/Eastern-Jungle-Gym-Bracket-Install/dp/B07J2MP1S1?sa-no-redirect=1&amp;th=1) located at \~12'. This brings me to my questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Will a 4x6"" beam be strong enough to withstand the forces of up to 4 kids swinging at a 10' beam height (considering a vertical load support at 12')? My kids are young at the moment, but I would consider 150# per swing max even when they are grown (we are not big people). I ask this mainly because it looks like Rainbow uses a 4x6"" beam for some of their lower beam heights but then uses [this reinforced header](https://www.rainbowplay.com/product/swing-beam-header-92/) for higher beam heights.
2. If there is concern for the loading on a 4x6"" beam, and I decided to go to a 4x8"" beam, could the beam be notched at 12' to still utilize the readily available A-Frame bracket? Would the notched portion of a 4x8"" beam act like a 4x6"" beam in terms of strength or does the process of notching it further compromise its strength?
3. Would the 90\* vertical orientation of the A-frame support create concern for side to side motion? I assume the fort is such a large mass it is difficult for the structure to move in this direction,.

Little bit of background about me, I'm a recent EE grad with overall below average grades, though my grades are somewhat polarized. There are terms in high 3s and terms in low 2s mostly, and it its mostly due to me being clinically depressed for the majority of Uni life. Despite all that I was lucky enough to have 18 months of coop experience in very respectable power companies, and was elected EE team lead for a year, and then elected project manager for another year at uni's robotics club before I graduated. (The team goes to a yearly competition that can get fairly competitive, though our team only gets OK rankings and results). I am a very hands-on guy, and is willing to get super dedicated and no-life to achieve a goal, but was always slow at understanding knowledge.

The 2 years in robotics club really got my attention as it is way cooler than the power engineering stuff i did during past internships. However, while I was looking through the job postings of many robotic/automation companies, I am only aligned with about \~40% of their criteria. I might be able to close that gap by a little bit though the Udacity robotics course that I plan to do and some self learning, but the high standards that this industry asks still feels out of reach to me. I am already 26(wasted few years here and there) unlike 99% of the undergraduates out there and I cannot afford to wonder around anymore. There are a lot more realistic stuff I need to start to take into consideration. 

It would be somewhat easier to get a job as a electrical designer or similar in either distribution or transmission probably, since most of my work experience align, but knowing there are fields which I am far more interested in kills me on the inside. I just feel that working in the robotics/automation industry gives me a lot more personal significance and sense of accomplishment, even if this is purely my naivety speaking.

Do I just settle and not think about it anymore? I am too afraid that I will end up resenting myself for not trying. To me this is akin to accepting mediocrity (and i know this is a personal issue that I need to work on lol) Do I go hardcore on trying to land a job in robotics/automation? I can certainly get a job somewhere while looking for it. The temp job doesn't even need to be engineering related and I can do the hard grind in the meanwhile. But how long can I last before I submit to the cruel reality? My GF(who's also a EE) has been working(not in robotics/automation) for a year already and feeling to continue live off her sucks. She was talking about getting married and such in a year or two as well goddammit. I'd be even more devastated if I had tried and not able to make it into this field. Time would be wasted too.

I apologize if it sounds more like a rant rather than description. What's your opinion on this?
