0,Protection in case of paint leak,1468610652,"I have this system [here](http://imgur.com/DNqjuMI).

There are paint lines connected to the front, basically what I need is something to stop paint from going everywhere (contain it to a small area) if one of them blows.  There are controls on the front that need to be accessible, and there are tubes that also connect to the top.  Those are the only constraints.

The only ideas I've had is to make a steel encasement and put a curtain on the front, or put a curtain around the entire thing.  The only problem is that the operator most likely will leave the curtain open 90% of the time, making it useless.

Similarly, there is a little pad on the top of the door handle that you can touch and the door will lock as you're leaving the car. So, two questions:

1. How in the world does this work? My theory is the key broadcasts some sort of RF code to the car so that the car knows that this is the correct key, then there is a touch sensor (is that a thing?) in the handle that unlocks the car when activated. Same idea when locking the car.

13,Socially handicapped,1468555762,"Hello, everyone.  I am 17 years old. My passion is physics and engineering. My goal after graduation is to get into an engineering program (electrical engineering and computer science). When I was young, I used to watch physics documentaries. What fascinated me the most was the inventions and tools these scientists and engineers had built to enhance and further our understanding of the natural world. As my fascination with science grew,  so did ny desire to become an inventor. Since then,  I have been reading as many science textbooks and attending lectures to expand my knowledge so that i could hopefully get some ideas that may have practical use in our everyday life. 
Unfortunately, I do not have adequate funding and nobody wanted to support me. 
One of my major obstacles is my lack of connections and any relationship (no family, no friends). 
As a little kid, I enjoyed being isolated while other little children were able to easily cultivate friendships. I have no family. My parents were emotionally detached from me. I had nobody to talk to throughout kindergarten and elementary school. In middle school, I was weird and people derided me. All of them treated me with scorn. 

Throughout high school, I joined robotics and science clubs where my effort was never appreciated. Nobody wanted to listen to me or be my friend. I don't understand. Why am I the one who is isolated and unliked? I am not a bad person. I would never hurt or isolate anyone. Halfway through freshman year, I started to become more conscious of my inability to attract friends (same situation with like minded people). This lack of support and friends has hurt my self esteem a lot which has hurled me into the deep hole of depression. Anxiety is ripping my mind apart and I no longer saw any potential that I believed I had. I am close to graduation and everyone is smiling while I am the lonely, unpopular and depressed teen in the far corner. 
Anyway, I am tired of being like this and I want to change. I don't want anyones pity. Me not having friends(hell, I don't have ANY acquaintances) is not only having a detrimental effect to self esteem, but i also believe that it will negatively impact my chances of finding a job in the future as I don't have references, since I am always isolated.

Can anyone here relate to having felt like this once? What can I do to improve?

Furthermore, they don't permit any metal-to-metal contact, for fear of corrosion. All supports need to have a fiber reinforced wrap or sleeve on them where we hit the steel.  The client's specs refer to a couple of vendors who do the wraps and offer supports for this sort of thing, but neither of them can guarantee their clamps can act as an anchor with a fiber wrap between the pipe and the clamp. They're afraid it'll be able to slip through too easily. So welding to the pipe is out, and clamp-style supports seem to be out.

My friend is an engineer and said he'd be up to try anything so long as I had a decent idea....so naturally I thought a fun thing to build would be a device similar to those hydraulic crush videos on here as of late!

I say similar to because the goal wouldn't be for it to crush anything. I'm more interested in learning about the mechanic behind timed ""pressing"" of the solid. Like, the large metal thing that drops. How does that work?

The end goal would be to have a Pi or an Arduino control a crank-like device that would slowly press a solid downward. It could also work by pressing horizontally instead - horizontal or vertical is fine.

48,Trying to define an equation for a (non-gameplay) blackjack strategy,1468422288,"First things first, this isn't a strategy to increase win rate or returns, like card counting, but a strategy to manage quitting.

My brother taught me his [preferred gameplay strategy](http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/)  and we went to the casino to try it out. Worked out just fine, but in the long run (like all casino games) you have a negative expected outcome. It dawned on me that having a strategy for when to quit playing was just as important as a strategy for gameplay. I got curious and tried to model the idea I was discussing with him.

The strategy itself is basic: After every 3rd hand (ignoring splits), put your minimum bid aside into a bank that you won't play from, and stop playing when you run out of accessible chips.

The strategy does a few simple things for you as a player. 
You quit when your behind, but you quit sooner. Ex. Starting with $100 at a $5 table, losing every hand causes you to walk with $25 instead of $0.
You quit when you're running even. Ex. Losing every other hand in the same example, you walk away with your original $100 +/- $5.
You quit when you're winning. Ex. Winning 5 hands above 50/50 means you will eventually put an extra $25 aside.

I wanted to see how this actually played out in a 'real' scenario, so I modified some blackjack simulation code to track the money moving around and to calculate it over the course of a few million games. What's odd is that my outcomes seem to be positive in the long term. I set the program to consider a Win to be any time I walk with more than I started, a loss for less, and a tie for a perfect break even. What I'm seeing is a positive walk rate between 60-80% of the time, which doesn't seem right, it seems like it should trend negative to match a win rate for the house.

If someone wants to look at the code itself for an error, I'll release the source code later today. I couldn't find any issues in the simulation itself, but my modifications could easily be implemented incorrectly and screw up the final outcome.

As an alternative approach, which might expose a logical error in my program, I thought it might be better to determine an equation that models the game outcome instead. Unfortunately, I have no clue how to do this, I was not a very good statistics student. So I turn to all of you for ideas/help!

53,Reforming capacitors in VFD,1468382628,"Hi,

My boss just dropped this task on me and I'm looking for good ideas on how to do it. The current situation is that I have dozens of old VFD's (spare parts, some of them EOL products) that have been sitting on shelves for 3-10 years and their capacitors are most likely in need of reforming.

I did some googling on the subject and it seems that most common way is to use lab-grade DC supply to directly supply the capacitors with needed current and voltage to reform them. However I'm not terribly fond of this idea because I don't have access to suitable DC supply and it would also involve taking apart the VFD's to get access to capacitors.

Other idea I did find was to use another VFD to supply AC to second VFD and use a long starting ramp to slowly bring up the voltages to nominal values on the VFD while allowing capacitors to be fed throught the internal regulators and electronics of VFD. This would seem most simple idea to me, however since the VFD doesn't recognize the second VFD as a load it refuses to raise the voltage/frequency.

So, any ideas how to get on with this project?",AskEngineers,Bliswas,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4sl7oy/reforming_capacitors_in_vfd/
54,Is a second BS degree worth it if I can't find a job once I'm done with my first?,1468380763,"I tend to lurk around this subreddit every day but never have to guts to answer or ask. So this is my first time. A bit of info on myself...
I'm gonna start my last year in ME (BS) and I still haven't had the chance to do an internship/coop. I've taken a while too. Health and family issues so I transferred to a university near my home. This caused me to fall a bit behind, more than I already was (I was a semester behind when I made the change). Last semester, I went over to the coop office in my university and got two interviews in like a 6-8 week span. I was really looking forward to the second one since it's a healthcare company that focuses on spinal implants (the plant I interviewed for) and for a long time, I've been keeping and eye out on them since they are one of the few companies succeeding in my area. Unfortunately, didn't get a call back either. I have a great GPA, some non-engineering related work experience and that's about it. Haven't been able to break past the famous first wall - ""no experience, no job"". I felt really secure of myself during those two interviews and they went great, so it has been a bit of a bummer. My university just opened up a Biomedical (could be Biomech) BS. They just opened it and to avoid frustration, I haven't asked for more info on it just yet. My question is, if I graduate and can't get a job out of grad, is it a good idea to pursue a second BS (since Bio has been a great interest of mine, ME being the first on the list)? Or should I just find a non-engineering related job and send resumes all over in the mean time? I was planning either a second BS or a MS. I hope I didn't break any subreddit rules. I haven't met anyone who has been in my position so I really have no idea who else to ask.

56,"Mental Illness, Physical Disability, and Engineering",1468370642,"I'm going to make a long story as short as possible in consideration of readers, and then ask a few questions.  Thanks to those who share their time to read this:

I'm starting college for electrical and biomedical engineering this fall.  In my efforts to find scholarships and financial aid I have come across the Dep. of Rehabilitation (which for those of you who are not aware, is an organization which provides small scholarships to partially disabled, working adults who are making efforts to maintain the ability to work meaningfully).  

To give just a little background on my physical disability, I was injured in a weightlifting accident at 18.  An inoperable (due to its location) spinal injury turned into what I suspect is mild nerve damage, but this was unable to be officially diagnosed for the same reasons it could not be safely operated on.  My case worker informed me that the lack of official diagnosis would probably be a problem in getting my scholarship approved.  This is a bit frustrating, as I have been dealing with this for 9 years through several rounds of PT, and taking medications as a result.

When my medication history came up, the conversation changed.  I take Lorazepam (anxiety medication) and Ambien (sleeping medication).  These medications are taken to deal with the anxiety and lack of sleep that can result from the chronic pain caused by my injury.  My case worker advised me that I might have an easier time getting the scholarship if I get a psychiatric evaluation and get an official diagnosis of generalized anxiety, which although it resulted from my injury, I almost certainly have.

So this brings me to my questions, firstly regarding mental illness:  Would a diagnosis of this sort possibly hurt me in the search for a job in engineering, either officially or unofficially?  What about the medication? Will this come up in background checks, and if so should I bring it up or only address it if questioned?  What about security clearances?

As for my physical injury, could it either officially or unofficially hurt my prospects for employment?  I know engineering can be ""hands on"".  Would electrical be a better idea than mechanical, given my injury?  Would it be worth getting it officially recognized as a disability in order to get protections from the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as possible subsidies for employers?  Really, I would just like to be in a position where reasonable accommodations can be made if necessary.

The primary reason I would like to get the anxiety diagnosis is so I can guarantee I can continue receiving my medication without jumping through hoops every time I move.  You can die from Lorazepam withdrawals...  That security and the scholarship would be nice, but if it will possibly hurt my career I might consider not getting evaluated.  Thoughts?  

Feel free to ask any questions if it will help determine your perspective.  Thank you to everyone who reads this and for any help!

I'll pose a scenario to help explain it:

I have a 20lb bag hanging from something out of reach. I need to trigger the bag to drop without delay via a wireless controller. So I have a controller that can send a wireless signal to a receiver which can then trigger a mechanism to release the bag.

Here's the constraints.

* I need it to be near instant. (ie why i am think a solenoid)
* I need the releasing mechanism to be very small and lightweight (for example , maybe 30-40g and roughly around 160sq cm... this is just to give a ball park so no one comes back with a single carbon nano tube solution or something LOL)
*  it has to have an electronic triggering switch (dc)
* if it's some kind of lever system, the load on the solenoid cant be so great that it would bind or bend the rod. (with a really light system, vs the large load, I worry about the forces on the releasing mechanism)

I was thinking of a hinged bar where you support the weight as closely to the hinge as possible, with a solenoid that supports the other side (to shift the bulk of the load to the hinge side). But I worry with repeated use, the solenoid wouldnt hold up. http://imgur.com/wc7dmgk

65,[Civil] Structural vs Project Management,1468338649,"Thank you everyone for your responses. 

I'm entering my last year of my CivE program in the Bay Area. I've always thought of myself as someone who's meant for the structural route, since I like the ""creative"" aspect of construction and structural classes came naturally to me. However, certain issues keep pushing me towards the PM route. 

1. The more I hear from those in the industry, Structural doesn't sound like much of a creative job after all. Unless I can get employed by a well renowned firm, I see myself getting stuck in a lower firm making designs for footings all day long. I want to be part of the project and see it go from start to finish and I feel like the PM position is where I get to experience that. 

2. I'm worried about the salary, compared to PM. If I choose structural, I need to get my masters, then my PE and SE, and even then it seems like I won't have the opportunity to make the same type of money that I feel my years of schooling deserves. In addition, it seems like PM position has more room for upward mobility. 

I hope I didn't offend any Structural engineers. These are simply worries (might be irrational) that I have encountered through my research. 

That isn't to say that I'm sold on the PM route for me either. As an introvert, I have doubts on whether the role will come naturally to me. I have the confidence to lead but I don't know if I have the natural charisma to make it in this industry. In addition, I'm worried that the endless phone calls and meetings might tire me out. 

And of course, if I decide the PM route right after undergrad and I don't like it, I have worries that it might be hard to get back into school for structural studies.

Most of the electrodes that I'm looking at are the disposable snappy kind. A lot of them require gel. Most critically, I need electrodes that are dry and reusable. I was planning to incorporate them via some kind of garment, like Under Armour style compression clothing, or a harness. NanoSonic makes some ""metal rubber"" products that look like they would work well for my purposes, but they're pretty expensive and I also feel like that technology might be more advanced than I necessarily need. I was also considering just machining and creating my own, if I can't find any that are mass-produced. Any advice on this? Am I going to shock myself? I'm looking to connect them to a microcontroller which will in turn be connected to a computer; I probably won't use Arduino but I do have experience with that so I might in a pinch.

Also, I've found some good documentation on MMG sensors and how combining them with EMG can let you do some feature extraction that isn't possible with EMG alone, and modify the signal in ways that respond to user fatigue and so forth.

82,How transferable is a mechanical engineering masters to something in computation or elecrical?,1468274764,"I am looking to change my career to engineering - I currently work as a writer in the tabletop gaming and video game industry. Because everyone asks why, yes, the game industry *can* be incredibly fun and I've had a chance to do things I wouldn't have if I'd immediately followed my degree (I can walk into a Barnes and Noble and find my books), but a standard week has long hours (most are 40-50, 50-60 in crunch) and the writing is often surprisingly uncreative for writing, because it's usually within a framework someone else built or following someone else's creative vision. It's notoriously unstable, so starting a family and staying in one spot would be difficult. While the pay as a narrative designer looks good, because the industry is so project based, there's often long periods of unemployment between projects, and when you adjust income with those periods, it's less attractive. I also struggle to find ways that my work feels substantial or like it has any value to society except as a diversion.

I've spent the last 2 years taking evening courses to round out the coursework I didn't have in engineering (degree is English and Biology), but every adviser I talked to indicated I would need more recent research experience to get into any grad programs (I've been out of school for 6 years - bio and chem major, Englosh minor). I figured, what the hell, the worst that happens is they say no and I have a record of interest to point to next year, so I applied to just one program, not wanting to sink too much energy when it didn't sound likely, and they offered me a position. It's a top 20/30 school in the US (depends on the source) for ME, top 10 for computer, electrical and bio. It's also probably the most affordable grad school option (any better ranked engineering programs jump up to 30-40k a year, this would be 15K/year) and if I accepted, I could start this fall instead of the fall of 2017. 

In some ways, I feel like i have the bird in my hand, I should accept and dive in, because so many advisors and professors indicated my lack of recent research was a big weakness, but I don't know that I'm totally sold on mechanical engineering as the field for me. In some ways I was looking forward to trying different engineering disciplines as a volunteer researcher after work this next year to be sure that I ended up in the right field. I don't want to repeat the mistake I made when I was 22 and jumped on an opportunity at what sounded like a cool, interesting industry, only to realize half a decade later it wasn't what I had projected on it from the outside. 

So my question is, how much wiggle room is there in a mechanical engineering masters (masters of science) to work as, say, an electrical or computer engineer afterward? I've really enjoyed my EE and CoE coursework, those fields are growing quickly and will continue to do so for many years, and they are both huge parts of the economy where I live. I have friends who're doing Ph.D.s and it seems like they can somewhat reinvent themselves with their research projects (one is in a neuroscience program but she does mathematical modelling and is effectively an EE - she's finagling now to get that as her Ph.D. title instead of neuroscience), and there are professors doing research on mechatronics at the school that made the offer. Would that kind of coursework and research be valuable if I wanted to work in consumer electronics, microprocessor design, or software? (I have a harder time believing software unless it's control systems in mechatronics).

I have tried building a prototype of my design using an 8ft 2x4 and legos. There were many faults with my prototype but it functioned enough that i want to see if I can build a better one.

So I want to make something that will consist of a vertical rail approx 8ft tall. On it would ride a small slide that is motorized. The time it takes for the motor to drive the slide the whole length of the rail in one direction would be something between 30 and 60 seconds. The slide needs to be able to carry something about 2-3 pounds. The whole rig needs to be stable and not wobble. It should stand on the floor and be easily moved to other locations. I am thinking ideally the rail could be broken down into two 4ft sections (or hinged @4ft).

So does anyone have suggestions on building something like this? Perhaps links to places that I can buy the rail/slide? Or suggestions of parts to build my own.. I dont really want to spend a lot on building this but I realize I will have to spend a little bit buying things..

4,How do you determine the amplitude of sine wave to find cut off frequency?,1468203105,"I'm doing a control course and I am a bit confused about frequency response. Let's say I have a system with a cut off frequency of 10 Hz. What I've always thought was that this cut off frequency does not change no matter what, as it is a intrinsic property of the system.

But I think this cut off frequency could be easily changed. Consider the following two scenarios:

 - We are controlling a mechanical jack. The input is a sine wave with amplitude of 0.2, let's say we do a bunch of tests with the same input wave but we just change the frequency and keep the amplitude constant, 0.2, and we figure out the cut off frequency is around 10 Hz. i.e. If the input is a sine wave with a frequency larger than 10 HZ the jack doesn't have enough time to reach the desired amplitude of input sine wave, 0.2.

-
- Now in the same scenario let's change, increase it, the amplitude and find the frequency response again. Let's say increase it from 0.2 to 0.4. I believe in this case the cut off frequency would decrease because the mechanical system has to travel a larger distance and it would reach it's limit at a lower frequency.


Does this make sense? If so, how should one perform a frequency response test? How do you determine the amplitude?

8,Calculating required motor torque.,1468193461,"Im having a bit of a derp moment and wanted to check I have this right before purchasing some motors.

We have a robot that runs currently on motors rated for a max torque of ~15 N/cm. These run fine but when its fully laden it can cause it to 'stutter' as the motors aren't providing enough torque. To combat this we are getting new motors but also reducing the wheel size from 10cm to 5cm. I want to calculate the required torque from the new motors with smaller wheels to allow the new setup to match the driving force of the previous motors with the larger wheels.

Initially I began with the obvious 'Torque = Force * Distance' before quickly realising that nope... thats not right, thats for a lever! So my calculations now go as follows:

Calculate the driving force from the current motors:

    T = 15 N/cm
    R = 5 cm
    
    Total driving force = T / R = 3 N 

Then to calculate the torque for the new motor with smaller wheels.

    r = 2.5 cm
    F(target driving) = 3 N

    Torque = R * F(target driving) = 7.5 N/cm

So I believe that the required torque from the new motor with smaller wheels would be 7.5 N/cm. This would allow it to perform the same as the current system.

4. Positions ranging from upper level management to low skill hourly labor have not been being filled. Positions keep getting consolidated inside the company. Our workforce has shrunken about 15% over the past year (around 160 employees total)
5. Our site is averaging 2.2 X the company's TRIR (total record-able incidents rate). We have become a focal point for corporate safety policy enforcement and are being scrutinized.

I also read about [formulas just involving the spring's geometry and shear modulus](http://www.springhouston.com/spring-information/spring-engineering.html). But that doesn't seem to give a hint on the spring preload which may be present.

*The goal is:* Buying two types of replacement pull springs to replace the ones of some black and some white keys of every octave, so that the black keys among themselves and the white keys among themselves can be pressed down a certain distance by means of the same amount of force.

Please help me out with the steps required to achieve this goal.

22,Liquid fuel engine help,1468112297,"Hello, I have been considering building a small liquid rocket engine just as a project in the summer. I have been using this book/site (https://risacher.org/rocket/) for a reference, and while it has a lot of useful information, I still have some questions. First is the whole injector system. The engine will use gaseous oxygen and gasoline as propellants, and it will use spray nozzles to inject it. How exactly does this work in terms of connecting the spray nozzles to the combustion chamber? If you go to the fabrication section on the site, there is a schematic of the engine, and just have trouble understanding the injection process. Second is the machining. Is this something where I can go to a machine shop in the city and ask to be built? I obviously have neither the machine or the skill to do it on my own so how would one go about that. Third is the size, this engine is pretty small, around 3-4 inches in length and almost 2 in diameter, would it be wise to scale it up? I'm trying to learn as much as I can about the practical side of this subject and any insight would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

26,Should I ask for a higher salary given this situation?,1468096043,"A little background info on me. I went to a relatively new university and graduated with a BSME this past May with a 2.94 GPA. Not great, but I don't believe it represents my work ethic. I interned for an HVAC company in the midwest last summer and absolutely loved it and they loved me. I applied right out of school and was offered a job at 60k for Mechanical Design. I declined it however because this job was for their location in Virginia (I needed a few years of training first) and after visiting, it just wasn't my type of place. My goal as of late is to get a job here in LA where I live. 

This past week, I was offered a job as a Controls Engineer for an autoclave design company. I'm not entirely sure the entire size of the company but the Controls team has about 11 members. The position opened because one of their engineers wanted more time with his kids. The job requires 50-70% travel and I was offered a salary of 60k. The engineering manager said that realistically, once I start traveling, I'll be realistically be making around $75k due to travel subsistence and working the occasional Saturday. they said it's not a traditional 9-5 job and I might have to stay up to 10 hours sometimes to get the job done for the day. 

Anyways, 60k didn't sound bad to me at first because I was going to live with my parents while I saved/paid off school loans (22k), but their offer included a 3k relocation package to move north within 30 minute commute of the location (current commute going to be around 1.5-2 hrs). while 3k is nice, moving out will become a recurring bill and the rent in the SFV above LA is not really cheaper from what I've seen than the other areas of LA. They want me close so I don't get burnt out with long commutes + constant travel. however, I don't have to move nearby nor accept the relocation so there's that too. 

When I was asked about how much I wanted to get paid in the interview, I said I wasn't sure being a new grad and all but that I had just received an offer for 60k in Virginia where the cost of living is lower and I was expecting maybe around that adjusted for LA. To which the Engineering Manager said '60k coming out of school? that's pretty steep, they must have really liked you'. so maybe it was more than the average. but I also know that my mom's coworker's son and his friend used to work there and her son made 80k fresh out of getting his MS and his friend made 65k with a BS. I don't think they were in the Controls team though and I never met them so maybe the mother had the numbers wrong or something. But I feel like 60k is too low for having to pay rent for a place I'll won't be in 50-70% of the time. but the commute is long and I'm no fan of driving, especially in traffic. Should I ask for more like around 65k? I read that rent should be no more than 30% your gross salary and the median rent price in that area is like $1700/month which comes out to a gross salary of 68k which is manageable assuming I really do make 75k when traveling and they didn't just tell me that number to convince me to accept 60k. But I don't want to lose the offer because it seems like an interesting job and I want to try Controls (however I'm pretty inexperienced in it. I was asked technical questions in the interview related to EE and could only get them after being given a hint so I know I'm not adequately prepared at the moment. I just know I'm a quick learner). But if it comes down to it, I'm confident I could probably find another job. it's only been 1.5 months since graduation and I've had two offers out of like 8 applications (taking it slow haha). The HVAC company I worked for even called to tell me about a software engineer position that opened and if I was interested so I don't think losing out on this would be the end of the world. What do you guys think?

I am a junior going into senior year studying Aerospace Engineering at Arizona State University with a GPA of 3.76. I'm the president of a relevant club, and I'm going to get my Master's degree.

Currently I only have one internship (the one I'm in now at Orbital ATK)
I think there are 2 paths I can take.

**Path 1:**

* Summer 2016 Work at OA

* Fall 2016 school and intern at OA

* Spring 2017 school and intern at OA

* Spring 2017 Graduate with bachelors

* Summer 2017 Intern somewhere else

* Fall 2017 Pray I can find an internship during school during Master's 

* Spring 2018 hopefully interning still during school

* Spring 2018 Graduate with Master's

* Summer 2018 Real work 

**Path 2:**

* Summer 2016 Work at OA

* Fall 2016 school and intern at OA

* Spring 2017 pause school intern **out of state** 

* Summer 2017 continue interning out of state or intern instate (wherever relevant)

* Fall 2017 Pray I can find an internship during school

* Fall 2017 Graduate with Bachelor's in December

* Spring 2018 hopefully interning still during school during Master's

* Summer 2018 Intern

* Fall 2018 Intern and school 

* Fall/Winter 2018 graduate and start real work.

Essentially, I'm on Path 1, which is on schedule and I can graduate one semester earlier than Path 2, however I'd have less internship experience. If I stay on Path 1, I'd have 2 internships under my belt, whereas with Path 2 I'd have 3+ internships, but I'm in school one extra semester.

Is that extra internship/experience worth it? Can I negotiate a significant increase in salary?

29,Salt dome and Brine Storage?,1468078308,"If you have saturated brine stored in a pit in a salt dome, will the pit change shape over time? 

Context: People use solution mining to make large, cheap caverns in salt domes to store [oil.](http://energy.gov/fe/services/petroleum-reserves/strategic-petroleum-reserve/spr-storage-sites) This works well because salt is not soluble in oil. 

If you put water into one of these caverns, you would rapidly get saturated brine (and a slightly larger cave.) If you had an insulated pool on the surface (so the brine doesn't change temperature) you could have underground [pumped hydro storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity).

If you line the caverns or use a balloon or something, the salt and the water don't interact until the lining leaks. Which it will, eventually.

If you use unlined caves and saturated brine, on the average you don't get any salt going into or coming out of the water; that's what saturated means. But are there second order effects, where (for instance) some salt precipitates and some salt dissolves and the cavern collapses or changes shape or something?",AskEngineers,nebulousmenace,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4s0rgw/salt_dome_and_brine_storage/

Bouncing some theories around I wondered if perhaps it was some residual stress after surface grinding or perhaps even after seeing temperatures used for the physical vapor deposition process. They only used the TiN coating as corrosion protection (which it's not very good at anyway) so I was looking at using a grade of stainless steel instead. Currently the process also requires the metal to be ferritic as they use a magnetic back to the plate. Not that it couldn't be changed if needed though.

64,MS instead of first proper position?,1467949788,"I graduated in May with a Mechanical Engineering degree and 3.15 gpa however I have been unable to land a proper engineering position. Last summer I was an intern at a biomed company and worked in the quality and manufacturing departments as a kinda rotational program. Since I did not have a job when I graduated in May, I reached out to my boss at that internship and was able to get a part time position as a CNC swiss lathe operator, which is what I have been doing recently. I've applied to nearly 100 or so positions and have really only heard back for opportunities as a technician or quality engineer. While I think these positions could provide an interesting insight into dealing with and supporting a product, I really have no interest in them. 


As far as career goals go, I know I want to live outside of the US again for a period of time, however I'm not totally set on what field I really want to go in to, although I do know I want to do design work. So while attempting to somehow fit that into the rough future outline I have in my head, now I find myself wrestling with going back to school for a year or two or continuing to try to find a job.


For the MS degree, I am still between coursework and thesis, however I know acting as a research assistant is mandatory for the length of the program, which I think is awesome. I would like to get a PhD at some point because I find the idea of teaching later in life really attractive and I am looking at either Materials Science or Optomechanical Design as my concentration.

Got a pump off a craigslist to clean inground swimming pools. Its an above ground pool pump that is ""self priming"" meaning that its best used in a scenario where the pool water height is above the flow-in opening (B).  After a frustrating 45 minutes I finally got it to pump water, but I of course didn't write down or exactly remember what I did. I believe it was because I brought the back-wash hoses end (D) to the same height as the flow-out opening (C), filled it with water, then filled the prime chamber, as best I could, and then did my best to fill the clean up hose with water.   
Numerous times as I turned the pump on I'd get small surge of water into the prime chamber, followed by water movement.  
The biggest issue is that the ""Prime Chamber"" I cannot fill completely up with the setup, as the water flows back into the clean up hose. I think I could fix this by orientating the pump perpendicularly to the ground. with the flow-out parrel to the ground.

80,Alloy selection for high speed - high load bushing,1467911288,"Concept picture of rig here http://i.imgur.com/oyRzb7T.jpg
Carriage is dropped and guided along rails via linear bushings, impacts anvil at the center of gravity directly in between the rails. (Ignore the bent tubes at the base)

I can't use ball bearings or other fairly sophisticated linear motion devices as I plan to have the carriage moving at a peak 15 m/s and bearing loads during impact could reach as high as 40 kN if there is misalignment, so I've been looking closely at brass/bronze bushings instead. This leads me to my problem;

Any alloy rated for high loads is limited to low speeds (galling and seizing problems), and anything rated for high speed is limited to low loads (deformation problems). That being said, while the carriage is falling the loads on the bushings will be minuscule, and when the loads are high the speed will already have decreased dramatically. Can I use a harder alloy like aluminum bronze or manganese bronze for this application (even though they are rated for low speeds) and avoid galling and the like during free fall because the loads are low, or do I need to use a softer alloy to achieve these speeds? Are there any ways to work around significant stress deformation of soft alloys other than precision alignment of the system, like using a thin bushing with a hardened steel backing?",AskEngineers,letsbuildshit,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4rpolx/alloy_selection_for_high_speed_high_load_bushing/

87,"Minivar, a single-phase automatic PFI unit for domestic use. Why isn't it more considered worldwide?",1467884859,"Hi engineers of Reddit, I hope I am not breaking any rules though I feel I am in the right place for my very first post. I am a soon-to-be-graduated (foreign) engineer, specialized in the energy field, at a university in northern Europe (cannot make names, yet. I can only say that we recently had Brexit, doh). 

Until now I have been working, along with my tutor, on my thesis (I hope I can publish it one day) that basically talks about the difficulties and the solutions of power factor correction in the domestic field.

I knew that it would have been a tough argument, especially because by googling the theme I encountered infinite scams. Anyway my teachers informed me that my uni had previously worked with some international companies that worked on a aforementioned unit, that could fit in my thesis.

Obviously I knew that there have been multiple solutions that tried to provide power factor improvement for domestic use, indeed I had a contact in Japan, but I never received any answers to my questions.

My tutor and I eventually contacted an Italian firm that patented the unit in the title. It is the only device that actually follows realistic rules and does not promise miraculous savings on bills. Based on what they write on their website the benefits of this unit are:

* To the end users, having a supply with a maximum current limiting switch that disconnects the supply in case of current exceeding the preset value. By achieving a PF compensation to 0.98/1 it becomes possible to reduce untimely tripping of the limiting swicthing and/or to get the most current permitted by the electricity supply board.
* To the electricity supply board, in order to reduce the losses along the lines between the user and the distribution substation and for an increasing the supply capacity thanks to the reduction of the reactive current along these lines.
* To the environment by contributing to a more efficient production, distribution and usage of the electric energy.

As long as I am proposing this as solution for PFI in the domestic field across my thesis: how come that this device is not widespread in all those countries that actually need it in every home?
The company said that their main requests come from South America and Middle Asia, but I am thinking: what about all those contries that notoriously have power factor issues, like US or East Asia or South Africa and so on? Merci to anyone that feels me.

http://www.satellite-bandwidth.net/NewEra-2014/equipment-manuals/Prodelin/1184%20RxTx.pdf

I pretty much know nothing about electrodynamics so I am truly starting from scratch. My plan is to fabricate a circular waveguide to concentrate the radio waves from the reflector so that a stub antenna can receive them. The signals will then go to a low noise amplifier and then to a software defined radio module connected to a computer.

The target frequency is 1420 MHz, and so such a waveguide should be optimized for this frequency. I read that a waveguide for this application should support a resonant mode at the desired frequency, and that a simple longitudinal resonant mode can be acheived by making the cavity length wavelength/2, in this case 10.5cm since the wavelength of 1420 MHz is 21cm.

The biggest problem is that I need the radiation pattern from this waveguide to cover roughly 70 degrees to illuminate the dish properly. At this point I am in the dark about how to find out the proper waveguide diameter to achieve this.

15,Increasing Pressure in a Pipe as Temperature Increases,1467767675,"This is related to hydrostatic testing. Basically the pipe is filled up with water and then it sits for a few hours then if the pressure gauge reads the same as when the test started then the test is successful. However I frequently get into arguments with the plumbers when the test fails by a little. They claim it is due to the temperature change outside. I feel like this would be negligible but I want to calculate it to see who is right.

So far I figured I have four major contributors. 

1. Volume Expansion of Water

a_v=(1/V_0)(dV/dT)
where a_v is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient
V_0= is the initial volume
dV is the change in volume
dT is the change in temperature

Source
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion#Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion

I solved this for dV/dV_0=a*dT and I know everything else

2. Volume expansion of the pipe
I plan am using the same equation as for the water but with different constant a

3. Compressibility of Water
B=-(1/V_0)(dV/dP)
where
B is the compressibility of water
dP is the change in pressure

Source
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressibility

I solved this for dV/dV_0=B*dP, I also know compressibility

4. Pipe increase in volume due to the increase in pressure from the water expanding
I could not find a source for this so I used Hooke's Law

Sigma=E*e
where E= Youngs Modulus
e= strain
sigma equals stress

I plugged in dP for sigma and dV/V_0 for e.
I solved this for dV/V_0=dP/E, and I know the Modulus.

Next I combined the volumes(dV/V_0) as follows:
Expansion of Water from temperature-Compressibility of water=Expansion of Pipe from the temperature+Expansion of Pipe from the water Pressure
a_H20*dT+B*dP=a_steel*dT+dP/E
Now I solved for the dP term to get my answer so
dP=((a_H20-a_steel)dT)/(B+1/E) however my answers are in the thousands of psi which clearly  is not right(I did convert to psi to Pa)
for reference
B=0.0004478(1/MPA)
a_H20=0.000207(1/deg C)
a_steel=0.000026(1/degC)
E=200(Gpa)
dT=10(deg C)


The pipe is filled with water, so please do not suggest the ideal gas law. I only say this because others have suggested this. I have searched online but have not found anything which is really surprising because I am sure someone has probably worked this out before. I would appreciate any advise at all, maybe I am completely on the wrong track. Thank you for reading.

Edit: the pressure in the pipe is usually held at 150psi if that matters.

18,Equal displacement turbocharged V8 vs turbo V6 ? (both 500 HP). Asked this question in r/cars and got led here. *not a homework question*,1467754708,"I know that there are a ton of variables that come into play and I try to minimize them as much as possible, Please try to answer my question as best as possible, thank you.


Okay so lets say we're comparing 2 turbocharged engines with identical displacement, and peak power output of 500 HP, but the differences are the number of cylinders and the amount of rpm and boost required to reach 500hp output, (let all other performance variables such as direct injection, equal length headers, or 4 valves per cylinder, etc be the same and turbocharger(s) are optimized for each engine).

The v6 will be 90 degree bank angle with shared crankpins, so odd firing order of 150-90-150-90-150-90 but even per bank (240-240-240)

The v8 will be 90 degree bank angle, crossplane crankshaft, so even firing order of 90-90-90-90-90-90-90-90 but odd per bank (180-90-180-270)


Lets both place them at 3435cc


The v6 having a bore and stroke of (90mm x 90mm).


The v8 with a bore and stroke of (77.9mm x 90mm)


Assume the max safe recommended rpm for 90mm stroke is 7500 rpm due to max piston speed, but the v8's rpm limit will be slightly higher because of lighter reciprocating mass.


To make this easy, we'll say that each intake valve's (2 per cylinder) area is 30% of the cylinder bore area and each exhaust valve (2 per cylinder) is 20% of the cylinder bore area, we'll use this for both engines. No matter what percentage you use for the areas of the valves, the v8 will always have more total valve area. In this case, the v6's total would be 162mm for intake, 108mm for exhaust, and the v8's would be 187.1mm for intake, 124.7mm for exhaust, (even though the v8's Bore:stroke ratio is UNDERSQUARE it still has over 13% more total valve area).


The v8 also has the advantage that it's bore:stroke ratio is about .866:1, or 86.6% which gives it less surface area to volume ratio, this promotes far better thermal efficiency, so better fuel burn, and allows for the use of a higher compression ratio on the same octane fuel than the v6 before having to worry about detonation. Thus increases fuel economy and power, though higher frictional losses.

How much more boost and rpm would the v6 (90x90mm) require to make equal power to the v8 (77.9x90mm), and at that point, which would have better fuel economy?

note: this is NOT a homework question. It's out of my curiosity and enthusiasm for motorsports, and my quest of over 4 years to find the optimal engine configuration for my intentions of use. And I also plan on building a custom engine in the future, so it's relevant to my finances.

My dad gave me [this digital multimeter](http://i.imgur.com/NUWkxeZ.jpg) and I've been toying around with it. [It's max DC voltage is 1000 and AC voltage is 750](http://i.imgur.com/DMkkmw1.jpg), so I used it to measure the voltage on a wall outlet (supposed to be like 110-120 VAC in the US) and it came out to [this](http://i.imgur.com/KQ3wgI2.jpg). Cool!     
   
Our old water softener broke so we had to get it a new one. I got to keep all the electronics from the old one - they look like [this](http://imgur.com/a/PtwWo). You see that separated metal thing to the right of the first image? I believe it's a small motor that drove all those gears in the second pic (that's where it came from). Some kind of a timer I guess?     
   
Anyways, the motor was wired up like [this](http://i.imgur.com/JlFbeW0.jpg). I wanted to just see the motor working, so I pulled off those blue cap things and got [this](http://i.imgur.com/C1ZWzlZ.jpg). On the back the motor say [this](http://i.imgur.com/pqKiI9z.jpg). 115 Volts AC right?    
   
So, **Here are my questions:** Can I plug this into my wall outlet, and if so, how do I do it safely? My wall outlet measured 121 VAC. It says it takes 115 VAC. Am I gonna to break it if feed it a couple extra volts? Furthermore, how do I actually physically plug it in (wow this sounds stupid writing it out, haha). It's of course no longer connected to a power cord, because I took it out of that whole unit. Can I just put the two exposed wires in [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/C1ZWzlZ.jpg) directly into the socket, or is that dangerous? Is there enough insulation on those wires to protect me? How do I know which wire is supposed to go to the live terminal and which wire is supposed to go to neutral on the outlet? If I reverse the voltage, is that fine - does the motor just spin the other way?
   
All I know is that wall outlet are nothing to fuck with because they put out enough volts to seriously hurt/or kill you - so I'm just trying to be cautious. I was even freaked out putting the test prongs on the multimeter in there to measure the damn voltage!    
   
Anyways, thanks for any help! Sorry for the likely noob questions.   
    
Edit: formatting    
Edit 2: I went ahead and tested it using the procedure /u/SrSkippy layed out. It didn't work :/. I may try switching the connections to the power cord - both of the wires from the motor were black, and I didn't know which was supposed to be live and which one was supposed to be neutral.

I've spend the past few days getting acquainted with what is possible, then decided a reddit post would be a good place to get more advice more quickly.

Now, I've talked to a couple of people at the university I go to about what can be done. We can 3D print hollow tubes using harder plastics, which is good. In our lab, we've done model building before where we sort of 3D printed a model using cylindrical metal tubes in a cast of agarose. What I want to do is put these two things together, and 3D print models with agarose gel, which has similar mechanical properties to human tissue.

What I want to do is similar, but different. My airway network is, at its core a system of hollow tubes.

The hollow tube material I would want to be agarose gel, or something similar, which has similar mechanical properties to lung tissue. 

I know agarose is water soluble, which means it probably can't get 3D printed. But, some more flexible materials may be equally suitable.

I'd like to fix the position of the ball-and-socket joint and the other simple joints (simple linkages), i.e. fix the position of the device so that it's all suspended by the ball joint and not moving..

If there were a way to do this in one motion with the left hand, instead of manually screwing things in (which seems more error prone) it would be pretty cool.

So, mechanical engineers: how can a hand simultaneously apply pressure to a ball-and-socket and several simple linkages (as though just screwing them down)? Is there a simple way to apply this friction pressure?  (Preferably with some kind of switch you can push on and push back off.)

My time in Cambodia has given me a desire to be able to use engineering to raise living standards in the developing world.

So my question is, would I be able to do that with an education in either civil or structural engineering? I don't care about making a lot of money. If I can raise a family on a moderately tight budget and repay school loans, that's all I need.

Since civil engineering is often working with local governments, would an American civil engineering degree be worth anything in a place like SE Asia, Africa, or S America?

Would structural engineering be more useful internationally? 

Does anybody have experience doing international development engineering?

Can anybody recommend a field of engineering that would be useful in developing countries? Someone suggested I could study ag science, which I'm sure would be useful, but it's not really what I want to do.",AskEngineers,Tahns,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4r6b7b/question_about_international_development_and/
61,"What would you consider as constituting an ""engineering internship""?",1467614070,"Throwaway because I like to keep my personal details off my main account, sorry if this bothers anyone.

What do you consider to be an ""engineering internship""? I ask this because at a career fair at my university, I was asked whether I had worked any engineering internships before, and had to sheepishly say no.

I finished my second year of chem. eng. in May and am now working an internship at a wastewater treatment plant (sewage). I intern in the operations and maintenance division, and work under a maintenance engineer. My job is basically miscellaneous support tasks such as compiling lubricant quantities for various motors and pumps from manuals and field verification, creating life cycle cost analysis models of things like boiler systems to analyze whether to repair or replace, et cetera. Not a labor job, and not extremely technical, although somewhat technical.

Would you consider this to qualify as an ""engineering internship""?

I’ve notice a lot of people using palm routers like the [Dewalt 611]( https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DWP611-Torque-Variable-Compact/dp/B0048EFUV8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467464789&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dewalt+611) which, if my calculations are correct, clocks in at the following specs : 


•	$122


•	932.12W


•	25k RPM


•	0.28 Nm (0.21 lbft)



Now this spindle is great, I’ve seen LOTS of cncs using this, however, it is incredibly noisy. I have my cnc out in a small shed 4’x6’ and having a noisy spindle isn’t ideal. Therefore, I’ve been looking for other options. I then came across a spindle that is [Water Cooled VFD]( http://www.ebay.com/itm/FOUR-BEARING-ER20-2-2KW-WATER-COOLED-MOTOR-SPINDLE-AND-DRIVE-INVERTER-VFD-CNC/251191469666?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&amp;_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20131003132420%26meid%3D85b41a7f5d424fa49d7b8b7efd5b7e16%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D3%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D221995590779), which clocks in at the following specs: 


•	$325


•	2200W


•	24k RPM


•	0.7 Nm (0.52 lbft) 

At this point I’m starting to get some sticker shock because I would like to keep the cost down under $100. So I kept on digging and finally I came across a guy using a [Brushless DC motor for his spindle](http://www.raynerd.co.uk/brushless-dc-motor-cnc-high-speed-spindle/). Now I didn’t find his motor exactly, but I did find ones that was similar in power to the VFD spindle. [Here](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idproduct=18127) which clocks in at the following specs:


•	$60


•	2360W


•	260kv (which if I understand this correctly is 260 RPM) *more clarification on this would 
be great


•	69.35 Nm (51.15 lbft)


Now, the only grey area for me is the 260kv vs RPM. I don’t understand why they don’t just list the RPM? I also don’t understand how this little spindle the size of a baseball can put out more torque than the VFD spindle that is the size of an Arizona Iced Tea. So, getting to the meat and potatoes of my question, why aren’t these little Brushless DC Motors used more often for CNC Spindles? Am I missing something? I mean, sure, you’d have to create a housing for it and everything but I imagine if a manufacturing shop would take this on it would be very profitable if they sold them at $100/e. Now, I’ve been doing research as to how much torque I actually need in the first place, and I found this calculator: 


[Link](http://www.custompartnet.com/calculator/milling-horsepower)


To make things easier to follow, I’ve created this [Google Doc Spread sheet]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_FpoqB5xsB742VRx75PTN3jIbL_6lTF9BZv5-gZlfow/edit?usp=sharing)


Sheet 1 is the Spindle comparison and Sheet 2 is the Torque required calculation spread out by endmill diameter (sorry that the formulas didn’t transfer in, I made this in excel first and copied and pasted) 


Ok so I think  that about wraps it up. I’m a Mech Engineer myself, so if you need to drop any sort of math on me, because I’m pretty sure I’m missing something, feel free. 


Also just found [this](http://www.burger-web.com/ProductDescription/AKKON_Spindle/en_AKKON_Spindle.htm.en) and I was wondering if this would also be a viable option.

I'm asking people who majored in computer/electrical engineering. 

1- What is your job and what do you do on a daily basis? Do you enjoy it?

2- Do you feel that all the hard work in school is worth it in the end?

3- Any advice?

I just read the sidebar about not asking about undergrad degrees/majors after writing this so I'm not sure if this is a bad post or not. Sorry.

7,"Get a master's in mechanical engineering, business administration, or not at all? - A question for current engineering professionals",1467349545,"Hello All,

I am currently a 3rd Year ME, at a Top-5 engineering school. I've had three internships so far, two of which were at top automotive and aerospace companies. My career interests lie in design &amp; testing, where I can utilize some combination of theoretical &amp; technical knowledge with design for manufacture knowledge; for example, structural component design: essentially, something where I can use my hands and head. I've got specific positions at two of my past internships in mind which fit this description. I plan on working at one of those in an intense department (60+ hrs/wk) for a few years, learning as much as I can, then transferring to a calmer department or company to start a family. Above all, I take pride in my work, and would be satisfied at any company which solves tough issues and/or affects the general population greatly.  


I was just accepted into the BS/MS program at my college, where I have the option of studying masters without research (can finish in 1 year, will cost ~50k) or with research (can finish in 1.5-2 years, will cost nothing, may get paid). 
* If I decide to pursue a master's I am leaning towards the research option, for obvious reasons.   
* If I decide to pursue a master's, I would prefer to do it now, straight out of undergrad because if I do not, and plan to come back with the financial backing of my future employer, I fear that I will then be satisfied with my position and not want to go for the masters.   
* My primary motivation for pursuing a masters is future career growth (becoming a manager easily), and a secondary motivation of increased pay (I will have ~160k loans from undergrad, so anything will help)  
* If i do not do my master's, my GF and I will graduate UG at the same time and can move straight to the company where I had my last internship (where I would likely have an offer). Else, she will have to work in our current city for 1-2 years and try to sort out a transfer in order to move.  
* My manager at my last internship (which is also my dream company) made it clear that he would like to hire me on after UG, but was not so sure about hiring after i finish grad, presumably because it is more distant in the future, and he doesn't know what the need may be.   


**SO, if you made it this far, the question is:** Should I
* screw the master's program, have a smooth transition with my GF, get into the industry, make that money asap to get rid of those loans, and slowly rise up into a senior role as I progress my career? Is it even possible to rise into a senior position without a master's, given the increasing competition? Does your manager currently have a master's degree?  
* absolutely do a master's, let loans be loans, have the opportunity and freedom to take on various technical roles that I may become interested in later, jump into a senior position quickly, and eventually become a very experienced, very rich man?  
* don't do an engineering master, join the industry, get an MBA (prob part-time, nights), and use that to progress my career rapidly? Will an MBA lead to a managerial role with different responsibilities than with an engineering master's?

20,I have an idea for a new type of color e-reader that I want to develop with an engineer at my University- should I talk to a patent attorney first?,1467309719,"Basically, I think my invention idea is for something nobody's done before in color ereaders that is more cost-efficient and gives a better picture quality and brighter colors than past color ereaders.

It will use the same technology as a regular black &amp; white kindle eink reader- with positive and negative electrodes to shift positively charged white pigment to the front of back of a pixel on a screen.

My university, The University Of Waterloo, has a large and very prestigious science &amp; engineering program- I know I would be able to find someone there to help me make a prototype by asking professors and students I know, but I don't want anyone I talk to or partner with to steal my idea and do it themselves. Should I talk to a patent attorney first?

My problem is that without a prototype I don't know if I can even patent this idea, I want to make sure it'll work first, and also I don't have a lot of money. 

What should I do? Get an engineering partner first? Once I tell him my idea I don't think, honestly, an engineer would even need me- they could easily steal it and do it themselves, it's so simple. But I honestly think this idea will change the game in color ereaders.

The problem is that I am trained as a physicist, not an engineer (my primary job is teaching physics, I didn't lie on my resume or anything).
I am trying to come up with some chemical engineering projects for the kids (Juniors and Seniors in HS), and I thought that soap making, and candy making might be a good idea.
With candy, one can test the brittleness of the resulting candy, as well as its ability to test shearing forces, tensile forces and compression forces. These parameters can be mapped against the final temperature of the batch, the amount of sugar, and the starting-final mass of the ingredients (to test how much water has evaporated). I think that this is simple enough (COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS ARE WELCOME, I AM LOOKING FOR HELP!)
Another (possibly more simple) project might be to make soap. The kids could use different starting oils, and different bases (potassium hydroxide vs. sodium hydroxide) and test the resulting soaps.
I have many questions:
First, is this even what engineers do?!
Are these projects applicable to chemical engineering?
Are there any other pertinent tests (or more pertinent tests) that would be better for the candy?
What can be tested with the soap? (I would like to test its hardness [since different bases and oils are supposed to produce different levels of hardness], as well as its efficacy...

26,Advice with polycarbonate material for a stage magician,1467282909,"Hi there guys,
I'm a magician from Australia and I am working on a new stage effect that I affectionately call ""The Fish Tank"". The effect goes along the lines of my head being placed inside the tank and then it has water poured into it. I have to make my escape before I drown. 

(Please note I do consult with and work with other professional magicians on this effect, I understand the risks involved and I have safeguards in place so that I don't actually get anywhere near drowning. Magic only has to look real, I'm not stupid enough to actually do this for real...) 

Anyway the dimensions for it are 300mm cubed. I plan on using clear polycarbonate sheets for it but am unsure on how to determine the thickness for the sheets so they don't break from the pressure of the water. Also plan on using aluminium angle brackets and rivets to secure the four sides and base. The top will be hinged on. 

Additional note on the base. It is actually three separate pieces: 1 groove base and 2 separate plates with a semi circle cut into them to make a hole for my neck. These plates slide into the base through a groove. There will also be material in place around the semicircle to mold it to my neck to prevent leaks and for added comfort. 
I had planned for the groove plate to be 10mm thick and then neck plates to slide through the groove.

35,How do I create/find a box to hold an atmosphere inside vacuum?,1467238216,"Hi,

I'm a graduate student with a project involving testing some electronics for space based applications.  These electronics need to be at atmospheric pressure, however, so I want to put them inside a sealed box holding pressure with wires going in and out, and put the box inside a vacuum chamber.

Thing is, most sealed enclosures seem to be designed for underwater uses, so they're designed against a lot of pressure pushing in, while in this case it's going to be 1 atm pushing out.  Can I just use waterproofed containers (IP-68) and would they be able to hold in a vacuum?  Are there any industries that would make small (6"" x 6"" x 6"" ish) containers designed to be overpressured 1 atm from the inside?  I've been searching for a few hours, but no one seems to comment on the ability to hold pressure from the inside unless it's a compressed air tank, which is excessive.  Being able to see inside the container is a big bonus too.

I'm considering building one myself, but it would take time and money to machine, and I'm not really sure where to start.  Any help at all would be really appreciated, thank you!

40,"19th Century, water-powered mill help?",1467228060,"I'm a digital artist. I need to recreate a (pseudo)operating 19th century mill for a puzzle game (running by water wheel). I have a few general questions that would really help in getting the design process started. 

First, once the water wheel is in motion, how would you engage/disengage gears? What mechanisms were used to move shafts/gears into alignment? (Could you even engage once the wheel was spinning?)

If the wheel is being fed by an overhead trough (which has an adjustable gate for flow control), will the head pressure of the reservoir create a noticeable difference in power output? So, assuming the trough gate is left open at a constant position - will there be a marked difference in wheel speed if the reservoir water level is at 1 foot above the trough opening vs. 3 feet above? (Hopefully that makes sense...)

For the period (let's say mid 19th century), would there be any mechanism for turning a particular shaft for a set amount of rotations and then automatically disengaging it? Specifically, imagine a large door. The water wheel is engaged and running. I need the player to engage a gear driving the door (as per first question), the gear opens the door - but then disengages from the system. Did they have the tech for this?

Again, I'm only creating a lite-simulation. I don't need anything to be exact or have the correct math running under the surface - I just want it to look and feel plausible. 

Any help is appreciated! Even pointing to sources that may give me more insight would be great.   

I'm sure the answers to the questions are pretty easy to find, but with not even some basic engineering background, I'm finding it hard to find what I need. 

EDIT: Another question - would a clutch ever fail to engage if an engine/water wheel was running at too high a speed? (I'm trying to backwards design some puzzles). ",AskEngineers,ian80,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4qhddk/19th_century_waterpowered_mill_help/

43,Need to find an irregularity in a 3D scanned object (metrological problem),1467217137,"Good day, I have a bit of a problem and after having spent hours without coming up with a good solution, came here to ask for some advice.

Essentially, [I have a 3d scan of an underground tunnel](http://imgur.com/RcRenJl). Now, over time, this tunnel has started to ""crush-in"" a slight bit from the forces above. My task is to identify any potential points where the tunnel has been crushed in too much. I don't recall the exact numbers, but I think the tunnel is like 20m long and I'm looking for any places where it has become irregular by as little as 0.06m.

Analogically, imagine that you have a pipe and you hit the pipe with a baseball bat. Obviously, the bat probably left a slight curve inside the pipe. If it was only a slight curve, it wouldn't pose any problems for the pipe's functionality, but if it were to reduce the ratius by too much - there might be a flowing problem. That's the sort of problem im dealing with.

The tool that I'm using, as you see, is Geomagic. It's been designed specifically for metrological 3d object analysis so I'm sure it has to have some sort of way to solve the problem.

Here are some things that I've tried or just don't know how to use:

1. I first tried to run a Contour Detection to find any inwards angles in the tunnel. [After fidling around with it, I got this result](http://imgur.com/FsvdD22). Am I correct to think that the connecting points are basically the critical points where there is a big inwards curve? If so, that would make it all quite a bit easier. There were only 4 such big points, but I'm not entirely sure on how to effective check how bad the curve is. Maybe somehow compare to to another section a meter or so to a side?

2. I tried to colorcode the elevation of the entire mesh. This way I could check for points where the tunnel's elevation is too low compared to points next to it on the same x axis. Problem is, I can't find this tool. Only thing close is a Deviation tool, but I can't get it to work very well. Maybe I can use that somehow?

3. The original suggestion I was given by the person who gave me the scan is to cut the entire thing into many sections, each super thin and then check irregularities on each section. I'm not sure how to go about doing that though and without automation, it would make an eternity.

Additionally, I imagine that this problem could be solved using diferentiation, but I've not yet had a chance to put those into practice.

Any suggestions? I don't have too much time and the problem has turned out to be quite harder than it initially seemed.",AskEngineers,Felkin,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4qgdvr/need_to_find_an_irregularity_in_a_3d_scanned/

72,How hard is it to make small custom carbon fiber parts?,1467072046,"Title says most of it. This will likely not be easy nor cheap but I was wondering how hard it would be to create a custom built autoclave for small carbon fiber prepreg pieces as well as other questions about small hobby manufacturing I could do at a small level. If it ends up being way too complicated, I will end up doing the easier dry fiber and resin way. The pieces I will be making are shells for r/rccars. They are just thin car body covers. I will also be making custom chassis, which I will then use thin sheets of carbon fiber laminate or sheets, whatever they're called. That will likely be CNC cut out but I heard that CF is sometimes hard to cut due to it being abrasive. It is either this or aluminum but I like the look and some of CF properties better.


For custom thin shells like I said above, should I do prepreg or hand lay up? I like the idea of prepreg being cleaner since the epoxy is already embedded at near perfect ratios, but it seems to be quite expensive and requires heat/pressure curing. Would I be fine just vacuum bagging and putting in an oven if I were to go prepreg? I would like to keep it simple but I know carbon fiber isn't that easy to work with. I still would like to choose CF due to its appearance and the fact it is very light and strong.

I may also do driveshafts since I read about carbon fiber being very strong at tensile and torsional loads. The fact it is so light and strong means I can make the shafts thinner thus creating a very light solution. These driveshafts will probably be only a few inches long. Any ideas on how do this? The wheels might also being carbon fiber, since wheels on a car should be made as light as possible due to the rotational mass. Lighter wheels gives the car increased agility in handling and slightly better acceleration/deceleration.

Does carbon fiber go well with the sun? I also read on how UV light can ruin the epoxy. This and galvanic corrosion have me worried and I would like to keep those to a minimum if possible.

Our application varies widely but most designs include a motor, gbx, and some type of mechanical power transmission in the 208-400V range.

I have done basic PT calcs before but would like to become more familiar with them as well as broaden my understanding of quick and efficient machine design. If any of you have any tools or sources to point me in that direction that would be greatly appreciated. Or any career advice for a new graduate who is passionate about machine design and could benefit from wisdom.

83,I feel like I'm going into engineering for the wrong reason...is it worth it?,1467045449,"Sorry for the repost, if any of you are on /r/engineering as well. Just want to see if there are any differing opinions here!

This might be kind of a long post, but if you could read through it, I'd really, really appreciate it. Also, some of the concerns I may pose may be incorrect, or stereotypes, so please feel free to correct me if it isn't an accurate representation of the field.

So basically, I'm looking to go into engineering for the stability it provides in terms of job availability, and salary. Beyond just economic stability, I think that I would really enjoy building things. I just don't know if I'd like to do that as my career. 

Since I was about 14, I've been frequently scribbling down ideas for inventions I'd like to make in a notebook, and I'd be really interested in creating those. To be honest, part of the reason I'm considering engineering is because I want to be able to make those things, but I have no clue how to do so, so I'd like to maybe get some formal education and see if I can figure out how to make those things. 

I'm just nervous because I haven't been the best student in terms of STEM. I'm in accelerated math, and I've taken almost all AP/Honors math and science courses at my school. I've gotten C's in most of the courses I've taken, which I'm really just disappointed about. The one 'regular' course I took was in Precalc, and that was the year I learned the most. I remember actually enjoying math, and learning a ton because of the slower pace, but if I go into engineering, obviously math is not going to be at a slower pace. I feel like my math basics are really weak, and I never took the time to improve it. I just tried to find shortcuts to get around focusing on my skills and kept avoiding it. Eventually, I learnt more and more advanced math while my more basic math remained weak, and I kept trying to strengthen a foundation that was never built. 

That took a toll on my sciences that needed math, like physics and chemistry, and I started hating those because I never did well in them. I never understood them, and I never cared to try, and now I regret it. 

Now I have a weak basis in math, chem, physics and Computer Science, all of which I need to be very proficient in, and I am just scared. Even if I did decide that engineering was for me, I feel like there's no way I can catch up. 

I'm going to college this fall for Engineering, and I'm terrified out of my mind. My college is AMAZING for engineering, and I know everyone there's going to be super smart, and I feel so intimidated.

tl;dr Not sure if engineering is for me. Interested in it, but my academic basics are really weak, and I feel like I'm just going to be playing catch up the whole time.

90,Re: Two career paths.. Not sure what to pick,1467017528,"Note: reposting this because I put the wrong info here.

Hey. I am a recently graduated civil engineer. Due to the economic situation in my country I had to take whatever jobs that came into my way. I worked as a trainee structural engineering in one office then switched to another (due to getting no experience and poor salary with ridiculous hours)

Anyways. Now I am in this second office which has pretty good experience in structural as it works on a good number of projects. I am in my third month with them now. The salary is ok but there are 0 other benefits (no medical and no chance to develop outside of the real experience)

A few days ago I was contacted by a large oil company in my country. I was offered a quantity surveyor job with a much higher salary, full medical coverage, better and flexible hours and better overtime, gym membership and the chance to get sent on numerous courses to develop professionally. The job security with this company is secured because it is a governmental job. The experience will probably be okay, not bad and not exceptional.

I am unsure what to pick to be honest. The experience in my office is great but I don't believe I will continue as structural forever because the pay is poor in my country and more oriented towards expats and the liability is huge as you know. However, I also am unsure about quantity surveying as to whether I would enjoy it or not.

From your experience, is the extra experience worth ignoring all these benefits? Or is it not? Plus what other career opportunities would open for me if I remain structural or work as a quantity surveyor? Would both lead to management opportunities or other relevant opportunities even outside civil engineering? Thanks and much appreciated

The lower the delay time, the worse the accuracy. This confuses me because the datasheet states that the minimum delay time can be as low as 20 nanoseconds for the SI pulse and 50 nanoseconds for the CLK pulses. Since I'm still clearly above the minimum why am I losing so much accuracy?

I'd like to make a auto potato gun, but I don't want to shoot potatoes as they don't keep well and their irregular shapes make them unreliable munition to auto feed.

I found this list of potential objects to shoot out of a potato gun.
http://www.aaroncake.net/spuds/things.asp

Here are the requirements

1. Cost less than 1$ per round

2. Can be formed into a sealing cylindrical shape between 0.5"" and 3"" . 

3. Munition will biodegrade leaving no hard chunks that would damage agricultural machinery nor contaminate food (not worse than small rocks or cow dung).

4. Sabot can be used but if sabot is non-biodegradable it must land within 25 feet of the canon and be bright colored for easy cleanup.

5. Munition should not decompose in the magazine when stored in a dry location for at least 3 months. 

6. Munition should not become deformed by the weight of twelve more munition on top of it and the force of the magazine spring. (Not deform under Munition weight * 12 + 20 lbs).

7.  Munition should not disintegrate in-flight.

I have an encoder on my motor and I have an accelerometer on my mass. I then input a voltage step and record the data.

T(t)=Jα(t)+Bω(t)

T(t)=KiI(t)

But common sense tells me the torque I measure is from equation one (mechanical T). But what throws me off a bit is for torque control, I've been reading that you have to feedback current, which makes me think that I'm measuring values for equation two.

I am planning to use 2 chains, each of which would individually be rated to the lift the load on its own. Is there any need to look into another failsafe even?

I know based on this I already calculate the refrigeration load and can calculate the capacity by deciding the time to reach the cold temperature but I will use a secondary refrigerant of ethylene glycol pumped at 5 liters/minute around a mold containing the primary load.

If I get 10 liters of ethylene glycol and cool them to -15ºC then pump them around the mold then the cooling capacity would be 

Q'=m'(5 L/min)* Cp (specific heat of ethylene glycol) * (T*out*-T*in*)
T*out* would be -15ºC
is T*in* would equal to the initial temperature _before the refrigeration cycle work_ equal to the surrounding temperature about 25ºC ? 
Or the return temperature after the refrigeration work and it pumped around the mold (which I don't know how to calculate it) ?

95,Need an actuated gas valve,1466583226,"Hi all,

For a hobbyist application I want to control the CO2 in a chamber. The chamber is not completely closed so I will need a continuous stream of CO2 into it. I will have a CO2 sensor inside the chamber.

I want to do this with a pressurized CO2 bottle and an actuated gas valve between the bottle and the chamber (connected by tubing). Then through feedback control I want to control the amount of gas flow from the bottle to the chamber.


On the internet I can find a lot of (quite expensive) actuated gas valves with precisely controlled flow rate or pressure difference. What I need is just a cheap valve which can be actuated but it doesn't have to be that precise, because feedback control will take care of the appropriate CO2 concentration in the chamber.


So my question is.. What is a type of (cheap) valve suitable for this application? Also note that the pressure difference across the valve will be from atmospheric pressure to the pressure in the bottle, so quite high.. And that the required gas flow will probably be quite low..

My actual employer (company A) has locations and job postings all over the country. There are a lot of better sounding positions in cities I'd much rather live in. I'm not sure how to bring up the subject to my boss at Company A though. I have bosses at Company B as well but I obviously wouldn't tell them about it. If I bring up the subject, then he obviously knows I'm looking to get out. I don't really know how this would reflect on Company A's reputation with their client, Company B.

My company A boss is a pretty cool guy and all but he obviously has responsibilities to both our employer and our client. I would imagine he would end up speaking with his boss and then that's where shit gets hairy because his boss is the one responsible for maintaining a good relationship with our client company.

I think the most likely thing that would happen is they would try to get me to different work where I already am even though I have no desire to stay here.

I then dipped the two ends in saline water to check how efficient they would be at electrolysis, but bubbles only appeared at one electrode; and there goes my problem.

First of all, if all panels are connected in series, theb aren't the voltage supposed to add up? If so, why is the final voltage so low?

Secondly, why is there only one electrode producing gas in this setup? Electrolysis of water generally produce hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 ratio, and if one side produce bubbles, then the other one should as well.

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**

### Timeframe

This post will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted and stickied, and old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Once all the disciplines have been covered, a final thread will be posted with links to all of them to collect any more responses until archived. The current list of disciplines:

18,Where can I get rock solid information/resources about Engineering topics?,1466520411,"Hello, I am a Computer Science student, and this summer, I am working as a co-op student at an automotive test &amp; development corporation. I mainly test  motors and construct control boards on our company's products. Recently, work has been rather slow: meaning that there is little to no work for us co-ops to do. To solve this our boss has just proposed a solution so we can do something productive in our down time: write research papers on certain technologies or engineering topics for our company's engineers. Our boss will assign us the technology or topic which we will research. He hasn't  assigned us anything yet, however, when the time comes, I want to be prepared with solid, citable, trustworthy, information which I can put in my papers. This finally brings me to my question [Sorry about the lengthy introduction, I just figured the more context the better]: Where can I find some good online resources for information for engineering related topics? Any and all sources will do: except for techno entertainment sites like Wired, and the such. Databases, peer-reviewed research, virtually anything, as long as it is legal, is welcome. I will also need resources for technical specifications on hardware. Things such as circuits, resistors, boards, software, you name it.

I haven't taken physics in a long while and am not even sure where to begin here.

Assume a tube of radius R (R = 2.25"") with a fan (120mm CPU fan, ~150 CFM) blowing up into the tube. Mounted inside the tube (across the tube's ""diameter"") is a bar whose angle is controlled by a servomotor. The bar moves freely vertically. Constrained to this bar is a flat circle (hard plastic like a milk jug) of a diameter slightly smaller than the tube (which we will call the ""wing""). Assuming the fan is on and blowing air upward through the tube, when the servomotor turns the angle of the wing to block airflow, the wing is at 0°. When the servomotor turns the angle of the wing to be vertical, such that the air flow would not provide any lift to the wing, the wing is at 90°. The wing, bar, servomotor, and assembly (acrylic in a laser cutter) that keeps it constrained to the vertical axis collectively have some mass M. Whatever the angle the servomotor turns the angle of the wing to (such as 45°) there is a quantifiable upward force (F) and horizontal force (H) exerted by the air flow on the wing assembly. (Should friction of acrylic on acrylic be taken into account if H is above a certain amount?). Adjusting the angle of the wing should control the vertical position/velocity/acceleration of the wing assembly. However, I have no idea how.

40,Manufacturing Engineers who have gone into management: any advice?,1466451406,"I'm a third year mechanical engineering student and I'm currently at an internship with a fairly large engineering company. The internship has helped to expose me more to what job or career path that I would like to pursue. After spending some time with the design engineers, I've realized that it didn't interest me that much. Sitting at a computer all day seems particularly boring, even if the design engineers were really cool. But a couple days ago I was sent to work with the manufacturing engineers and it's been awesome. I went into engineering initially because I like to fix things and work with my hands, and manufacturing allows me to go more in depth with that. 

From what I've learned in this subreddit and related engineering subreddits, I want to eventually head into management of some sort when I'm older. I don't mind the tasks since it seems to replace a lot of the engineering technical work with finance (which is my second interest) and meetings (which seem bearable). However, I want a background in a technical field that I really like, and as of right now manufacturing seems to fit the bill. 

Has anyone else followed this same path of manufacturing into engineering management? Any advice? Any regrets?

42,Construction project book for my little brother,1466449626,"Hi /r/askengineers, my little brother's birthday is coming up, and I thought he might like a book on how to construct cool stuff from commonly available items. He's always liked constructing and creating things, first it was Lego and Minecraft, and right now it's besieged. He's moved on from just static constructions, and now likes to build things where he can see the parts moving, and how they affect one another (hence Besieged). He hasn't really been in to constructing things irl though recently, since what he has available can't really compete with his computer games. 

So what I'm really looking for is a book with a bunch of constructions that a young teenager (he's turning 13) might like to build (explosions encouraged but not required). They shouldn't be overly electrical, but rather the kind of thing where he can see the effect of what he's built; how every element of the construction works with the others (eg. a homemade trebuchet). They should also encourage him to explore and make his own constructions from what he's learnt, and teach him some of the basic scientific principles behind what he's building.

51,I have this supr idea about harddrives over ip,1466434558,"
I did some investigations into fpgas some time ago and I figured ethernet and some other things can easily be implemented with a minimal cost chip

so I got this idea

design a custom small chip that has a ethernet port and connects with SATA to a single harddrive

the commands for writing and reading the drive is entirely based on a custom tcp ip protocol over udp perhaps with some error checking

and what you do is you can connect large amounts of drives
directly to a ethernet switch or hub

all sectors and the FAT are held at the main server

when you want to write  data you send the info ""
write drive x position y data ..........."" up to how many bytes you want

and then you can do a ""read drive x pos y"" 

since the buffering  and commands are instantly sent out to the switch the network hardware takes care of the rest, all you have to do is put it out on the network

with this you can have literally thousands of SATA drives connected to a single computer

What do you think? someone should make it.


edit: ok

this wont be the fastest system but I aim for cheap

10 usd per drive + 1x4 gbit ethernet adapter (45 usd) + 2x48 port ethernet switch (200 usd each) + cables 
+the drives themselves

would cost I think very little

edit yes this is Ata over Ethernet but I have not found a single product on the net that goes between a network cable and a sata interface

54,BSEET going back to school for BSEE Degree worth it?,1466395373,"Hello Everyone,

As the title says, I graduated with a BSEET degree from an ABET accredited school 2 years ago. Although I liked my hands on experience and degree it seems I may have shot myself in the foot by getting a BSEET instead of a BSEE. I see online many companies asking for a BSEE degree requirement which makes me believe that even with the right experience I still cannot qualify for a good engineering position because of education. I know some companies see BSEET and resume goes straight to trash.

I have decided to reapply for a BSEE program and found out that only my General education courses would transfer and I would be required to start from scratch and spend another 2-3 years of school.In my current position I work as Electrical Field Engineer for a large rail company making roughly 70K a year. Going back to school would essentially require me to give up position as most of the classes are daytime. 

This is where I am struggling, would it be worth it to give up roughly 250K dollars worth of salary to go back to school. I could push my luck and try to work my way into a good engineering position however I am weary of the BSEET stigma and worry that it will hold me back in salary and advancement. 

What do you guys think would be the appropriate steps? Go back to school and get BSEE or stick with BSEET and work my way up. How is a BSEET perceived in the design world and by large companies?

64,What extractor fan should our maker space use to exhaust this rather demanding laser cutter? (UK),1466358271,"I am a member of a maker space that decided to buy an epilog legend 36ext A1 bed laser cutter. 

The manual suggests using a fan capable of 850cfm (1365m^3/h) @ 6"" (150mm) static pressure for the exhaust system. 

We have worked out that this is 6"" of h2o or 1500Pa. 

The manual suggests you have this fan outside the building connected to the cutter by an unspecified length of 150mm (6"") flexible metal ducting. There are two ports on the cutter so you'll have those ports connected via 90 degree bends and a T.  

Having done several hours of googling this (and read a bunch of sawmillcreek forum) it seems that most people use wood chip extractor fans as one would get from Harbor Freight (something like a 1.5 - 2hp backward curved impellers). 

However these don't seem to be available as cost-effectively in the UK. 

The question is really what is the most cost effective way to be sure we buy sufficient extraction and are backward curved wood chip extractors really the best bet? 

Comparing say forward curved HVAC fans you do seem to get significantly less air-movement bang for your buck. Is this just because wood chip extractors are mass produced? Or perhaps they don't really meet the spec they say they do? 

We're UK based and any advice would be very gratefully received.

So as you blow air over the cold, low pressure side of the loop, the heat would typically increase the pressure on that side.

and I mount it in a moving incompressible fluid (water) so that the large opening is facing the flow.

Let's say the intake of the funnel is 10 square inches and the outlet is 1 square inch.

If the flow is entering the intake at 1 inch per second then (being reasonably ignorant on the subject) I would expect the flow to be traveling through the outlet at 10 inches per second. However, comparing the volumetric flowrate for the entrance and exit (Q=v1*A1=v2*A2) seems very simplistic and incomplete in describing what's actually going on with the fluid in and around the funnel? What reduction in that nominal 10 inches per second would I see in real world conditions?

Once an obstruction is placed in the water that resists the flow won't some of the fluid that would have flowed through the cross-sectional area ""back up"" and flow around the funnel than through it, taking the path of least resistance? Won't there be some amount of back pressure from the funnel walls that acts against the flow? If I'm starting with a laminar or turbulent flow then how does the funnel geometry affect turbulence, respectively? What happens to the flow around the outside of the funnel, and does it's convergence at the outlet of the funnel have any affect on the flow through that outlet? Are there limits to the ratio of flowrate in vs. out in funnels based on their design parameters?

To take that a step further how would that change if I attached another funnel to the outlet in a reverse configuration in a more standard venturi setup? Like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturi_effect#/media/File:Aircraft_venturi_1.JPG

How would those two systems differ in the same flow conditions?

My fluid dynamics background from uni feels a little too simplistic to answer all my questions about this. Any relevant tools I can think of like Bernoulli mostly seem to just care about what's going on at different points within the funnel with an assumed influx of fluid (my classes were basically ""learn how to pipes and heatsinks""), and I want to know if aspects of the internal system can actually have an impact of that influx of fluid.

90,What happens to steam past the critical pressure?,1466213380,"I'm taking my 2nd Class Stationary Engineering right now and I can't find a good explanation for what happens to steam past the critical pressure. My understanding was that at 22.06 MPa there is no longer a physical difference in the properties of vapour or liquid water. Thus any further energy added past this point will be sensible heat that causes superheating of the supercritical fluid without a change in pressure.

But I've seen multiple references to supercritical steam boilers and turbines with pressures as high as 35 Mpa. I'm guessing that since you won't have to worry about cavitation you could use pumps on a supercritical fluid to increase the pressure even more. What's the actual story?

It seems like the honeycomb structure would make it harder to penetrate with a needle, but it seems like friction would be an entirely different matter. It's made of the same material as normal condoms so I would think that it has the same reaction to heat and friction. They claim to have designed it to reduce slipping inside the condom, but how much could they improve over the current condom in that respect by adding a honeycomb structure?

92,How could you vary the RPM of one rotor on a single engine quadcopter?,1466199136,"Before I begin, I should note that I'm just learning things for the sake of learning. I'm not an expert in anything but I find this all very interesting and challenging to think about. So with that said!

I looked on google for quite some time to find an answer the question in the title and came up more or less empty handed.

My journey started with learning about [intermeshing rotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermeshing_rotors) and wondering why no one had applied that concept to quadcopters. 

After a moment of thought I realized that intermeshing rotors are required to be in synchronization in order to function and avoid colliding into each other. For a quadcopter, this effectively would remove how they control their flight (by varying the rpm of their 4 motors).

We could still achieve flight control by simply tilting the rotor masts in the direction we want to drift (~~Though I have no idea how Yaw would work in this configuration~~ nevermind figured it out, just have the 2 sets tilt opposite of each other to achieve left and right).

Anyhow, **onto the actual question**. So, for a moment, let's imagine [a quadcopter using a single engine that has gears to turn each of the 4 rotors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1FqV36oEYE). What kind of mechanisms are there that could allow reductions in the rpm of the individual rotors? To restore flight control, but be ran by a single engine.

A magnetic gear lock? Something that could cause it to spin independently from the motor (slow down) before being picked back up again? Some sort of 3 point pulley system that could change size by widening or narrowing the distance of a belt (basically gear scaling with a belt) to increase or decrease rpm? Maybe something else. I have no idea!

I've just got a parabolic WiFi dish I ordered for some project of mine, and I am trying to think of a way to control its latitude and elevation without manually repositioning it.

Im a geotechnical engineer and currently working on my first medium scale earthworks project in England so you know units etc (don't usually do projects like this)

The client has asked to check the actual strength against this formula that gives required strength; ((twenty times the height of the wall in meters) plus sixty) divided by two. Therefore a 5m wall requires ((5 x 20) +60) /2 = 80 kPa bearing capacity.

52,I'm having trouble picking the best program for me...,1466005676,"Just a little bit of background: I'm going to be a freshman in college this fall. I plan to attend my in-state public university, UIUC, for Industrial Engineering. I took a CS course online this summer, and I really enjoyed it, and I'm thinking that I might want to pursue it as a major, but I'm not 100% sure. 

However, I am pretty sure that I want to transfer out of IE, because I just am not interested in any description of the major that I have read, and I've looked through all of the courses, and I'm not particularly interested in it. I'd much rather do something I enjoy, because I feel like college is not 100% necessary, and if I'm going to pursue 4 years of ""extra"" education, I'd rather make it something that I like. 

To transfer into CS at UIUC is a hassle to say the least. Though I like the price, and I like the proximity to home, the earliest I can transfer into CS would be the end of my sophomore year because I have to get at least an A- in 3 really difficult courses while also maintaining a 3.67 GPA. I also have to take physics and chemistry courses, which I'm not the best at, and I would totally like to try and avoid them if possible. 

I also have the option to try and transfer into the CS + X program, and I'm interested in CS and Linguistics, but that would also be till the end of my sophomore year to transfer. I would still have to maintain a 3.5 GPA with at least a B+ in the three courses, which is still hard. 

I'm not sure...I know everything's possible with hard work, but if for some reason, I can't do it, I'm going to have a rough time graduating on time or even with an extra year from a CS program and especially if I want to take pre-dentistry courses too, it's going to be hard. 

Therefore, I'm thinking about other programs in the area. I'm considering Purdue, IU, Madison and maybe UMich for CS. 

Purdue:
+ Good program 
+ Good recruitment 
+ Lots of opportunities and clubs 
+ Good athletics 
+ Was accepted as a freshman to CS
+ Close to home
- Social scene is pretty dead
- Winters are frigid
-  Doesn't seem very friendly, but that was just the feeling I got from a campus visit. 

UMich:
+ Great program 
+ Great job opportunities 
+ Lots of clubs
+ Great social atmosphere 
- Expensive (50K+)
- Far away from home 
- Bad weather 

IU:
+ Love, love, love the campus and the people
+ Good opportunities and clubs
+ Warmer weather 
+ Great business program for a minor 
- Not very well known for CS
- Not a great CS program

Madison:
+ Campus and location
+ Great program and great opportunities 
+ Closest to home 
- Cost (48K)

UIUC:
+ Great program 
+ Amazing opportunities 
+ Lots of clubs and great reputation 
+ In state 
+ Lots of opportunities 
+ Close to home 
+ Know people going there
- No fresh start
- Gamble for admission
- Hate the campus 

Which of these would you recommend and what are the criteria?

Hey all, I need your valuable professional working class input please! I (currently 26M, single) completed a civil engineering technology diploma in and have been working in the oil sands for 5 years. Have lots of experience and a great job but since the fall of oil prices, huge pay cutbacks have made me look for work elsewhere. I'm too impatient to sit around and hope things get better at work and with this city (Fort McMurray). I want to somehow better myself instead of waiting to see what the world does. Since I'm now living paycheck to paycheck and working more hours than before, instead of saving money, the value isn't here anymore to me. I'd like to live and work in a city like Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver. After a lot of job searching, I fear that my current education will limit my potential in such cities, despite my vast job experience. 

I've been accepted this fall into the Bachelor of Applied Science program at UBCO (4yrs). Bridging program isn't an option due to personal preferences. So the clock is ticking on my decision. Oh ya, I also own a house that I'd have to sell before September, and I'm super under water on the mortgage (thank you again, oil prices). This decision to sell and fund school would use up all my retirement savings and likely bankruptcy. But at least the money went to my education first instead of the bank?

Based on your experience from what you've seen in the workplace and networking.. Is the full engineering degree really going to be worth the financial setback and time for me to attain now? After being an experienced and certified engineering technologist, I am now also eligible to get a limited license (Alberta = P.L. Eng and Ontario = LET) where I can perform most engineer duties and stamp under a more specific scope of work. Will I be able to get by just as well in future life as a tech with a limited license?

86,"Building a big tire rack, request for comments ?",1465861677,"Hi,

So it turns out I have a big bunch of large tires that friends left me with. They're for racing and the type of racing they do burns a lot of them so that's why there's so many. Right now they're in a big pile in my yard and I want to make them more tidy and take up less space.

So I've drawn up a little sketch of what it might look like. 

Major design constrains are that 
1 bedrock is between 3 and 6 feet from ground suface. 

2 I'd like to fit 75 tires in a 4 by 12 space

3 It's tall enough that windage might be an issue (final structure will be covered with [camo polyethylene mesh tarp 0.008""](http://www.wholesaletarp.net/camouflagetarps.aspx) )

4 It has to be strong enough to lean a ladder against to fill the last row without tilting.

5 ""Roof"" portion should withstand 34lbs per square foot of snow (the maximum realistic amount it will ever have on it) (and it probably does not support that in the current configuration)

I think the biggest flaw so far is the top portion can't handle the snow load and the whole rack might skew on left-to-right loads because all the joints keeping squareness in that direction are weak. I think adding ""gussets"" (or whatever the equivalent is called in carpentry) would fix this issue nicely without making too much inside space unusable. 

Also the ground anchors are 6 inch diameters concrete tubes cast in place ad of a depth of at least 3 feet with four embed threaded rods. I will make a square tubing platform that will bolt through the legs to firmly attack the anchors to the rack's base. Unfortunately that part is not draw yet.

94,How feasible are my ideas for a Point Of Sale Testing Device?,1465839216,"I am a computer engineer interned at a company that has instructed me to design and program a testing harness for the Ingenico iSC250 Point of Sale Terminal. 
[Datasheet](http://kb.retailvisibility.com/index.php?/getAttach/83/AA-02484/Ingenico+iSC250.pdf) 

The device has to meet the following specifications:

-Needs to be able to enter a sequence of buttons on the Ingenico Device, which has 15 buttons total.

-Needs to be able to press up to 3 buttons at a time.

-Needs to be able to swipe a card in the card reader and chip reader

-Use as little custom ordered parts as possible and remain sturdy and reliable.

It is good to note at this point that I have not been given a budget or even a feasible range for the cost. I have been given an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi 2 to control the device with.

In order to fulfill the requirements, I have come up with a few separate ideas. I am confident in my plan to swipe the card, so i just need feedback for the button aspect right now..


The first is an array of 15 solenoids suspended above the buttons

Pros

* Solenoids are cheap and pretty simple to use. 
* Solenoids are small and can be arranged to fit over the buttons

Cons

* Solenoids of that size are quite weak



The second is an array of 15 solenoids set off from the device that uses levers to translate the force to the buttons.

Pros

* Solenoids are cheap and pretty simple to use.
* Can buy larger solenoids for more force

Cons

* Don't know much about CAD, Lever use.
* Sounds like it will be a lot of work to make it all work properly.
* Will force still be an issue? What size should I look for?



The third idea is to use micro linear actuators or stepper motors to press the buttons from above.

Pros

* Forceful enough to push the buttons

Cons

* Will need to buy a PWM breakout board.
*Large size



The fourth idea is to use arrays of rotary servos to turn axes with levers into the buttons.

Pros

* Forceful enough to push buttons?

Cons

* Lots of unique parts
* Very hard to fit it all in the small space I have.



The last Idea, and my personal favorite, is to use pneumatics to do it.

Pros

* Forceful enough to push buttons
* Can be bought small enough to fit directly above the buttons

Cons

* Expensive (My supervisor said that this solution would be a last resort in case nothing else worked. I doubt he is willing to spend the money I was asking for the control valves.)

Climate control, power generation?",1465782804,"I got curious about this when reading a SciFi book set in the near-present where the details were handwaved away. Basic idea is: Can you set up a long-term viable habitat or colony in an environment that is 1000° F, say deep enough in the Earth to hit that temperature for resources and heat conduction purposes?

As I see it, insulation to maintain an internal temperature of, say 70° against that external temperature with pretty low heat flow should be straightforward. The hard parts that I'm not sure about the possibility or practicality of are:

Can you build a AC/Heat Pump, or series of them, that can move heat from that 70° interior, or more likely a 40° or so cooling fluid, to the 1000° exterior? If so, will it likely need multiple stages, exotic working fluids, things like that?

Assuming that the heat pumps are possible, how would you generate power in such a facility to run them? Most large-scale power generation uses heat engines, but I don't think you can run a heat engine where the cold reservoir is artificially created with power coming from that same engine. Could a heat engine be built where that 1000° exterior is the cold reservoir, making the hot side like 1500° or so I guess? Maybe nuclear could generate those temperatures?

What would the long-term viability of such a setup look like? Ability to control and maintain systems that operate at those temperatures, manufacture of exotic materials and working fluids, consumables for generating power?

I have a hard time believing this because reflexing your aileron reduces the aircraft's overall lift, forcing it to seek a higher angle of attack to maintain constant altitude. I would think that the higher AoA would generate more overall induced drag than deflecting an aileron downwards.

26,Question about Eddy-Current testing of CFRP,1465727189,"Hey guys, I am a mechanical engineer working on different topics related to quality control of Carbon Fibre Resinforced Plastic (CFRP) structures in serial production. During my research I found [this publication](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.216.4155&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) to be very interesting, as it seems to use simple testing methods for the characterization of CFRP samples: Two coils are brought together in known relative position to the CFRP sample and the impedance of the system is measured within a wide frequency range. When the coil pair is rotated, the measured impedance changes with correlation to the fibre orientation. 
Coincidentally my research institute has the same impedance measurement system that was used in the publication (Solartron 1260A) and I would like to reenact the measurement setting that is presented in it to get information about CFRP samples from my institute.
As I am a mechanical engineer, my theoretical knowledge is quite limited  when it comes to electrical problems. Therefore I would like to ask you some basic questions about the testing set-up and how to achieve comparable results to the publication (see Fig. 9). Unfortunately no one of the original authors did respond to my questions, which is why I am desperately seeking your help!

The connections of the Solartron device consist of four BNCs that can be connected to the winding ends of the used coils with alligator clips. 
By systematically varying the coil-distances and sizes I came to a set-up with an apparent resonance-area of |Z| that is changing by rotating a unidirectional CFRP sample. The change however does not seem to be directly comparable to the rotation angle as the resonance area is shifting more of less unpredictably. 
An example measurement can be seen in this [imgur link](http://imgur.com/rRVHHEi) . (Sorry for not aligning the plots, this is the only screenshot I have at the moment, and no Matlab installed atm...)
0-0/90-90  means that the sample has two unidirectional layers that were rotated by 90° relatively to the coil pair, with two repeated measurements per set-up to be certain of systematic changes.
And now the main questions:

* What role does the phase angle play in this set-up? 
* How do I properly compare measured |Z| (is the resonance area important at all? If no, what frequencies do I use instead?)
* Are there any methods that are common in the analysis of impedances that I must know when approaching this topic?

I am sorry in case I am not precise enough in the description of my problem. I really just want to imitate the testing set-up from the linked publication. So if you think that I am going a completely wrong way, I would really appreciate if some of you could give me one or two hints to adjust my approach in the right way.

What I am having trouble with is understanding which rotation matrices I should be using. I have read several derivations of quadcopter equations of motion all using different rotation matrices.

What I am struggling with is this seemingly arbitrary rotation order. Some of these derivations use the Euler angle rotation matrix (global z followed by local x then local z) and some use roll pitch yaw (local x followed by local y followed by local z). But of course in actuality the quadcopter isn't rotating around it's x axis followed by its y axis then its z axis. To me it seems like choosing this rotation matrix is just as arbitrary as choosing a rotation matrix represented by local y followed by local z followed by local x rotation; which as we know is not the same rotation matrix.

I think I understand that if I choose which ""angle system"" to use and then am consistent with my mathematics I can derive my equations of motion, however the problem is then how do I transfer my gyro sensor data to this arbitrary angle system I have chosen for my equation model when I wish to actually implement some sort of control system.

* The motor is a 250 watt brushed dc scooter motor with an 11 tooth #25 chain gear and runs at 2500 rpms max.

* The track wheels use #40 chain (1/2"" links) and are 50 tooth, 8.25"" OD.

* The track wheels will have ~30"" wheel base, requiring 170 links in #40 chain. I say ~30"" so that I may adjust the front driven axle for chain slack.

* I would like a top speed of 8-10 miles per hour. For the safety guys out there, it will have an electronic 1-4 volt throttle, which I will run through a selectable resistor or potentiometer to the speed controller. There will be no gear box.

* Edit: I would like to know the correct tooth sprocket to attach to the rear driven axle. This sprocket needs to be #25 chain to attach to the motor.

74,Guidance re: a physics/engineering question for a legal argument,1465508035,"Let me start by saying I'm not asking Reddit to do my homework for me, but I am asking for some guidance on where to go for advice.

My law firm is representing a client that wants to kill a construction project that's going on next door to them. Another company just bought the building next door and wants to demolish it to put in a hotel. They also want to use part of the existing alley for a porte-cochere for their valet service. Currently, the alley runs through the property at a right angle and both legs are 18' wide; the hotel is saying that to compensate for putting in a porte-cochere they'll expand one leg of the alley to 21' wide.

Where this becomes a problem is that our clients routinely receive deliveries in that alley from standard-sized 18-wheelers (which, if I'm not mistaken, are about 8.5 feet wide). We're concerned that the installation of a porte-cochere, combined with the cab traffic that will follow, will create a serious traffic problem in the alley: if there's a delivery truck in the alley, a cab will have to either try to maneuver around it to turn right/left and exit at the other end, or try to do a 3-point turn and exit the way they came in. We can't prove that this would be a problem, though, because the porte-cochere doesn't exist yet.

We know that a cab is about 6' wide and a truck is about 8.5' wide. We know the width of the proposed alley (21'). We don't know exactly how far into the alley the porte-cochere will extend. So, with the available information, is this a problem that could be accurately modeled to show whether or not this would create the kind of traffic problems we think it would? If so, what kind of expert would we need to go to to have this problem modeled?

We do get involved with existing building operations (ASHRAE Audits, base building system calibration, etc) but 80% of our work is for new construction. We do not typically get involved w/ building ops post-construction.  A lot of our modeling is for code and/or LEED submissions.

78,Looking for a Relatively High Power Compact Motor/Actuator with Integrated Electronics and Series Elastic Actuation,1465501563,"I've been doing a lot of searching and unfortunately I have been unable to find an adequate solution. Essentially, I need something similar to the actuators developed by [Hebi](http://hebirobotics.com/products/) or [Kinova](http://www.kinovarobotics.com/service-robotics/products/actuators/), but it needs to output somewhere in the area of 65W-110W. Ideally it would have integrated controllers, series elastic actuation, velocity sensing, absolute position sensing, and the ability to respond based on external torque input.

Also, the motor would likely be direct drive and thus would need to handle at least 3Nm continuous torque and about 10Nm peak torque, but more is better. However, the real clincher is that the whole package needs to be at most 400 grams per actuator if not less.

I realize these are some pretty harsh constraints and a there aren't a lot of companies doing this kind of work on this small of a scale, I am just hoping someone here might know of something that might be workable.

The other possibility is using a Maxon (or similar) motor configuration. This is not ideal due to the fact that they lack all of the integrated systems, but at least they have the power in a small package. I've already tried using the part configuration [464058](http://www.maxonmotorusa.com/maxon/view/service_search?query=464058), however the gearhead that in that configuration is really under built for the torques that I need and they keep breaking. I don't want to upsize the motor because then the configuration would be too heavy. If anyone knew of comparable gearheads that were stronger and could be attached to a 22mm diameter motor someway, that would be appreciated. The gearhead would need to be able to have a nominal input of about 20,000 rpm and also be able to output around 65W-110W with a reduction of approximately 100:1. However, this package would need to be at most 250 grams to accommodate the electronics that we'll need.

81,I need help calculating solar energy collected for a specific situation.,1465490636,"**Intro**
I'm building a fourplex with the goal of making it both affordable and net-zero. Net-zero energy will do little good for the world if it isn't accessible to everyone.

Part of the project includes an invention of my own design. It's not wildly different from other people's designs which have proven themselves effective. I intend to put a piece of glass with a 3 inch space between it and the exterior wall on the south facing wall of the building. The cavity between the glass and the wall is sealed around the edges. When it gets sufficient sun the space heats up and when we want to warm up the building we draw air in by opening up insulated dampers.

I've built a prototype and had very encouraging results but couldn't get sensors built in time to record real world performance.

While I hope this system can provide all/most necessary heat for the building the small heating loads required for each unit can be completely covered by a small electric backup heater. I'm just looking for a ballpark estimate to help inform decisions on size and reassure my construction manager that I am indeed not nuts.

**My Question** How much solar energy per square meter or square foot can I collect with a vertical piece of glass facing south-south-east (20 degrees off south)?

**Details**
The building is oriented south-south-east (20 Deg. off south). Location is Kamloops, BC,  Canada. The glass is vertical. Assume 0.65 solar heat gain co-efficient. I'm most interested in average energy production for October, November, December, January, February and March.

I think that's enough to calculate how much energy enters the system which could give me a rough idea and is probably good enough. If I'm to get really specific I would need to know how much energy I'm losing through conduction. That will depend on the temperature difference which will be effected by rate of air exchanges and occupant habits... I don't think we can do that without monitoring the system while it's in use. 

Let me know if I've forgotten anything and if anyone decides to take a stab at this thank you very much.

Tonight I got to have a conversation with a co-worker who grew up in racing working for Indycar teams and drag teams as a volunteer. I have been working to get into Nascar for years and am finally making the strides to try and make this a reality, but today he painted a picture of the racing industry that I am praying is not the whole truth. 


The racing industry he spelled out for me is one that is almost impossible to get into without working for free first. And even once you get your foot in the door you tend to work for crap pay (compared to other engineers) and lots and lots of long hours. He told me that it takes over your life entirely, from dawn to dusk and then some. And that is assuming you can even get in touch with the people to let you in the door. 


Some parts of this i expected such as barrier to entry and long work days, but not the 75 hour work weeks plus constant travel he described.

90,"ELI5: Why can you compress air, but not water?",1465432460,"Was talking to a civil engineer today, and he mentioned that you can compress air (as in compressing with a cylinder/piston), but you apparently cannot compress liquids (such as water). He indicated this is why we have air compressors, and said it had to do with fluid mechanics...

I know that air is a gas, meaning the molecules are spread out more. But with water, the molecules aren't as close as with a solid.... So shouldn't they be compressible? Like what happens if you got an extremely powerful piston and tried to compress water the same way as you would with air? 

Lastly, I know all about the infamous 'water locked' examples (as I am a car enthuse). 

http://www.croberts.com/Hydrostatic-lock_files/image002.jpg


In this photo, it shows that water is incompressible, along with the arm of the pistol breaking... But why? What if the arm of the pistol were much, much stronger, maybe even indestructible? Edit: Let's just say as an example you have a piston AND cylinder made out of something incredibly strong. Perhaps it is diamond. What happens when you compress that water in the cylinder? This is so fascinating, because they always say explicitly ""you can't do this."" But what if you DID?! I'm so fascinated by what would happen.

Is it because when there is too much water in the voids, that space occupied by water could be used by fine particles, therefore increasing dry density? Also I'm confused with it decreasing after optimum water content, since what I've seen is that the optimum water content also is dependent of the compaction energy.

I have limited knowledge on the subject, but i""m intrigued by it and i want to learn more! I play with scrap electronics and just tinker around with circuits and soldering. I had this idea about a week ago while thinking about a physics subject i had in junior year about using large conductors and the rotation of the earth to collect energy. I was intrigued by it but was dissapointed to see that the attempts did fail. The idea is to use large conductor structures in super cold areas to make the conductor a superconductor, if the superconductor structure is tall enough and cold enough, the absence of resistance would prevent the matirial from heating and collapsing. If this structure is tall enough, the rotation of the earth would move it at a speed where the electrons in the air would attach to the structure, creating power. Without resistance the electricity can travel without degrading the structure, and be used for power. I think because its in a cold place, and with global warming and everything, the energy could be used to pump water onto ice beds, freezing it once again rebuilding the ice caps!

**It will do two to three very short pulses (about 0.5s apart) and then go straight to the most powerful setting.** The on/off button doesn't work, and the mode button (low/medium/high/etc) button doesn't either. The weird thing is that ~5% of the time, it works just fine like nothing is wrong.
__________________________________

I've disassembled the wand and inspected the circuit board and I don't see any issues with the solder points, capacitors or anything else that sticks out as a problem but I know absolutely nothing about circuit boards really. Can anybody give me pointers on what to inspect that would cause both the on/off and mode buttons to be completely bypassed when the cord gets plugged in?

Just to put it out there, we have basically stopped using it due to this problem - the fact that it goes straight to the highest setting makes me worry that it will blow up mid-use.

78,How quickly can a unit of electricity be generated by a turbine?,1465078121,"Basically I was looking at something about the development of electric cars and I thought about a prospect for active electricity generation while driving.

I was thinking if you had a car like those hot rods in the 50's with the exposed engine blocks except instead it was a funnel or something that channeled air to a turbine which turned and generated electricity. 

Obviously I'm not expert (Please be gentle if this is something totally ridiculous) but is this possible? Would electricity be generated quickly enough to maintain a car engine running?

84,Propagation delay and syncing multiple generators,1465056199,"So I was talking to my friends about how generators sync on the transmission system and propagation delay came up.

I figured that, assuming a copper conductor (close enough, gets the point across) there would be a [delay of about 20 degrees](https://imgur.com/Y6ctc2e)

I have 2 questions:

1. Is that a valid calculation?
2. If that is valid and there is that much of a delay then how do multiple generators sync on a power system. 

I.e. If, say, G1 was generating 200 km away and then G2 was about to come on, G2 would have to account for the 20 deg delay in order to sync with the voltage at its connection point. But as it came on, it would then have its own delay making its generation 40 degrees out of sync by the time that gets back to G1?

The puzzle is simple: name a time, on a 12-hour clock with second, minute, and hour hands, at which the hands are farthest from one another (i.e. spaced at exactly—or as close as possible to—120 degree offsets relative to each other).

If that's too easy, consider a clock with a 10 cm long second hand, 9 cm minute hand, and 8 cm hour hand, and define the area of the triangle formed by the endpoints of the hands as a function of time from t=0h to t=12h. From here you can find the function maxima, which will provide the times at which the area is largest (at which times the hands are also spaced farthest from each other). See what you end up with!

1. What is the typical AC voltage of power lines in residential areas, that is, before it's fed into pole-mount transformers?

2. What is the typical KVA for residential pole-mount and pad-mount transformers, and how many customers does each transformer normally serve?

3. My current understanding is that power comes to sub-stations at hundreds of KV, then stepped down to something like 15KV, then goes to pole or pad-mount distribution transformers where it's converted to 120V split-phase (USA). Is that correct, or am I missing something?

4. Why do the bushings on power lines and transformer terminals have a ""wavy"" profile to them?

5. Where can I learn about the dangers and design considerations that are unique to voltages in the tens of KV? 

6. How frequently are distribution transformers replaced, and what sorts of things lead to their failure?

7. In what's the typical cost-per-KVA of distribution transformers, and where does one buy them? Does the cost differ for pad-mount and pole-mount?

8. What's the business structure like? Are all the distribution grids maintained by the same company that generates the power? Do they sub-contract out things like repairs and maintenance?

I'm building an oxygen concentrator, I should be able to produce 500 cubic feet of 96% pure oxygen per day. I would like to store this in a high pressure rated (3000 psi allowable) tank.

Of course pump such as they use in diving shops costs several thousand dollars used so they're not an option for me.

Compressor found in refrigerators can easily pressurize to 500 psi, however I want to pressurize oxygen and these compressor will contaminate the gases with oil. 

Oxygen &amp; oil = boom. (Perhaps there is oil that will not explode when exposed to oxygen though ?)
If I clean them perfectly or all oil traces, they will probably destroy themselves in minutes so not an option. 

Another option would be pressure washer pumps. They are rated at 3000 psi. However they are meant to pump liquids and I don't think they would work very long if they just pump gasses (for one thing, they seem to overspeed easily without the load of pushing water).

Maybe I could pump water into a high pressure reservoir filled with oxygen. Now I have 3000 psi oxygen but it's contaminated with moisture !

Maybe if I could have a membrane between gas &amp; liquid, perhaps a modified hydraulic acumulator cylinder ? If I can get all the air out of the gas side ?!

Now, to calculate whether the 55W Peltier is enough:

Q = m * Cp * (T1 - T2)    

, where Q is heat, m is air mass, Cp is air capacity (0.716 kJ/kg.K) and T1-T2 is temperature difference.

Air mass is:

m = V * d

d is air density, cca 1.225 kg/m3, V is 75 m3, so m = 91.875 kg

Then for a difference of 20K (40C - 20C):

Q = 91.875 * 0.716 * 20 = 1315.65 kJ

The fans have CFM of 110, that is 0.05191416666 m3/s per fan

The heatsink has volume 0.12 * 0.12 * 0.02 m = 0.000288 m3

So the air 'stays' on the heat sink for 0.0055 s

For one heatsink volume with that 110 CFM fan the Peltier transfers this much heat: 

Q = P × t 

Q = 55W * 0.0055s 

Q = 0.3025 J = 0.0003025 kJ 


So one exchange of the room volume (40min) will decrease the room temperature by:

Q = m * Cp * (T1 - T2)    [kJ] 

 (T1 - T2) = Q / (m * Cp) 

 (T1 - T2) =  0.0003025kJ * 75m3 / ( 91.875kg * 0.716 kJ/kg.K) 

 (T1 - T2) = 0.0226875 / 65.7825 = 3.44e-4 K = 3.44e-4 C 


Even with the most powerful 135W peltier the difference would be only 8.44e-4 C.

Is this correct? It seems to me hard to believe that such a powerful Peltier module does virtually nothing.",AskEngineers,1osb,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4m7a2f/peltier_air_conditioning_will_it_work/

1) What's the best way to get access to modeling software and analysis tools so I can brush up my skills? 

2) Should I hide the fact that my current position isn't very design focused when I interview?

35,How to filter clay from well water,1464834115,"We have a house in Thailand with patchy public water supply. For this reason we had a well drilled, which works fine except the water contains a lot of clay  (I assume).

Before the water reaches the storage tank, it passes through a big filter (built by local craftsmen who usually know what they're doing). The filter uses sand and charcoal (both lumps of coal and charred rice husks).

It has a surface area of maybe 1 m^2.

The filter works acceptably, the water comes out clear enough.

But it clogs very quickly (within a day or so). A fine layer of clay forms on top of it, which makes it overflow, and unfiltered water reaches the storage tank. 

Does anyone have suggestions for improving the filter, or adding another filter stage? I don't mind maintaining it, (though clearly a maintenance-free system would be better)  but not daily. ",AskEngineers,InternetOfStuff,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4m4y9u/how_to_filter_clay_from_well_water/

40,[mechanical] - Could you store energy using a spinning cylinder of water ?,1464817562,"Most of you have heard in the news a few months back how Tesla was considering selling a home battery pack so you can use solar panel electricity at night. That got me wondering, could you store energy mechanically using the following contraption:

A cylindrical tank, say 1.5m in diameter, 2m high. I think thats 3.53m^3 of water, which is about 3.53 tonnes. Suppose further that this tank were able to be suspended on a magnetic circular ""track"", using opposing magnetic forces to keep a thin barrier of space between the tank and the holder. The holder is the same shape as the cylindrical tank, just larger, and with a vacuum pump to keep the air out of the chamber where the magnets are.

Now, here's the energy part: during the day, your solar panels send current to a controller which pulses magnetic coils at the side or top of the holder ( far enough away to avoid interfering with the levitation magnets at the bottom ). The tank inside has corresponding magnets which act as the rotor and spin the cylinder when they receive this magnetic field from the coils. Inside the tank there are fins protruding in toward the center of rotation to ""grip"" the water (i.e. so the tank doesn't slip around the water). Since there should be very low resistance (?) even a small electric current should be able to get the tank rotating and gradually move it faster (i.e. hopefully the force would be ""additive"" ).


When the sun goes down, hopefully the tank will be rotating at a pretty fast rate, and the mass of the water will want to keep it moving. To draw electricity, you simply let the motor run backwards, with the rotor sending AC out the stator. With a big enough cylinder, it should take a while before the water slows down.

I have no idea how efficient this would be, or if its possible to get the resistance down using the suspended magnet idea. Maybe a high-quality axle would be better. But I'm interested in where this idea would fail, or any guesses as to what its efficiency would be. I think part of the problem would be that the 3.5 tonnes of water isn't really 3.5 tonnes, since the inner mass doesn't contain nearly as much energy as the mass toward the edge. This could be mitigated using a torus-style design, with maybe spokes connecting back toward the axis. I dont know, but please tell me what you think. thanks!

Edit: the only reason I thought of water is because you could empty it and the device could be moved easier. You could just as easily use bricks, dirt, whatever. I guess water isn't really critical to the design.

I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here, I looked through the search results and I found some topics regarding thesis ideas, so I thought it's fine. However, if it isn't, I'll delete it promptly.

I'm a systems engineer student and I'm going to start writing my thesis in 4~ months or so. I've already found a tutor (advisor) but he already told me that my idea was a no-go. It was an Information System that keeps track of medical records. He told me it was picked enough times already.

I can't pick stuff like 'Inventory System', and I think going for what would be an enterprise CRUD system could be boring and soul-crushing to build, mostly because I'd need to integrate too many things for it to be accepted. People usually go to a company and find whatever problem they have and either try to do Re-engineering or Automation.

I have experience working with Python, doing scripting and web development with Django. I've started to learn Laravel lately. However, I don't feel restricted to do it with these technologies.

I thought about buying a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino and do stuff with them. Problem is, *what stuff is necessary?* *How could I justify me building that, except for my own satisfaction?* . I already asked my advisor for ideas, he told me to figure out one I liked, that it didn't need to be tied to a company's needs but whatever necessity there is for my software.

However, the system can't be too simple. They (the department in charge of approving topics) usually disregard websites in general, unless you're building a web server yourself and serve information to a website front-end, desktop application and/or mobile applications.

55,Anyone in Chemical Engineering having a hard time finding what they want to do - where they want to live?,1464789308,"Hey everyone, I am a chemical engineer that has been working in industry for about 6 years now. I started fresh out of college working at an orange juice facility (Tropicana) - in Florida. They basically abused their engineers and made us work 3rd shift for years at a time (constantly being on shift) and didn't pay much of anything. After this, I decided it was time to get out of that mess and move to the chemicals industry. I am currently making catalyst now and am based in - you guessed it, crappy Louisiana.

I have had a hard time swallowing a fact that I did not think about whilst in college and that is - that being a chemical engineer almost guarantees you will have to live in a crappy location. I dream of being able to live in Colorado, Florida, or any of the nice locations and still being paid good pay. It seems like there are competing incentives ... live in a good area and get paid at the very low part of the spectrum for our profession, or live in a crap area (in the middle of nowhere) and get paid boo-koo bucks. On top of that I have found that even if you looks in a great area (for instance - I have been looking in Denver for the last year), there are MINIMAL chemical jobs. There are tons of software engineering, programming, etc. jobs , but MINIMAL chemical jobs. 

There is another part to this and that is - engineers get the short end of the stick. Many of us have to work long hours, again in crappy areas, doing absolutely ridiculously hard things every day, and maybe travel 50+% of the time in some of the roles. And at the end of the day - some of the hourly folks that work in my site that only have a high school degree very nearly make the same salary as I do. *FRUSTRATING*

Has anyone taken a role in an industry that they dont particularly want to be in - just to be able to live in a decent area is kind of what I am getting at. Like right now, I am in chemicals and I do things related to what I went to school for - but the area I live in sucks so my free time sucks (Wondering what to do on the weekends, time off isnt even that great, etc.). 

I am contemplating moving back into food / beverage manufacturing (the industry I came from) just to be able to live in Denver. Really, I like working with chemicals more and the more technical things, but hate the area I am in. Its like a revolving cycle of going back and forth between high quality personal time and industry I want to work in. I think some of it is due to the vast variety of roles chemical engineers can fill - you can work in chemicals, food/beverage, oil/gas, engineering firms, sales engineering, etc. Having worked in both food / beverage and now technical engineering in chemicals I don't feel like I am track to become a ""subject matter expert"" in any one particular area.

Basically, I'm just wondering if there is anything more to engineering (specifically electrical) than a typical 9-5 cubicle style job. I'm going into my junior year of college at Georgia Tech, studying electrical engineering, and have interned at the construction site of a nuclear power plant (Vogtle Units 3 and 4) for the last two summers with the quality department and am currently interning this summer with the electrical engineering department. The past two summers were dreadfully boring (I only kept at it for the pay) and the first 3 weeks of this internship haven't been exciting, either. I had hoped things would be better since I was actually in the discipline at work that I was studying at school, but they're really not. I beg for work constantly but rarely get it, and when I do, it's a mundane task that I find hard to complete without falling asleep. And the problem isn't that I'm an intern, all of the people that I work with don't seem to do any exciting work either. I know that this is a construction job, and there isn't much in the way of electrical work going on, but does it get any better than this? My passions are electronics and space exploration. I plan on applying to intern at SpaceX, NASA, and maybe Lockheed next summer (and feel I stand a decent chance of being hired at one), and if I am hired, and none of those prove to be any more satisfying than what I'm doing now, I may have to re-think my degree choice. I don't expect every day to be full of ground breaking work spent in a lab inventing things no man has ever used before, I don't particularly mind working in a cubicle, but I do expect to feel a sense of accomplishment in my work and see progress. I don't want to always sit at a cubicle and hate my job day in and day out. I would rather do something I enjoy for $30,000 a year than something I hate for $100,000.

64,A company has offered me my dream position and their initial offer is a number 50% higher than my wildest dreams. Do I still negotiate higher? (xpost /r/askhr),1464737739,"It's important to point out that this is after doing salary negotiations the ""right"" way, eg. it took two separate rounds of them asking me my current compensation package and me making up reasons to not tell them before they simply offered a number.

Also important to note that I am paid well within industry norms at my current job so it's not like I'm grossly underpaid. Also, I've carefully accounted for cost of living differences.

Also important to note is that discretionary bonus is part of the package, which my VP has control of and he's aware of the ongoing negotiations.

I'm thinking of asking for another 10-12% just on general principle like again the rules tell you, but I'm worried that I would therefore get a higher base compensation but a lower bonus.

72,Making my own variable resistor. Help needed figuring out connection combinations!,1464721399,"So, I'm making a variable resistor for my solar panel system which heats water. I am making different combinations of 3 resistors that have the same resistance. I'm using relays that have one selection switch, a selection relay or whatever it is in English. So one relay has: common connection + closing connection + opening connection.  

Combinations needed between the voltage source and ground:  
-1 resistor  
-2 in series  
-3 in series  
-2 parallel + 1 in series  
-2 parallel  
-3 parallel  

I have 4 outputs left on my logic controller. 1 output can of course control several relays at a time. I have several of the mentioned type of relays so the amount of relays used is not a limiting factor.


I'm fairly sure this is possible to accomplish because with 4 outputs you can have 16 different states. But, my mind goes into a knot when I try to draw some solutions to this..  
I'll take tips and methods how to tackle this problem, but a solution is more than appreciated also. :)

74,Feeling lost in the corporate world,1464717756,"I graduated with my BS in Aerospace 1 year ago. I've been working at one of the giant aerospace companies for 10 months. Here's the issue - I'm extremely unhappy. I don't enjoy the majority of the work that I do and I have no passion for the program I'm on. The solution probably seems obvious - get a different job. Well, I'm also feeling very disenchanted with engineering in general. I don't feel particularly good at my job. Sure, I can accomplish the tasks assigned to me but I don't feel as though I'm gaining a thorough understanding of the overall program or developing any expertise in a certain field. I spend the majority of my time writing little scripts, using other people's tools, or being a PowerPoint engineer. What scares me is that I could be in the exact same place in 5 years (there's a guy in his ~40s who literally does the same thing as me with the caveat that he's way more knowledgeable than myself).

I've lost my purpose. In school I was working hard towards the goal of graduation. Now that it's happened and I'm unhappily working, I don't know what to do. I've always had plans to pursue a masters, but I'm unsure of whether to go further into Aerospace if I can expect more of the same from future jobs. Additionally, I moved far away from friends and family to take this job. I have no interest in living where I am now long term and it's gotten to the point where I am considering moving back home with or without a job.

Sorry for the long post, just looking for general life advice from engineers that have felt like me. Has anyone obtained a graduate degree in a different field from their bachelor's?

82,What are the most significant machines that become a major problem when suddenly becoming unmanned?,1464708305,"I was wondering what the short term effects would be of every human suddenly disappearing from the face of the planet. The effects I'm focusing on mostly include things such as nuclear reactors, aeroplanes, and literally every single other thing you could think of screwing up. What machines would be the most catastrophic and immediately noticed over the course of the first few weeks/months to the average person wandering the now empty planet?

Partially answered by an old question here, as well as the documentary ""Aftermath: Population Zero"", however the documentary skimmed over the first few weeks which I'm the most interested in.

To provide context, I need this for a novel I'm writing in which an airborne virus infects people. Besides still being able to move, their cognitive functions are diminished to the point where they may not exist at all, thus I would consider things such as nuclear reactors immediately becoming not just understaffed but unmanned. Assume the virus has uniform spread to most locations on the planet and upon release infects anyone in contact with outside air in less than 30 minutes, causing them to pass out and wake up a few hours later but zombie-like.

From what I read earlier, most nuclear reactors would reach meltdown state at some point. When would they reach said point and what would be the observable effects of events such as this? It's easy to write about trains being derailed or aeroplanes being unable to land safely anywhere, and then running out of fuel, but when it comes to the grand scheme of things I'm sure I missed vital details and machines that have the potential to cause a lot of damage to the environment.

Sticking to the nuclear reactors, since they seem likely to cause problems, what are the chances of one remaining airtight so that some crew survives and is able to maintain operations? Is it possible for just a handful of dedicated people to ensure the reactor is 'disabled' or is this a process that takes several months and requires help from outside people bringing in coolant etc.?

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**

### Timeframe

This post will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted and stickied, and old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Once all the disciplines have been covered, a final thread will be posted with links to all of them to collect any more responses until archived. The current list of disciplines:

This picture was taken this weekend during the fly over of the Indy 500.  If you look right at the center of the image, above the nose of the plane, the image is distorted.  I was wondering what is causing this?  

My initial thoughts are that the air is compressing at the nose of the plane which increases the density of the air.  Due to the increased density its distorting the way the light is moving through the air.
