0,"""Flowability"" of Metal Powders?",1560859392,"Why might the ""flowability"" of metal powders be an important consideration for manufacturers, and how might this ""flowability"" be tested? 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I can tell:

* It is important for the metal to be able to flow all the way into a die during production of a piece, therefore it's an important consideration for manufacturers. 
* Could ""flowability"" be deduced from the flow rate of a test sample of the metal powder?",AskEngineers,False,superanalysis,/r/AskEngineers/comments/c21ehb/flowability_of_metal_powders/

What did they do before that technology, though?  

It seems like most modern developments bring in thousands of tons of material to lay a skeleton of a neighborhood before even pouring concrete.

Sorry for this being so long, but after a hectic 1st-year, I really do  not know what I should study anymore. For context, I'm going into my  2nd-year in sciences at uni. Any thoughts or comments would be greatly  appreciated!

...

**Why did I go to uni for sciences in the first place?**  Thought I'd be interested in healthcare - pharmacy/ optometry in  particular. However, in uni I realized that I hate biology and was  pretty terrible at it (put in quite a bit of effort, only to get below  avg in all 3 of those courses. Also taking one now, and also way below  avg lol...). Moreover, the job market for pharmacy is ehh at the moment,  and I'm not sure if I'd like being a pharmacist after volunteering in a  pharmacy for slavework (i.e. putting meds on the shelves, and taking  out expired ones). I know that this is not what being a pharmacist  really entails, but it just seems like such a mundane career to me from  observation. The tuition hike for PharmD is also drawing me away. There  is one more pre-req (microbio) that I am contemplating to do, but would  not take if un-necessary, since it might lower my already shit gpa: my  marks in previous cell bio/micb classes have been pretty dismal.

I  enjoy/ am interested in chemistry, and have gotten relatively good  marks on it compared to all my other subjects. Have chosen that as my  1st-choice on my specialization app (not too sure if I'll get in, but  yenno). Though I realize that a chem degree is going to get me nowhere  without higher education, and who knows whether my dumbass will be able  to get into/ want to do grad school. I did have to put in a huge amount  of effort + office hours were utilized lots to do relatively well; not  sure if I'll be capable of doing well in upper-level classes and labs (I  actually did pretty bad in labs during first-year, as in below average.  But it was literally my first lab lol, and there should be lots of  opportunity for me to improve).

I would  be interested in pursuing chemical engineering as it is more useful for  jobs, and think that I might be into materials chem (which i'm not  entirely sure yet due to a lack of courses/ experience, but anyways).  Electrical engineering and computer eng (also cpsc, which is in the  faculty of science) are also possible options, though I have no good  reasons. Well, other than ""it seems kinda interesting"" (I have nothing  to back this up with though) and ""good job prospects"" lol. For  engineering in general:

* I  was good at math, including pre-calc, all throughout highschool (used  to be my best subject) - except for calculus, which I slacked off in  (since it did not count for admissions, stupid logic I know). I'm pretty  sure that I could've done way better than the 60s, but in 1st-year, I  fell behind on the workload early on, and wasn't able to catch up. And  calc I and II are known to be pretty brutal at my uni, thus I kind of  gave up on the courses after hearing all about its perceived difficulty  (a terrible mentality which I regret having, but the rumours also held  true lmao). From using desmos to the online integral calculator, I never  really learnt the material myself, and it sure as hell reflected on my  exams. Curveball/ wtf out-of-the-blue questions were rampant on calc  I/II tests, and the course averages were incredibly low - though neither  should be an excuse for my shitty performance (which was even below the  avg, just like most of my other marks).
* Apparently  the 1st-yr physics that I'm going to take are relatively easy at my  school, and have corresponding class averages. Will really try to apply  myself more in 2nd-year, and actually complete the homework without  excessive external help ;) I got like 90 in phys 11, but slacked in phys  12 oops + had a terrible teacher.

I've  always been interested in economic matters in a general, non-academic  sense, thus might want to switch to economcs instead. But not sure how  I'd fare in an actual course - taking one next summer term tho so I  guess I'd know soon. But I realize that one course is not indicative of a  major, also, I have to choose my winter-session courses before taking  econ.

So if I get into chem (will know in  a few days lol, and the below would still be quite similar for if I do  not), my options are as follows:

1. stick with it (if I still like it/ am capable) and pursue grad school if possible
2. switch to comp sci at my school
3. switch to economics at my school
4. switch to engineering at either my school or others (thinking about waterloo)
5. try for pharmacy at my school by scheduling in all pre-reqs in 2nd-year (incl. micb LOL)

The  big problem here is that I could never fulfill the pre-reqs for all of  these options on time (i.e. for switching, as I have very limited  elective space), and have to choose something to follow lol: course  selection is coming soon, and I simply don't know what to do.

Hi Guys.

Currently carrying out some complex steel to steel moment connections and am required to use SCI P398 for the equivalent T-stub lengths. When checking the required thickness of the plate (which is a full depth end plate) should I be carrying out a check on the top row - which will have the highest tension - calculating my Leff for the top row. When it is substituted into the equation to give FTRD..is the value of FTRD only for that top row, or is it the total that the plate can carry?

Once this check has been carried out should I repeat the process for the internal bolt rows?

I am pulling 69sec I/O's in SolidWorks performance tests. I haven't tried to run anything heavy in Matlab yet but I see no reason why it shouldn't plow through that either.

I am beginning to think that the issue is not that the MacBook Pro is bottlenecked anymore. I see it as running a second partition and doing such tasks as the registry hack is just not in everyones wheelhouse, or maybe these tasks are tedious for some. Possibly mechanical engineers are just not tech savvy?

I get it I get it. It's not as seamless as just picking up a Thinkpad with a Quadra.

91,Do employers take into account applicants with slightly lower WAM/GPA if they have a dual degree?,1560696711,"I'm sure there are many out there who are/ have been in a similar position to me. 

TLDR: dual degree Physics + Civil engineering is taking its toll on my WAM (due to difficult physics subjects) . Will employers understand this and take this into account when reviewing my resume?

So I'm currently halfway through my 3rd year of studying full-time, aiming to graduate university with a Bachelor of Physics and a Bachelor of Civil Engineering after my 6th and final year. I am sitting on a 77 WAM (from Australia so not familiar with GPA). However, whilst I immensely enjoy my physics subjects, they are significantly more challenging than any engineering subject I have taken so far. 
Apologies for the rant but at the moment I am required to sit 3 simultaneous math subjects this semester, none of which are required if I were to only pursue the engineering degree. The only other students taking these subjects are those who study pure/advanced math. My mark for these subjects are quite worse than all my other previous subjects taken.

Although I'm finding this degree very rewarding and interesting, I can not help but feel frustrated at the fact that when application time comes around, I will not be anywhere near as competitive as I could potentially be in terms of my GPA/WAM  due to taking these subjects.

Im new to the subreddit because I just finished my masters of engineering in Germany a couple weeks ago. Since almost two years I work full time at my current company in Berlin and still managed to finish my masters with a gpa of around 3.0 or a bit better. Before that I worked part time at a different hvac designing office.
I’m very specialist in HVAC designing, analyzing  and energy management/efficency. The closest to it is mechanical engineering.  
I really like the job and I would have a great future in this firm. 
Problem is, that my wife is American and wants to move back to Florida.
So here are my concerns: 

-	can I work as an engineer with my German masters in the USA for example as a senior engineer in a construction firm?
-	Do i need the FE and later the PE to get the most out of my masters?
-	What can I do before I come over to prepare myself?

Feels kinda overwhelming to leave a very secure job and have no idea how I will end up in Florida with my degree.
Does anyone have some tips for me?

I'm an engineer for a company that manufactures medical equipment. (If I get more specific that that my company will be easy to find so I won't go further into it). One of the other engineers I work with has an aerospace engineering degree.

25,DIY heat exchanger failing at its task.,1560605264,"Dear engineers of Reddit,

A while back, I had this crazy idea to build my own hottub in the garden that is capable of heating the water using a stove. After everything was slowly put together, I have not been able to get the water to heat up fast enough (it is very slow).

&amp;#x200B;

Below you can see an image of the setup. 

&amp;#x200B;

After measuring the temperature at the top part, I nearly instantly reach the max temp of my thermometer whilst at the exit of the warm air (at the bottom of the setup) the temp is approx 35 degrees Celsius (ie heat is being transferred). The tubing that functions as the heat exchanging surface is made out of copper (due to its heat transfer properties (diameter 1.5cm - length 9m)). The water is being actively pumped through the setup with a pump at about 600 L/min.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone told me that I should get a pump with a lower flow rate, because the water is not getting warm enough fast enough with the setup... but according to me, the higher the temperature difference, the higher the total amount of energy transferred from the hot air to the cold water. 

Someone else told me I should isolate the outside of the stove, but with small flames sometimes coming out of the top, I have no idea of what materials would be appropriate to insulate the stove that reaches high temperature (any wooly materials would start burning slowly?).

29,I feel trapped in my engineering career. (Vent post),1560580567,"Hello all, I recently stumbled upon this subreddit and I'm glad I did because there's a lot on my mind to the point where I'm going to break down. I have finals in a week for chemistry and engineering physics and I should be studying, but everything just came crashing down in my head and I just need to take 30 minutes to vent it all out, you know? This might be a long read but it would mean so much if just one person knew how I felt.   


In terms of being an ""engineer"", I'm not a smart person. I was never genuinely good at math and I'm only good at ""pull and chug"" problems like some lifeless robot. I horribly suck at problem solving to the point where it's laughable because I lack any form of patience. Calculus and physics in general makes no sense to me at all and everything I try to ""learn"" in physics class just goes over my head. I'm a very slow learner, and I just don't have the mind capable of doing complicated stuff like this despite studying and doing the homework at my snail's pace. I've always known I was inferior to my friends in class who can just absorb the physics and calculus material like sponges. You see, I LOVED subjects in high school such as English, world history, geography, foreign languages, etc, and I still continue to do so. I love creative writing as a hobby and I write on a daily basis, just writing meaningless stories. I love all this. It sucks to know that I'm only good at all the useless shit. I see the world in words, not equations. And you're all probably wondering why I'm even in engineering.   


It's my family. My dad and mom want me to pursue engineering; it doesn't matter what field of engineering, as long as it's engineering. They were born in the Philippines and knew what it was like to actually *struggle.* They moved to the US and then I was born (unfortunately), and them being an engineer and a nurse respectively, they did this for me and the family. So I can utilize resources and opportunities on US soil that the PH didn't have. And I did for a time. I got a 3.8 GPA in high school, did sports, and got into my state's top ranked public university to study civil engineering. That was 4 years ago; I'm 22 now. Since then, I had to drop out of university after the first year and I settled into a local community college in my area. I've had very low grades (50s - 70s) in my calculus and physics classes over and over again as if I were trapped in a whirlpool, because none of it makes *fucking* sense. I just don't know why, but working with math makes my brain freeze. I don't have dyscalculia either because if I did, then I would have done poorly in my math classes in high school too. But at the college level, I've lost my direction and I find my math and physics classes extremely boring and excruciating, compared to where I used to find them interesting and intriguing. In general, I've lost direction in my life and I truly don't know what I want to do. My GPA now is sitting at a 2.6 and I plan on retaking those same calculus and physics classes yet again, but I am so, *so* burned out.  


I can't just switch out of engineering that easily. I can't just tell my mom ""hey, I don't want to be an engineer anymore"" like most people can. They're the traditional Asian parents who tries to guide my life so I wouldn't go homeless and penniless, and they truly mean well. We've spent too much money on my classes for the past 4 years, I HAVE TO finish civil engineering at this point. But these mathematical classes are seriously eating away at my sanity and I have no one to talk to. Engineering drew me in initially because I wanted to help make a difference in the world with my creativity, but I lack the math brain to survive the ordeal. I feel the itching urge to finish my degree as soon as possible because we only have so much time in life.   


Lately, I've looked into forestry engineering (I've actually never heard of the field until a few weeks ago) and it's slowly and steadily rejuvenizing my mental strength to pass my classes. The natural world has always been important to me and the conservation of forests is something I can wholeheartedly put my efforts into. I really loved biology in high school, and combining ecology with physics actually sounds enjoyable because I'm doing something that means a lot to me. But I feel like I've blown so many opportunities by now, especially moving from a university to a community-college and failing classes at both colleges. I can always go back to my university by applying directly to the engineering program, but I blew my first chance and took it for granted.

30,Taking a job at a place I started an internship at but quit after a week.,1560570061,"Hello everyone. 
Here's the story. I started an engineering internship last June at a mid sized company and I quit after a week because I didn't like what I was gonna be doing. I was going to be doing all paperwork and other tasks the engineer probably didn't want to do. So I ended up leaving and got an internship at another small company where I actually got some pretty cool design work (no regrets) and it lasted about 6 months.
After that I got a job at the same company where I quit the internship after a week but at another site, so there wasn't anybody that recognized me and HR didn't have a record of me quitting the internship. 
So now I've been working for 6 months and I just applied at another position which is internal. The problem is this position is at the same site that I first interned at and quit. It's nicer position and I think it will be a better fit for me and I'll have more engineering work (at my current position all I do is drafting). Now I'm afraid that my old boss sees me when I start (it's sueper likely I'll get the position) and tells HR about it. I don't know what you guys think or if Im making this a bigger deal than it it. Just to clarify, the department that I'll be working at isn't the same where I started the internship, but I believe they collaborate a lot so I'll be in contact with my old boss.

32,"Can you help me debunk this ""gravitational energy system"" scam?",1560563689,"Hello /r/AskEngineers, not sure if it's the right place to post but I need some help.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past couple of months, a close acquaintance of mine has been investing pretty much ALL his money into acquiring from an ""inventor"" the exclusivity to distribute within our country a **Gravitational Energy System that uses buoyancy devices that exert ascending force using planetary gravity, transformed on mechanical torque.**

&amp;#x200B;

Even before I knew or saw any information about the machine I knew it was a scam due to the absurd amount of money needed to get the distribution, shady business practices, fake documentation (ex. stock photos used as proof of the facilities where they are being built, fake company names used as references, etc.) and the everchanging specifics of how the machine actually works (for example, early on the inventor claimed that it needed no outside energy whatsoever to generate free electricity, to later on explaining that it indeed needed electricity to function, but the output of the machine is orders of magnitude bigger than the input).

&amp;#x200B;

After months of pointing out all the red flags and the fact that they seemed to be unable to finish installing the demo machine, my acquaintance was finally about to pull the plug on this money drenching venture, when the dam thing started working and now he is even more willing to mortgage his future for this.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the machine in question and some of its claims:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fairly recent graduate of Engineering, I got my first engineering job about a year ago, and while I was nervous at first, it;s kind of become a bit of a constant source of anxiety in my life. We mainly focus on heavy industry jobs, and I feel that despite my lack of experience a lot is expected of me because there's a shortage of engineers in our field. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember being told in college that it would get easier after college, but I'm finding that the opposite is true, I focus a lot on the projects I'm given (so much so that I have a bit of a reputation in the office as being a slow worker), and even then I notice that no matter how much time I spend on something, I'm always worried that I fucked up somewhere without realizing and that eventually it's going to bite me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? I've been trying lately to let things go, to get things ""good enough"" so that I can move on to something else, because there's always something else that needs to be sorted. But there's always this nagging feeling that I should spend more time  on things and I'm finding it hard to find a balance between quality work and fast work.

61,How to manage major project assigned by director by yourself (Intern),1560502375," This may be more of a rant, but definitely looking for some guidance or advice from anyone that has been in this situation and overcome or just that can relate to me.

**Background**:

So I am interning in at a company that has assigned me a very large project that could potentially be implemented nationwide. My job isn't so much to find a solution to a problem but more so identify and prove that a problem exists and justifying using resources that would involve finding a solution later on (solution to problem is outside scope of summer internship).

This project was assigned to me an individual that is above anyone at my current location for the position I am interning for (ex: NA manager (so this person) &gt; regional manager &gt; site manager &gt; position I am interning for). This is a very important project to this individual and they selected me specifically because of my background in engineering (interning for safety). The NA manager cares very much about this project and has given me full control of how to lead it and has informed me that they will provide any resources that I may need to assist me with accomplishing this project. I am working alone on this project, but I do have people around me at my site that I can ask if I have questions or want ideas from them. Most associates have told me they aren't sure why I was given such a big project that is very difficult as opposed to a project that focuses on their specific site rather than implementing something nationwide.

**Problem with my project**:

Unfortunately, I feel like I am doing a very poor job managing this project right now and feel very defeated despite barely starting the project a couple of weeks ago. In school, we usually work with teams or have help from our professors in order to help finish a problem. And different parts of the project are done by different people. Now, I am being given a project where essentially I will decide everything and I need to manage my time, tasks, deliverable, ensure goals are met, etc.

I was given an internal tool like Microsoft project that they use so I can set up milestones, tasks, and everyone can see where I am on my project. Only my project sponsor and I currently look at it. Since my project sponsor isn't ever at our site because they travel, they have different priorities, views, and perspective on how my internship should go. They want me to devote a lot of attention to the project but the project is separate from doing my daily responsibilities for the position I will hopefully become full-time for.

**Problem managing my time**:

In order to not neglect my associates at my site, I have a good amount of time shadowing them, learning from them and performing the responsibilities for that position. I have also spent days focusing solely on my project. But it is hard to know how much time to spend working on my project vs. working with my team. My team and project sponsor are definitely not on the same page as far as what the goals of my internship are. And I have brought this up and they are understanding if I ask to work on my project, but politics are everywhere and I know that if I spend more time on my project, it will look bad on my part. Because of how I spend my days, I feel that I am not doing what needs to be done for my project. My project sponsor gave me a timeline for what I should deliver every week and what my focus should be for that week. I set this up in their internal tool to where we can see my progress.

**Problem with executing and making decisions**:

I have spent so much time investigating and looking into the tasks she assigned for the first week that pretty much define what the project scope will be, purpose, what we will study, etc. After all of my investigation, I am not sure how to deliver that to her in a short report (I was informed if I am spending more than 15 minutes on writing a report of the findings of my weekly tasks, I am doing something wrong). I am not sure if I should do this in a PowerPoint and present it to her, should I make it into a word document?

**Underlying Issue**:

I guess what most of this stems from is that while I am confident in my technical abilities and I have already demonstrated my knowledge in numerous areas, I am struggling with actually leading a project, how to organize what I will be doing, how to spend my days, how to document my findings, etc. It's pretty embarrassing and I have done independent projects in school, but again, most everything was laid out for me. I just don't want to mess up such a big project for someone that has really high expectations for the results.

Thanks to whoever took the time to read this and good luck to any other interns out there!

   I'm big into transhumanism and hope to someday be a cyborg, so I have always loved the idea of tech inspired fashion. I am attempting to make a device like this: a 0.5 inch x 0.5 inch sticker, with a width not exceeding 2 millimeters, that would have an always-on LED connected to a small, ultra thin battery that is powered by a small solar cell. Preferably, I would want ambient light to be enough to power it during the day, and have the battery hold enough charge to keep the LED on for 8 hours without light, or more if possible. 

 I know that there are extremely small and flexible solar cells in existence, but I am having trouble finding a source to buy a few. I know that there are extremely small and low energy use LED's, and I am having trouble finding a source for one of those other than Alibaba. I know that there are batteries that are incredibly thin nowadays, some supposedly as thin as .1 millimeters. I would like to locate one in the 1mm range that I could use for this purpose. My first request is, would any of you point me in the right direction of locating such parts? A certain website?

 As for specifically building this device, from what I can figure out with my non-engineering education, I need to calculate how much energy the LED uses while on, how much energy the battery can hold at Max charge, how much energy a solar cell or two with a size of 2x3-4 millimeters or so would need to produce within a certain amount of time to keep the batteries charged while the LED's are in use. Once I figure out all of that, I would assume I could then calculate how much time the LED's would stay on without the solar cells receiving sunlight.
My second question is, please point out where I'm getting things wrong and what I need to be doing right, and resources on how to learn what I need to know in order to pull this off.

88,Sustainability of aluminum replacing steel in automotive industry?,1560458293,"As we all know, the bodies of Ford trucks are being made of Aluminum, and they plan to keep it that way for the foreseeable future.

I'm an ME student so what I know about the automotive industry is the little I've heard from a couple of my classes + what I've read on the internet. I just don't see aluminum being a sustainable solution to something that isn't really a problem.

I don't have an idea as to how much, but I know that the raw materials cost is higher with aluminum. This would be a greater expense for Ford (or whoever), but would the cost of production drop? Low-grade aluminum isn't as 'strong' as low grade steel, so in theory the presses (or mills, whatever process is changing the metal) consume less power and last longer. I can't imagine Ford buying high grade aluminum (or steel) when they can strain harden it and have the same mechanical properties. So the raw materials are more expensive, but I'd assume that the production is cheaper. Is this assumption correct?

Another selling point is that it 'doesn't rust'. It may not rust, but it certainly corrodes... My alloy wheels had some ugly corrosion, and I've seen plenty of crusty aluminum hoods from Chrysler vehicles at the scrapyard. The repair industry is setup around steel, and I can't imagine there are very many shops (or dealerships, yet) that are capable of welding aluminum. Not sure if Ford (or whoever) cares about this, but it's something a lot of consumers should worry about.

Aluminum is also lighter, so in theory you can make a bigger vehicle and still meet weight requirements, which I'm imagining customers will flock to. However, for aluminum to have the same mechanical properties (tensile strength, toughness etc) as steel it either needs to be  'higher grade' or undergo some sort of strain hardening. Or, the parts themselves would have to be thicker... All 3 of those options adding to the cost of production, which the potential customer ends up paying for.

The economics of it don't make sense to me either. If this enormous demand of aluminum is placed on the aluminum industry, the price will only increase, yet another expense for the car MFR. Won't this decrease in steel consumption raise the price of steel too? I can see this dominoing into a lot of other things, but I don't know much about the raw materials market. 

I've also read that steel is easier to recycle. Not sure how valid that claim is, but given that car bodies have been made of steel since the beginning of time, it makes sense to me. Easier to repurpose, less of it ends up in a landfill.

Being composed of Iron, steel also doesn't have an endurance limit, where aluminum does. Not sure how much of a factor this is when designing car bodies, but that's something that steel has going for it.

The only benefit I see is a lighter vehicle, but if it's larger then it won't be much lighter. A larger vehicle also seems to me like it would have more air resistance, yielding lower fuel economy at higher speeds. 

Again, I'm just a student so I don't know jack shit. Switching to aluminum just doesn't seem like a sustainable decision to me. I'm inclined to think it's marketing wank... If it were 'the superior material', the Japanese would be doing it too. So would truck MFRs (peterbilt, kenworth, etc). All of this is just kinda spitballing, but I'd love it if someone from the auto or raw materials industries would give some input.

89,Why does the resistance of Parallel Resistors drop to (near) zero when one shorts?,1560456814,"I bought a book on electrical engineering (I am not a student, just curious about how it works) and I have a question which I cannot seem to find the answer to (not a good answer anyways)...

So if there are a series of resistors in parallel in a circuit, the total resistance of them is 1/(1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) ..., so that the resistance is lower than that of the lowest resistor in the circuit... My first question is why does that make sense, why is there less resistance when a higher resistor is added in parallel than if there was only the first resistor?

The more important question to me is about one example from in the book... so there is a circuit which is a 12V battery and 3 parallel 10 Ohm resistors. The 3rd resistor shorts, and the batteries resistance is 2 Ohms when a short happens, I must find the Amperage running through the circuit. So using the logic of the previous problems I used the equation for resistance, and add to the battery (as they are not parallel to it, but in series) as such...

Amperage = 12V / (1/(1/10 Ohms) + (1/10 Ohms) + 1/0 Ohms)) + (2 Ohms),

This has a divide by zero error...

The books answer is six, which means that it is really the 12V / 2 Ohms of the battery itself, which leads to my real question... Why when a resistor has a very near zero resistance (like 0.0001 Ohms) does electricity flow through all resistors, hence the equation must be used to find amperage, but when there is Zero Ohms at one spot, ALL current flows through it? Am I missing something?

Before I start, I want to preface saying I am a fairly competent person that likes doing handyman-type stuff around my house. I know little, but I love the work and I want to try to learn as much as I can.  

Here's what you need to know: We are putting a standalone garage in soon (as soon as the concrete guy gets some free time to pour our pad). The garage will be steel construction 30x36. The side walls will be 12'. We plan on putting a 30x16 (10' walls) room in the back of the garage. This room will be sealed off, insulated, and temperature controlled(we live in FL) for a gym area.

Here's what I need help with: I want to know if I should use 2x8s (or thicker) joists for the ceiling or if I need to  use I-beams or LVL beams.  There will be a small loft (glorified attic) for storage above there with simple OSB as the flooring.  I would prefer to use 2x8s or similar due to cost but if I need to double down and use LVLs, then I'd like to account for that now.  I' ve tried understanding span charts but I want to make sure I've really got this right by asking someone who understands these things for a living!

A follow up question: We are getting a cement pad poured for an outdoor area as well, I plan on building a pergola out there since it is a south facing patio behind our house.  The one part of the pergola will need to be attached to the house (on the roof).  This pergola would ideally be 16x30'.  I haven't found good plans or knowledge on something this size.  Right now I planned to use 6x6s for the posts of the pergola and space them every 10' then attach to the roof with one of the roof brackets. The beams for this, I was thinking would be 10"" and then have 6"" boards as the rafters.  But again, I haven't been able to find any solid information on this.

93,Rebar Schedule in thin-shell concrete structure,1560451619,"Hello - just wondering if anyone can help me to understand how to figure out the rebar schedule required for a thin-shell octagonal concrete structure? 

We plan on using fabric airforms for the concrete forms based on Mark West's ""The Fabric Formwork"" book. Mark is at MIT and has ressurected fabric formwork design. I can get 1.5"" concrete walls with 1/4"" tolerances based on supplier specs. Of course thicker walls are also possible but the idea is to use as little concrete as possible.

The idea is to build 900 square foot octoganal domes in a single monolithic pour with 10' walls and roof in one pour using self-consolidating concrete. Helix micro-steel says they can eliminate the horizontal runs of rebar with their helix micro-steel fibers. We can vary the roof pitch based on what will give us the best strength/weight ratio.

Which leaves the vertical rebar schedule. I was hoping we could use helix steel fibers to replace them but after talking to their rep he says that didn't sound possible. But they could only tell after seeing structural drawings, which we don't have at this point.

There are alternatives to traditional steel including basalt rebar, fibers or mesh or even basalt rope. Which would be easier to work with than steel rebar based on our thin shell airform design.

Since we're trying to figure out whether all this feasible or not and at what cost I don't want to engage an engineer until we actually decide it's worth doing and we need a stamp. So I'm trying to get at least a good estimate of the vertical rebar requirements so we can do some cowboy math and make a go/no go decision.

If a 32-bit system can only access 4,294,967,296 bytes of RAM at a time, does it make sense to say that since every 8 bits equal 1 byte of memory then every single 32-bit memory-address equals 4 bytes of memory since 32 divided by 8=4?

My friend and I have some access to land as well as an old, disused vehicle. We've got some hairbrained ideas about making the cab airtight to perform some weird experiments for the sake of photography and just being bored (these ideas do not involve us being in the cab). 

What's the best way to make the cab airtight? I figure that the door and window seems need to be taped. If we set the door for the AC to recirculate the air instead of allowing in fresh air from the outside, would that be enough, or does that need to be sealed off, too? Anything else?

6,100% Outside Air HVAC question,1560436319,"**First some background:**
The facility where I work has a 100% outside air HVAC system. This is probably because in addition to offices, we have some labs with fume hoods.  

We have a chiller/cooling tower which supplies the air handlers with 44 DegF (7 DegC) cooling water. The air handler takes in 100% outside air, cools it and distributes this now very cold dry air throughout the facility. In addition, we have natural gas fed boilers which supply hot water throughout the building.

Every room has it's own thermostat and heat-exchanger so the very cold air can be heated using the boiler supplied water to the occupant's desired temperature.

When the outside air temperature is below freezing, the air handlers just heat up the incoming air.

Exhaust fans take all this nice dry cold (or warm) air and blow it out stacks on our roof.

Needless to say, our power and gas bills are enormous for a building of our size.

I'm an EE who did a little work in industrial controls a long time ago so HVAC isn't really my thing. Our facilities guy is trained to fix HVAC, not to second-guess whoever designed it.

**My question is:** It seems as if the chiller set-point should vary depending on either the outside humidity or perhaps the chilled air humidity. On a humid day, it makes sense to have really cold coils to get all that salty water (we're on the coast) out of the supply air, but on a nice spring day, couldn't you dial it back a little. Less power to chill the water, less gas to warm it back up.

I did have a thought that it's somewhat self regulating, as less humid supply air will lead to cooler return water from the air handler so less work to chill it again, but I'm not the ME.",AskEngineers,False,nevereven,/r/AskEngineers/comments/c06jav/100_outside_air_hvac_question/

27,requirement for the use of an inerting gas for Anhydrous Ammonia?,1560408152,"  

There are two methods of storage of anhydrous ammonia: refrigerated atmospheric tank or pressurized tank in a pressure temperature equilibrium. This question can apply to both but we have the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

No code or standard specifically requires the use of an intermediate inerting gas when emptying and purging the tank for inspection and maintenance. 

&amp;#x200B;

FLAMMABLE LIMITS OF VAPOR IN AIR:	LEL/UEL 16% to 25% (listed in the NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards 15% to 28%).

&amp;#x200B;

AUTO IGNITION TEMPERATURE:	1,204 °F (If catalyzed). 1,570 °F (If un-catalyzed).

But, because of explosive range of anhydrous ammonia, some companies decide to use nitrogen as an inerting gas. Others decide not to.  

My opinion and the opinion of many others: inerting is not required because there is no ignition source inside a storage tank or piping.  I even saw one company that said ""It's not required, but we do it anyway"" and they specified it in their procedure.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other notes:

The only “explosions” on record are inside buildings (ammonia refrigeration facilities) with ignition sources, and those are super rare with only 1 documented case that I know of.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s impossible to get to 16% unless it’s an enclosed space.  Even a dense gas cloud from a major liquid leak will still be below the explosive range.  I learned this in training but cannot find it written anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ammonia safety is managed by:

\-OSHA Standard 1910.111 Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.

\-ANSI K61.1 now CGA G-2 Anhydrous Ammonia Standard

Neither of these say inerting with an intermediate gas is required, but they do not say it is not required.

&amp;#x200B;

30,Outward weight/pressure on a garden box,1560399170,"Figured civil would be the closest to geotechnical (as geotechnical is a subfield of civil engineering I believe) So to preface this, I am building a garden box (dimensions of it are approximately 1.5x3x1 at wlh) and given that I want to fill it with dirt I basically just want to know that the material I plan on building it out if isn't going to snap under the weight of the dirt when it's getting out into the box (once it's in it will compact down with time meaning if the box fails it won't be as important).


Anyways I tried to do a rough back of the envelope calculation using the angle of repose to try to determine what the dirt would look like had the box not been there and determined the weight of the dirt that would be outside of the box to calculate the force/weight on the sides of the box. Given the type of dirt used and some google searching I found that 35 degrees (0.611 radians) is the approximate angle of repose. Anyways given a height of 1m to determine how far outward the dirt would slide (1.42m from center) so the dirt would be about 68 cm outside of the box and would intersect the box at a height of 47cm. Given this is roughly a triangular prism, on the larges wall (3mx1m) there is an 0.96 m^3 at a density of 1220 kg/m^3 aka a mass of around 1200kg (2600lbs) of dirt pushing on that wall.


Anyways my big question is if this is along the right track for figuring this out. My question is because I want to basically I want to save as much money as possible and a family friend is offering some material for free but it's kind of weak relatively and I want to make sure that if I build it out of said material that it's not going to just break while tossing the dirt in, as well I am trying to figure out how much support I should add on for the given materials. If my calculations are correct (even though I have no idea if they are) then my original design should be more than capable handing the stress.

I'll be doing some controls work and some CAD.

Right now, I've estimated my hourly rate to be around $30/hr from a payscale salary report. From there, I think I'd have to adjust for FICA, insurance, etc. but I'm not sure whats all applicable.

34,Can you encase an engine inside an engine??,1560391587,"Okay, so I was daydreaming while working a moment agao, and I thought to myself “Hmmm, wouldn’t it be cool to take a car engine, bore it out to some insane cylinder size, and then encase it in another larger engine as a shell to cool it more effectively? Then just weld the two shut or some other method to keep them together?” 

The premise behind this is that I thought if you took an engine (preferably cast iron) bore the cylinders out to some crazy amount, and then essentially chop off all the excess metal until what’s left is the outer shells of where each piston would sit inside, then you could isolate each cylinder, and thus cool each cylinder entirely by running coolant in the space between each cylinder, without them transferring heat directly to each other since the space would be liquid keeping it cooled instead of metal keeping the heat trapped within the center? I’m not sure if that makes sense or not, but yea. And to encase it, you could use an alluminum shell which should lower the weight right? 

Basically imagine each cylinder being built like a line of outdoor coolers. Whereas with a cooler you have a vacuum in between the inner and outer shell, in this you’d have coolant. 

You know, now that I think about it, perhaps this is how engines are already manufactured? I’m not entirely sure since I’ve never really looked into it, and from what it seems, the space in between cylinders always seems like it was a solid chunk of metal that they simply bored a line of holes into lol. But if someone could give some insight to this, then that’d be awesome!

35,Steel/aluminium fasteners,1560387835,"Attaching seat mount brackets to an aluminium boat. 12’ open tinny kind of deal.

Because the floatation is under the benches, I can’t affix anything underneath, so I plan to use rivnuts to add a threaded insert (they are like a pop rivet with a threaded centre. 

I have stainless fasteners, and a choice of aluminium rivnuts or what was purported to be stainless steel, but I’m certain they are bright plated steel.

I will only be using the boat in fresh water, but I’ve noted a fair amount of galvanic action with the steel bolts that were used on the boat loader, so they’ve been replaced with stainless (like they should have used in the first place.) 

Similarly, regular steel bolts on the boat itself have corroded a lot, so those have been replaced with stainless.

I don’t have the time to wait for yet another shipment of what could turn out to be non stainless, so I am figuring on using the aluminium rivnuts with the stainless screws. They have at least 5mm of thread, so I figure there is a reasonable amount of grip if I don’t overtighten. The most force on them will be side to side, not much pulling. 

Or should I risk the steel ones and monitor the level of corrosion, if any? I will probably use lithium grease or copper anti seize on the threads and maybe the rivnuts before insertion (I haven’t checked the specs for compatibility.

Only other safety concern is the seat brackets falling out when upside down in the boat when boat is on loader/rack.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is as follows: The exhaust ductwork for the room and related sterilizing equipment (the HVAC system is a once through system) is running in the 150F-200F range with high humidity (at least 30% possibly much higher). The system is exhausting \~8000 CFM. There is 200' ( with a 90' rise) of un-insulated ductwork to the point of discharge. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition particulate matter (rat urine, feces and bedding material) from the equipment being washed is being carried up into the ductwork. This is causing the condensate to become acidic. The duct is condensing a *significant* amount of water. The estimate is at least 10 gallons an hour. So the interior of the stainless steel ductwork is being pin holed and leaking. Any weld points not passivated are chewed through. As a stop gap the client has been epoxy coating the bottom six inches of the ductwork to prevent corrosion, but any joints are still being chewed through.

&amp;#x200B;

We do not have a current T&amp;B report with flows, temperatures or humidity levels (the architect is trying to schedule with ownership to get the T&amp;B guy in).

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the issue is this air temp/humidity is way off the normal areas that the psychrometic charts cover. I did enough digging to figure out the energy loads I am dealing with. Assume the saturation curve at these temperatures is nearly vertical.

&amp;#x200B;

The client would understandably like the ducts to stop raining. the options we are looking at include: 

Complete epoxy coat of the exiting ductwork.  

Factory epoxy coating (or anything better) of of replacement ductwork.   

Insulate all exposed ductwork. Unfortunately the 90' riser is in a fire rated shaft and the expense is prohibitive.

Pitch the ductwork to drain back to the tunnel washer.    

Find a way to control the moisture. We are willing to look at heat exchangers to draw down the air temperature and wring water out at specific points in the ductwork. We are willing to reheat the air to get off the saturation curve.   

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody know of coating options that work on stainless steel, work in high temperature, high humidity environments that are acidic, tolerate the welding crew welding the ducts together and can be field applied in areas where welding occurred?

41,"how do i prototype a physical thing that's really, really small?",1560378945,"I'm trying to prototype something small. not like single digit micron small but not that far off, it's about 4mm x 4mm x 0.3mm, with a feature or two about 1mm big, with said feature possibly going down to 0.1mm but i can live with 1mm, and it can't be floppy, i need it to all be at least fairly rigid as it will clip in to other stuff. I need it to be both accurate and precise as these parts need to connect to each other and to other things that are themselves very accurate.

Where am I at? Well I'm not looking for comment on this quest without trying some stuff first, here's my past two weeks:

I've learned openscad and i'm cranking out variations of my shape like there's no tomorrow, digitally my product is ace.

I've slapped a 0.25mm nozzle on my prusa mk3, tightened up my belts, and built up a mountain of plastic rejects.
I've also managed to fairly consistently print my part tho, by tweaking both the slicing and the openscad design to avoid movements that seem to cause the greatest variances in printing runs, and trying a bunch of different filaments. Nylon was too floppy, PLA was the best for rigidity but PETG overall gave me the best results, slightly less rigid than pla at 0.3mm but good enough and more consistent tolerances across prints.
But ultimately at those tolerances I think I've hit the limits of this particular fdm printer.
it's an awesome printer, getting it this far has made me really appreciate it, it's so close to printing my ridiculously small part, but it's not quite there.

I've just today sent my stl to shapeways and treatstock, with 1mm sprues thrown around the 0.3mm parts to pass the automated checks but i'm half expecting them to reject it during manual checks tho.

i've even ordered some casting resin and i've started reading up about silicon moulds, but TBH I'm not sure how i go from stl to mould and i very much want to drive this off my openscad project so maybe this will sit in my garage next to that cement I bought a while back because i thought i'd make something out of that too.

I've also started looking at the anycubic photon or maybe the prusa sl1 and am seriously considering ordering one or the other. i've even eyed up the form 3 but £3k is a ton of dough to drop so i'd want to know fo sho it would work for me. maybe i'll order a part off treatstock from someone with a form 3...
I also looked at an ultralight3d altraspin but €150k is a bit steep :(

I'm hoping for suggestions of how i can prototype this really, really small part at the tolerances i need without spending loads of ££££/€€€€/$$$$.

Are there tricks to get this thing successfully printed by a service like shapeways or treatstock or i.materialise at those tolerances? sprues? cages? some exotic thing i've not discovered in the past 2 weeks of trying to figure this out? I've attempted an order so i'll report back but keen to hear others experiences while i wait. Maybe there's a service that specialises in small parts and tight tolerances?

Should I get a anycubic photon or a prusa sl1? or... a form 3? I mean not just because they'd be cool to have, could they actually print this thing precisely and accurately? and if they can why are the online services that use them failing my stl on automated checks without sprues?

I recently graduated from uni with a Degree in ME and start work as a manufacturing engineer at one of the large defense companies in a few weeks. I plan on working for a few years and then going back to school to get an MBA. 

From everything I’ve read here, it seems that large corporate companies can be a shit show- with politics being played, people trying to sabotage you, lack of leadership, etc. Obviously, not all companies are like this and the people that say this about corporate culture could just be jaded. 

However, I have goals to become either a program director or a top level executive one day. I was wondering if any of you more experienced engineers can offer advice on how to achieve those goals. I’m seeking to do little things every day to help me stand out, move up the ladder, and excel even in the midst of all the corporate bullshit that seems to go on. 

I’ve read that it’s good to be personable and have a sort of charisma at work- both traits I personally think I demonstrate. I always like talking to the machinists at work, because more often than not, they know more than me. I’m a pretty outgoing dude, and I believe that this can help me gain the favor of my supervisors compared to someone who does a great job technically, but may be a little introverted.

I’ve also been warned to not trust anyone in a large company, because people will try to fuck you over.

70,How should I plan my future transition to Aerospace?,1560351096,"I'm currently a Supplier support/ Design Release Engr with a supplier for the Detroit automotive companies in electrical wiring and power. My degree is in Mechanics(not mechanical engr) and Aeronautics. I originally moved to the detroit area to contract for GM fresh out of college but got burned by layoffs. My new job is nice and I'm treated well(and not contract) but it's not the direction I wanted my career to go. 

I'd like to move back towards aerospace when it comes time to move jobs but I'm having a hard time planning when that time should be. Originally planned on sticking with this job at least 4 years to make me a more desirable candidate in future job applications, but seeing on here how most engineers jump ship every 2 to 3 years I dont know now. I'm not learning as much as I thought I would at this job and its typically not engaging. As a new engineer I feel like I should be learning as much as possible and at this job it feels like I do mostly emails and clerical work and not the design based engineering I feel that I'm a better fit for. 

How should I prepare to move into aerospace and when should I consider doing it? I haven't been at my current job long enough for any company I apply to realistically consider it previous employment. Any advice any engineers have on this subject would be great.

72,Office Practices: Telling a client you can't meet deadline/Telling PM your resources are booked?,1560348616,"So I'm just curious what other people's work experience has been regarding client/internal deadlines and managing them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a PE so I typically do stress analysis and drawing development, but I've recently been given a large part in 3 simultaneous projects for 1 client.  We have been busting ass to get drawings put together with VERY little information from the client after months of requests.  Finally get a set out and that day are requested to have a conference call.  I'm on the call to be informed on any changes or decisions made.

&amp;#x200B;

During the call the client mentions some changes he would done so the site looks more aesthetically pleasing.  This is going to require a significant amount of modeling changes.  The client says he would need these changes done by the next day at 11AM.  This call is taking place at 2PM.  The PE on the call asks me if I think it can be done, so I'm honest and tell him the CAD operator we had working on the project has been pulled for another project but our modeler is still available.  Just giving the current status of resources available so the PE can make a decision.  He immediately says we can get it done, meanwhile I'm thinking this is going to be very difficult to do.  The call continues and we find out that it's not just the 1 site the client wants changed, but all 3, with the same deadline of 11AM the next day.  PE says we can do it.

&amp;#x200B;

After the call I get told by 2 PEs and a PM that we NEVER tell a client we can't make a deadline, no matter what.  After the PM is off the phone, I'm then told by the 2 PEs that we NEVER tell a PM that people working on their project have been moved to another project because ""PMs don't want to hear that people are working on other people's projects"".

&amp;#x200B;

We did manage to get everything done by pulling people off other projects to help and by faking in everything.  Measurements weren't correct, pipe routes were interfering with each other, model became a mess of 2D and 3D that didn't match up, but it looked correct on the PDF because the scale was so small.  

&amp;#x200B;

To me this seems like piss poor engineering and management practice.  The fact that we won't tell clients that they're asking for unrealistic expectations and then providing them with bullshit work.  Then we also won't tell PMs the current status of resources so they can do what they're ""supposed"" to do, which is manage resources and scheduling.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a civil engineer environmental student. I am approaching my 4th year, planning on staying a total of 5.

Now I am in a really bad situation. Personally, I've been dealing with an issue and that affected my GPA. My current gpa as of now is a 2.62. I am going to try my best to bring it back to a 3.0 but my advisor told me that it is not possible within two semesters, and it's not like I am guaranteed to get all A's in those classes either.

&amp;#x200B;

I never thought I'd be that student with the low gpa in college. But Now here I am, planning on going back for Fall 2019 . I currently have no internship experience. I applied to companies but they don't fucking respond. (sorry for cursing, I am just so frustrated at this point in my life)

&amp;#x200B;

People say that a sub 3.0 gpa is gonna be a huge obstacle for me but they after I get my first job, it will be all about experience and people skills. I'm at the point where I just need an internship so I can get that job. My parents are counting on me to be financially independent after college. and I am honestly terrified at this stage. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate how school and GPAs mentally traumatize me and make me feel as if my life is going to be a life of poverty and worthlessness. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main goal out of this degree again is to just get a decent paying job. but Idk what to do witha 2.62 gpa. because a low gpa means no internships and no internships mean no jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pls let me know what my options are in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I go to cal poly pomona, a polytechnic school. I do have a resume already. I want to stay positive about my situation.

Maybe invest more of my time into projects and groups and hop off the GPA boat at this point? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not planning on having this as my main career. I am planning on crossing over to music to be a famous and successful producer if the opportunity comes.

&amp;#x200B;

As for now, I want to know what I should be working on to better my chances of getting an internship besides my gpa. OFC, I will do my best to improve it but I am looking for other options. 

&amp;#x200B;

And also, I have no idea how this Engineering license test works either? Will it make up for a bad gpa in college in terms of landing a job?

92,"Why can torque be multiplied through gearing, but not power?",1560300999,"So I was looking into building myself an electric car for fun, now some units are putting out 100kW and 450nm

Now I was intending to use the factory items on the car, gearbox, transfer case, Diffs, etc

However then it was pointed out to me that my gear ratios will multiply torque, and if I'm fitting a motor that has oodles more torque than original, I'll start breaking things.

So, I'm here to expand my knowledge, the explanation that was given to me is as follows:

450nm at motor

3.5:1 at gearbox = 1,579.5nm at the transfer input

1.5:1 at transfer = 2,369.25nm at the output

4.11:1 at the diff = 9,737.62nm to the axles

So I'd essentially get 100kW and 9,737.62nm at the wheels, excluding drive train losses

We're talking about the Rankine cycle (ideal, w/regeneration, w/superheating, and w/reheating) in fluid mechanics. I was wondering how engineers at a power plant determine what the most efficient version of a cycle would be, using regeneration, superheating, regeneration, and whatever else they can do. I figured this would be constrained by the size of the facility and the amount of power they need to generate in order to keep up with demand.

To my disappointment (but kinda predictably), he said that typically, whoever owns the power plant doesn't care *that* much about efficiency; they just pick a cycle that is proven to work (already in use at a different power plant), scale it to their building, and sell any excess power to the neighboring regions.

Despite this, I still want to understand more cycles, how to figure out what variations are better than others, and the best way to modify them if you wanted to optimize efficiency.

Apologies in advance if this is the wrong place and if my crude understanding of a GC instrument is wrong. (please of correct any assumptions and point me to some good reference material).

I am seeking some documentation/ advice on how I might go about building a Gas Chromatograph detector.

I roughly understand that a GC has a control and test gas mix that is heated in a column/oven and that the rate at which the mix passes through the column determines the gas.

But how can I detect this, I have seen a link [here](http://nerdytoad.blogspot.com/2015/01/diy-gas-chromatograph.html?m=1) and this person seems to use two methods:

- Heat loss to environment via copper pipes
- Differential heating from a Constantan wire (I think?)

4,Has anyone been an engineer in the military?,1560287453,"Hi everyone, 

I just graduated with my BS in Civil Engineering and I started grad school for a masters right away a few weeks ago. A few weeks in and I'm not really digging the research &amp; everything as I dont really think its what i want to do. I've always wanted to serve since I was in high school but life had different plans at the time. I was just wondering if anyone graduated then joined a branch of the military to be an engineer and how they liked it? If anyone could speak on their experience, commitment to the job, if they enjoyed it, training involved, opportunities it leads to, etc, that would be very much appreciated!

5,Should I try to move on to another company?,1560285229,"I'm being told by my new manager to brush up my CV. I graduated under a year ago with a masters. I went straight into this job and straight away things weren't right. I think it's probably time to move on but I don't know if leaving without at least a year under my belt will look bad. I'd appreciate any advice and opinions. 


When I joined this company, there were only 3 engineers including myself. In that time, I've seen 8 guys come and go (not contractors, employees).


In the months since autumn last year, I've designed large amounts of all of the industrial products going out of the door. Mechanical, electrical and some software, (my degree only covers one of those areas). But none of my work was checked. I haven't been shown how to do most of that work. I've effectively received no training, it's produce or perish. And there are obvious design flaws in the products we ship out because I didn't know what I was doing and made mistakes.


At this point, almost all mistakes are being put on my head. Even when the mistake happens after I raised the potential of an issue and I've been overruled. The senior engineer will go out of his way to play the blame game. And I willingly accept blame when I am at fault. I take it as a learning opportunity. And I feel that I've performed well for someone completely inexperienced who was thrown instantly into the design of complex systems with no training or oversight.


A new guy was recently brought on who is my new supervisor. In discrete conversations, he started hinting that I should brush up my CV. Now he's telling me that he'll be leaving soon. Of all of the staff brought on recently (which at least doubled the amount of staff), I've heard similar sentiments.


I've been there for months now and I thought maybe this is just how the field is. These guys are coming in and telling me that this really is a toxic work environment and that I should be looking for a new job before I have to. And I don't think that's meant in a malicious way.


Basically, I'd like to know your thoughts on a recent graduate with a few months of experience moving on so quickly. Given the situation, should I endure this job for a few more months or should I look to move on now? If I do move on then how would I market myself and explain why I'm moving on so soon? I feel like it will look bad and, as much as I have my gripes with the company, I don't want to justify leaving by calling out all the faults at the company.

I posted this in the electrical engineering forum but thought I might as well post here as well.

I've honestly been googling around for 2 hours and still am not quite sure how to approach it. The relevant standards for the cable are ASTM B33 and UL 758-AWM Style 3900. Both of which I do not have access to. I have the date sheet for the cables which offers this information:

Flexed Tinned Copper Conductor

Cond Size (AWG) = 535.3, No. of Strands = 1332, Insulation Thickness (mils) = 125 , Nominal OD (mils)= 1130

15,"Chemistry BS + Mechanical Eng BS or add ChemEng BA + MS, or MSIE?",1560272822,"Hello, all!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working under the title of Materials Engineer at a small company for almost 2 years now. I currently have a Chemistry B.S., but I really like the work I'm doing with engineering and designing systems and creating more optimal processes. However, I want to branch out further and be able to further expand on my knowledge of the subject, and I believe the first step of this is to get a degree in engineering proper.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've essentially made some P&amp;ID diagrams, specced out small control systems and done some chemical product deployments of coating chemicals into our plant with great success. I think this falls more in line with process engineering more than anything, but please correct me if I'm wrong. In addition, I do work with some of the number crunching over determining the most cost-efficient way to produce our product, and created a kind of ""data-acquisition"" program with some Raspian computers to be able to gather it as needed. This kind of lines up with what I understand is Industrial Engineering, with using stuff like Minitab?

&amp;#x200B;

I've combed over threads and information here and kind of determined that MechE is a pretty jack-of-all-trades that could serve me well to complement my current chemistry and process knowledge, but ChemE would be a more focused degree more ideal for the kind of work I imagine myself doing. However, Industrial Engineer is also a very nice position to look into, though I currently don't want to stay tethered to a computer all day right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought about going back to school, since I had a nice full ride for my Chem BS, so I have no debt there. On this line of thought, I've looked at a couple of programs around me and I could either:

&amp;#x200B;

A: Get a second Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (And possibly risk having to leave my position if they end up being day classes)

B: Take a conversion program to convert my Chem BS into a ChemEng BS + MS

C: Continue my current position and take an MSIE degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, there's always the option of just staying here, but I want to upskill and land myself a better position.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts,  guys? Should I just keep getting experience and applying to jobs? Should I go back to school and get my BA in Engineering proper? If so, what might be the best avenue?

I have finished my fourth year of my undergraduate career in Biomedical Engineering in California. Initially, my interests were to work in engineering positions (quality engineering or to R&amp;D). However, since positions are more likely given to those who have degrees in ME, EE, or Chem. E, I have decided to move past engineering to a different industry. I learned that engineers can become business analysts and I want to work in management consulting or regulatory affairs. I have had terrible luck with getting experience despite having amazing interviews and social skills, networking, etc. Can someone help me with some input?

45,"Maintenance Engineer, 1+ years experience, bored at work",1560206471,"So I'm a mechanical engineer in the maintenance department of a automotive supplier. Maintenance department is responsible for the equipment that is used to produce our product that we ship to different automotive OEMs. I'm the only engineer in my department and my boss is a former technician. I'm also the first engineer to be in the department, before me they just outsourced all drawings/engineering. I've been there about a year now and I'm finding myself with a lot of free time. Right now my job is mainly entering in data for maintenance downtime. I'll occasionally be given something like a shaft to reverse engineer and make a drawing of. After I enter in all my data I don't really have anything to do. I usually walk the lines and see if any of the technicians need help/ are doing anything interesting. I get my hands dirty to some degree helping the technicians by fetching them parts, handing them tools or however I can help with. I'm fine with helping them but I feel like that shouldn't be my main job duty either.

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked to my boss about not having enough work to do and his response is basically it's my responsibility to find something to do. I really want my boss to point me in some kind of direction of a piece of equipment/line to focus on. I don't really know what he expects me to do. I feel like without that I'm too spread out trying to keep up with all 4 production lines. I've tried applying myself to try to learn more about hydraulics, various heavy equipment at the factory and useful excel functions in my free time. My boss has given me a couple of more things to do since then but its stuff like tracking PMs that doesn't take that long to do.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel like most of our issues are either too complicated for me to tackle or simply due to maintenance guys not paying attention/caring. A lot of issues don't require a FBD, any math or engineering knowledge and are caused by operators not caring about their work. The remainder of the issues are usually electrical PLC issues. I've struggled with the small projects I have tried to analyze because every possible variable is unknown, from the forces applied to the type of steel. I don't really have anybody in the company that I can ask for help with engineering problems like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering changing jobs. The big thing is that I want more things to point to on my resume that I've accomplished at this job. So far the amount of projects I've done at this job are minimal and I don't have a lot of talking points.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm implementing a kalman filter to fuse data from multiple sensors, all providing 3d position data (from various computer vision algorithms).  In my case, I have measurements coming at \~5 hz that are very accurate, and different measurements at \~30 hz that are noisier.  My questions is: how can my filter account for the difference in uncertainty between the two sensors?  

&amp;#x200B;

All the measurements are currently inputted to the same kalman filter, and I have been trying to tune the measurement and process noise covariance matrices.  However, it currently doesn't take into account the fact that I trust the measurements from sensor1 more than I trust sensor2. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I've tried so far is simply changing the measurement noise covariance based on which sensor the data came from (i.e. if sensor1 then R = M1, if sensor2 then R = M2).  I haven't gotten good results doing this, and moreover am not sure if this is an acceptable way to approach the problem.

51,Career Advice: Jumping from a Project Engineer to a more Technical Role,1560193678,"Would really appreciate some advice for my career path as an engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently a senior project engineer with a masters &amp; bachelors in mechanical engineering. I have no design experience aside from my internships and college projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been wanting to switch to a more technical role - design engineer/mechanical engineer. I recently got a job offer for such a position, but I would be taking a small salary cut (\~5k) as the company has (accurately) stated that I have no real design experience. I know if I stay on the current management role that I'm in, I can make at least 10-15 k in my next position. But I'm worried that if I stay in this management track, I won't ever be able to get any technical experience. I really don't want to be one of those project engineers that do not fully understand or appreciate the technical details. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: is it worth it to take the salary cut to gain more technical experience? I'm fairly early on in my career (\~3 yrs after grad school). Would it make me a stronger project engineer in the long run if I were to take this design position and decide to switch back to management later down the road?

55,Considering telling my boss that I intend to leave the company in a year. Is this a bad idea?,1560187761,"I know what the conventional response is: do not tell your company you intend to quit unless you can afford to be fired that same day. I have seen it on this subreddit, /r/personalfinance, /r/cscareerquestions, etc. 

However, I think my situation is unique. I am on a team supporting a project. We previously had 7 people. About 8 months ago, the most senior member on the team, and the only other engineer working with me onsite, retired. We knew this was going to happen, but it was still a huge loss of knowledge. Last week the project manager put in her two weeks' notice for personal reasons. I posted about how I think I am going to have to absorb her responsibility last week. It appears clear now that that is what some of the higher-ups are planning. Previously I was already sort of irreplaceable, but if this happens, I will be the most important member of the project team by far (which is a bad idea in my opinion, beer truck succession planning, etc, in addition to this being well outside of my experience level). 

The timing for this expansion is also not great because in two months I start an online master's program in a different field, so I don't really want more responsibility and I definitely don't want more stress. I am a chemical engineer and the master's is in computer science, so not that closely related. To tell my boss that I am starting this program would be tantamount to me telling him I intend to quit at some point in the near future. So there is no telling him one without the other. 

Part of me wants to just level with my boss, tell him of my intentions: master's program in August, leave in ~May 2020, support the project until then. There is absolutely 0% chance that I will get fired for telling him this, I can say that for an absolute fact. My company would take at minimum 6 months to get a competent replacement for the previous project manager up to speed, similarly for me. Both the project manager and myself have been working on this project since day one, so we are incredibly familiar with the details of the project. The company literally could not afford to lose both of us. There would be no one left to support the project from an operational and managerial aspect. 

What do I have to gain by doing this? Probably not much besides being honest with my boss and allowing them to avert disaster by concentrating all of this responsibility on me and then have me quit in a year (less of a disaster if the project is complete by then, 50/50 shot of that happening). It could help them figure out how we are going to push the project along without putting far too much of the responsibility on me, which would probably result in a better finished product at the end of project.

What do I have to lose by doing this? Nothing really. Or nothing that would matter really. They can't fire me today. If they chose to ""punish"" me in other ways, reduced COL adjustment next year or something, the impact would be insignificant. If they hired a replacement and got them trained up and then fired me in 6 months, that wouldn't be catastrophic either. I have a decent amount saved up already in preparation for quitting. I would find some way to make some income that would allow more time to focus on and accelerate my studies. 

What do I have to gain by doing nothing? Nothing. I don't want more responsibility and I'm not looking for more exposure to grow my career within the company. 

What do I have to lose by doing nothing? Possible impacts to my studies (remains to be seen, but there would definitely be an increased time commitment).

I recently started an internship at a NASA center. I was very excited to come work here for the summer until I learned that I was working with NASA contractors far away from the main buildings on site. I work in a small building with some contractors and blue collar workers. NASA owns the building and only a select few offices were given to the contractors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I currently have no work and the room they put me in is a computer server room, and it is very, very loud in here. The computers are always making this loud ass beeping noise and I can't focus on anything. I barely can type out this post. I have a nice pair of Bose headphones (The QC35-II) and I can still hear the damn computer unless I have my headphones at 100% volume. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked to be moved, but because of ""Reasons"" they can't move me anywhere else. Even though they're plenty of desks in other rooms in the building, the contractors weren't assigned these rooms and so I can't even go in there and ask to sit at that desk? I don't report to anyone here, that's just what the co worker who has been helping me out told me.  What irritates me the most is that there is a conference room that no one uses that is very quiet and last friday, when almost no one was here, I just moved my computer over and sat in there and worked in peace for the day, but when I asked if I could work there full time, my co worker said no. I kinda think that it's bull that they can't move me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My co worker did say that the program lead sometimes comes to our building and uses the office that I am in, and hates the noise too.

I am asking you all, what would be the best solution for this noise problem? Should I keep asking around and see if I can get moved to a new, quieter desk? I person who is technically my manager may have some say and may be able to help me move desks, but honestly, the hierarchy is so confusing here and I actually don't know if this guy is my manager and even has a say in moving me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to include only relevant details, but enough to get a real picture for a real answer.

**TL;DR:** In a training program with the DoD where they pay for me to go to grad school (must be STEM) while not working for one year (paid school, salary). I worked it so I could get a full year to study at GTL in Metz, France. Am I trying to make up for mistakes and relive my early 20s when I should just let go and rearrange my priorities to get a masters locally and/or something more stable like finding a partner and planning for a family? Insecurities due to age and gender, and (possibly self-imposed) pressure

&amp;#x200B;

Without going too far into a full life story, I feel like I threw away my college years and early 20s in a lot of ways and missed important opportunities, maybe in some part due to my family working-class background and not knowing how to navigate college or career stuff, and in other parts due to mental health struggles.

I've had some instability in the last few years, but I grew up with an unstable home life, so it didn't strike me as abnormal. Again, without going into too many specifics if it's not relevant, I'm looking back at my choices and regrets, and I feel like this last year I've been trying desperately to make up for lost time in not being assertive and trying to please people and turn my life around.

In the process of trying to find a fitting career path in the last couple years, I found an opportunity with the DoD and took it. I started last September - it's a training program where I work for a year, get paid to go to grad school for one year, then return back to work. I graduated 4 years ago with my BS in mechanical engineering, and now my age is hitting me. I'm worrying I'm too old to be doing this training program that's geared to fresh college grads. I'm also worrying that I'm being insane in using it to go do the masters in France. I taught myself French for fun a couple years ago and looked for ways to get over there, so I actually tailored this opportunity to work out for my personal goals. I'm just wondering if as a female it's dumb because I should be trying to settle down and have a baby, not go back to school after 4 years out. I was accepted by Georgia Tech and can go to either Lorraine or Atlanta, and I was also accepted by another local school. I'm in the visa application process, but I could still technically choose to go to the other local school or Atlanta (though I don't think GT would be very pleased with a switcharoo at this point).

I have really enjoyed the job I'm in, I love the people at work, I've made many friends, gotten to do a lot of fun things with really great people, and I see and have sought out opportunities. I don't think people realize I was working for 3 years prior, so sometimes I get bummed that it feels like my work experience means nothing, but I'm also not sure it matters ultimately. Some people do know and I think it is obvious in how I communicate, work and approach problems anyway, so maybe it doesn't matter. At work, anyone brand new like me is about 22-23 years old and some of them start higher pay scale (mainly because of my training program I chose), so that makes me self-conscious sometimes. The maturity difference is usually noticeable and I often feel alone in my situation, but for the most part, I've been happy, though constantly quite neurotic and stressed about all of these worries and wanting to have a stable residence for longer than a year!

I've often been intimidated by my male counterparts that exude a natural confidence with regards to engineering, and I definitely still feel it, but I'm more confident in myself now in dealing with that. Still sometimes I wonder if I might be too behind to be able to have a fulfilling career as an engineer.

It's really tough to hear people talk about women in certain ways that make me extra self-conscious. Sometimes I'm not sure if it's done to plant seeds of doubt and neurosis, or if I'm just overthinking it. Like, an example, my high school ex who insists on still texting me occasionally (but it's always a ""how are things going?!"" to which I reply in a laconic manner, but he only wants to tell me about the latest thing in his life that's going great, like his career, house, trip, etc.), one day texts me how he feels bad for his older sister because her time is running out to get married and have kids. He says how after 30 females are just not prime for child bearing anymore and men at their age are looking for younger women and men can have kids up into their 40s and how that really sucks. Well, I'm still unmarried and I've just moved to a town in the middle of nowhere with a limited male selection and, the area being full of families and retirees, probably largely already married. Then even if I do meet someone I really like and start a relationship, I have to leave them for a whole year. So I've fucked my prospects completely!

I would give anything to go back to being 18 or even 23 (yeah I now am starting to get when older people see posts from people that young saying their life is ruined, etc.). I feel like if I were a guy, this wouldn't be a big deal. But as a female, I am increasingly getting surrounded by married couple friends and married women who don't work or work less with these stable lives. I feel like I've screwed up in a lot of ways - I'm still not married but I want a family, I'm having a longer path to career stability and fulfillment, and by the time I get out of grad school I'll be 29 and apparently undesirable to many men.

So the possibility of failure in the program and the pressure to settle down have me in a state of constant anxiety and stress. I haven't been able to sleep well for weeks, I have frequent panic attacks, chest pain, and I already have other health issues I'm trying to address with doctors before I leave in August. I also met someone I really really like and I don't want to get into that, but it's just getting hard to stay above water in my head right now.",AskEngineers,False,rootlesstraveler,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bysduq/female_engineer_will_start_a_masters_in/

96,Civil/Environmental engineer looking to focus on water resources water quality,1560122670," 

Hi all,

I've spent the last three years as a civil/environmental engineer. It seems like I've done something different every year because of switching departments or switching jobs. I've had exposure to a lot of areas in civil and environmental. I've got CAD experience, survey experience, geotech drilling/boring log creation, soils analysis, water treatment plant troubleshooting/engineering, wastewater collection system engineering, water distribution system collection, roadway condition assessment, groundwater sampling and remediation, county water and sewer plan submittal reviews, microbial air sampling, septic site assessment and design, forcemain design, groundwater monitoring well destruction, industrial waste stream sampling, culvert design, training in well rehabilitation and construction, phase 1 site assessments, experience working on landfill engineering, hazardous waste sampling and probably more that I'm not thinking of right now.

I'd really like to focus my career on water treatment/water quality. It's really the only thing i get excited about when i'm going to work and honestly it's exhausting constantly working on something i'm completely unfamiliar with, or have very little experience with and very little interest in.

Hi everyone,

I recently graduated from a Canadian university with a bachelors degree in biomedical electrical engineering and have spent the last few months searching for work without luck. Due to the diverse nature of the courses taken for my degree I am feeling under qualified for a large number of job postings I come across. The courses I took were split between electronics courses and software courses, with a few dealing specifically with the medical applications of these topics. This has left me feeling like I have half of an electrical engineering degree and half of a software engineering degree. My work experience during school has also been diverse, with one job having me in a very basic software development role, and another having me in more of a clinical engineering role. In addition to my software related job my final engineering project for school was a smart phone application.

My first thought when applying for jobs is to go for the more software engineering oriented ones as opposed to the electronics ones. However, although I have a bit of experience with the software side of my degree, I still feel as though I am vastly under qualified for any real software engineering degrees. Specifically because my experience for both my job and final project was simply understanding the basics of the programming languages that I was using and then figuring the rest out based on examples on stackoverflow.

I would ideally love to work a job related to the biomedical side of my degree; however, in my area of the country I have found that there aren't too many opportunities for this. I'm completely open to working any type of job I can get with my degree, but I'm completely unsure of what type jobs these would be? What type of job titles should I be searching for?

I am a senior ME student and will be graduated in this month. I have received two different job offers, one from a major aviation company and the other is from a missile company which is also a major one in the country (not the US).

I have been doing an internship at this aviation company (let's call it company A)  for the past 6 months and got a job offer just last week. The company has a variety of projects going on and it's near future plan is quite big. They aim to design a whole new military helicopter and the position I was offered is on the helicopter team. They basically want me to work as a payload design engineer which  did sound great to me because I have been told that I would get to do design and be in close contact with the suppliers or contractors of the related parts. So the position is a combination of both design and a little bit of project management (I guess??). The major downside of this company is basically the unstability caused by the high pace of growth. They hire a lot of engineers right now and the feedback I received from the engineers I met was not that good either. Main complains I heard from them were how little amount of work they were given and how there was not that much to do during work time... There is just a lot of know-how in the company and lots of different training courses are available for engineers but company A's high pace of growth questions my mind, since it came with a questionable work discipline and a salary cut (entrance salary was %20 more last year)...

The other offer I received is from a missile company (let's call it company B) which is known for their good work discipline and salary. They offered me 30% more than company A but the offered job description did not seem that exciting to me. My job there sort of comes into role after the sales. I wouldn't be designing the main product, I would be integrating those sold missiles onto related vehicles and plus, I was told that I would get to work with vibration which I didn't really like during my bachelor. But you know, money might make me like it??

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, if company A offered me a salary as high as the company B, I would just jump onto it without caring about anything else because the future of aviation is great and apart from that, the country I live in currently got some invesments from both Boeing and Airbus which also provides great future opportunities for the local aviation industry. Company B is just attractive to me because of its higher pay and strong work discipline.

11,Is practical experience a must for getting a job as an engineer?,1560101265," 

Hello enginineering community,

right now I am about to finish school in germany and I really would like to study mechanical engineering. But my parents make it really really hard for me. They are basically telling me all the time that without practical experience I won't be able to get a job after I finish studying or if I find a job and my lack of practial experience will lead to alot of embarrassment in the company. So they are suggesting to me to dual study or educate before with another job. I applied for a dual study for some companies but always got rejected (I haven't finished school yet so its pretty hard to get a place). They now want me to try it again for a place in 2020 after I finish school this month.

Now what really confuses me is that a lot of people are saying that as a engineer its really easy to find a job and there is always a lack of engineers and that the companies are searching for them all the time. The unemployment rate of people who studied engineering is about 2,5% in Germany.

My parents however show me forum contributions with engineers saying how hard it is to find a job and how hard it is to get into a company and so on, they are telling me that in their companies engineers with no practial experience get rejected and have no success. They also know an engineer, who says that ""you will be nothing without practial experience"".

Honestly I don't know what to believe anymore.

I really don't want to wait a year after school to get the chance to apply for a dual study again with the chance of being rejected again. I can understand the point from my parents but I think the are exaggerating way to hard and that their point of view is a bit one-dimensional

It would really mean alot to me if you could give some advice, tell me how the situation is in your country. Would also be really handy if there are some germans that can give me a realistic and detached point of view of how the situation is in Germany right now and how you are getting along.",AskEngineers,False,babyboje,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bymnib/is_practical_experience_a_must_for_getting_a_job/

20,Tips for making a game controller (DS4) mod idea work?,1560082148,"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8CTx6TCRS2YzYyP2J8gWwH.jpg

Not quite the typical engineering question, but I'm trying to come up with a mechanism to do the specific task of making something click the TouchPad on the front of the controller when clicking / pulling a button or something added to the back of the controller. The idea is to make makeshift grip buttons on the back with software that binds keys to the TouchPad, rather than buying expensive controller models. The only idea I currently had was gluing / taping a butt hinge to the top of the controller, putting string through it and knotting it at the top and looping the other end at the back of the controller so that I could pull the loop and pull the hinge together. Although I would separate the hinge from the pad a bit with some sort of thin space, so it wouldn't make contact unless the string was actually pulled.

I know it sounds like a silly idea; I just want back buttons on a controller, and because you can use software to bind keys to the TouchPad (which isn't normally used), making back buttons that can click the touchpad mechanically could be a solution. I'd just like some sort of DIY solution myself, but there's definitely good 3d printing opportunities out there for it, because if done properly, it could be a better and cheaper alternative to other options out there.",AskEngineers,False,Belmonkey,/r/AskEngineers/comments/byjl3e/tips_for_making_a_game_controller_ds4_mod_idea/

22,How to calculate VRM heat dissipation,1560073058,"Hello everybody  :)

I'm new here so I hope this post won't cause any problems(especially on the rules) :/

&amp;#x200B;

I was analysing a motherboard and studying the VRM efficiency.

Now the use case was

Vcore controller: [IR35201](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/dc-dc-converter/digital-dc-dc-multiphase-controller/ir35201mtrpbf/) (8 total phase, in 6+2 configuration)

Power stages used: TDA21472

The configuration is 6 (Vcore phases) and 2 phases(SOC)

&amp;#x200B;

[Link to the image showing the vrm](https://imgur.com/a/i64xkNf)

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the calculation of the Heat output(of the single phase) I used the formula, [based on this article](https://www.powerelectronics.com/power-electronics-systems/mosfet-selection-switching-power-supply-systems):

    W = 1/2*Vin*Iout*(Tr+Tf)*Freq

&gt;Vin = 12V (or 2.2V)  
&gt;  
&gt;Iout = the current that the CPU wants(for example a 8 core CPU, from current AMD generation, for 1,35/1,4V will provide around 100A) that will be divided by phase count  
&gt;  
&gt;Tr, Tf = are from the data-sheet(Trise and Tfall)  
&gt;  
&gt;Freq = will depend by the manufacturer(I usually use 400KHz because it's a good value in the usual use case)

This gave me this results:

&amp;#x200B;

|Vout|Switching Frequency|Iout|Heat (W)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2,2 V|400 KHz|100 A|9 W|
|2,2 V|400 KHz|150 A|13 W|
|2,2 V|400 KHz|200 A|18 W|
|2,2 V|400 KHz|250 A|22 W|
|2,2 V|400 KHz|300 A|26 W|
|2,2 V|400 KHz|360 A|33 W|

&amp;#x200B;

Now the calculation seems a bit off(especially at 200+ Amperes) and maybe I need to take into account something else.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My real question comes when I would like to measure the Heat when a doubler is involved(so 8+4 phase that are, really, just a 4+2 with a doubler) how should I do?

Will the equation be enough?

31,I'm in need of engineering career advice. Can you help?,1560041559,"**First paragraph contains context to my situation. Skip to second paragraph for questions.**

My relationship with the field of engineering has been slightly convoluted.  Originally my undergraduate degree was biomedical engineering and I had plans to work as a researcher after graduation.  I had an internship at the NIH between my junior and senior year that heavily discouraged me from pursuing my first plan so I pivoted into a double major in electrical engineering.  However without a relevant internship during my undergrad, it was hard to land a good job as an electrical engineer.  I decided to apply for Ph.D. programs in electrical engineering thinking it would allow me to gain further knowledge in electrical engineering and pursue a research role as I had planned from earlier in my education.  Fast-forward and I am now graduating with my masters in electrical engineering.  Although I learned a lot, the program wasn't a great fit for me in terms of continuing with my Ph.D and I couldn't find research that I was really interested in doing.  I am now at a crossroads in my career path.  On one hand, I am excited to be done with school for a little.  I accepted an offer to work at Northrop Grumman as a hardware engineer which will be a good opportunity to build my resume.  I am on the other hand still attracted to the idea of a pursuing a Ph.D.  I received an email for an on-site interview at the JHU applied physics laboratory which seems like a good place to possibly continue this goal, but I feel that I'm reaching a point of burn out.

**For those of you that have decided to go down a career in industry, how has your progression through the engineering ranks ended up?**  I am concerned that I will be working on projects that may not be interesting but it may be necessary to put in work now on something less interesting with the goal to move on to something better.  I am however excited to start my ""adult life"" as I will be making a good amount of money and I will have some free time to pursue extracurricular activities that I have wanted to for a while.

**For those of you that have received your Ph.D., was it worth the extra input at the beginning?**  The advice that consistently I've gotten was to do your Ph.D. early.  I have however realized that to be really successful in a Ph.D. program you must be interested in what you are studying.  I am concerned that I may not find that thing that I'm really passionate about and trying to force the Ph.D. will not be worth it.  It also sucks having to spend all of your time working and I am concerned that I'm quickly letting my early adult life slip away from me.  However, the reward for putting in the time early seems significant so I am trying to weigh the pros and cons.

To be honest, I currently feel like there hasn't been a specific thing that I've studied and said ""this is what I really want to do"".  I like engineering and I'm good at it.  However I feel like I have no idea about where to look and find something I really enjoy.  **I feel like I can't be alone in this feeling and my question is** **how did people find something that they really enjoyed?**",AskEngineers,False,GenericUs3rn4m3,/r/AskEngineers/comments/byer5o/im_in_need_of_engineering_career_advice_can_you/

58,Question Involving Airfoils in Engineering Drawings,1560003818,"I have recently been given an engineering drawing of a compressor blade from  a company, with the task of regenerating it in CAD. I was not provided with NACA series for the airfoil cross-sections, and I am struggling greatly with how to proceed. The provided engineering drawing cuts the blade into eight different airfoil cross-sections, and provides the following specifications about each cross-section:

1. Maximum thickness
2. chord length
3. leading and trailing edge radius
4. x,y coordinates of the tip of the leading edge, relative to origin.
5. angle between the chord and the x-axis.
6. The ""trailing edge angle"". to generate this angle (designated theta2), two normal lines are drawn between the concave and convex sides of the airfoil, fixed distances away from the tip of the trailing edge (designated d\_A and d\_B). The *midpoints* of these two normal lines are then connected, and angle between this resulting line (designated line l) and the x-axis is then defined as the trailing edge angle. a link to a diagram of trailing edge angle can be found here [https://imgur.com/ShRfhjb](https://imgur.com/ShRfhjb). I did not want to post the actual engineering drawing, in order to respect confidentiality.

The engineering drawing does not give the NACA series for the airfoil.  I have never encountered an instance where I've had to generate an airfoil without the NACA series (granted, I have not worked extensively with modeling blades). This seems like a very roundabout way of describing an airfoil, but I am not really in a position to judge.

My question is, is it possible to generate the shape (or to calculate the correct NACA series) of these airfoils with the provided information? Wouldn't you need more information about the camber? I can't seem to find any way to calculate the camber/mean camber line with the provided information. 

More generally speaking, I'd also be interested in gaining any information about the way that airfoils are typically dimensioned in industry. Is there a standard convention for airfoil engineering drawings, as far as the information provided? Do companies generally provide the NACA series for airfoil cross-sections, and if not, how exactly can you model the airfoil shape without the NACA series?

I hope that this isn't too confusing of a question, and that the description is clear enough.  Any input at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this post.",AskEngineers,False,Dukie_McDukeface,/r/AskEngineers/comments/by8gsp/question_involving_airfoils_in_engineering/

I'm not here to ask which is better for a prospective career, I've heard that CSE/CE is better job wise. What I am curious about is which degree is more pertinent to the music business. I am interested in creating the audio equipment as well as the software in a music studio. I want to work with/fix/build the microphones, speakers, stations/equipment, computers, and etc. However, ASU is the likely school I will be going to and they do not have an audio engineering or sound/acoustic engineering option (though even if they did, I am not sure if that will do what I want it to). So my question is, would EE or CSE allow me to be more involved with music? The plus side to either is that I can do music as a hobby if things go bad.
Electrical Engineering is enticing to me because I do have interests in a wide variety of things (both in and out of the entertainment industry).
I know there are programming classes I would need for this, which makes CSE desirable and is also something of interest, however a lot of the jobs I have found for people who work with or build the equipment used by musicians are by electrical engineers.
ASU does offer a 4+1 program with a BSE in EE and an MS in Computer Engineering (Electrical Engineering), but I don't know if that is a logical route or not, and if it's going to let me achieve my goals.

84,Second Internship VS. Student Association Position?,1559919915,"Hey all. I appreciate this subreddit, it's been an excellent source of information as I work through my time at school. I'm using a throwaway.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Mechanical Engineering Technologist student at SAIT, in Canada. It's a 2 year program that I am planning to take over 3 years due to documented learning disabilities, as well as having had to upgrade before starting that program (I'm a mature student, at 24). These disabilities don't have much of a noticeable affect on my day to day life, but it means I take 4 courses a semester instead of 6. I finished last semester (S2/6) with a 3.93 overall GPA, and was offered 3 internships for the summer: 2 with O&amp;G equipment manufacturing companies, and one with a large construction company in their engineering dept. On the advice of my uncle, an engineer of 25+ years, I took the offer from one of the O&amp;G equipment manufacturers and started at the end of April.

&amp;#x200B;

This internship has gone very well, in my opinion. Within two weeks, my manager had given myself and another intern full reign over a project to be completed for a company down in Texas. We're nearly completed on the final phase of that, putting the design through final testing on-rig, and it seems like my company is happy with what we've done. I know I've enjoyed working here, and I still have three months to go before school starts again. My manager has hinted at asking me to come back next summer, and it's a really enticing thought.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I do have other options. I feel strongly that I could get another internship with a different company next year, if I chose to put the work into it like I did this year. But that's not the real question here: what if I was to forgo another internship entirely? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been very involved at school this past year. I was the president of the D&amp;D Club, on the student association's Board of Directors, a member of the SA Finance committee, Clubs Reimbursement committee, and Campus Activities board, as well as the Internal Relations Director for my program's Academic club, SMS. I've volunteered within and without my department, and was campaign manager for a friend as he ran for an executive position this last March. At my school, we have 4 SA executive student positions, elected positions that are paid and last for a year. I am most interested in VP External, the position that advocates for students to local, provincial, and federal government. I feel like I won't have much of an issue getting elected, and it's something I really want to do and feel I would do well at, not to mention effecting real change at my school. But it would mean extending my time at school from 3 years to 4 (graduating at 27), and I wouldn't be able to do another summer internship within industry before graduation.

88,Is it time to start looking for a new job?,1559918288,"  

Okay, long story short,

I’ve been working for the same company for approximately 3 years (anniversary in September). Because of their unfair and somewhat stupid performance review, I haven’t been able to get an extra penny from the organization, so I’ve had the same salary for all of this time. The organization is a somewhat important and recognized automotive engineering supplier around the globe with important customers such as GM, Ford, Chrysler, BMW, etc. Yesterday I sought the manager of the site and asked him about what could we do to improve my salary and to have extra responsibilities (change from design to product) but he told me that right now the company is struggling with the money so raises and hiring processes are in hold by the moment (which is always their perfect excuse). The place is fine, work is really interesting but I can’t stand another month begging for a change in my salary or even a change in my engineering responsibilities. I am way below the national average in comparison with other engineering jobs. Should I just stop the non-sense over thinking and start the job hunt already? One of the reasons I want to stay is because of all of the technical engineering work that the company does. It requires you to literally apply all your mechanical engineering skills to develop the systems that the customer wants. As a plus, I already have my master’s degree but it seems that is not being taken into account. I am struggling right here and I know that I have to take a decision. I do not want to spend any more time devaluing myself in terms of money. As an extra note, I am planning to get married in the following year and start looking for a house so definitely I need to get a better salary.

I have job security here in that people like me and tell me I do a good job, but Im not that interested in staying long term. I could stay here forever and shift project to project but I have not felt strongly that this is where I can build a life. I stayed for my required year since they provided relocation and a sign on bonus, but dont have anything holding me here.

I wont be looking to start a job a bit before this project ends, but Im already feeling like I should apply elsewhere. My commute isnt too bad, but I would much prefer a shorter commute or public transportation as an option (hard to find in most places, since suburban office parks are where most engineering jobs are, and suburbs suck to live in). Theres job security in having a clearance, but it also comes with its own ethical questions and I have thought about those a lot. Im fine with what I work on now, but I cant say the same for future possible projects. I would much rather work civilian stuff in the long term.

The other wrinkle is the state of the economy, I think a recession is coming before the end of next year if not this year and I am concerned if I get started at a new job only to face a risk of job loss because of a downturn. But thats part of the risk of a job anyway.

I am a 24 year old manufacturing engineer at an Aerospace company.  
I've been with this company for about 1.5 years now but have about another 1.5 years of experience as an intern at Tesla (which i would consider full-time engineer experience). I didn't want to return to Tesla because I disliked the bay area (no offense to anyone in the bay area).

This is all complicated by the fact that I don't want to stick around with the company after the project is complete. Mostly personal reasons that I won't get into here.

26,Resin powder level sensor in railcar,1559834087,"Hello,

I work for a plastics manufacturing plant that uses resin as an ingredient in making product. Sometimes, the resin will be obtained from a railcar (sent from a raw materials supplier) through a vacuum system that hooks up to the bottom of the car to move the resin to one of the plant lines. 

One of the problems with this system is that there is no way to tell if a railcar compartment is going empty while out in the rail yard. Workers will literally bang on the sides of the railcar compartment to see if it sounds hollow or empty. Sometimes the vacuum system will suck air because the compartment has already run empty and no one knows about it (or people catch it after it's too late) and this can slow the process down and even cause us to lose a line.

Would it be possible to implement some kind of low-level sensor in the railcar that would trigger an alarm to alert workers that the compartment needs to be switched soon? Since the railcars are not my company's the sensor would have to be movable. What about something that could be placed at the top hatch opening and point down, sensing when resin reaches a certain distance away from the top of the railcar?

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!",AskEngineers,False,oil_rig69,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bxhvfa/resin_powder_level_sensor_in_railcar/
27,How do you ensure an assembly has been performed correctly?,1559828920,"Good morning everyone,

I was thinking about what kind of testing could you perform on a complex assembly to ensure non-visible parts have been correctly installed (or installed at all). I’m talking of mechanical components such as bearings.

Searching around for regular NDT (Non Destructive Testing), it seems like these tests are usually aimed at checking one particular piece for faults (cracks, deformities…) but not at checking the presence of a piece in an assembly.

I’m sure this issue has been encountered before, and somehow fixed in many industries. The only option I have found so far is doing complicated visual inspections.

To simplify it, let’s assume an all-metal assembly.

TLDR: What tests are used in various industries to ensure the presence of all the required pieces in an assembly?

30,about this profession... what should i do?(searching for help with this profession),1559818929,"warning, this will be a long text, and i will be bitching about it most of the time, and my grammar sucks too:

about me: i am 24 years old, second semester at a german hochschule (i think it is the equivalent to college), my father is engineer and i actually enjoy handy work. if i don't finish college, i will be the first one in my family to do so and i have 16 older cousins than me. some of them got doctors summa cum laude.

so as i said, i am in the second semester. my current problem is: all my life i have been told that i am talented when it comes to technical thinking, and now i feel like i don't belong here. i went to a technical school, had a great apprenticeship to be an engineering draughtsman, and now i am here, feeling like a complete failure. 

math is hard, and i guess that is normal

technical mechanics is managable, but definitly not what i want to do as a job. i don't give a shit about how much pressure whatever material can handle. i would use this when i would be constructing cars, spaceships or ships, which i don't intend to do. this is exactly not what i want to become. still managable though

electronics is ... just a big questionmark to me. i chose my type of engineer because i tried to avoid it, and it is still a topic that i hope i will never use.

construction, the thing that i used to do for fun, has now become a storm of formulas, that could be avoided by just adding more material. again, i don't plan to become a rocket engineer.

physics... i just left the lesson because it makes no sense to stay there while i don't understand a single sentence. like genuenly, he explains something with formulas that i would need another explanation for.

the next semesters will go more into detail, which is a direction that i don't want to go.

the reasons why i am still here: to make my parents proud i guess? the salary is good i guess? no idea of alternatives? i think i could do it since i have enough time, but if i would repeat a semester... well i would have to be in this hell longer. 

so my question: is this normal? my classmates don't seem to get that much of the topics either, or they don't care enough. 

if it is normal, am i the only one feeling this panic?? 

also where can i find someone to talk to? (my mom got a burnout 2 years ago, and my father (usually an awesome guy) simply doesn't know how to handle this topic.",AskEngineers,False,yellow-snowslide,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bxfep0/about_this_profession_what_should_i_dosearching/

I started working at a tier 1 automotive supplier in a high COL area right after graduating college in June 2018.

61,What should I be doing with my degree?,1559768202,"Hi everyone,

I recently graduated from a Canadian university with a bachelors degree in biomedical electrical engineering and have spent the last few months searching for work without luck. Due to the diverse nature of the courses taken for my degree I am feeling under qualified for a large number of job postings I come across. The courses I took were split between electronics courses and software courses, with a few dealing specifically with the medical applications of these topics. This has left me feeling like I have half of an electrical engineering degree and half of a software engineering degree. My work experience during school has also been diverse, with one job having me in a very basic software development role, and another having me in more of a clinical engineering role. In addition to my software related job my final engineering project for school was a smart phone application.

My first thought when applying for jobs is to go for the more software engineering oriented ones as opposed to the electronics ones. However, although I have a bit of experience with the software side of my degree, I still feel as though I am vastly under qualified for any real software engineering degrees. Specifically because my experience for both my job and final project was simply understanding the basics of the programming languages that I was using and then figuring the rest out based on examples on stackoverflow.

I would ideally love to work a job related to the biomedical side of my degree; however, in my area of the country I have found that there aren't too many opportunities for this. I'm completely open to working any type of job I can get with my degree, but I'm completely unsure of what type jobs these would be? What type of job titles should I be searching for?

62,Why is Euler's Formula Failing Me?,1559765783,"Student here working for the summer with an engineering firm.  The P. Eng I'm working for has asked me to analyze a lifting frame consisting of a single 3""x3""x1/4"" HSS section, 25"" in length.  It will have two lugs on the top and two on the bottom, supporting a load of 1750lbs, shackled to the crane's block at 60 degree angles.  I'm a mechanical student, not a civil, so structures aren't really my thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was analyzing the compressive force in the beam, which I found to be 106 psi through stress = force/area (used a different load for these calculations).  Just to be sure I thought I'd find the critical stress of the beam  to make sure it doesn't buckle, even though I'm pretty sure at such a small compressive load it wouldn't, but I'm a student and eager to go overkill.  I'm using Euler's formula to find Euler's buckling load/the critical load, but keep getting absurdly high numbers: 570ksi, which is greater than the strength of steel by a factor of 10.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to figure out where I'm going wrong, and why the values I'm getting are so high.  Is it possible to get a critical load higher than strength of the material?  Is it possible that the column will fail before its buckling load?  If so, how do I go about making sure that the frame won't fail in compression?

Also, why do radio waves generate current in an antenna? Is it because the radio wave is an EM wave which is a stream of photons. When a stream of photons hit the electron cloud in the metal the electron cloud ends up oscillating which generates the current?

78,I’m an adult student needing help with choice of Eng. discipline.,1559742712,"Hello all,

I’m a 30 year old, first time, student entering the engineering field. I am approaching the crossroads of which engineering discipline I must choose. I like aspects of Industrial, mechanical, and am on the fence about electrical or possibly software...

A little about me. I’ve transplanted myself from Canada to the US a few years ago (American wife says no to snow). I’m currently an electrician, unhappy with it, and decided to go to school to find a more rewarding career with a better life balance. I was always interested in engineering but missed the boat while living in Canada and settled in to a niche oilfield service position. Since moving to the US I joined the IBEW and have been doing that for a few years with little enjoyment. My wife said I was “too smart” to be coming home tired and beat up everyday and gave me the green light to do what’s best. Took the ACT, nailed it, got a full ride to a CC that directly transfers to a state school. I’m a few classes away from completing all the coursework I possibly can. It’s all been online so I can continue to work right up until I’m at the big school. Because of this schedule I haven’t taken any “real engineering” classes. Just all the maths, humanities, socials, etc. when I make the jump after this semester I’ll have to decide what to do as the bulk of my schedule will be made up of major specific courses. 

I’m in a position now where I don’t really have “time” to throw around and discover myself further. I have a passion for engineering, I just need to find my career within it and be the best I can be. I can only afford to be out of work for two years so switching majors mid way will be a very tough or even impossible venture. I guess these are the cons of starting so late. 

Back to the question at hand: which path? I like industrial because I am a true believer and have always considered optimization as the missing piece to many puzzles I’ve come across in various industries. I like mechanical because of its broad scope and more tangible results. Electrical is always pushed on me because of my background but every EE I’ve encountered does work that I myself don’t particularity care fore. I’m sure there are scopes of that path I would enjoy but haven’t come across any yet. The bridge between electrician and engineer really doesn’t help much anyway other than possible floor level communication with contractors. Software is the one on the back burner but I have always enjoyed technology (especially in my teens and early 20’s) and wouldn’t mind joining that ring. 

It’s tough, it’s stressful, it’s a big big decision for me and it’s approaching. I’ve talked to a few engineers I know, mostly electrical and one ME who has moved in to a VP role with a aerospace company. He said IE roles can typically be filled with ME’s but not the other way around. That’s about all the advice I’ve received within my small network.

But if it does filter true ac that actually goes back and forth,how would it do that? First,ground isn’t usually a return path like people say(maybe they’re referring to conventional current???),but ground is usually connected directly to the negative terminal of a battery in a dc circuit,such as a car or even an iPhone. IF the battery doesn’t switch polarities,how would a cap with a pin on ground even do this? It’s very confusing.

2. The duct will meet and drop into a metal box with water in the bottom to stop most of the sparks. The exit will have a metal mesh to also help with sparks.

3. There will be a magnet before the blower motor to catch any large particles that make it that far.

4. I planned on using [this blower motor](https://www.pennstateind.com/store/DC250SEMB.html) because it has a metal fan blades and good reviews from others who have used it for welding/fume extraction. 

5. The exhaust is going to go though the wall outside and turn down into a metal box. I thought about including a filter on top of the box, but am worried about the fire risk. If I didn't have a filter I would probably just have some fine dust gather around the area outside that would need to be swept up. Everything outside is concrete and sweeping it up once in a while wouldn't be a big deal.

93,Have I sealed my fate by not getting an engineering job out of college?,1559704532,"Some background. I graduated with an EE degree with a not so hot overall (major GPA is better) GPA and no internships (I've realized my mistake but by junior year the damage was already done). I graduated without having a job lined up and by the end of the summer, I panicked and applied to everything technical.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually got 2 choices, an IT job in a well known health IT company or an EE job at a industrial plant. The EE job was in a town with less an 2k people, completely dead (didn't even have a gym!!) with nothing to do so for my own sanity I went with the IT job, as it was closer to friends/family in a huge city. I ended up liking my job (to sum it up I save hospitals time, $$$, lives by automating software/workflows) more than I thought because of my amazing team and the work I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to get bored of my job (I've learned a lot but it's not challenging anymore) and knew this would just be something to pay the bills in the end. My current job is also having me do more script level work that engineers are supposed to be doing, but they have no idea how to work on my solution and they have an engineering title. I want to move on and get back into engineering... nearly 2.5 years later. There are software eng positions here but I do NOT want to code.

99,Isn't the 85th percentile rule fundamentally flawed...?,1559698511,"ELI5 on the 85th percentile rule as I understand it:  in 1964, a researcher for the Dept of Commerce, Bureau of Public Roads named David Solomon wrote a paper called [""Accidents on Main Rural Highways Related to Speed, Driver, and Vehicle""](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa1304/Resources3/40%20-%20Accidents%20on%20Main%20Rural%20Highways%20Related%20to%20Speed,%20Driver,%20and%20Vehicle.pdf).  In this paper, Solomon states that variation in vehicle speeds on roads is a leading cause of accidents.  Somehow, that became to be that, when left to drive completely by their own intuition regarding speed, 85% of drivers will drive a ""reasonable and prudent"" speed.  And somehow that became to be that, logically, if speed limits are set at the 85th percentile (rounded to the nearest 5mph), then the road will have safe speed limits.

Now, like I said, that's how I understand it.  Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.  I'm a structural engineer, so I only had to take two classes is highway &amp; traffic engineering.  Maybe my understanding of the fundamentals is flawed.  Also, if someone would fill in how we got from the Solomon paper to the ""reasonable and prudent"" 85th percentile rule, that'd be great, too!  I see the logic in the progression, but I'd love to hear who made the decisions and exactly why.  But that's kinda off topic.

Here's my beef with the whole thing:

As an intern, I helped lay down tubes and do speed studies with a county DoT.  Now, I didn't do the number-crunching at the time, but there seemed to be some direct relationship between the speeds the tubes recorded and the speed limits on the signs.  But those drivers were driving on an already-marked road.  They weren't free to intuit their own reasonable and safe speed.  So, wouldn't the whole concept be flawed?

It'd be akin to taking speed measurements with a police car and radar parked on the side of the road.  Then, stating that the speed limit needs no change as 85% of people were driving at the posted limit.

But what about unmarked or new roads?  Every driver is taught their ""...unless otherwise posted limit"" during driver's ed.  I don't remember exactly, but it's something like 30mph in city limits and 45mph or 55mph on rural roads.  So, even if there was some brand new road through the country, drivers would be influenced by the thought, ""I don't know the speed limit, but it's probably 45mph.  I better drive that just in case there's a cop around.""  This seems flawed as well.

**TLDR:**  My understanding of the 85th percentile rule is that it requires drivers to intuit a safe speed without any legal influence and wonder how that's possible when speed studies are conducted in an environment where existing speed limits are already clearly posted or where drivers are taught typical speeds for unmarked roads.

My solution would be, of course, to just use the design speed of the road as the speed limit.  While working at my county DoT internship, I sought out a few roads' design speed limits from the drawings.  Knowing then pretty much what I know now about roads, I drove them at those design speed limits to see what that was like.  On a design speed 45mph road (marked at 35mph), I can honestly say I didn't *want* to speed.  I felt like 45mph, with the number of entrances per mile, clear zones, etc, was plenty enough speed.  I feel like it's a much better system than the 85th percentile rule.

I could go on and on because I'm passionate about speed limits and roadway design.  But I don't want to ramble.  Please help me understand how the 85th percentile rule isn't fundamentally flawed as described.",AskEngineers,False,Goins2754,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bwwxw6/isnt_the_85th_percentile_rule_fundamentally_flawed/

2,Torn between EnvE and Microbio/Soilscience..?,1559696693,"Hey there, 

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my first year in school, my current major is Microbiology. I plan to transfer to a larger school once I finish my prereqs, and double major in Microbio/Soil Science. I plan to work in industry, doing soil bioremediation and environmental consulting. One of my goals is also to create a plant nutrient line to create a stream of passive income. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have been wondering if Environmental Engineering may be a more suitable degree? I don't really want to work in a lab all day, which is what it seems a Microbiologist will be doing. I want to help companies maintain compliance with environmental regulations, and I feel like this is within the domain of the Environmental Engineer. I could also double major in Microbiology to maintain that background. I would like to continue my education someday and research things like genetically engineering bacteria.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound accurate? I think the EnvE with a Microbio double major or minor might be the best route to take. It seems like that route may be more employable than a Microbio/Soil Science and also with higher pay. I want to maintain the hard science within my degree because I want to go to graduate school eventually. My logic is that most of the things I want to do with microbiology are pretty inaccessible to those with only a bachelors degree, so why not go EnvE/Micro and have an easier experience straight out of school?

I'll be graduating with my BSME soon, and am trying to decide whether I should just get a masters in ME, or try something different. My favorite things about ME so far are CAD/modeling, thermo/fluids/heat transfer, and additive manufacturing. I'd ideally like to get involved with sustainability and renewable energy, or at least improving the efficiency of fossil fuel applications. That said, I know that career goal isn't guaranteed, so I don't want my master's selection to go to waste if I don't get into that field. 

If I don't go with ME, I think EE would be a good addition in terms of allowing for versatility, but from my understanding, EE has a lot of CS prerequisites I don't have. 

Systems engineering also looks interesting to me due to its versatility and complexity. 

I found an online Masters program for sustainability engineering, but again, I don't know that it would be useful if I don't get into that field. 

And finally, I think a material science masters could be useful in some of the fields I'm interested in (both additive manufacturing &amp; renewable energy), but I haven't found a program for that close enough to me or online.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently graduated from a Canadian university with a bachelors degree in biomedical electrical engineering and have spent the last few months searching for work without luck.  Due to the diverse nature of the courses taken for my degree I am feeling under qualified for a large number of job postings I come across. The courses I took were split between electronics courses  and software courses, with a few dealing specifically with the medical applications of these topics. This has left me feeling like I have half of an electrical engineering degree and half of a software engineering degree. My work experience during school has also been diverse, with one job having me in a very basic software development role, and another having me in more of a clinical engineering role. In addition to my software related job my final engineering project for school was a smart phone application. 

My first thought when applying for jobs is to go for the more software engineering oriented ones as opposed to the electronics ones. However, although I have a bit of experience with the software side of my degree, I still feel as though I am vastly under qualified for any real software engineering degrees. Specifically because my experience for both my job and final project was simply understanding the basics of the programming languages that I was using and then figuring the rest out based on examples on stackoverflow.

I would ideally love to work a job related to the biomedical side of my degree; however, in my area of the country I have found that there aren't too many opportunities for this.

And in general, from time to time I hear from some Americans and Europeans I know that there are technical/industry jobs that companies actually have a hard time finding locals interested in then, and I did watch somewhat recently a DW note on a German maker of metrology instruments hiring Syrian engineers because German ones weren't interested. But all this seems too good to be true, and not very grounded in reality . When I look for jobs abroad, most offers specify you must be already be able to legally work in the country, so nobody seems keen on actually bothering with the hassle of hiring foreigners, plus some countries even need to be proven by the company that no locals are willing or capable of doing said job.

I am designing a temperature switch and would love some guidance if anyone has any suggestions. It would be a contact switch (stick on) that can open a relay when it exceeds 350 F and closes the relay when the temperature drops back down to 250 F; application is shutting down a compressor before it overheats and restarting it once it cools.

Most switches I’ve found online are instream switches, or if they are stick on, they have low switching temperatures.

60,"failure analysis, fatigue or creep?",1559607946,"I have a part I am designing and am somewhat confused about what would best model the failure of this part over time.  The part is essentially a steel shaft, while in service it will be in compression in the axial direction.  I've looked into buckling failure and it is not very slender so that doesn't seem to be a potential issue.  The stress would be below the yield strength of the material.  This particular part will only be stressed in compression, but for the sake of discussion and understanding everything better, I'd be curious if the analysis would be any different if the part would be stressed the same magnitude but in tension (as long as buckling failure is not a concern).  

The stress would be cyclical, but the amplitude of the stress cycles probably wouldn't be more than 1ksi, with a mean stress of about 30 ksi while in use (probably about 15 ksi while not in use).  With such a small amplitude, would it be more accurate to consider failure under fatigue or from creep? Does creep even apply for compression?  Is there a way (or need) to model the effects of both together?

(The part is also case hardened with \~.006"" case depth, I've been using the core properties to analyze fatigue, since the case is so thin and the part is 1/4"" diameter, but I don't know if this is correct.  From my understanding these types of failures are somewhat dependent on the strain, so I'd assume at some point if the effective case depth is deep enough you would need to change your analysis.  Would the part just deform at different rates, or would the core actually just kinda give way, then making the case have to support too much of the load and then which causes it to crack?)

I am trying to build an Arduino force measurement setup using the following components:

1. [500 lbf load cell from TE Connectivity](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Measurement-Specialties/FC23-1-1-0000-0500?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvDU9HV27FC0SNYwnIdM84WCYgY1qFCwx8%3D)
2. [Sparkfun HX711 Load cell Amplifier](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879)
3. Arduino Mega

The tutorial I have been following to assemble the components is pretty straight forward and is the [official hookup guide from Sparkfun for their amplifier](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/load-cell-amplifier-hx711-breakout-hookup-guide/all). 

&amp;#x200B;

I followed the tutorial and connected by load cell and amplifier to the Arduino as mentioned in the tutorial. Then I followed the calibration procedure mentioned at the end of the tutorial and found a calibration value of -167500. I used this calibration value in the example sketch (also found at the end of the tutorial) to take measurements. 

&amp;#x200B;

The load cell was and amplifier were preforming as expected until a load of 44.5 kg. But for whatever reasons, the maximum value which can be reported by the setup is 44.5 kg. It caps off after than and a further increase in load is not registered (it still shows 44.5 kg) by the setup. I ended up ordering another load cell from the same manufacturer and the issue persisted.

&amp;#x200B;

As a sanity check, I kept the setup the same, but connected the outputs of the load cell to a very accurate multi-meter. The load cells works just great! I tried weights up to 110 kgs and the load cell gives a perfectly linear voltage response (its in the mV range) as expected. It does not cap off at 44.5 kg. This leads me to believe that I am missing something about the amplifier which is not outputting the right voltage to the Arduino.

I've been watching the Chernobyl series on HBO (if you haven't *please* check it out) and become interested in Nuclear stuff as a curiosity. What surprises me is that, from what I have heard and seen, Nuclear safety design is almost exlusively focused on *preventing* meltdown instead of planning for meltdown. In Fukushima for example, it appears that all design efforts were exhausted to ensure there were multiple backup systems for cooling to prevent meltdown. However, aside from the main concrete containment building, it appears that little consideration was given to what happens if a meltdown actually occurs.

It seems odd to me, because in my work we plan for system failures and build in multiple systems to handle a complete failure, rather than simply increasing redundancy and obsessing over failure prevention.

Is it simply impossible to contain the heat output of a reactor meltdown? Why are there not systems to chemically neutralize the buildup of hydrogen?

Background: I am my company's in-house Mechanical Engineer who designs pretty much whatever the research labs need that have to be done in SolidWorks and sent to a machine shop for manufacture or printed on our FDM 3D printer, plus some static FEA in Simulation. Mostly aluminum or plastic housings for optics and electronics. I don't have any coworkers that have a Mechanical Engineering specialty, so there aren't people here to poll for advice on anything. 

I am trying to think of how much I didn't know as a freshman in college, and it's a lot. I feel unsure of a plan of action for how to give my intern a meaningful experience that isn't also a waste of my billing hours; as much as I genuinely enjoy teaching, I don't think my supervisor means me to spend all of my time coaching and there are projects I need to keep up with. I know this student has started some SolidWorks tutorials on his own, but at this point I don't even know if he can measure and rough draft anything on paper, let alone do it in SolidWorks. For now I can only think that he could shadow me/do SolidWorks tutorials while I'm busy, do informational interviews with my coworkers in other fields (he is still deciding what major to choose), and he can learn to operate and troubleshoot the 3D printer (Ultimaker S3) while it makes parts which is usually a big time sink for me.

How dumb would it be to have, what I am tentatively naming, a ""Different Engine Ratio Process"" (DERP) where, say, the driver side engine bank has pistons that are 9.5:1 and the passenger side is 8.5:1.

The goal is not to have better turbo response at any RPM, or efficiency, or any of the regular reasons for fitting a turbo. It's just to see if it would a) work, and b) possibly sound cool.

Other thoughts: Would an ECU capable of individual bank/cylinder fueling/spark control, and for bonus points, different cam grinds *per bank*.

89,"What would cause this ""perpetual motion machine"" to come to a halt?",1559568223,"I know a perpetual motion machine is impossible, but so far failed to find / understand what would cause the following device to come to a halt.  
The setup is as follows:  
At the bottom of the device, an electrolysis cell (water + electricity --&gt; oxygen + hydrogen + heat)  
At the top, a fuel cell (oxygen + hydrogen --&gt; water + electricity + heat)  
The in/outputs are connected (with tubes).   
The water from the fuel cell goes through a turbine when moving back down into the electrolysis cell.  


I have been told that I can assume that a fuel cell will produce electricity so long as the required gases are present in sufficient concentration (and with sufficient temperature), and that the electricity gained / unit mass processed is essentially constant. I have also been told that the same applies to the electrolysis cell, where the electricity required to process a given number of water molecules is constant at constant temperature (and reduced at higher temperatures).  


Lastly, I assume that the device will run slow enough to exchange heat with the environment at such a rate that the temperature of each part is about constant.  


In the starting configuration, gas tubes are filled such that, after letting the gas distribute without further interference, the concentration at the top is sufficient for the fuel cell.   


The idea is to select a height at which the electricity produced by the turbine and fuel cell combined for cycling a given amount of water is greater than or equal to the amount of electricity required for the electrolysis cell to process the same quantity.   


The total amount of gas in the tubes at a given moment should therefore also be constant. To my knowledge that would mean that it will always end up in about the same distribution if given time, so long as the temperature is constant. Therefore if initially the concentration of gas at the top was sufficient for the fuel cell to work, it now should still be sufficient. This would suggest that it could indefinitely repeat the above cycle.  


I must have made a false / impossible assumption (or conclusion) somewhere. As this has been bugging me for some time now, I'd very much appreciate if someone could explain to me just what the contraption would go through in the process of coming to a halt.

1,Engineering career with a focus on more abstract problem-solving (rather than mathematical problem solving)?,1559534490,"Title, basically. I went into engineering because I like solving problems. This mostly revolves around optimization of processes -- any process, not just ""engineering"" ones. In fact, my roommate in college, upon seeing how I did my laundry, said, ""You're definitely in the right major."" I didn't do any calculations for that laundry optimization, but I was creative and resourceful, using things not typically used in a laundry process. (I can't think of the word, but it's when you use things in ways they weren't originally designed to be used in order to benefit something.)

So, essentially, I don't really care about the topics of engineering, especially as a mechanical engineer. I just want to solve problems that aren't FEA analyses or designing a product by following the company's technical documents and doing what everyone has done before. I like innovating and it really doesn't even have to be an engineering job. But, I would rather start within engineering.

7,Am I changing jobs too much?,1559527019,"I saw a similar post and decided to post my own story. Seeking advice from fellow engineers. Apologize for wordiness 

I graduated 6 years ago with a BSME and have been changing jobs every year or so.  And I am wondering if I am making the correct career move.

 My first job out of college was working at  an aerospace company thousands of miles away from home as a quality engineer , after a year and half later I internally transferred to a manufacturing project engineer with a promotion. I thoroughly enjoyed that role for a year and some  but i always wanted to do mechanical design and wanted to go back home. so I did a lateral transfer back home. But the work pace, the program organizational culture and lack of recognition made me wanted to leave the company. 
   After a year and so, I left the mech designer role and the aerospace company(Aero1) and went to an electronic manufacturing company, I enjoyed my work but my direct manager was a micromanager and a creep( he touched me inappropriately) so I quit after 3 months and went to another aerospace firm(aero2).
 I was test equipment designer for a mature program where most design work was completed and I was left twiddling my thumb. Or I beg my manager for small jobs. Since I didn’t want to move to LA after the main program was over and I felt I wasn’t growing for that role. I started looking for new jobs but I couldn’t get anything in three months(83 applications) besides an internal opportunity. So I decided to take the internal offer. After three months of working at the new office, I realized it was very ancient(infrastructure) with older coworkers that didn’t wanted to put in the time and clearly lack of a culture.  Luckily one of my precious application to an aerospace startup(aerospace3)  decided to hire me on as a contractor for at least 6months. 

  I guess what I am worry about is that if the startup contractor job doesn’t last a year or more. Would I have a lot of flags on my resume? I already left my electronic manufacturing job out of resume because I assumed sexual harassment is a taboo for recruiters. Do y’all think i hop too much?

While there wasn't anything that I was asked to do (or anything that I could take initiative and do), there were times when my superiors would walk in and see me essentially doing nothing- which I'm trying to avoid this summer.

This year I have an internship at a different company, and they have a specific project that they gave me. I have a good idea of what the end-of-term deliverable will be, but I haven't received much instruction on it. I believe they're still putting everything together before they hand it over to me.

Until it's full speed ahead with this project that they've laid out for me, how do I convince them that I'm not a waste of resources?

The pack of 5 replacements I got from Amazon are marked with the appropriate rating (F0.315AL250V), but I decided to test them just to make sure. Using my small bench power supply and collection of resistors, I got the following results.

Using a 1Ohm 3W resistor:

* At ~2.5V and ~700mA, the fuse glows but doesn't pop. No observable changes below this threshold.
* At ~800mA (don't remember the voltage), the fuse finally blows.

Using a 22Ohm 2W resistor and a new fuse:

* ~8V, ~350mA - fuse not blown.
* ~10V, ~450mA - fuse not blown.
* ~12V, ~550mA - fuse not blown.

At this point, I was reaching the voltage limits of my little power supply, and putting 6W of power through a 2W resistor, which was getting quite warm even with short bursts, so I stopped.

My question is, are these results within spec for a 315mA 250V glass/filament fuse? Are they even reasonable?

37,Deciding between two job offers as a recent college graduate,1559477680,"Hello all,  


I recently graduated with my bachelor's in Materials Engineering . I will keep most of this information anonymous because I would rather not divulge too much information.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking for a full-time job in the aerospace industry and have received two job offers.

  
Job Offer 1:  
Defense Contractor in Huntsville, AL

75k a year 

Good 401k and health benefits

Relocation assistance offered

9/80 work schedule

&amp;#x200B;

Job Offer 2:

Contractor working with NASA at KSC in FL

63k a year

Average 401k and health benefits

No relocation assistance

Monday-Friday schedule with occasional Saturday work; paid overtime available

&amp;#x200B;

My issues in deciding between the two offers is that I think I would prefer the work at NASA more because it is more in line with what I studied in school and I would be working on the Orion program which I am more interested in compared to the defense work I would be doing in Alabama. Also I would be in FL for job offer 2, which is my home state. I would only be an hour away from my parents and about 2 hours from my university which would be easier to visit as an alum.  


However, everything else seems better with offer 1 since I would be getting paid more, would be able to live much closer to my job, have cheaper and higher quality housing options, and a more desirable work schedule. I don't know too much about Huntsville, but I've heard that it is actually not too bad of a place to work as a young professional and I could always move to a new job in a location that suits me better in the future. I also would be able to start negotiating for a much higher salary at a new company if I decided to move.

&amp;#x200B;

Do any of you have some advice for me in making this decision? I am quite conflicted as I originally thought job 2 would be better, but now I am leaning towards job 1. I have to make this decision by tomorrow so I would appreciate any advice!

40,Will we see an Atkinson like turbo-compound engine before electric energy takes over completely?,1559467455,"Adding some details to the Otto cycle or looking from a more chemical and not so mechanical side I would say it goes like this: The piston starts at the top and goes down. Air is injected. Half way down the air inject valves close and the fuel inject valves open. At the bottom the fuel valves close. Fuel and air mixes. The piston moves up and the adiabatic compression delivers the energy needed to evaporate the fuel droplets. Just before the top, the spark plug in the center of the gas volume ignites the gas mixture. A more or less spherical flame front diffuses to the walls. To keep the pressure constant while the gas gets hotter, the piston moves down to increase the volume. After the flame reaches the walls of the cylinder, the piston needs to move down a step to reduce the temperature by adiabatic de-compression below a point where NOx is created, but above a point where soot still burns. So like 800 °C, red glowing. After soot is burned, the piston moves down to the bottom to reduce the pressure slightly above the level in the exhaust manifold. Just before the bottom the exhaust valves start to opens and the exhaust leaves the cylinder. The piston moves up and pushes out the gases. Ideally at the top there is valve overlap and in a turbo engine / or with a tuned exhaust the injected air blows out the residual exhaust.

Since we cannot make the piston stop in the middle of the power-stroke (maybe big 2-stroke Diesels can do this), wouldn’t it make sense to invest in a turbo-compound engine where soot is still burning in the exhaust stroke? A turbo-compound engine needs the turbo right from idle. So even more complicated that an original Supra one may need like three turbos of different size all connected by gears to the engine and connected by water cooled waste-gates and blow-off gates with each other. At idle they run in series. When the small turbo gets to fast, it large gates open and the gears to the small turbo are disengaged. The bigger turbos continue to spool up. Hello turbo-lag. Fast response must come in an electric form, so this ICE would be for a large luxury hybrid car or truck or stationary. In a turbo compound we can use the whole intake stroke to inject air, but cannot blow out the residual exhaust. Also the engine gets hotter, which may only qualify it for use with low energy fuel like Ethanol (no nitro).",AskEngineers,False,IQueryVisiC,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bvvna9/will_we_see_an_atkinson_like_turbocompound_engine/
41,Choosing a ruler for technical drawings,1559466203,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a more suitable ruler for technical drawing. Currently I use a stainless steel, very flexible ruler, which is very thin. Being so thin and flexible is for me unsuitable. But is stainless steel the absolute way to go? I've seen many plastic rulers on offer and own a few myself. The problem I've encountered with the plastic rulers (one made from acrylic, the other I'm not sure, but it's white opaque) is that the edges chip, leading to scraggly lines, instead of crisp clean ones on the page. If I were to go the plastic route, which material should the ruler be made of, in order to last a long time? As a side, aluminium is also an option. 

What are your thoughts? Steel, plastic, or aluminium. I'd like the ruler to be at least 1 mm thick and preferably not bendy.

42,"Block Wall Foundation, Sill Plate, Rim Joist",1559458443,"'1. Why do some block wall foundations start out wide and then become narrow a few feet off the ground? 

Example: https://www.oneprojectcloser.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0137.jpg 

Is this due to cost? Is there anything wrong with making the entire wall wide, just like the bottom portion? 

Also, is there anything wrong with arranging the blocks so the longer side extends inside? This would mean more materials but, I mean structurally, is there anything wrong with it? 

'2. The reason why I asked Question 1 is because I was surprised to learn that sill plates and rim joists are quite narrow. 

Example: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/23/61/29/2361294fd292d9982f3f6f4a88c7596d.jpg 

I find it amazing that the weight of the house is resting on a rim joist that is so narrow. I can see that the weight of the walls gets distributed over joists via the subfloor, but still. Why aren't they wider? Any downside besides cost? 

I googled double rim joist and I see a lot of pictures of people building decks with exactly that - double rim joists. 

I'm asking these questions because a part of my house had termite damage from the previous owner and I wonder how that portion of the house is being supported.

49,Way to detect an arrow shaft in a square frame,1559433842,"I'm looking to make an arcade game for a local archery range. The idea is to have a wooden square (maybe 12x12"") with some concealed RGB light strips and a small arduino controller.

The square would go directly on to the backboard that captures the arrows so the LEDs would shine on to that.

When an arrow hits the backboard, inside the square, the color changes.

It's a giant game of othello sort of. One player is red, the other is blue. You are trying to change as many squares to your color as possible.

Hope that all makes sense so far.

My hang up is on how to detect that an arrow hit within the square in the easiest and most confident way. Motion would cause false positives and the arrow shaft is probably too thin for that anyway. Light break sensors also wouldn't work for such a huge space/array.

I've considered some short-range ultrasonic detectors but I think again the shaft is too thin for that to register. Plus I need to detect multiple arrows hitting in the zone each time.

My best guess right now is to shine two ultrabright IR Leds from two corners and use a tight arrow of sensors to pick up the shadows and do some math in the Arduino.

Or, and I have no idea if this would work, to create a thin mesh of conductive wire, slightly smaller than the diameter of the arrow. When an arrow passes through it would stretch it and change the resistance... or if I can ask them about metal shafts then it could change the conductivity.

Lately I've been thinking a lot about what else I could be doing to help my career in the future. Wondering if anyone here might have any ideas. I live in the UK, so all qualifications will be from the UK, not certain what the international equivalents would be.

My current position is as an apprentice. I'm not sure exactly what my job ""title"" should be, but I work in mechanical maintenance; cranes, conveyors, forklifts... that sort of stuff. I'm currently 2 years into a 4 year apprenticeship.

At the end of the apprenticeship, I will have completed a level 2 BTEC, a level 3 BTEC, an HNC in mechanical engineering, and a level 3 NVQ. I'll also have a good amount of operator training for the equipment I work with.

Along with starting my HNC in september, I will also be starting my degree (Mech BEng) on a part time basis, which should take around 6 years to complete, so ending 4 years after the apprenticeship does. From what I've been told about HNC it doesn't sound like a lot of extra work compared to what I've already done, and I have a lot of time on my hands so I figured I might as well get started with the degree at the same time.

It has gone extremely well and we get along great, really could not have asked for more. I have many years management experience (I am 31, so not your typical college student) from a job i worked at for 9 years before this. I will ultimately be in charge of a lot of the operation of the plant (including the people), maintenance of machines/plant and continued development of new machines. The owners of the offered me a job prior to this summer and told me if anyone else offers something, they will match or exceed the offer.

 It is a unique job in the sense that there will be one engineer (me) once their current engineer retires in the next couple years. They are in the farming industry and build and design nearly everything from scratch, from forklifts to spray rigs to hoists for shop etc. I am a certified welder, very proficient on machines (lathe, mill, etc) and can fabricate well enough where they just hand me plans from current engineer and I will get it done. All of the background, now to my question.

We are going to finalize the deal next week concerning pay and those details. They told me to tell them how much i wanted per hour (we agreed hourly was the best way at this point) and it would probably be fine. Being they/we are Ag, you do not get OT until after 50 or 60 hours.

The paper can't just come spooling out, but it also shouldn't be on a spring loading to rewind itself in the roll; when it's pulled out, I imagine a small amount of resistance, but then when the user stops pulling it, the roll just stops rotating.

71,Modeling Boiling with mixed Gases,1559396757,"I'm racking my brain for the correction equations to do improve a model i have built. The part is a vessel that is filled with a mixture of water and air below the boiling point of the water. The vessel has an exit that is a check valve at the top and a way to add water with a check valve at the bottom. It is assumed the water has a perfect boundry for water and steam. The vessel can also have no air at the start. Heat is applied and the water is allowed to boil. This is an explicitly integrated model. State Variables are Mass and Enthalpy.

So far i have an equation for 100% liquid based on compressibility of water. that way as more mass is added or density drops the pressure rises. When there is a mixture of liquid and gas my math starts falling apart. My current method is a very rough formulation of how much volume the gases take up, and then using that with the liquid equation to get the pressure. However the transition from 0% gas to any gas is very rough. The transition to 100% gas is also a huge jump. For 100% gas i use the specific volume of the water gas to determine the pressure (i have curves i built from steam tables) along with the pressure created by any air in the mix with the ideal gas law (realzing the law falls apart at high pressure).

73,How can radar continuously track a single target?,1559394874,"As a major simplification, assume a (primary) ground radar is trying to track a target -  the only plane in the sky. Once it has the first return signal, how does it then rotate to make sure it continues tracking the target? My thought was that it could measure the change in angle over time and work out the velocity, therefore giving it a way to predict the flight path, and follow this prediction. But after the first measurement, how does it know the velocity of the aircraft so it can follow it rather than move in the opposite direction? Can all radars use doppler shift? What if the aircraft is travelling with no component of velocity radially toward the antenna? 
If the antenna remained fixed and the aircraft travelled through a few degrees, would the radar be able to determine the heading even though the pulses would not be reflected directly back to the direction the antenna is pointed? Are the pulses sent out within such a short time that the aircraft will only have moved a tiny (but measurable) amount between pulses?

I know C (quite good at it), a couple of OOP Languages (quite good at Java), basic SQL and I am currently learning Assembly (x86). About six months ago, I stumbled upon ML.

Sometimes I got involved so much in it that I even coded in my dreams, lol. This is one side of me. 

(B) I always loved taking things (not computers) apart and finding how things work (and of course, put it back together when I am done). And also, the entire hacking scene around the PS3, fascinated me. I feel like I should learn Reverse Engineering. I really love hardware!

Now, I am clear about what my career should be - Robotics, Computer Vision. The thing is, should I take Computer Science and Engineering (or) Electronics and Communication Engineering? 

I want to know how everything works, right from the basics; so I can manipulate them in my way. Let us not talk about jobs for now. I want to do a lot of research, hopefully give something useful to the society.

So, would I be better off (1) doing CSE,  'mastering' the skills which tech giants  want, learn something about hardware and then try my hand at Robotics (2) doing ECE, learning a lot during the way, become 'great' at the skills which the tech giants want and try my hand at Robotics?

95,How will my one time THC use effect my Secret Clearance Investigation?,1559341219,"I just graduated from college this past month (woohoo!) and decided to take a job with a large defense contractor.

My offer letter says I require secret clearance or I will likely be terminated, which makes sense for the position. They do have me starting in few weeks, which means (I assume) that they have unclassified work for me to do before I get cleared, since clearances can take a few months to over a year to get.

While I was in school I filed an SF85 for a job I was working (they also gave me an offer but I took the defense contractor gig). That SF85 investigation never finished, but I was interim cleared for a few months from it.

Here is my predicament. Around the time that I filled out the SF85 but before I was approved for interim clearance, I took two or three puffs of a THC vape, which was legal in my state but not federally. I've really never had an interest in smoking, it was at a party and a few friends were passing it around so I hit it, didn't get high or anything though I guess that doesn't matter. It was less than a year ago, but in a few months it will be a year. I haven't done anything since.

I realize that I should still come clean on my new SF86, but will this destroy my chances at secret clearance since I smoked in such proximity to the interim sf85 clearance? Since it was a one off thing in a social situation and I don't want to do it again, I think my risks are mitigated, otherwise.

Is this something I should talk to the securities team about? Would they actually just terminate my employment if I asked for their advice? I think they are supposed to be on my side and I've heard of clearances getting delayed to hit that one year mark for marijuana (although I feel like a thc vape is a little different than normal pot.)

12,Tape measure as linear actuator - Mechanism name? off the shelf designs?,1559316983,"I've got a situation where I think the functionality of a spooled flexible metal tape that is curved and becomes fairly rigid when extended (IE - a standard metal tape measure) might make the perfect linear actuator to replace/supplement the chains on this X/Y 'plotter': [MaslowCnC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow_CNC#/media/File:Maslow_CNC.jpg)

The issue is that when the 'sled' gets close to the vertical under either one of the motors, the weight of the sled is not enough to overcome the friction of the sled against the surface so you end up with poor horizontal accuracy. 

I'm thinking if the chain can be either replaced or at least supplemented with a rigid 'pusher', that would help overcome the lack of horizontal force. The rigid element wouldn't need to be particularly powerful, just enough to overcome the friction of the sled against the surface.

Surely someone has thought of this kind of actuator before, is there some prior art or even existing mechanisms?

I have recently graduated with an undergrad degree in mechanical engineering. I will be going for my master's in mechanical engineering (largely focus in artificial intelligence, robotics and computational engineering) so I suspect much of my coursework will be related to computer science-y subjects. 

While I am very excited about working in this new field, I am unsure as to how to pitch my undergraduate research experience to professors and potential advisors (since I am coming from another field). I was hoping I could get some inputs help from here. 


I have published 4 papers during my undergraduate studies, all in highly reputed journals but much of it is related to core mechanical engineering topics like structures and materials. The only thing that is going for me here is that  all of my work has been related to FEA which is built on mathematical principles like linear algebra and multivariable calculus, much of which also forms the basis for fields of study like Machine Learning. So one option that I have is to pitch myself as someone who is well versed with computational engineering and has picked up transferable skills. Through my research I have been regularly in touch with python and MATLAB so  programming is not an issue.   


I did an internship during my undergraduate studies which was loosely based around basic concepts of machine learning, but applied to structural health monitoring - so that is  another thing.

26,Analyst at Big4 or Traineeship/Graduate Program after graduation?,1559300733,"Hey engineers,  


Throw away becuase im paranoid.  
I get my degree in a couple of weeks in ME (BSc + MSc) and im starting to get into the last phase of recruitment for a couple of companies. I have narrowed it down to two positions i really want, but i see benefits and drawbacks in both.  


First is an analyst position within data analytics at a Big4 firm. The boss and the culture at this office seems good. It's in a new town but i have no trouble relocating. I would be working \~50 hours a week and have a salary of \~3000 Euros. Mostly the job entails (after first 6 months of training) implementing data analytics platforms at companies and consulting them in gaining usage of their data. The typical data management consulting things I assume. Not so much hands-on, but more about adapting already existing solutions into organizations and making sure the clients get use of their data. The drawback here is I would be losing a lot of my engineering knowledge since there won't be a lot of programming/maths in this sort of role, but more business and soft skills. Yet working for a big4 is good on your resumé for future employment. Im just worried i won't be able to transition into an engineering role after 2 years in consulting because i will by then have forgotten a lot of the techniques and methods i learned during school.  


The second is a quality engineer graduate program at a global manufacturing firm of mechanical components towards automotive and aerospace. It's a 1.5-2 years program where you get to be part of 2-3 different parts of the organization and partake in real-life projects to optimize production and/or the supply chain. The program includes 6-12 months of working abroad at one of the companies other locations (could be the US, China or India) which i think would be very rewarding. The company is very respected in the industry and has a lot of innovative ideas for the future of its products. I would be using a lot of my engineering knowledge in this sort of role and really develop into a great engineer i believe. I dont know what the pay is but im guessing it would be similar to what the Big4 is offering. I am 100% sure it is a paid program. The drawback here is i am afraid i would be pigeonholed to only work within manufacturing/ quality/ process engineering in the future. While i believe i want to transition into IT/ data management (with a niche towards manufacturing and Industry 4.0) in the future. Also, the program doesn't guarantee an open position will be available once the program is over.   


So im struggling between which one i should choose. I can't really ask any family or friends for advice since none have been in a similar situation or have industry knowledge. So im very thankful for all your responses, sharing of own experiences and recommendations.  


Sorry for my bad English, its my third language.

Job 1:

\- HVAC company

\- About 5-6 engineers total (some Civil, some Mechanical)

\- I would start as a CAD modeler (Revit), but with the opportunity to be mentored by the PEs

\- I enjoyed thermodynamics and heat transfer in classes so this job appeals to me, but does it actually utilize these skills?

\- I've been told that the industry can be boring after you figure it out in a couple years, any thoughts?

Job 2:

\- Consumer product company

\- Job would be a project engineer

\- Smaller office branch of a huge company

\- 50 people total in the office, about 20 engineers

\- Office has a prototyping lab (3D printers, drill press, saws, etc.)

\- Manufacturing of the products is overseas.

\- Products are interesting to me.

\- Opportunity to advance to a design engineer role which I like.

Questions:

\- I've always enjoyed building things and using my hands, but I also like thermodynamics and heat transfer, so I'm not sure which direction would be better.

\- Is it easy to switch between industries after a few years? Maybe I try one and don't like it.

\- Starting as strictly a CAD modeler isn't what I'm looking for exactly, but would it be a good place to start to get into the HVAC industry?

2. Place the concrete blocks as rail ties (not wood since wood is weaker) with the help of surveyors

3. Nail the metal nails in once the rails are well placed.

4. Use a really, really good welder to weld the track continuously.

Is there other options? Like apprenticeships or anything else I can do so I can get a career in engineering (ideally want to be a project manager eventually). The way my course works I will have an Advanced HNC after this year if that makes any difference.

&amp;#x200B;

If I sit in October, I understand I wont have the experience required to get the license. I do know some states allow you to sit for the exam without having your experience assessed and accepted. In that case, lets say state X allows this. Do I just book my exam through NCEES for that state and go sit for the exam or do I need to reach out to the state?

I will most probably sit in New jersey, if I have all my educational documents verified on NCEES will I still need to contract the NJ board and have my universities send them my transcripts etc similar to what I did for NCEES? Perhaps there is a option that I can let NCEES forward them or something? I would really like avoiding contacting my university oversees again and get them to send the documents to the board etc.

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize, we concluded that if it is absolutely necessary to have an inexpensive BLDC motor and a constant precise RPM rather than controlling the rate of the synced LED modulation based on the measured slightly-off RPM instead, we need a velocity-based PID control loop, possibly with a Hall sensor.

&amp;#x200B;

I have three questions now:

1)  The PID should supplement the motor's ESC, not to replace it, right?

2) If the answer to above is yes, will the PID be fixing the RPM by modifying the PWM signal, or just Voltage or Current? If the former (PWM signal), how would one do that the right way?

3) Will a single magnet be sufficient for Hall sensor? It is enough to determine the zero (home) position/angle of the spinning system but I am not sure at 2400 RPM providing a single reading from the Hall sensor to the PID per revolution is sufficient to maintain a constant RPM for each 1 degree separated positions at 360 positions on the rotating disc.",AskEngineers,False,jadomud,/r/AskEngineers/comments/buquls/can_you_use_pid_to_improve_accuracy_of_esc_for/

I wanted to become and engineer to design and build planes and/or trains. At the time I was not aware just how broad of a discipline engineering actually is. I started out in college majoring in aerospace engineering, but due to some unfortunate events I dropped out after the second year to work full time. Now I am going back to school and researching careers that suit me because my interests have changed. My first option was mechanical engineering because I still love the thought of working on and designing moving machines. But after doing a lot of research, I'm starting to feel really discouraged. It seems that most, if not all, engineers have very little creative freedom. From what I've seen engineers are stuck in offices and designs small parts of the whole project using very strict guidelines. The other thing that discourages me is that it seems like engineering is not a hands on job. I dreamed of designing something and then being able to at least help build it.

So is this true? Currently I'm deciding between electrical and mechanical engineering for my major. My main fear is that I spend 4+ years dedicated to learning it and end up dreading my career choice.

92,Which engineering major would be best for me mechanical or chemical?,1559163445,"So here's the story. I already have a bachelors of science degree in biology. I originally had intended to go to med school but after a lot of thinking decided that it wasn't for me. So after graduating in 2015 I decided to see what other opportunities were out there for someone with a biology degree. As it turns out there aren't many good opportunities at all unless you plan on completing a PHD. Even after graduating from a reputable school in my area with a 3.5 gpa I found myself working at entry level positions as a basic lab tech along side people who don't even have a college education.

So now at the age of 26 I'm planning on going back to school to pursue a bachelors degree in engineering. Im attracted to engineering because I enjoy science, there are excellent job prospects and a great starting salary. Also I will have already completed many of the prerequisites like general chemistry, organic chemistry, calc 1, and calc based physics. I was originally attracted to bioengineering due to my interest in medicine and biology. However after a lot of research I hear that it is not the most valuable degree as the curriculum is too broad and the companies in this industry would rather hire mechanical or electrical engineers who have more specialized training than bioengineers. I do not want to make the same mistake twice. So I am thinking maybe since I already have a biology degree, I would be competitive for these jobs if I went for mechanical engineering. This would also give me many other options if I could not find a job in that field or decided that it wasn't for me. However chemical engineering also interests me due to my interest in chemistry. I am wondering if I could work in this industry as a chemE. I also hear chemical engineers generally start with a better salary. Ive also heard that there is not much chemistry involved in chemical engineering and that it is mostly about designing chemical plants and looking for ways to improve the manufacturing of chemicals rather than actually creating new products.

I am not solely committed to the biomedical field and am open to other fields. I have many interests including biotechnology, nanotechnology, automobiles, 3d printing, robotics, computer aided design, and more.

Changes or additions have to be handled as individual items across several sheets and databases, and I feel like there has to be a better, more automated, way to handle this. 

We mostly handle small-scale R&amp;D projects, so tools for production and and assembly aren't as important as just keeping the various design documents for each discipline (EE, ME, Software, etc.) coordinated.

6,Anxious on what to do.,1559148889,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a math major at a well-respected university (UT Austin) and I'm currently under a huge dilemma. Before I chose math I was an engineering major at a community college, and after going through the course work, I realized engineering was too tough for me after a slew of bad grades. But after spending a year at my current university, I realized that I feel more interested in engineering and that I am more passionate and curious about it. Back at CC I feel that I just didn't know which discipline to study later on at a university, and I am now finding most of the concepts in the math major as trivial and useless unless you want to pursue research or work in academia. 

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest concern is about whether I should continue with the math major and go to graduate school for engineering, or transfer to a different university in Texas for engineering. I have already applied for an internal transfer (change of major) at UT Austin for engineering, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get in. However, after doing research on reddit and many other forums it seems that a math bachelor's --&gt; engineering graduate school is starting to seem like a path that is not viable these days. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really anxious because I'm going into my 4th year of college (did 2 at a CC, just finished 1 year at UT Austin) and if I choose to attend another university for engineering I would spend at least 2.5 years catching up on course work and potentially lose some credit hours + money is tight. I also don't have any research experience or internships (but I'm hoping to get some next summer) so graduate school might seem a little reach for me since I would not be a very competitive applicant.

22,Low Voltage Insulation Question,1559115933,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

First off background: I'm a mechatronics student towards the end of my bachelor studies. I'm currently working on a small personal project where I would like to use two vertically mounted lead-screws (probably stainless steel), each driven by their own stepper motor to vertically move a few dozen lightweight metal slats (window blinds). The horizontal distance between the lead-screws would be about 1 to 1.5 meters. Mounted to each metal slat would be small latching (bistable) solenoids that must only turn on for brief periods. I would like to avoid cabling running in between the slats if possible, mainly to avoid fatigue/wear. The system would be exposed to the elements, ie rain, winter cold, summer heat. 

&amp;#x200B;

So follows the question: If I use a low voltage, say 5-6 volts, could I safely use the lead-screws as the conductive elements to carry power to the slats/solenoids? Would this present any risks to the user? I know solenoids draw a fair amount of current, so I think I'd activate them sequentially or in small groups, rather than all at once, in order to avoid drawing 20+ amps all at once.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an air conditioner that works well, but I want it to remove more moisture from the air. after it ran for a bit, I opened the cover to see how much water was condensing. it looks like it was condensing a fair amount, but also seemed like a lot of droplets of water were suspended between the fins of the heat exchanger, surface tension preventing them from falling into the condensate drain. this AC unit is thermostatically controlled, so it turns off the compressor but keeps blowing air across the damp fins, extracting moisture from the fins and returning it to the room.

&amp;#x200B;

any ideas for how I can get better humidification out of it?

At the moment, we are covering Arithmetic Logic Units. Mostly I understand all of the functions we expect them to do except for the Set Less Than function.   We have a bunch of logic gates that together can take two inputs (A and B) and either add, subtract, do an AND, do an OR, or do an SLT. The function is selected using a multiplexer.

I’ve looked it up (and tried to go through my teacher’s notes) but all the SLT seems to be is a funny way of subtracting. Based on the description, it tells me if A is smaller (as in closer to negative infinity) than B. If that’s the case, it gives me a true output. Otherwise, it gives me a false. But it does so using the last addition output from our chain of ALUs.

This makes no sense to me, because in 2s complement subtraction is just a disguised addition. Whether we are adding A = 80 to B = -5000 or A = -5000 to B = 80, the output seen is -4920. The observed output won’t care if A is smaller than B, it just gives the addition.

Also, based on this diagram that the teacher gave us. [https://i.imgur.com/iPgA26O.png](https://i.imgur.com/iPgA26O.png)

It looks like the output used by the SLT only ever becomes activated if the last inputs of A and B are at true. This means that they are both negative numbers, doesn’t it? Based on this (which I’m sure is a misunderstanding of how it works) the SLT would go to true only when A and B are both negatives. Nothing to do with A being smaller.

74,QTY Breakpoint of PLC vs. Custom PCBs,1559055718,"Hey gang - I'm an automation guy with a mechanical background, but have been getting more and more involved on the Controls and Electrical side the past couple of years. I'm working on a machine design, and found myself wondering: at what quantity does it make sense to use a custom PCB for logic, rather than a PLC?

Everything I've ever worked on, sometimes quantities as high as 50, used a PLC and all off-the-shelf components for everything in the control cabinet. But I was recently working on a winder that had stacks of PCBs, and other (I'm assuming) custom boards in the panel.

Why choose one over the other? Or how many of these identical machines would they need to make for this to make sense? Even on ""repeat jobs"" in custom machines/automation, nothing is ever actually the same twice. No matter how many times the customer says it will be. (We started calling jobs our salespeople brought in as ""build-only"", ""build-mostly"". And lost money on the engineering required on most of them.)

76,Using split washers inside critical part on motorcycle,1559054760,"I hope this is the right place to ask. I am rebuilding a carburetor off a Suzuki motorcycle and it has two screws (M4) inside the carburetor barrel that originally were secured with a Loctite-type compound to the aluminum body. The reason they were thus secured was because if vibration loosened them, they would drop straight down into the intake manifold, potentially wrecking the valves, or worse yet dropping into the cylinder. When dissembling the carburetor, I broke screws and they had to be drilled out and replaced with a 6-32 helicoil inserts.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am figuring out how to secure the new screws in a similar fashion, but to still allow for disassembly of the carburetor without breaking them in the future.  The simplest solution is to add a washer and a spring washer. This is what I immediately have on hand. However, as the carb sits right above the engine and is attached to it rigidly, there is going to be quite a bit of vibration on it, and it seems spring washers don't do much, based on my Google research.

&amp;#x200B;

Second option is to use some other type of compression washer, such as this: [https://www.mcmaster.com/91241a539](https://www.mcmaster.com/91241a539). Would this be an improvement over a split spring washer?

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is the nylon patch style [https://www.mcmaster.com/96562a148](https://www.mcmaster.com/96562a148). It says it will resist loosening from vibration, but will that be enough, and will I have trouble undoing it later?

&amp;#x200B;

Top of the line in terms of security seems to be [https://www.mcmaster.com/95894a115](https://www.mcmaster.com/95894a115), which seems like basically epoxy pre-applied to a screw. Would this be too difficult to undo later the way I had trouble with the OEM screws?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I could just use blue Loctite, and use less of it. The original screws I believe had never been removed since they were installed in 2002, so perhaps that was the source of the trouble.",AskEngineers,False,craftyrafter,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bu0vq4/using_split_washers_inside_critical_part_on/

82,How to work less hours?,1559045580,"I feel like I'm losing my mind

I was poor growing up and my father worked 60+ hour weeks cleaning shit out of portable toilets for us to get by. (Mother disabled).

He always told me to work smart not hard. Get an education so you don't have to work long shitty (pun?) hours like I do to survive.

So I did, and I now have an extremely well paid engineering job (computer engineering in finance). In my five years since graduating I've managed to pay off all my debts and save up $100k in savings+401K.

I am finally at the place where I am not working to pay off someone else - I am not working because I _need_ my next paycheck. I am only working to provide for monthly expenses which I have covered with plenty to spare.

My father has since been promoted in his company and now has a cozy office position working 40 hours a week making enough money for him and my mom. Once he could make more money he decided to work less hours.

My current company requires me to work 45 hours a week. After five years of working for them and making more money than I need I decided I wanted to cash in on my 'smart work' and work less hours each week - just 40 hours.

I offered to them that I would take the pay cut of ~11% to go down from 45 to 40 hours. I would continue to complete the same work in the same amount of time. Win-win right? They save money and I save time?

My company said no way.

I then offered to go hourly. Lose benefits + 401k and take a pay cut down to 40 hours per week.

My company still said no way.

This is where I am losing my mind. So every year you are going to give me a raise+bonus and pay me more and more money to do the same work for you. But you won't let me do the same work for less money?

I know what they want me to do - I see it all over the company. They want me to buy a luxury car, have some kids, all while taking on more responsibility at work. Five years from now they want me to be a manager making even more money than I do now working 50+ hours a week.

THAT IS INSANE. I have the money I need. If you give more money I'm not going to buy more stuff. More money doesn't shorten my commute. More money doesn't give me time with my family and friends. No one wishes they spent more time at work on their deathbed.

I make enough money where I could work half the hours I do now and still get by. And I would LOVE to work ~20 hours a week.

My whole life I've been told the more money you make the less time you _have_ to work.

Was this a lie? I'm losing my mind. Working 45 hours a week for the rest of my life is fine if that's what I need to pay my bills. But I'm not going to work 45 hours each week just to build up a bank account.

I wondered if it would be possible (and practical) to build a partial or complete exoskeleton that matches the range of healthy movement of the wearer. The exoskeleton would have to strongly resist any movement outside of the acceptable range.

For example, an exoskeleton for the legs would allow the knee joint to move backwards, but not too far forwards. It would also allow only limited sideways flex. If a person wearing the exoskeleton was to jump and land with their leg at an awkward angle they would avoid injury as the exoskeleton would stop the leg from moving beyond the point of its natural movement.
