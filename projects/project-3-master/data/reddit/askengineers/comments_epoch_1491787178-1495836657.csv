Specifically I have having some issues finding information regarding the conversion of PFHd to MTTFd or vice-versa.  Any documentation I can find on the matter merely states that MTTFd can be converted to hours (from years) and is then equivalent to 1/PFHd.

However, completing a sample calculation against known values does not yield the expected result.

1,Why isn't Ammonia used for cooling equipment?,1495831216,"Isn't it more effective then using glycol to which is transported to a  heat exchanger which uses water to then carry that heat else where like  radiator or a cooling tower?

At high pressure (High enough to keep it in liquid form) you could take that ammonia in liquid form through the machine, then let it flash evaporate in a tank that is lower pressure, then condense in a radiator and feed back into the system.

Wouldn't this remove the need for two different liquids? And a whole redundant heat exchanger?

Edit - I would like to note I am talking industrial here.

Edit - **What flair should I use?** It's sorta a mix....

Edit - Probably would require a smallish pre-cooler",AskEngineers,CyanConatus,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6djje0/why_isnt_ammonia_used_for_cooling_equipment/
2,Soft touch *without* overmolding,1495824802,"I have a surface on a polycarbonate medical device housing that is to be soft touch. For various design reasons, I cannot readily overmold onto this surface.

To me, medical grade soft touch means appropriate grades of TPE or silicone rubber. What are the non-overmold means of assembling such a material to polycarbonate?

All I've come up with are adhesives. Are other assembly processes available to me?

If adhesives are the answer, can someone specifically recommend (a) an elastomer, (b) an adhesive, and (c) a process for achieving this? The elastomer must be medical grade and there is a very strong preference that the adhesive is as well. The polycarbonate already is a medical grade.

I've found elastomeric sheet goods that could be die cut, but what I'd really like is something injection molded where a converter could apply the adhesive to supply us with an adhesive-backed piece that we just peel and stick to the housing.

5,"Bored at Civil Engineering job of 2 years, need career advice.",1495817702,"Hi! I'm new to reddit, but thought this would be a good way to get some opinions for other engineers.
I work at a large civil engineering consulting company but in a small office (6 employees in our office). This is my first job post grad and I have been here about 2 years. 
In the beginning I felt like I was learning loads, but as time goes on I feel like I have become totally stagnant at what I am learning and doing. The only projects I work on are government roadway design projects, and being the least experienced person in the office, I feel like I have basically become a drafter/office assistant. I work on the same thing most days and spend about all my time drafting in front of the computer. It's extremely boring and I have limited interaction with my coworkers.

So this is where I would like advice! Is this all that civil engineering is? I'm starting to think that even though I excelled in math and in school that civil engineering isn't exactly a rewarding a career. I make good money with relatively low stress, but I don't feel as challenged as I did in school. Should I switch companies or is this pretty normal work culture? I've considered going back to school, but I'm not sure what I could get to further my career.

Currently I'm testing the adhesives by applying a thin layer to a 2"" square piece of steel, and then applying a 2"" square piece of conductive plastic on top with light pressure while it cures. I measure the bulk resistivity by placing the glued sandwich between two large pieces of copper, pressing everything into contact with some bolts and nuts tightened to a set torque, and using a milliohm meter to measure resistance.

The results from the small tests will be used to extrapolate to a larger area of 6-10 ft^2. I'm a chemist, not an electrical engineer, so I'm not sure if I am using sufficient area to be able to extrapolate to larger areas, or if there's some standard method for conductive adhesives that I should be using. 

I'm also measuring the sheet resistance of the adhesive, but my understanding is that sheet resistance doesn't really translate into bulk resistance.

49,"Where to learn about dimensions, threads, etc esp. in regards to SolidWorks?",1495647802,"Hey, I am a first year mech e student in need of a little help.

So this past semester, I took a engr design course and it was really just to teach us solidworks. Our instructor did delve a bit into proper dimensioning, taught us some about threads (I remember the format was like fraction-#UNC-2A or something like that) but we never really went in depth because it wasn't absolutely relevant to what we were doing right at that time.

However, I'm beginning to feel that this is even more important, so where is a good place to learn what all this stuff means?

For example, right now I am doing a instructional solidworks module that is showing me the Hole Wizard.

Essentially, I'm able to follow these directions easily and get familiar with the software but if you didn't tell me what to select I would have no idea which of the options SolidWorks is giving me.

I'm trying to figure out how move a table back and forth with a quiet motor / linear actuator setup. I'd essentially like to have an actuator with an arm under the table that extends and retracts to shift the top of the table. 

I have drawn a [shitty MS paint picture](http://i.imgur.com/xiGSUcF.png) to show you guys what I mean. 

Problem is, this thing needs to operate quietly enough that it won't sound annoying in a quiet office or home room setting.

I found this [Arduino Motor Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438) seems like it'd be helpful, but I'm not sure if I'd have to custom build the actuator arm or if I can just pop a motor into something I can buy online. I'm thinking controlling with Arduino would be pretty easy, just hooking up the digital outputs to transistors that control the motor to go forwards or backwards.

54,Please help interpret the oscilloscope's picture,1495623122,"The situation: let us have an operating IGBT valve. Turn on our oscilloscope and adjust its sweep line riiiiight at the zero line of its screen's grid. The input of the osc. has to be sensitive to DC component of the signal. Put the signal probe of our oscilloscope on ""G"" pin of the IGBT, and its GND crocodile on ""E"" pin. Well... We can see the beautiful, well shaped square pulse sequence of 20V from peak to peak, 50% of duty cycle, and slightly downshifted by DC (5V downward from the zero line). 

The question: which way should I read the actual voltage between ""G"" and ""E"" pins of an IGBT valve (speaking about ""actual voltage"" I mean the sort of voltage that mentioned in the Data Sheet's ""Absolute Maximum Ratings"" chapter):

1. From peaks to peaks of the square pulse sequence
2. From the oscilloscope's screen grid zero line up to peak of the pulse
3. I have to calculate the ""absolute maximum G-E voltage"" from the ""peak to peak"" full swing voltage from the oscilloscope's picture AND the duty cycle's percentage for every specific case.

64,Expected transmit power for a space based pulsed radar system,1495594951,"Hello, I'm part of a team working on a mission proposal for a CubeSat mission at the University of Auckland (NZ).

We are trying to design a monostatic pulse radar for detecting 1-10mm sized objects for a CubeSat mission to detect space debris. The payload space available is 0.2U (100mm \* 100mm \* 20mm). Our radar system needs to fit inside this space constraint. Our operating environment is somewhere in LEO.

We are using the system diagram from [radartutorial](http://www.radartutorial.eu/02.basics/Pulse%20Radar.en.html) as a guide to design our system. We’ve settled on using a spark gap in our modulator to save space and on using a magnetron to generate the microwave oscillations.

Our target output is a pulse of 1-300GHz frequency that can detect objects &gt; 1km. Our transmit/receive antennas are patch antennas (the design of which have not been specified yet).

We're pretty new to radar design, so whilst we have an idea of the components that make up a radar system thanks to web resources, we have no idea whether our ideas are realistic in terms of power requirements and space constraints. We reckon that the magnetron is the most space consuming part, and we don't know whether we can make one that fits in such a small space but can generate the required pulse. The alternative solution to solve space constraint issues is to use an IMPATT diode, but this means that our emitted pulse will have much lower power.

Our questions are as follows:

* Is the described system feasible considering the space constraint?
* What output power can we expect would be needed to produce a pulse with the target attributes (ignoring the power source constraints, we can deal with that later)?
* What would be the recieved power that we can expect from the reflected wave off of small space objects? Is our detection size range (1mm - 10mm) realistic?
* What sort of noise, thermal or otherwise, can we expect during the mission in the stated frequency range (in space/LEO)?

Update: Thanks for the comments, looking into the additional lines of inquiry currently to help with this system design. Ultimately, we are able to rework the requirements if they are too demanding, but we want to see at least what the magnitude of power is required to accomplish a radar pulse such as this.

68,How does the mathematical relation of Power = Torque * Angular Velocity and the principle of gear ratios relate in the real world?,1495580228,"So I completely understand the mathematics behind gear ratios and the relationship between power, torque and rpm. For a simple 2 gear system, the ratio is equal to the number of teeth of the output over the input or the rpm of the input over the output etc.

And from a mathematics stand point, it's easy to see that torque is inversely proportional to rpm. However, I'm trying to wrap my head around how these phenomena work in the real world, in terms of a car pulling away in first gear from a stop, or how initially pedalling a bicycle is easier in first gear as opposed to sixth or seventh gear. However, I want to physically understand what is going on rather than just someone say, it's because of the formula for power showing that torque is inversely proportional to rpm.

I want to know how reducing rpm physically increases torque when talking about the gearing system in a car or a bicycle. For this case, I will use the bicycle as the real world example to try get across my guess as to how this happens, and hopefully someone can correct me.

The only explanation I can think of is this;

Imagine a case where your bicycle is in first gear, and for example, (just plucking random numbers here), the crank gear has 10 teeth, while the first gear on the rear wheel has 100 teeth, and the radius of this 100 tooth gear is 100mm, obviously this gives an extreme ratio of 10:1, so output rpm is greatly reduced, and therefore mathematically, torque output increases too.

Now, imagine putting the bike in 6th gear, this gear has 25 teeth with a radius of 25mm, giving a ratio of 2.5:1, increasing rpm but reducing torque.

Now, where does this increase in torque from putting the bike in first gear come from? Is it simply from the case that torque is the product of the normal component of a force and the distance it acts on about a point, therefore the torque acting on the rear axle to move that rear wheel which it is connected to is equal to the force from the chain pushing the gear teeth forwards multiplied by the radius of the selected output gear the chain is attached to?

And since first gear has a larger radius, it will produce a larger torque that will make it much easier to pedal from a stationary start where a greater force is needed to overcome static friction ie Newton's first law of motion.

72,Material Recommendations for a Thin Platform for a Person,1495564240,"I'm currently planning out a 0.5m by 1.0m platform designed to support human weight as part of a DIY project. The best way I can describe it is two platforms with four [load sensors (strain gauges)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/4/5/9/5/10245-01a.jpg) sandwiched between them, one at each corner.

[Here's a quick sketch I drew in Paint.](http://i.imgur.com/Sqk6B4w.png)

What material would be best for these platforms, and how thick would they have to be to support a person? (I haven't decided on a max load, but I'd say maybe ~120kg) The thickness and material of the bottom platform is irrelevant for the most part, since it's just touching the floor, so it just comes down to what I want the top platform to be made of.

I'm hoping for a material that does the following (though primarily just the first):

- supports ~120kg in the center without coming in contact with bottom platform (0.6cm clearance)
- doesn't deform over time
- easy to clean (not porous)
- non-toxic

The idea is to keep the platform as thin as possible to reduce its height and keep it relatively unintrusive. While flex in the material when under heavy load is perfectly fine, it does matter if it causes the top platform to bend and touch the bottom platform. I'd say the two platforms will only have around 0.75cm of space between them at rest, but since the load sensors themselves will flex a bit due to how they work, maybe 0.6cm would be a more accurate number.

Materials I've been considering so far are aluminum and HDPE (high density polyethylene) plastic, but I'm unsure as to how thick they would need to be. I would love to hear if you have better recommendations and their thicknesses for something like this.

Thanks all!

82,Wire Bundling and Concealing,1495519675,"Hi all,  
  
I'm working on a shaker table for a project. My task is basically to find a few boxes to conceal the wires and some electrical components. My question specifically concerns these electrical components. My general understanding is as follows: AC power comes in from the wall and into a junction box/switch box inside of a bigger box. The line then splits and is fed through an isolation transformer, which is then fed into a rectifier, and out of the box. Where the line is split, it's then used to power a 5V phone charger inside the box. The charger then powers two PWM's in the box and also goes out of the box. All of these wires going out of the box then (I think) are grouped back up and fed to a box under the shaker table. The wire is then split again, where the 120V line powers two solenoids, and the 5V line powers two sensors. Finally, the 5V and the sensors are grouped again into a single cable and are sent to a final box, where the 5V lines power a Raspberry Pi. The wires from the sensor are also fed into the Pi, and there are throttle lines that go all the way back the PWM's in the first box.  
  
So that is the general setup, as far as I understand. My questions are:  

Does this make sense? Am I misunderstanding this setup?  
What does an isolation transformer do? Seems to me it simply makes AC current safe?
What does a rectifier do? I think it converts AC to DC, which is what the solenoid (presumably) needs?  
How do these wires split? I'm assuming they'd all be twisted together or something, but what is the wire ""sheath"" called? Where could I find the terminals for the ends of the cables? Someone else mentioned two different things: the Ethernet cable terminals and GM Weatherpack.

84,Accurate characterization of high-strain region of stress-strain curves and damage evolution behavior in FEA,1495516501,"Hi!

I'm trying to gain some more fundamental understanding of the behaviors of materials as they approach ultimate strains, and the best methods for modeling materials at strains past a several percent. I'm mostly interested in metals, but I'm interested in the general topic as well...composites and polymers, which I realize are likely treated much differently.

I would like to begin to be able to accurately model the behavior and subsequent failure of materials using (for example) damage and softening (damage evolution) models in Abaqus (and other solvers). I have been working through the documentation which is fantastic, but I am interested in what is really required for grounded, reasonable estimations of post-failure behavior.

I'm familiar at an expository level with material modeling like Johnson-Cook models to characterize temperature and strain rate dependency, which are fundamental to the responses I'm interested in, but I'm looking for literature in modeling methods, and potentially any articles that anyone can recommend that demonstrate some tested correlation so I can ground my understanding.

I'm familiar with element deletion techniques and how to ""set up"" models that fail at certain strains, but I'm interested in the methods behind developing accurate ultimate failure criteria based on FE results as well as development of test-based parameters to control post-failure stiffness degradation.

95,How much turnover is 'normal' in a small- to mid-sized firm?,1495483645,"I've been with my current (also first) employer for nearly two years since I graduated school. It's a 75ish person firm with two offices with a heavy emphasis on transportation (highway/bridge) and some site design and municipal work, too.

The company is owned by a select group of employee shareholders and a board makes corporate decisions. Corporate culture has been shifting lately from a small family-type business that takes care of its employees to an environment where profits and the bottom line are seen as priorities in order to facilitate rapid growth. 

Some examples of what's been going on:

* minimizing office overhead by moving to open floor plans (despite widespread protest), 
* forcing some employees to travel 1+ hour from the rural part of the state to an office closer to our biggest client,
* stagnant wages and non-existent bonus programs, etc.

The benefits package is competitive (in terms of 401k match, PTO, and education assistance), but the pay is becoming below industry average for the area.

Since I've started (two years ago), there has been a growth from around 60 employees to about 75, but 18 people have left (or will be soon): 12 due to moves or better salaries/positions at other firms, 4 straight-up fired, 1 had to leave because the company wouldn't sponsor their visa, and 1 is being forced out by eliminating the position (though the firm is supposedly setting them up to spin off and do their own work).

Meanwhile, the company continues to push for growth and even just signed a lease for a new office 100+ miles away in another state to try to attract new clients, seemingly deaf to the discontent of the rank and file.

Right now the only solution I've come to is having an open Google Form and then being able to manipulate the data direct from the submission data, but ideally I'd like to be able to have multiple different forms point to the same mass database for identical data points (i.e. personal information would be identical regardless of form, and would populate a single database).

A few questions. It's doing my head in and I don't know where else to go to for advice. 


Long story short. I want to be someone who works designing electronic devices. Specifically in the medical field. It is my absolute dream. 

However in Australia (where I live) I know there are virtually no jobs here. So, I have the option of; 

1) doing an electronics degree
2) doing a mechatronics degree
3) doing an electrical degree (with power units - so not fully focused on beautiful electronics &lt;\3)

*All of these degrees options will have to be done at relatively low/mid-tier university 


My plan is to do a degree, get what little experience I can in the medical electronics field that is here in Australia, and then move ~overseas~ (I don't really know which country yet) to do either a  Masters in Biomedical Engineering or just jump straight into a job. Whatever suits me best at the time.

My heart says stick with electronics since I love maths. And fiddling with circuits. But with the situation I am in I may end up having to do mechatronics/electrical - as I may not have enough marks to transfer into the university which offers electronics. 

If I can't transfer, will mechatronics/electrical still be looked at favourably overseas? 

Also the fact that the university's I would possibly attend are not stellar in reputation - does it matter overseas?

What happens to the pressure inside the vessel (pressure gague measuring pressure in the vapor space of vessel) once the pump is started, the discharge valve is opened and the liquid starts flowing into the tank? 

Why does the pressure increase? Is it because some of the liquid flashes when it enters into the tank which is at atmospheric pressure? Or does the liquid compress the vapor space increasing pressure? I am very confused about this whole pressurized tank concept.

One of the positions is as an Electrical Engineer at the Corps of Engineers Hydroelectric Design Center in Portland, OR. The work will involve projects in controls, protections and power systems.

39,"Engineers, How did you decide your interest area?",1495207944,"**TL;DR at the bottom of the text**

Hi!

I'm a university student - currently in 3rd year, 1 year left to graduate. I'm in a course that is rather like a mix of manufacturing/IE and management. I also took a robotics module previously. 

This course gave me a good insight into many areas in engineering, but never got into teaching me in depth. There just wasn't enough time to teach all the necessary mathematics nor practical skills like programming. During the past 2 years I have talked to a number of experts and read some easy-to-read books about the subject, and I've narrowed down my choices to some specific areas (generally related to Quality Engineering):

- Developing new quality system/techniques for Industry 4.0 + Factory managment

- Reducing cost of manufacture in one-off productions (e.g. spacecraft production)

- Cost cutting of expensive medical/surgical devices(e.g. MRI machines, surgical robots)

Despite all areas listed above may be based on quality engineering or cost cutting, each specific area requires different skill sets, which I currently do not possess. I acknowledge that I'll need to study more maths and programming and related engineering knowledge, but given that I'm going to graduate within 1 year, I need to finalise my decision in choosing my interest area and focus developing skill sets in it. I am enthusiastic and I do not fear learning new skills regardless of how challenging it is, but the problem is that I find all areas fascinating, and it's difficult to choose one.

I've asked my friends in the same course but their advice have not been very helpful. I was wondering if any one of you had a similar problem as I, and I'm hoping to hear your stories of how you got through this issues.

Automobile Manufacturing
The following is a problem that occurred at an automobile manufacturing company. You are hired as a consultant to help solve this problem.

For this exercise
1. Identify possible causes. From experience, what could have caused this deviation from what has worked before to what is currently happening?
2. Evaluate possible causes. How will we evaluate the possible causes proposed? Which possible cause best fits the known facts. Which possible cause has the fewest, simplest and most reasonable assumptions?
3. Confirm the true cause. What can we do to verify any assumptions made. How can this cause be observed at work? How can we demonstrate the cause-and-effect relationship? When corrective action is taken, how will results be checked?

A valued new customer received one of your EX25 automobiles one week late. Because the equipment was late, the customer missed some key pilot tests in an important project. Unfortunately, the late delivery was due to your internal production difficulties, which delayed the shipment date a week. This delay is not an isolated incident. Recently, a number of your EX25 customers have experienced delays of from three to nine days. Since many of your customers have guaranteed arrival dates, the consequences of these late deliveries are becoming serious in terms of both cost to your company and damage to its reputation.
The Manufacturing Manager has informed you that the recent production difficulties are no longer just an in-house problem. The excessive number of rejects that you’ve been experiencing during the last two weeks has begun to result in late delivery of EX25 automobiles. The difficulties are compounded by the fact that you are in the middle of your peak season, which is the time of year when increased demand requires the hiring of new people and the speeding up of production on both lines.

Interview with Manufacturing Manager
Since one of the major features of our automobiles is their durability, they are all encased in painted metal body. His analysis shows that the delivery delays have been due to an excessive number of paint rejects on the body of our EX25 autos. While this lack of paint adhesion does not affect the operation of the automobile, He cannot send out a unit with a substandard paint job. Stripping and repainting the rejected body is more cost-effective than scrapping them. However, this rework takes valuable time and lowers the output of acceptable units. This problem has caused the reject rate to rise from the normal 1.5% to over 6%, and it’s still increasing.
The problem couldn’t have come at a worse time. Since our customers tend to have similar budgeting cycles, orders for all three of our automobiles tend to peak during the same six- week period each year. We are currently half-way into this peak season. Two weeks before the peak season begins, we bring on new personnel to work with experienced employees on both of our assembly lines. Each week during the peak season, we increase the rate of production on both lines so that all three of your units--the EX25, the EX35 and the EX45-- can be produced more quickly to meet the demand. Currently, the EX45 autos are being
produced at a rate of 40 units per hour, the EX35 autos at 70 units per hour, and the EX25 autos at 140 units per hour. The rate is scheduled to be increased again tomorrow.
Most frustrating to him is the fact that we experienced the same problem a year ago. After many days of investigation, we discovered that some employees, including employees who handle the body before painting, were using a silicone hand lotion which could prevent proper paint adhesion. A notice listing the acceptable hand creams was posted in the wash rooms. Within a week, the reject rate returned to normal.

Interview with Industrial Engineering Manager
The rejected units are the body for the EX25 automobiles. The EX35 and EX45 automobiles are experiencing the normal reject rate of 1 .5%. The EX25 reject rate has soared to over 6% and is still rising, due to periodic rejection of body with random gaps in the paint. While the automobile operation is not affected, the units cannot be sent to customers with a lack of uniform paint coverage on the body. The defects have been noticed by the quality control inspectors during their final visual inspection.
Since the rejected bodies are stripped and repainted, there has been no increase in scrap. However, this increase in rejects is beginning to have a significant impact on the number of satisfactory units that are sent to Shipping.
He mentally reviews the production process for the three units: the EX25, the EX35 and the EX45 automobiles. The basic process involves several assembly operations: component testing, body painting and inspection. Supplies of the various parts, such as instrument panels and trim, are kept at the points at which they are assembled in the automobile chassis. The new employees, hired just prior to peak season, work with more experienced assemblers on both lines. This was done to help with their on-job training and to prevent mishandling of the units.
The three autos are very similar in design, engineering and size. The EX35 is somewhat more sophisticated than the EX25. And the EX45 is the most advanced machine. Because more of the EX25 units are sold than the other two models combined, the EX25 is produced on its own assembly line. The EX35 and EX45 autos are produced on the other line. Last week, the output of Line 1 was increased to its current level of 140 units per hour of the EX25 autos, and output of Line 2 was increased to 70 units per hour of the EX35 autos and 40 units per hour of the EX45 autos. These rates have increased weekly during the peak period and will continue to accelerate until the end of the peak season three weeks from now.
Each line has its own supply of subcomponents and two simultaneous operations. While the engine and other components are being assembled, the metal body is going through wash, paint and dry operations. The wash involves a dipping operation in which the bodies are immersed in a cleaning solution that removes the contaminants and oils. The solution is changed every half hour. Because a continuous supply of body is required, each line has two wash tanks: one that being used and a second that is being drained and filled with fresh solution. The tanks on both lines are filled from a common, central supply tank.
After cleaning, the bodies are manually suspended on grounded hooks attached to the two conveyors, one of which is for EX25 body and the other for EX35 and EX45 body. The conveyors, which move at the same speed, take them through the booth in which paint is electro statically applied. After painting, the units enter the drying section.
After drying, the bodies go to the final assembly section of each assembly line and are attached to the rest of the unit. After this final assembly step, the units go to Quality Control and to Shipping.
Yesterday, when he checked the entire manufacturing process, everything was being done according to the standard procedures. However, he wouldn’t necessarily have noticed employees who might have been mishandling the units in some minor way.

The EX25 units are being rejected because of defects in the paint that covers the metal external body. The body has random spots in which the bare metal is visible because the paint has not adhered properly. Since the EX25 is assembled on Line 1, his attention has focused on that line. The other units, the EX35 and EX45, are not experiencing the problem and are assembled on Line 2. The two lines are set up identically. Even though the more sophisticated EX35 and EX45 units involve assembling some different components, the assembly operations are essentially the same. On both lines, the instrument panels and other internal parts are assembled at a series of stations, each of which has its own supply of parts. While this assembly is occurring, the external metal body are washed, painted and dried.
The wash operation involves dipping the body, using a continuous conveyor, into a bath that removes contaminants and oils. The bath solution is changed every half hour. Because a continuous supply of body is needed, each line has two wash tanks, one that is being used and a second that is being drained and filled with fresh solution. The tanks on both lines are filled from a common, central supply tank.
The body are manually removed from the wash tank conveyor, carried the short distance to the painting area and hung on hooks suspended from one of the two moving conveyors. One of the conveyors carries EX25 body and the other carries EX35 and EX45 body. As both conveyors move at equal speeds through the walled booth, the electrostatic paint is applied to the grounded body by spray nozzles located on the sides, top and bottom. The paint is mixed in small batches in a “homogenizer” next to the paint booth to control its quality and consistency. The homogenizer must be cleaned after each batch to avoid contaminating the paint. After painting, the units enter the drying section where they are exposed to a fast, thorough heat-drying process.
After drying, the body goes to the final assembly section of each line to be attached to the rest of the unit. After this final assembly step, the units go to Quality control and from there to either the rework or shipping sections.
Five weeks ago, as part of the annual peak season preparation, we hired additional personnel to work in all areas of the assembly operation. To ensure effective on-the-job training, each of these inexperienced employees is paired with an experienced worker.
His frustration with the body paint deficiency is compounded by the fact that he experienced the same problem a year ago. After many days of investigation, he discovered that some employees were using a silicone hand lotion which could prevent proper paint adhesion. A notice listing the acceptable hand creams was posted in the washrooms. Within a week, the reject rate returned to normal.
Since the problem started two weeks ago, he has increased his time on the floor. He had not noticed any employees doing anything wrong. He can’t help but recall that he warned everyone about a month ago that increasing the production rate can lead to all kinds of trouble.

Interview with Quality Control Supervisor
The automobiles come to his section after they have been completely assembled. The internal components have been attached to the chassis and hooked up, and the body have been washed, painted, dried and attached to the rest of the unit. While some component testing occurs during the assembly operation, the final testing is done in Quality Control. His section includes three inspection/test operations: electronic, operational and visual. Working in each of these three areas are quality control specialists who are qualified to test and evaluate all three of the automobiles, the EX25 units that are assembled on Line 1 and the EX35 and EX45 units that are assembled on Line 2.
The 4.5% increase in rejects of EX25 autos is due to periodic paint defects on the surface of the body. While these defects do not affect automobile operation, the standards require him to reject any unit in which the paint on the body does not uniformly cover the metal. During the last two weeks, his visual inspectors have rejected a significant number of the autos because of gaps in paint coverage that appear randomly on the surface of the body. The paint rejects solely are among the EX25 autos; the EX35 and EX45 units have not experienced an abnormal number of rejects.
When a unit fails to pass any of the inspections, it is sent to the rework area. Because of the disproportionate number of paint rejects, the rework group on Line 1 is dedicated almost exclusively to disassembly and paint stripping. While nearly all rejects can be converted into acceptable units, the rate of satisfactory units reaching the shipping area is not sufficient to meet promised customer delivery dates.
He has asked his inspectors to keep an eye out for anything irregular. So far, they have not reported anything back. However, a number of them believe that employees may be using inappropriate hand cream again.",AskEngineers,PleaseHelpMeWork,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6c10rr/please_help_me_with_this_engineering_job/

I am working on a project at the moment and have problems with finding appropriate accelerometers and implementing them into my system. I do drop tests and therefore need accelerometers which precisely measure any vibration of the drop element, the microgravity quality (10^-5 g) and the deceleration shock (&gt;50g). In my opinion I´ll need piezoelectric accelerometers for the vibration of the drop element and the shock event. Pz accelerometers cannot measure static acceleration like gravity or microgravity though, which is why I also need either a piezoresistive or a high-percise variable captive MEMS accelerometer. Out of redundancy reasons I´ll need four accelerometers of every kind.

Which sensors should I use? Is there a MEMS accelerometer which is precise enough to measure 10^-5g? What do I need to read out the data? Can I use a Raspberry Pi to send the data to a computer in real-time?

70,Perspective on pipeline carrying natural gas liquids through populated areas?,1495120290,"Sunoco is currently building a pipeline, the Mariner East II, that will carry natural gas liquids through populated areas, including next to many schools. Naturally, many people are in freak-out mode over this. For example, here's a portion of a recent post being distributed in the local community:

* It will carry a horrendously lethal and highly combustible combination of liquefied Ethane, Butane, and Propane. 

* A small breach in the pipe will almost certainly escalate into a huge breach. The liquid expands roughly 500 times when exposed to air.

* The resulting gas is heavier than air. It doesn't evaporate or dissipate. It hugs the ground, and can be ignited by something as trivial and commonplace as a cell phone. It will spread at a rate of about 600 feet per minute. 

* The resulting gas is immediately toxic. Once inhaled, it begins an irreversible disintegration of the lungs. Death may occur within 3 to 30 minutes.

* There is basically NO Emergency Recovery procedure for a major breech that has been proposed. The initial Blast Zone is 1100 feet. The extreme toxicity and immediate combustibility of this gas leave First Responders with no ability to assist anyone in the blast zone. 

Thoughts? Is the panic justified? Would you buy a house next to this pipeline?

(Sorry if the question is overly broad. I am indeed surrounded by people in panic mode over this, hearing stories of people standing in their yards, crying, and so I'm interested in hearing informed opinions that are a bit less emotional.)

81,"Once a home is built, what are optimal energy saving thermostat settings? Under which conditions and assumptions?",1495057866,"I made the Title sufficiently generic to permit general discussion on the topic (which is welcome).  I'm including my specific context here, but it can be entirely skipped if someone wants to jump right into the subject matter.

**TLDR; The following can be skipped.**

###My situation###

I would like to ask if there's anyone who can check my logic, and offer advice or data that could help me adjust or refine my cooling strategy.

My current living arrangement is less than optimal, but isn't going to change anytime soon.  I live with family, which is a bit of a mixed bag.  On the plus side, I'm not paying for HVAC.  On the minus side, I can't pay for HVAC (complicated).  The thermostat is not my own.  At best, I can make a pitch for adjusting the heating strategy.  I'm making a form of that pitch here, to see if the collective wisdom of this sub can improve my chances or adjust my specifics.

###History###

I have allergies and would strongly prefer to breath filtered air.  We have, in the past, used a whole-house fan at night to provide cooling, and no AC at all.  (The AC was old and highly inefficient at that point.)  This had several downsides.  (1) Allergies.  (2) Summer temps don't drop far enough to sleep in until midnight. (3) Uncomfortable afternoons and evenings.

Now, we have a new AC unit, but I've heard the idea floated that we might still use the fan to save money.  (long story, not getting into it.)  My goal is to prevent that from happening, for the aforementioned reasons.  I need a plan that a civil engineer can accept.

###Variables and Technical info###

The thermostat is a cheapie, but it supports 5-1-1 programming with 4 phases per day.  The AC unit is new, and supposedly pretty efficient.  We're on time-of-use power, with peak pricing between 4pm-9pm.  We have two boarded up fireplaces in the center of the house (brick and stone) and a tile entryway, providing some thermal mass.  The house is at least 50 years old, and has had some insulation added.  Insulation is Ok, but not fantastic.

Looking at local temperature data from July last year (on wunderground), it appears that the fastest cooling occurs between 11pm and 4am, and that temps reach at least as low as 75F, typically by 2am (sometimes a little later).  Daytime highs surpass 100F.

AC units, as I understand, are far more efficient when the temperature differences between indoor and outdoor are similar, or are inverted.  On the other hand, most of them don't run at all (or shouldn't be run) when the outdoor temp dips lower than 60F.  AC are more efficient to run in long blocks of time, after the first 10 minutes or so.

###My Proposal###

All temperatures are hypothetical.  I'll take what I can get, which might not be as ideal.  If I ask for too much, I'll get turned down.

9pm - Setting barely cool enough to sleep (78-80 F)  
2am - Pulling down temp as low as possible to take advantage of the more efficient cooling (65-70 F)  
9am - Increasing the temp to a maintenance level (75-78 F)  
4pm - High temp, effectively turning AC off (80-85 F)  

The idea is to cool our thermal mass in the cheapest possible way (using AC, not the house fan), and then ride it until nighttime.

Am I overlooking anything? (technical or otherwise?)  Do we have enough thermal mass for this to work?  How much more efficient will it be?  (a lot, a little, not at all?)  Am I deluding myself?  Am I asking the wrong questions or barking up the wrong tree?",AskEngineers,hypothetical1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6brvis/once_a_home_is_built_what_are_optimal_energy/
82,[Electrical engineering] Please help me know if this is a viable solution. I am an interloper and need assistance,1495057127,"First off, I have read the sidebar FAQs. I was referred here from r/ engineering and do believe my post to be permissible. Mods, please feel free to correct me and delete my post if I am wrong.

Okay, long story short. I have an LG 47LN5200 that had the backlights fail on me. I tested all the boards, etc, and everything appears to be within specs; all signs point exclusively to backlight failure, which is common with this set from my research. I was going to buy a new backlight kit but everywhere that actually has new ones sells them for too much making this already fiscally questionable repair totally not worth it. I could buy a used set for around $50 but I think that is still overpriced for a used set that for all I know will fail on me in a few short months.

TO MY QUESTIONS....

I buy things off of craigslist and resell/fix them. I recently bought an LG 50LF6090 with a damaged screen ($10 for everything!) and plan on harvesting the guts to sell. The backlights work perfectly in this set. I have yet to find the specific specs of these backlights to see how many total volts/watts per each LED on the busbars, I’m in the very preliminary stages of this (foolhardy?) endeavor and know this info is important…but IF, after I trimmed these strips to fit (50” down to 47”, lopping off an LED or few and reinsulating the exposed ends), could these serve as a viable replacement in your opinion? I know the LEDs would likely have minor coloration differences, and presumably be askew from where the original ones and were aligned but don’t anticipate this will have a large impact given the various diffusers.

I know essentially all components, on a board level, of a TV are generally specific to that set but to me it seems like the backlight is a very “stupid” component of an otherwise intelligent system. Meaning that, if the voltages sent from the LED driver circuit of the 47LN5200 PSU are consistent at around X volts then couldn’t those X volts supply power to essentially any vaguely similar spec’d LEDs wired in series? I’d guess the wattages are also likely different from the original LEDs but believe this could be adjusted for as follows.

I’m in medicine, not a electrical engineer by any means and my physics skills are admittedly rusty. But it seems to me that if the original power supply was trying to keep the volts at 5V per LED, x9 leds = 45Volts in total per strip (totally guessing with those figures for purposes of speed of this post), then couldn’t I just use any LEDs with use of diodes and/or resistors with these replacement strips to keep the voltages in that range so the PSU keeps pumping out the volts and doesn’t go into safe mode?

Sorry for the wall of text. For all of you who have read this far please give me your sincere and educated thoughts on this questionable project. I know it would be far easier to just buy a different TV and organ harvest both to recoup my losses but don’t want to do that because I’m stubborn as hell. In my mind this appears to be an entirely plausible and cheap solution.

Going to cross post this on various subs. Again, please feel free to delete if I posted against any rules, it wasn't my intention. Just wanted to solicit opinions of those with much greater background into what I plan.

The project we decided on was to build a quadcopter drone.  In planning this out, I decided I wanted to document the entire process, use a Raspberry Pi as the core, and do as much of the engineering and software development as I could.  I realized that by using open source software, commodity hardware, open-sourcing all of the custom code that I write, and thoroughly documenting the entire process, I could provide a very educational guide for hobbyists to use at home, or even teachers to use in their classroms.

I mentioned this to a coworker, and he thought I should see if I could find a grant to help defray some of the costs associated with it.

I need assistance with a current project I am working on that requires knowledge of uneven distributed loading calculations. I have posted a general image of the design in the link below. The major problem I am having is calculating for the three reaction forces of the supports at R1, R2, and R3. I have a computer simulator that has calculated the forces for me, but I wanted to be able to support it with actual equations. The simulator states that R1=947.137lb, R2=225.198lb, and R3= -25.736lb of force along the beam. When I try to calculate it by hand I keep getting R1=972.87lb, R2=173.72lb, and R3=0lb. Any guidance would be great. I have tried singularity functions and a couple of other methods used to solve these types of problems, but have had little success. If anyone can please show me how to reach these reaction force values I would be eternally grateful.

A little context.  I am working on designing a ceiling mounted air conditioner. using a peltier module.   I am not a engineer but for this project I naturally need to consider the inner workings to some degree. So the design can be a little conceptual so we've kept that in mind. Because we know that peltier modules are terribly inefficient today. 
I found this [post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4m7a2f/peltier_air_conditioning_will_it_work/)
I've read all of that post however I was wondering whether there was any way to cool the hot side of the peltier without blowing the air into a pipe out the room? 
The reason I ask is that if it were able to cool without having a big pipe going outside then it would really help our project.

96,"Graduated with an EE degree, (reluctantly) accepted my first job offer. What's the next best course of action?",1494998107,"I graduated in December from the University of Michigan with a bachelor's in electrical engineering. My cumulative GPA was a 2.4, I had one internship last summer, and no outstanding skills/credentials that every other applicant doesn't have as well. I do have three projects listed, but project experience is pretty ubiquitous. I didn't start my job search until a couple months after I graduated and I got my first offer as a staff engineer about a month and a half later. It's a small company near my hometown that deals with wastewater management and clean water distribution. Starting salary is 55k. I accepted because I'm aware that I am not that  competitive of a applicant, and it would probably take months and a lot of luck to land another offer.

For most of my time in college and for the few months post-graduation, I felt a total lack of ambition, I was really exhausted and depressed all the time, and in general just didn't give a shit about anything. I isolated myself while I was in school, so I don't really have a big network of alumni to reach out to. But now I'm feeling especially unhappy about my situation and I just want to break myself out of this slump. I know my situation could be worse but I keep thinking that if I had done some things differently while I was in school, then I could be working at a bigger company doing really cool shit, living in a more exciting city. A lot of my peers ended up at Boeing, Ford, Texas Instruments, Raytheon, Microsoft, etc. I just feel so lackluster in comparison. 

My job starts in June. In the meantime, I have been studying for the Fundamentals of Engineering exam to obtain my EIT certification. I know the certification is not recognized among all industries, but I feel like taking the exam and passing would give me a boost of much-needed confidence. I have also been applying to other jobs. Not too aggressively, just a few applications a day. 

Is it pointless for me to continue my job search right now, considering my qualifications are not as impressive as other applicants'? Should I just stick to this job offer for a year or two and gain some skills, THEN look for another job? My parents have encouraged me to keep looking, and my dad said a lot of people at his company started work there for a few weeks or a few months, and left once they got a better offer. He said it's not that uncommon to continue seeking employment even after accepting an offer.

Also, what else can I do to make myself a more marketable applicant? Is it even relevant to do side projects (Raspberry Pi/Arduino) to put on my resume if I'm not in school anymore? ",AskEngineers,emwhy11324,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6bmr6q/graduated_with_an_ee_degree_reluctantly_accepted/

3,Holding a retail summer job while looking for internships?,1494985600,"Hi, I just finished my first year at university. I definitely wank to find work this summer, preferably internships/jobs related to my engineering. However, I also understand that it is quite late and that freshman do not often get internships.

In the case that I get no internships, my plan was to work local retail jobs at the mall, Walmart, etc, which I am believe I would be able to at least get one opportunity if I start applying now.

The thing is, I wanted to apply to career/major related jobs first because that is what I would want over other jobs. However, if I wait too long on those jobs usually once high school finishes, all the high school students begin to take the local jobs at malls, Walmart, retail, etc.

As a result, I decided to start applying for all jobs now, hopefully get something, and then continue looking for major/career related work knowing that I will at least have some type of work in the worst case scenario.

I have a couple questions about that.

1) Is this considered rude/unethical? For example, it might be possible that I accept a job as a bagger or cashier somewhere, and then if I continue applying and get a engineering related job/internship like two weeks later, I would leave the bagger/cashier job.

2) How do y'all who've done this, deal with the job search process during your other work? For example, if I need to take time off my retail job to interview for a potential internship, do you just inform your current manager? Wouldn't they disapprove of that or maybe fire you? Is that just some risk you must accept?

While I can imagine the problems associated with small nuclear reactors running around the city, I can only speculate about  the engineering problems with a diesel-electric system. What prevented/prevents such configuration to be widely used? 

Edit: I'm asking about diesel-electric transmission, not about diesel-electric hybrid. Diesel-electric (or turbo-electric, or nuclear) transmission uses an engine to power an electric generator, to power an electric motor. It is mostly used in locomotives, submarines, ships and some heavy machinery. It sounds like a really good concept, because you can have the generator working always at optimal RPM, maybe even adding a battery to store unused power.

Edit 2: Following the information from the comments,  there is a thing called ""[series hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain#Series_hybrid)"" that work like a diesel-electric locomotive, but uses a gasoline engine instead.

I've always dreamed of working on developing electronics products of any kind, like making circuit design and PCB. I wonder how can one land a job in that despite being from middle east (Jordan) like myself since we don't have companies like that?

I know about circuits and microcontrollers, used PICs and Arduinos (hence AVR). I know about PCB design using circuitmaker but not a total professional. Also getting ICs from digikey or mouser, changing design to suite my goals...etc. I used LTSpice to build a circuit for a lab bench linear power supply with switching pre-regulator topology (SEPIC) but didn't design the PCB yet. I am eager to learn 3D CAD stuff using Solidworks and so on too,  but right now AutoCAD is all I know. 

It is worth mentioning that I work in the industrial field now as a planning engineer for instrumentation and electrical departments dealing mainly with sensors and instruments. I have a youtube blog called VEGEteK too.

42,Technical career is stagnating quickly 3 years out from school. Not sure what sort of jobs I should be looking for anymore.,1494813200,"Obviously a little background is required:

* First job out of school lasted 7 months and was mostly a manufacturing/facilities job doing preventive maintenance and helping out with manufacturing. I wanted to do design so I never intended to stay in this position long. Required absolutely nothing I learned in school. 

* Second job was for an engineering outsourcing company that did design work. I was placed onsite at a customer location here in town with the title of ""design engineer"" but I ended up in more of a sustaining/support role. Sure I was stuck in CAD for 8 hours a day but I hardly ever legitimately *designed* anything. Mostly quick fixes for parts and updating drawings. I was in this role for about 2 years and only recently left. 

* Third ""job"" is still with the same company as 2 but on a different project. I've only been on this one for about 2 months but so far its been 95% menial drafting work. That's simply what the customer requires. I have no idea how long this project is going to last. Could be a couple months, could be multiple years. While I'm learning quite a bit about GD&amp;T and other drawing-related stuff, I'm picking up almost no engineering knowledge. I haven't touched an equation in literally years. 

So here's where I am: a ""design"" engineer who's never really designed anything from start to finish. I'm kinda at a loss where to go from here. I have 2.5 years of experience but those years have not been very technical whatsoever. 

When I look at job postings, most design roles obviously want some technical chops but I simply don't have the know-how at this point for these roles. This has me questioning whether I want to stay the design path or not. But what else would I do at this point? 

I could see myself doing more of a ""systems integration"" role that may be more hands-on, which I would enjoy. But I don't really know what the career path for something like that may be.

52,Not sure what I'm doing anymore. I think I've sabotaged my career..........Where should I go from here?,1494788510,"Sigh....So I've been in uni for 3 years. I've been in three different engineering programs so far.


I think I rushed myself into engineeering. My goal going into engineering was to hopefully have my own side business and a good job that I enjoy and doesn't drain me. To be able to make enough to not worry about money or losing my job like I have for most of my adult life. (I hoped around $200-250k in savings by the time I'm 30-32 and making $85k+ from my job and business and hopefully have one house paid off.)



First year was general eng courses. Second year I was in computer engineering for the first semester. I liked what it would allow me to do in theory like design chips, build stuff and maybe one day start a business but I realized I absolutely hated programming and didn't want to do it for the rest of my life. I almost failed out that semester. Next semester I ended up switching to chemical. I went in to chemical thinking I could maybe one day use that to work in the medical or pharmaceutical fields. I liked it but I was still unsure about it. Plus I had heard horror stories about the oil downturn absolutely crushing the job markets and the rants at r/chemicalengineering discouraged me further from pursuing it.



Now I just finished my third year with both semesters in level 1 civil engineering. The coursework is doable and I enjoy parts of it like water treatment and environmental engineering, but there's a huge gaping void of uncertainty in my head.



Thing is unlike parts of chemical/computer I don't have a particular fondness for making buildings and dams. With computer/chemical I liked the career goals and the stuff I'd do in the workforce but I hated what I was learning. For civil I'm pretty indifferent to what I'm learning but I hate building stuff and feel really disheartened knowing I'll probably end up in a job I don't like.




I've thought about dropping out recently but I don't know if that'll help me in any way. Ill have wasted time and money and probably be just as lost and still not know what I want to do. Plus my parents and family would likely abandon me if I ever did that.



Another option would be to finish up these last two years and then go into the workforce and see what it's like. I like wastewater/environmental engineering so who knows, If I get a job there I might enjoy it more. If not I go back to school and risk losing 3-4 years+income further.



I still carry a nagging pain of failure and wasted opportunities though. I recently read a book about a guy who became a millionaire by starting his own software company and I couldn't finish reading the book cause it was so painful knowing I couldnt do that and wasted an opportunity I had to learn about it. (computer engineering). I could never become a millionaire being a civil engineer since every single successful business is in the technology field. I can never own my own business or make as much as computer/chemical engineers being a civil engineer. I'm not trying to belittle civil engineering, but I just keep thinking about all these other opportunities that are out there and how I will end up missing them to wake up at 50 one day and asking myself wtf I did with my life.

I am trying to fix a issue on onload tap changer of transformer. It is of MR make. The issue is that the when I raise or lower tap on oltc the motor works but when the tap is about to change, the motor stops working.
What I have seen is that the limit switch operates during that time and then a contactor K20 picks which causes it to stop the motor from operating. When I hold down the contactor for raise or lower tap(K1 or K2), it works without issue and operates properly. But when I just send a pulse to pick the contactor K1 or K2, it will move, but when it gets to the point of changing tap, it will not change.

How do I fix this issue?

67,"Why are the rail mass transit systems of Boston, NYC, and Chicago laid out differently than San Fransisco and Seattle?",1494700179,"Boston, NYC, and Chicago seem to have a two part System

**Boston**

* MBTA Commuter rail for the far suburbs with only a couple stops in the city limits of Boston ([System Map](http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/))

* The ""T"" subway for travel inside the city and the near suburbs

**NYC**

*  Long Island Railroad and Metro North for far suburbs and even well into CT ([LIRR System Map](http://web.mta.info/lirr/Timetable/lirrmap.htm))

* New York Subway for travel around the 5 boroughs ([Subway System Map](http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.html))

* and the L for the city and near suburbs ([L Map](http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/maps/ctatrainmap.png))

All these have a couple things in common.  The commuter rail lines make very few stops in the main city except for the hub station and possible one or two others.  The subway handles all city transit within the city (and buses as well).

***Meanwhile***

Seattle only has a single rail network, the Link Light Rail.  Looking at the [ST3 expansion map](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/51nn15/king_county_fast_and_frequent_transit_in_2040_if/) (sorry, best one I could find that had the actual layout of the area as well), the whole region is covered by a single light rail network with a much larger number of stops in the Seattle city limits.

(It is worth noting that the sounder train does serve as something of a regional rail train but the Link will eventually go to its main hubs once ST3 is complete)

Similarly, in San Fransisco, the BART provides rail service both in the city and to the surrounding area ([BART System Map](https://www.bart.gov/stations)) making 6 stops in SF and 5 in Oakland (the two main population centers in the area).

I believe there is a subway in SF but it is limited in scope, similar to the sounder train

**Is there and engineering reason for this?**

These systems see quite different in philosophy. Is is related to population distribution?  Or is it just the natural way that these systems developed over time?

72,How can I optimize airflow for bathroom fan project?,1494668327,"I live in an apartment where the bathroom is in the middle of the layout. There are no windows, just a small exhaust fan to pull air out of the room. I don't believe it is very powerful, and it does not look like I can modify it to increase the pull. (Plus, this is a rental, so permanent modifications aren't possible)

My bathroom door has [a vent in the bottom](https://diaryofafreeman.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_20160111_183751.jpg?w=1472) of it for passive ventilation.

When the fans are on and the door is closed, I can feel some extra air coming into the bathroom, but it's not very powerful. (much less force than I'd imagine 5 case fans would put out) The airflow also seems to be diverting in all different directions immediately upon entering the bathroom.

I believe this is because of the positive air pressure in the bathroom, but I'm not sure. I imagine that when the door is closed the door fans push more air into the bathroom than the exhaust fan can pull out, thus creating positive pressure in the bathroom. 

You can see how I have the fans [arranged immediately next to one another](https://i0.wp.com/diaryofafreeman.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_20160117_175947.jpg?w=364&amp;h=273&amp;crop&amp;ssl=1&amp;zoom=2).

Could this be causing turbulence and killing the efficiency of the fans?

I have a pretty mixed background from school in EE, ME and CS and my day job varies between: AIT(electrical,software), Systems Design(hardware level), controls software. A lot of my projects are short and understaffed so I wear a lot of hats. 

 I've learned a lot from all this but I feel a bit constrained. Compared to a software engineer, I'm not as skilled especially when it comes to algorithms/data structures. Compared to a EE, I can't design pcbs that are worthwhile. Compared to a ME, my CAD design skill is just rough. There's not as much jobs out there that are fit for me. Most systems engineering positions require someone with much more experience. 

I recently tried to jump to a new company just for something different but found it difficult to meet the expertise required for most positions that aren't entry level. Most positions asked for a subset of what I do now and often required expertise beyond me(even for &lt;4 year experience positions). I feel overwhelmed at what I'd need to learn to become proficient at everything.

81,Questions about undergrad research + future goal,1494630234,"So currently I am a freshman Mech E going into my 3rd semester this fall (sophomore). I am researching in a biotechnology/biomedical lab in the ME department. 

I think the lab itself is cool (this is my only research experience though so I don't really have anything to compare it to). 

However, I don't really see myself going into a career within biotechnology/biomedical nor if I go to grad school do I think I will study stuff related to that. In fact, I've recently begun to explore more energy +oil/gas careers and was thinking about doing some researching with drilling, etc in the petroleum engineering department at some point in the future.

My questions,

1) Given that I haven't been in this current lab for even close to a semester, how long should I give it a try before considering joining a petroleum related lab like I earlier mentioned? 

It's not that I am super bored of this lab and want out immediately or else I would have left already, and this leads to the next questions.

2) Correct me if I am wrong but I would assume if I applied to grad school to study something non-biomedical related, wouldn't it hurt my application if I have a history of doing research something completely different than what I intend to study? 

This is largely why I'm a bit conflicted. I obviously want to align my current skills/experience/activities with what I will do in the future, however, since I'm already in my lab I also don't want to just jump ship and leave before really getting started. 

3) Stemming off the previous question, does what field my research experience have affect applying to career/industry as much as applying to grad school?

For example, if I were interviewing/applying with BP, would a recruiter think badly on my application if they see research (which is a plus) but then figure out it's not energy, oil/gas related and mark off for that?

4) Lastly, I came up with what I thought was a genius idea at the time of simply researching in both labs simultaneously. What are your opinions on that?

I've seen people say it is unethical and should never be done, to it is fine but harder to manage, to people who've done quality work and get published in both, so I'm guessing your mileage may vary?

Honestly, I guess all these questions stem from the fact that I think aligning my skills/experience with what I plan to do in the future is nice, but I don't want to just give up something so soon after starting nor do I want to wander around from lab to lab creating minimal results.

EDIT: I also feel like the lab treats undergrads pretty well and gives us some good work to do, so I would really hate to land in another lab that researches the ""right"" topic/field but I'm just sitting there touching test tubes.

About a month ago I asked a question here regarding getting a recent graduate engineering job. I am Canadian and my education is done here. 

For reference here is what I asked a month ago (quoted):

&gt; anyone in Canada with a degree in aerospace engineering have advice on job searching? I have graduated last June and I have only been to 3 interview tops. OSAP will be calling soon and its been far to long since I got any call back. I wanted to gain some Canadian experience for the P.ENG designation before I even tried to do a masters (since my overall cpga suffered due to family issues and an injury, took me 6 years instead of 4 years to graduate, thus hoping job experience would outweigh cpga), but no luck. Currently I am doing odd tutoring jobs and I have signed up for a CCNA certification course based on advice from a family friend. I would really want to work in a job in my field though. I have academic experience in C++, ANSYS, Matlab, CAD and I have been dabbling into Linux on ARM architecture and virtual machine to play with openfoam and such. I would like to end up working in aerodynamics, fluid mechanics/astromechanics (such as relativistic mhd), satelite design/payload design (i was designing a payload for my 4th year project) or something related to robotics/ai or computers since I love computers as well.

6,Should I take offence to a low job offer?,1494557129,"I graduated last spring (BSME) and have been looking for a job for 9 or so months now. A handful of interviews but nothing is panning out. My last interview had me really hopeful, I thought I really connected with the owner/manager, we had a good report over the interview. I submitted my resume as a cold call in January. The position is ostensibly for a machine design. He reached out to me a couple weeks ago asking if I was still in the job market. I interviewed Saturday morning and on Tuesday he sent me an email offering me a job. It was for 15/h. I felt that this was low, but since I've been looking for so long, who am I to complain? I have 6 years of military electronics experience, and 3 years as a technician in the semiconductor field (both prior to my degree). I sent a reply email telling him I'm excited for the opportunity and so forth. I asked if it would be possible to start me at 18/hr (I honestly wanted to say 20, I was making 25 at my last job as a technician, and I know I don't have engineering experience, but I figured the degree meant something). After that I haven't heard back. No counter offer, no rejection, he just disappeared. I called his office and left a message telling him I emailed him and I'm excited to give notice at my part time job.. etc.. I thought I was a great fit and it just disappeared. And I don't even know how I should feel with the original offer. I'm just sick of being unemployed, I probably should have just said yes.


EDIT: UPDATE; Original timeline was this

Saturday-go in for interview (very positive overall)

Tuesday-get job offer email at 15/h, I replied via email with a small counter of 18/h

Wednesday-call and leave message touching base to make sure he got my email

Friday-I called just now and he answered, I asked him if everything is okay since I haven't heard back.

7,What does the security clearance timeline look like nowadays?,1494555256,"I accepted a job at a defense company, and they require at least interim secret to start. I filled out the SF86 honestly and submitted it, and just got confirmation today that the security office sent it to the government. I hope that maybe someone with experience in this realm can calm some of my nerves. Will it take a long time to get interim? 

I'll give some background on my situation too, if that might help with context.

My current job has an uncertain end date, since the client contract isn't being renewed and there's been no indication of my getting reassigned at the office. My apartment lease is also up in a couple of months, I have to decide if I'm going to move out or if I'm going to suck it up and renew the lease. So not only do I not know how long my current job will last, but the lowest monthly rent option is a 13 month lease and it's still 20% (!!!) more than what I am paying now. I'm fortunate that relocation for the defense job will reimburse a lease cancellation, but that's just nuts in the first place. I basically live in Mayberry, it shouldn't cost as much as it does. Most of all I don't want to be in no man's land.

I'm pretty boring for the most part, I don't think I'd fail the entire clearance. I was honest about who I am, but part of my is a bit anxious because I might not get interim and thus might have to wait a long time to get final clearance. The sources of my anxiety are the following.

I was naturalized as a kid through my parents getting their naturalization. I only have visited India (country of birth) once in my life and that was last year for a wedding. I have an OCI card, which is a lifetime visa not a passport. Back when I was in college I had a lot of stress from different things at once so I got help with counseling and medication, both of which I haven't needed since the stress went away 3 years ago. I felt like I could have answered 'no' on the question but felt like honesty is a better policy. 

I like everything about what the job entails (work wise/compensation/location/the company) but I'm nervous that if they take a long time I'm going to have to do the whole job search thing again, and I don't want to make a commitment to some other job that I can't keep.

However, and I feel pretty stupid for this, I do not understand how exactly STATCOMs work. As far as I can tell:

When connected to the grid, STATCOMs are synced to whatever the voltage is at: if the grid's power factor goes out of whack, as does the STATCOMs.  Then, the voltage level is adjusted accordingly in order to bring the power factor back to unity.  

However, I don't know if I am right at all about this, and all the textbooks I read seem to tell me the purpose of STATCOMs, but not really the operating principle.

32,Let's talk about wire lug terminals,1494467861,"Disclaimer: I only know enough about electricity to be dangerous.

I'm wondering about large (&gt;=4ga) electrical wire lug terminals. I have made several battery cables, and am unsure of the optimal technique. I don't think there's such a thing as overkill, and like to future proof my projects when possible.

I plan to make some large cables for an 8k lb winch on my truck, which should draw north of 400A at full capacity. 

What's the objective with terminals? I assume it is:

* As low resistance as reasonable 
* As durable as possible (fatigue from vibration, and tensile strength (I don't anticipate needing massive tensile strength, but to be safe)) 
* As environmentally/corrosion resistant as possible (I do live in the salt belt)

In my previous cables I followed this procedure using welding cable, up to 2awg.

* Trim insulation from end of wire
* Hold ring end of terminal in vise with open end of lug terminal facing up, put a dab of rosin in the pocket that will accept the stripped wire end
* Heat rosin with torch until boiling and insert stripped wire end, allow to cool
* Place lug terminal and wire into hammer crimp
* Start compressing crimp with bench vise to ensure alignment 
* Finish crimp with several forceful blows from a 2lb sledge while attempting to avoid bodily injury 
* Put ring terminal end back into vise, heat lug and wire with torch and solder joint until the pocket is ""full"" 
* Shrink UL rated marine grade shrink tubing over joint

____

Unfortunately there is much conflicting information online, such as:

* Solder will crack, totally unacceptable to use in an automotive application 
* Crimping will never form as good of a connection as solder 
* Crimping is far superior to solder, as it cold welds
* Ad nauseum

My concerns with my method:

* Introducing hydrogen embrittlement in the copper. I'm familiar with this in a welding application, but I did not even consider it in this case until I read where someone mention it. According to them, it can happen as low as 300F in copper, which is less than the melting point of solder, as far as I am aware 
* Introducing a stress riser in the wire where the solder wicked up the strands. It's definitely stiff past the lug. I assume some strain relief would help mediate this, such as the shrink tubing. The wires will obviously see vibration in the engine bay, but I won't be swinging them around my head or anything like that. 
* Hammer crimping vs hydraulic crimping. I'm not sure what the peak force of a 2lb sledge is concentrated down to the tip of the die, but I imagine it's quite high. Hydraulic crimping offers more consistent and more attractive crimps, but are they mechanically superior, assuming the dies are quality?
* Heating the crimped lug to solder it anneals the copper.  I saw this mentioned on a forum, and I'm not sure what the repercussions of this would be.  It seems (to me) that if it was work hardened by crimping, annealing it would return it to a less-stressed state, and would be better.  It was presented as a negative, though.

____

I did take some time today to read part of NASA's spec sheet for wire connections.  They seem to permit both soldered and crimped connects, granted they are executed within the guidelines.  I noticed that the testing methodology for the crimped connections is quite through, and not something I could accurately reproduce without test equipment.  My other concern with their standards (as applied to my application) is that they don't contend with salt/corrosion.

Another consideration is that all factory automotive wire terminals I've seen are crimped.  Is this due to the fact that it's the superior method, or is it a cost saving effort?  Or both?

I graduated in May 2016 and started working for a Japanese automotive company a month after that. One month from now is my 1 year anniversary.


Working at this company is a lot different than I expected. A normal work week for me is 55+ hours, and it is starting to drain me, both physically and mentally. I don't find the work interesting anymore, or the Japanese work culture. I talked to my manager about my workload and he was basically like meh, everyone has a high workload here.


The only keeping me from leaving is the relocation and signing bonus I would have to pay back. If I leave right now, I would have to pay about $10k. I have $25k in savings, so technically I could pay it and be fine. I would have to stay an additional year to not pay any money back, but I don't think I could do that. 


My other question is about how easy it will be to find another job. I don't like the current city I'm living in, so ideally I would move back home with my parents and find a job there. Through my own research it seems I should accept a new position before resigning at my current company.

58,Scheduling Queueing Theory,1494368694,Hello! This is my first post here and I'm looking for some guidance with my current project. I work in an aluminum extrusion plant. We have a 2500 UST press that runs the show. There are times that the press is down. One cause is because there are no dies that are ready. Dies have to be heated in an oven for about 2.5 hrs - 3 hrs. The operators get a list of orders (some past dues and some for week) and they pick dies to go in the ovens (10 ovens) at random or by instinct. The sequence they pick sometimes leaves the press waiting for dies to heat up in order to continue. I am wondering how I could pick a sequence from the Order list that will keep the press running for as long as possible (minimal idle/ wait time).

62,Kind of dumb practical question... how can I unclog this strange pipe situation?,1494360510,"Hi engineers, I have kind of a dumb question. I have a cryostat. It was designed to be used with liquid nitrogen, such that the LN2 would be poured/injected into the top of it, and as it evaporated, the N2 gas would vent out a side port. [Here is a schematic of it.](http://i.imgur.com/SDeSYVa.jpg)

To be clear, the LN2 in poured/injected at the top where that big hose assembly connects, via the port labeled ""quickonnect"", and can travel almost to the very bottom, where it then connects to a bigger cylinder/pipe around it that goes back up to the port labeled ""cryogen venting port"". So it's kind of like a U bend at the bottom, but really more like one pipe inside the other, and the liquid first goes down the inner pipe, and then up in the volume between the pipes. [Just to be really clear, here's an MS paint side view of it; both of the outer parts are connected so it's like a jacket around the inner part.](http://i.imgur.com/vWX02NI.png)

So here's the thing. I can't use LN2 with it for various reasons so I just want to use cold water. I have a few pumps around and they're definitely powerful enough. In fact, I was using one of them, just a dinky 4W fish tank water pump, and it was working fine for a while. Then, at some point, I disconnected that pump because I wanted to switch it out for a pretty much identical one that's just probably more reliable in the long term (also 4W, I tested it and it works). However, this time, when I plugged it back in (supply the water from the top, using the side vent as the outlet, back to the bucket with the pump), it doesn't move water at all. The pump itself works (if I just have the pipe that goes to the top go elsewhere, it works fine) and it's not a height issue (raising the pump/bucket to the level of the top input port changes nothing).

So I think it's a clog... I also tried it with a much more powerful pump and it shows the same behavior (likewise for the original pump now). If I actually put my mouth to one of the cryo ports and blow, you can tell only a little air is getting through; it definitely feels constricted. Now I can stick a metal rod all the way to the bottom of the center (input) pipe and it seems like nothing is blocked there, but I can't really do the same for the ""jacket""/output pipe, because the port for that one is from the side. However that's also confusing to me because it seems like that one would be harder to obstruct since it has a ring shaped cross section... the only thing I can think of is that the part that connects the input to output pipes isn't actually like my drawing, but more like just a hole or two in the side of the input pipe, which would be easier to clog.

Anyway, my question is, does anyone have any suggestions for what I could try? I can't see down the input one (it's very narrow and any light source gets blocked by my head). I'm going kind of nuts with this and the manufacturer hasn't been much help. My next tries will be just leaving some vinegar solution, and then maybe after that some acetone solution, to try and dissolve whatever it is, but I think that's a long shot. thanks in advance for any ideas!",AskEngineers,integrals4daze,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6a7wy4/kind_of_dumb_practical_question_how_can_i_unclog/
63,Structural Framing Strength - wood vs tubular steel,1494360028,"Greetings,  
  
Novice builder of small structures moved from USA to South America and quickly discovered that the type of lumber I learned with is hard to find and comes at elevated costs around here.  
Most small buildings here are simply built with cement and brick, but tubular steel is about the same price as the wood and readily available.  
Besides the fact that I do not yet know how to weld, I'm tempted by the idea of framing with these steel members as they come in sizes that I'm used to.  
.  
so my big question;  
is it crazy to use stick framing techniques with steel rectangular tubes?  
I feel that the steel must be at least 2-3 times stronger so instead of lumber every 16 inches I could do steel every 32 and/or I could use a 2x4 metal tube as if it was at least a 2x6 or 2x8 of wood and in the end I'll have a super strong structure.  
,  
an example is this tube here
[HomeCenter Link](http://www.homecenter.com.co/homecenter-co/product/13304/2,5-mm-9-x-5-cm-x-6-metros-Tubo-rectangular/13304)  
Its basically a 2x4, the steel is 2.5mm thick and its a whopping 6 meters long (19.6 feet)  
besides the fact that I don't yet know how to weld.... - I feel like I could buy a bunch of these cut them to size, frame out my floor, walls, roof, wrap around deck, etc. -all along just using them as if they were wood. 
 
The folks working at these stores don't really know much detail but are def quick to say that they are ""strong enough""  
I'm only looking to build out structures that are less than 400sq feet but do like tall walls and elevated biggest concern is ensuring that I can support the load of 2 floors, with that second/top floor being used as deck to hang out on.  
I'm also now in an area where snow load is not an issue.  
.  
[the last project](http://imgur.com/oDGaCJK) 
This is 212sq feet that I built out with 2X10 for floor, 2x6 in the walls and 2x8 for the roof held up with 6x6 posts on top of 5foot precast piers. To say its OverBuilt, could be an understatement - but that's ok. I'm building for myself, by myself and enjoy the experience.

This button opens and closes like a clicking pen, but the mechanism is different.

I tried to take a photo of what the button cap looks like so you can see the ridges. 

Also, if anyone knows other products that use this mechanism, or mechanisms that provide a similar function, please let me know.

23,Looks like my dream job is taking a turn for the worse. What should I do?,1494085543,"I graduated last year as mechatronic engineer. I love robots and drones, and I've always been really into control theory and writing control software.

I got a job to develop the next generation control loop software for my company's pressure modulator. So, I'm a controls-guy, and got a job doing just that. I'm grateful for that, I don't think I could have asked for anything more fitting.

Now the catch is... the task itself is difficult.  For the good part of last year I worked on a prototype, and it seems the requirements describe a near optimal performance for the control.

The legacy device uses an old 16bit microcontroller. The new product was significantly changed as far as the pneumatics go, that's the whole reason they need the control loop modified. We've been pushing for a microcontroller change as well, but it's not going well.

I honestly think this problem needs a floating point-capable controller. The control loop needs to be adaptive, and there's no easy way to do that.

The hardware guys are evaluating the costs, and, as was expected, the processor update would cost a lot, they don't want to do it.

I'll do my best to explain all the issues, and proposed solutions which need the processing power, and how that would impact the control performance... still, there's no good way to put a price tag on 'control performance'. On the other hand, we know the better processor costs 1 euro more. (well, at least for now, cause the old one will no longer be produced some time midway through our production and its price may or may not sky-rocket.)

So I've been thinking... if the decision is final, and they'll force the legacy processor, I might want to leave them.

Instead of implementing, say, an extended Kalman-filter for this pressure modulator, I'd be struggling to implement just about any filter on integer math, and on a processor running at 95% load. 'Darn, this won't do, this thing has to be 32bit, 16 can't work. But then, I might have to remove a data point in that lookup-table... or compromise on that compensator thing??'

Apart from the soul-crushing misery of developing on this processor, I seriously doubt it is possible to deliver a working solution. In the end, I'll have spent 3 year doing something I hated, and then would feel like a failure because of all the claims and bad test results.

On the other hand, it feels like running away. Also it would probably lower my chances for getting another job. Nobody wants to hire some1 who's known to just leave when he just doesn't like his tasks.

So... would you leave them, or stay?

25,How does variable torque distribution work (for AWD e.g.),1494066015,"I'm trying to understand how modern all wheel drive systems work, for example BMW's X-Drive. I understand the ""official"" explanation, that there is a lamellar clutch between the front and rear drivetrain, that can be closed quickly and that therefore there is a distribution of the torque. But I don't get how that distribution can be set to any desired ratio. I can't imagine, that the lamellar clutch is only partly applied (= not closed completely) because slippage would wear it quickly. But when the clutch is always closed completely, there must be a fixed set of gears that would make a freely chosen torque distribution impossible and it has to be in the ratio of the gears, connected by the lamellar clutch.

33,Quality Inspections: How to articulate the benefit to stakeholders and identify metric correlations.,1494011898,"I am part of a Quality organization that supports manufacturing. We have multiple inspection points throughout our manufacturing process, as well as process audits to verify operators are adhering to the SOP. We monitor the data collected from these inspections, root cause nonconformances, drive corrective actions, and identify risks in the process. 

Recently my supervisor asked for a correlation study to be performed on our metrics for both product and process inspections so he can better articulate the benefit of the audits to stakeholders (i.e He wants to be able to say that increased performance with metric 'Y' results in increased performance in metric 'X'). While we are positive correlations exist, we are having a hard time identifying any solid correlative evidence. This is especially true for our process inspections where nonconformances are often operational or behavior based. I should also add that our process inspections are sporadic and not consistently performed in a single location (daily audit of a random production line), unlike our product audits which are performed with defined sample rates on all lines.

Does anyone have experience with similar studies or have suggestions on how to easily identify correlations? Perhaps there is a way can approach the study differently to see benefits we haven't thought of?

Our current results using simple correlation formulas with the data have shown inconsistent correlations (positive one week, negative the next), or no correlations at all where expected. We have had some success with showing correlations to added costs as certain metrics decline, but this is not what my supervisor was looking for.

60,"Simple, self-coded finite element analysis program for analyzing curved spines won't reduce upper curves no matter what I do",1493918002,"Hi,

I've made an FEA-style program in MATLAB for analyzing spines.  It's made of 16 rigid vertebrae and 16 intervertebral discs.  I've extracted the stiffnesses primarily from a biomechanics paper but also modify it using bending tests.  The boundary condition I'm using is that the bottom-most vertebral body is fixed at (0,0), this isn't counting into the 16 I've mentioned and isn't on the image to follow.

[Here are the bending test pictures to show you what's going on. 
 The circles are the centroids of the rigid bodies; the joints are more-or-less halfway between and aren't shown because they're not interesting in the output.](http://i.imgur.com/a/kumdP)  What's happening here is that the vertical spine is having a force applied to the top vertebra until the displacement matches the measurements from the bending tests  (top 12: right bending; bottom 4, left bending).  Then the stiffnesses (one for the top, one for the bottom) is modified to change the angle of the curve (top or bottom) to match the bending test for that section.  My problem is that my code is unable to straighten the top curve.  I've tried this on 11 spines now.

In those pictures, in the first one it's a right bend and the curve at the top (draw a line between the 7th and 9th and 9th and 12th circles, find the angle between the two lines) should be almost flat (1 degree) - I've run an optimization script that modifies the stiffnesses until it is 1 degree, but it never is, instead settling at/not decreasing past 20 degrees.  In the second, it's a left bend and the curve at the bottom (1 and 4, 4 and 6) should be 4 degrees, and it is.  I've tried both fmincon and brute force optimizations with the same result.

I've also tried reducing the top stiffness by a factor of 10, which brings the top curve down to 17 degrees.

Any ideas why I can't fix the top one?  I don't know what information to supply to help.  Unfortunately, the FEA guy in my lab is away and has been for some time.  I really need to make this work.

Before anyone yells at me for not posting this in the car forum: I doubt most guys there know about designing a circuit. What I'm doing isn't illegal or stupid. :-)  

That said...Here's the poop:  

I have a 1964 Chevrolet Corvair 500 Coupe. At some point, someone added a 3rd brake light which was pretty well jury rigged in - they'd grounded it at a random screw on the dash via 8 feet of wire, and had shoved the positive end of the wire into the brake switch. 

A few days ago, I received some new fancy pants LED tail light panels with two inputs controlling one set of lights through a diode. (separate wires for the running light and brake light circuit, separated by a diode and a capacitor in some way, I don't have a schematic of the design) I hooked them up and they weren't working properly. The brake/tail circuit was working but I could NOT get the running light circuit to work. I played with it for several days, scratching my head in amazement of this nonsense!  

Yesterday I FINALLY figure out that it is the third brake light, which is essentially wired in parallel with the BRAKE light circuit (brake and running lights are two different circuits sharing common ground through the body) which was pulling a whopping 7.36 Volts through the other side of the diode and causing the voltage to drop so far that the LEDs on the new panels won't turn on. I disconnect the 3rd brake light and voila, the LED panels work perfectly. 

Here's the thing though...  This car is going to be a daily driver for a while, and besides that, modern traffic is used to that 3rd brake light being up there so I'd like to figure out a way to keep it. I did a few experiments with a tiny 1N diode from an old amplifier I had laying around and I could get the circuit to function but the 3rd brake light (tested with both LED AND Incandescent) would still be on, albeit dimly, even when the brake was not depressed. (essentially, off.) Even the tiny LED was pulling 5 watts. 

So...I feel like there must be a way to use a transistor with a really high voltage rating (Say 8 Volts) to act as a switch for the 3rd brake light that will allow me to hook it up in parallel like it was (but in a proper way) and only pull current through the positive lead when the transistor says it can. 

Does this sound like something that is doable?  The brake light circuit runs on 12+ volts, which it's ALWAYS seeing so I feel like using a rather high switching voltage won't cause it not to work. 

I feel like this is probably simple for someone who really knows electronics...I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to circuits...especially where it applies to designing circuits. 



+++UPDATE++++

I found two 1N5402 diodes in the junkbox and stuck them in the circuit just before the brake input on the LED panels. Works perfectly. Stops backwards flow out of the panel's circuit and allows power to pass to turn on the brake lights and blinkers. Zero voltage at the source for the 3rd brake light now. Yay brainstorming!

Disclaimer: I'm as far from an engineer as you can get. An ELI5 explanation would be great! 

I'm currently writing a fiction work set about a hundred years in the future after an extinction-level event almost wiped out all life on earth. I'm thinking something like a nuclear war or supervolcano. 

A ""colony"" of sorts has formed and uses an old nuclear reactor for power. For sake of the story, this reactor was built sometime in the 1970's. One of the key plot points I have going is that this reactor needs to start breaking down or malfunctioning to an extent where it would present an immediate danger to those living in this settlement, and they would have to leave or face almost certain death.

Also bear in mind that the people running this reactor have almost no extensive technical knowledge about how to maintain it, as many of the records, manuals, etc were lost to time. They're going off of only the most basic knowledge available.

So, how could I spin this to make it at least somewhat realistic that everyone needs to GTFO before the reactor melts down/kills everyone?

80,Much needed advice for a freshman student (grad school related)?,1493857356,"This might be a little long and I'd prefer y'all to read as much as you can but the TL;DR is, if you were to give an engineering student going into his second year a game plan to maximize chances of getting into a top tier engineering school (MIT/Stanford/etc) what would it be?

Currently, I am a first year (second semester) Mech E at a public state school with a good engineering school. However, during applications in high school, this was not my first choice, and I got rejected from my top schools. However, if I could go back in time and give my freshman self a game plan to get into a top school (and I know the whole college process is a mess so nothing is 100% guaranteed) I would say extremely good GPA and SAT scores, learn how to write extremely well, find opportunities to create relationships so you can get good recs, and get extremely talented at one skill/activity/club/etc.

However, by my senior year, I had a very high SAT and GPA, my recs were probably good but not absolutely stunning, and I was involved in band and academic decathlon near the end but I felt I never got enough time to really focus in on it because 1) I didn't try hard enough and 2) I was in too many orgs for too long so never had time to properly focus on 1-2 things that could really stand out so I felt that my college applications were one of those typical high scores but still pretty average applications. 

Now, four years later as a freshman, I have a good GPA, I'm in 3-4 engineering design teams (formula 1, hyperloop, solar vehicle..), I just started researching in a biomedical lab (in addition, am also thinking of doing research in drilling and oil/gas too), and going into next semester I have some ambassador/leadership position with the engineering school. 

I have a lot of questions but the biggest one is, what do I need to do and what should be my gameplan/focus to get into top tier grad schools (I'm aiming for Stanford or MIT)? 

During high school, I started thinking about this too late and by the time I buckled down, there wasn't many years left and I definitely don't want to make the same mistake this time around.

I know this is alot but if y'all would also be able to answer some more questions I have that would be much appreciated:

1) Obviously, I probably should not be involved in so many clubs/orgs throughout my entire time here cause that might just stretch me thin but what could I focus on specifically? For example, design teams vs. research? Essentially, those who have been through this process, what would a perfect resume/application look like to you?

2) I felt my writing skills weren't top tier during high school so my essays were not as interesting. What other skills like these should I work on improving these next years in preparation for a grad school application?

3)Lastly, is there absolutely anything else I need to know? Any other words of advice/suggestions?

Lever that would move the drill up and down (drilling into the cork, when going down, and out of it when going up)
""Magazine"" that would hold the cork plug, so it doesnt spin when drilled. It would have 10 holes for cork plugs. 
A moving board, that would move the magazine and stop at each of the magazine holes.

You plug the machine into a electric circuit, so it works. Set the magazine at a ""starting position"" and put cork plugs in it. Turn the moving board on.

Will I damage this compressor if I run it at 65CFM and just 100 psi ?

I have a question about what the force would be on the walls of a bicycle rim. In a clincher style rim the tire is held on by the internal pressure of the tire pushing up against the wall of the clinch.

Tire pressure is around 8bar or 0.8MPa 

I have some cad of the wheel and the internal area of one surface is 9.24E-3 m^2 

Force is pressure x area so the force is 
0.8E6 x 9.24E-3 = 7393N 

Is this number reasonable? 

How do I design the wall thickness to cope with this?

43,Charging a battery using a solar panel.,1493669044,"Hi everyone,

I have a question regarding the use of a solar panel to charge a battery on a boat. The situation is as follows; the boat has two batteries, one is used for starting the engine and the other is used for basically everthing else. Both are being charged by the dynamo on the engine. I am a mechanical engineering student so I only have a basic understanding of how electricity works. 

So here's the deal: Me and my friends were thinking of buying a solar panel that charges one of the batteries. But were not really sure on how powerful it should be and how long it would take to charge the battery. So let's say the battery has a capacity of a 230Ah and a voltage of 12V, does this mean that using a 150Watt panel delivering 8A on 18V the charge time would be 230/8 = 28,75 hours? And does the difference in voltage on the panel and battery matter? 

A few other related questions are; is it possible to charge both batteries using the panel if they are in a parallel circuit? And what would be the easiest way to determine how powerful the panel should be? 

English is not my native language so I hope i phrased the questions correctly. Any information would be helpful, thank you.

Edit: the solar panel is a set which comes with a charging controller(not sure if this is the cerrect term).

44,Measuring Young's Modulus from Linear Stress-Strain Regime in Pre-Stressed Material?,1493664018,"TL;DR:
The basic questions:

1. If my medium is pre-stressed (so it's at equilibrium, but there is some compressive stress energy), then would I get stress-strain figures as the SS_0.pngs depict? (Note that SS_1, for a less-connected medium but with the same force applied (though actually

2. If my medium is pre-stressed, so that I get these stress strain curves, can I 'fix' them (i.e. transform them so they are linear) by simply: obtaining the average compressive/tensile stress over the points used to measure average displacement adding that stress to the applied stress (depicted in the curve)?

3. I am only accounting for the applied forces as they are applied to each particle in generating the stress-strain curve, not accounting for the applied force per particle.  Should I be doing this also?

Images (Stress-Strain and Medium):
http://imgur.com/a/BNtxv



I am looking to make multiple random realizations/instances/samples of a medium formed by points (3D) linked together. 


I sample point positions uniformly in 3D constrained to [0,1]^3.  I center the points so that the bounding box is [-0.5,0.5].

I make a random network by linking particles within some distance, and simulating to equilibrium.  I then apply a force to boundary particles, and measure the average displacement at either end over some number of particles to get a displacement.

I apply each force on particles within 20% of the extremal x-coordinates (of the bounding box) for 100 time steps.
I measure the mean position of particles within 20-40% of the extremal x-coordinates (of the bounding box).  I use these two positions to measure the change in length of the medium for each forcing after I time-step so that the system settles to equilibrium (sort of a Cauchy convergence criterion, which is satisfied after about 4000 time steps, but controlled by a tolerance). 

Some of the measured Young's Moduli are non-positive.  It may be that the medium I'm simulating is pre-stressed, as some linked interior nodes may be in a state of compression, even after the equilibrium state is achieved. 
 

I've attached some figures to better convey a depiction of the physical system (2D cross-section) and the nonlinear Stress-Strain relationship I see.  I want positive Young's Moduli

53,Can anyone that graduates high school be a engineer? (Anti-intellectualism),1493599161,"I'm asking because of a thread in shower thoughts that said that the only time they used  algebra in their life was to help their child with their homework and this got them into a lot of heat. The sentiment was that it was anti-intellectual and many cited they were engineers that utilize algreba and more advanced mathmatics.

From my understanding though is that not every one has the attributes to be a advanced engineer so it makes sense for someone to question learning certain levels of mathematics. 

I belive it takes not a better or worse cognitive type but a different one to excel as a engineer so having different tracks where some pursue that and others don't and in between would not degrade advanced mathematics.

So say you have a building that is 28 foot wide but 35 foot long. Then you had a wall running down the center of the building. So your spans on either side would be just over 14 foot.

So the building is 28 wide but the wall is running long ways over the 35 foot length of the building. So when that diagram says building width does it assume your wall is running a specific direction? Surely it matters what direction the wall is going right?

**The goal of the teams** - is to pump the required amount of water per day, in the most efficient way possible.


**My goal is to have a fair way to compare this example scenario:**
*note that there is no option to pump more units per hour than stated*

**Team A**

* needs to pump 10 units of water over a time of 5 hours (or 2 units per hour)
* has a water supply constraint of 1.5 units per hour
* *this means the minimum amount of time to pump 10 units will be 6.7 hours*
* the team actually took 10 hours to pump 10 units

**Team B**

* needs to pump 18.75 units of water over a time of 15 hours (or 1.25 units per hour)
* has no water supply constraint 
* *this means the minimum amount of time to pump 18.75 units will be 15 hours*
* the team actually took 30 hours to pump 18.75 units

On the left the circuit is connected to the center, while on the right they are connected to the outside of the design, so they are probably slightly different from one another.

Between the top and bottom on each side is a small piece of copper (probably) that is connected to a wire.  There are a total of 4 of these that should be visible in the image.  Presumably each window panel/design is for each of the two headphones.

98,Students: Need help picking your engineering major? Read this first.,1493406168,"##**Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/workexperience#wiki_work_experience

&gt; Every year, AskEngineers has a thread where working engineers from major disciplines can contribute their professional work experiences. The purpose of this is to give students, young engineers, and engineers from other industries an idea of what engineers actually do at work. It will hopefully give readers some info that can help them navigate their career a little better, or simply be educational and informative.

There's been a recent influx of high school students and other prospective college students asking what engineering major they should choose, or wondering what engineers actually do at their jobs. The AskEngineers work experience posts linked above was created to address these questions. These *""what major should I choose?""* threads are not allowed according to our [submission guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_questions) due to the high number we get every year. Our users have complained in the past that these threads become very spammy and take over subreddit traffic.

That said, I haven't locked any of the ones posted so far as they are technically allowed if you follow the guidance below.

###tl;dr BEFORE posting about how to choose your college major:

1. Ideally, you should have already made your decision on which major to choose (or at least narrowed it down) based on info in our [**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/workexperience#wiki_work_experience) page... so if you haven't done any reading yet, please do so before posting.

1. Come up with followup questions about the specific engineering discipline you're interested in and include them in your post. Some examples of relevant followup questions:
  * *what's the job outlook for this field?*
  * *are there any jobs in this field that allows frequent travel?*
  * *what's the work-life balance like for a typical job in this field?*

1. Finally, use the search function and look for past threads asking the same question. Many of the questions you have may have been answered in the past.

**Occasionally check back on your thread for new comments so that you can answer followup questions and provide more info.** The more information you provide, the more our users can help you. Here's an example of a recent thread that was well taken care of by its OP: **https://redd.it/5vqwxu**

###'Clarificaton' posts are OK

The most common of these is probably *""what's the difference between Computer, Software, and Electronics engineering?""*. I realize that not every engineering discipline is in the FAQ and that some of the entries aren't very comprehensive, so if the discipline you're asking about isn't adequately covered, feel free to make a post with your questions about it.",AskEngineers,dangersandwich,/r/AskEngineers/comments/684oww/students_need_help_picking_your_engineering_major/

I got a job in a small civil engineering firm where I am the only female engineer. I worked there for about 5 months now. In beginning my trainor would say good morning to me and talk to me when I get a chance. However, my trainor always talk down to me because I don't know how to do certain things in Auto-CAD. I told him in a calm and nice way, a month into my job that it does bother me because I really want to learn but you are always irritated at me. He (29M) was receptive and stopped raising his voice at me.
Fast forward now, he just walked past my desk without saying good morning to me. However, he would say sup to the other male co-worker who sit across from me. The other male co-worker also say good morning to others except for me. However, both would say goodbye to me when they leave. Also they would chit chat to other people in the company like HR, admin, and other male co-workers except for me. They would talk all day without including me in the conversation when we sit in the same room. I know I am quiet at times but I would ask them about their weekend or day. However, I don't get that reciprocate. When I got back to work after being sick, they never ask me how am I feeling or anything.
I am not calling them sexism. However, I do feel excluded and unwelcome them. On top of that my boss is always criticizing my drafting skills eventho he knows I have no experience except for college.

[This is an article in a Swedish newspaper](https://www.svd.se/svensk-anmarkte-pa-trafikljus-i-usa--botfalldes/om/varlden) about a Swedish engineer who lives and works in Oregon. He was fined for contacting the Professional Engineers of Oregon *suggesting* an alteration to a traffic light. He was fined 500 bucks for sending an email with calculations suggesting how the traffic light could be switched to yellow based on speed of the approaching vehicle (my guess, articles doesn't say exactly how his algorithm works). He signed his email with his occupational title but that doesn't appear to be the reason for his fine, instead he has ""practiced engineering without being a licensed engineer"". What about freedom of speech? Fining someone for doing some calculations and producing an algorithm is like a ""thought gag order"".

49,Can a nut at the bolt thread runout (threaded/smooth transition) support load?,1493253871,"[Image here for clarity](http://imgur.com/a/GjjNC)

I am adding mounting points to an OEM car roof rack ( [Honda HRV with rails/crossbars](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31lfGAA8E5L._SX355_.jpg) ) so that I can use ratcheting straps to secure a non-OEM car top carrier. To do this, I am adding a steel U-bolt to each side of each crossbar, 4 total, and securing them with a U-bolt-plate above and below the crossbar (8 total). The threaded section of the bolt points down, and the rounded portion accepts the S-hooks from the straps.

The crossbars are 2.5"" wide so I am limited to using U-bolts with inner width &gt;2.5"", the only reasonable ones I found were 3/8""(thick) x 3""(W) x 4.5""(L). Although these are perfect width wise, they are a bit big vertically, in that if the top plate is limited by the curved section, the threads end before the bottom plate can squeeze the crossbar. My options are to use spacers above the lower bolt, to raise the top plate above the end of the threads (current plan is to use over-sized nuts or nylon spacers), or:

**limit the top plate of the U-bolt by threading a nut to the runout, making a: shank/nut/plate/crossbar/plate/nut/thread sandwich** [(orange circle in the image)](http://imgur.com/a/GjjNC)

In execution, this solution is better for a few reasons, as long as it won't catastrophically fail on the highway ;). I believe, since the tension load from the straps will be primarily upward, this top nut is not support much load, just the clamping force on the crossbar, and the bottom plate is holding most of the tension from the straps. Is this a safe assembly?

61,How do I use VLE curves to find suitable T and P for removing chloroform and ethanol from water?,1493229114,"Hi everyone,


I'm an engineer associate at a small biotech company and at the moment, I'm tasked with finding a method in removing chloroform and ethanol (organic solvent) from a solution through a thin-film evaporator for pilot scale production. Mole-wise, the solution itself contains nearly 95% water,1.5% ethanol and 3.5% chloroform. I'm trying to retain the maximum amount of water while stripping out most, if not, all of the organic solvents if possible.


Sadly, I can't simply heat the solution to high temperatures due to a protein suspension in the solution and instead, I was looking into vacuum distillation.  I tried using the vle-calculator that I found online (link below), but I'm not sure how to read the vapor pressure map that it provides for ternary systems. I understand that the x-components (liquid) are all equal to 1 and y-components (vapor) are the same as well due to Raoult's law, but I'm not sure how I would find the suitable pressure near vacuum for the process.

64,% Stretch on O-RING,1493220364,"Hello fellow engineers. I'm running into a bit of a circumstance today at work. This question's directed towards any of you who have any knowledge regarding o-rings.

Rule of thumb: The stretch should be between 1%-5% with 2% as the ideal in most applications. A stretch greater than 5% is not recommended. The resulting stress on the O-ring will cause accelerated aging and cross section reduction.

My problem is to provide an effective seal, the O-ring’s I.D. (10.919 worst case) must be smaller than the groove diameter (11.576 worst case), so that the O-ring is slightly stretched, fitting snugly in the groove. Theoretically, the %stretch would be around 5.7% from the numbers above. Would this be consider acceptable in an engineering standpoint?  I have actually called several manufacturers/suppliers, they said it wouldn’t affect the integrity of the material (EPDM) at all.

I'm not too familiar how powerbanks work exactly so I would appreciate if someone can double check my calculations and see if I didn't make any mistakes.

The powerbank I'm looking at is this: https://www.qi-infinity.com/products/35k-mah-surface-pro-charger, which boasts a capacity of 35,000mAh.

The Surface Pro 4 has a battery capacity of 5087mAh.

I initially thought I could just divide the powerbank size by the Surface pro 4 battery and get the max amount of theoretical charges, but later found out that the powerbanks were made from lithium ion cells which charge at 3.7V.

The powerbank has some internal circuity to boost the 3.7V cells to a 12V DC output which is an acceptable voltage to feed into my Surface Pro 4 to charge it. However, that would mean the maximum capacity it can supply my Surface Pro 4 battery would be (35000*3.7)/12 = 10800ish mAh and that doesn't even count conversion losses.

So I would only get a maximum of 2 full charges out of this powerbank. Am I missing something here?

* 2. What are job prospects like for electrical engineers? I've heard that there's going to be a glut of engineers in general over the next few years, is that likely? 
* 3. What kind of leadership roles exist for electrical engineers? I don't think I would like to be stuck doing design work or technical stuff for the rest of my career, so what would career progression look like? 

These are all the questions I can think of right now, thank you guys for your time.

So, I was searching for desing considerations for my railgun proyect and stepped into the rail material problem, copper rails tend to deform and vaporize with the amound of energy thats transfered through them. My second thought would be tungsten, but I lack the knowledge to tell if they would be conductive enough for a railgun. After some thinking I came up with a sort of solution, copper coat the tungsten plates or get multiple conection points for the energy. 
Another thought was water-cooling the rails (copper hollow square rails), like computers, using a non conductive mix with a radiator and a pump. But I still wouldn't know if such mix exists and if such high currents would still fry any kind of electronics conected indirectly to the cooling sistem.
What would you consider a viable method to make durable railgun rails? Can I improve any of my theorical rail systems?

88,How would I map a small 2d field with moveable tags?,1493127298,"As you can tell by the title I am not an engineer ;-)

A board game that I really love is popular in the tournament scene. It is a cross between NFL, chess, and Lord of the Rings. People are starting to live stream some of these games but there is a big problem. You need an overhead camera to display the entire field of play (about 50cm x 75cm) so that viewers can see where the pieces are. However the pieces (which are miniatures that people paint themselves) can be hard to see. An added complication is that the pieces are given upgrades. Usually these are represented by plastic rings or rubber bands put around the miniature. These can also be hars to see. This makes it difficult for viewers to follow and that means that they stop watching.

So I had an idea, like in chess, of showing the audience a computer map of the game so they can follow what is happening. This could be done manually but that can be quite a challenge. So my idea was to tag each of the pieces somehow and then have something scan for those tags and automatically display it on the computer.

Thing is I have no idea how to go about it. I would need each tag to be independently identifiable (so the computer can assign attributes to it like what piece it is). It would also need to have a resolution of fitting in a 3cm x 3cm grid from a distance of 50cm above the board.

Any suggestions for my pointless hobby would be super appreciated. And please nothing too expensive (&lt; $1000).

89,How to handle salary and expectations for Civil Engineering jobs in MA or NY?,1493127057,"Please let me know if the following is better suited for a ""Career Wednesday"" thread. I just want to get the best feedback possible on my situation.

So I am currently looking for work and have quite an odd combination of credentials that make it hard for me to gauge what I should be expecting or asking for in terms of salary at engineering firms. Here are the key points:

 - I have a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from a US institution
 - I am an E.I.T.
 - I do **NOT** have a P.E.
 - I have **zero** work experience in industry. I went for my PhD directly from undergrad.
 - I am currently on the faculty at a college teaching CE courses, making the monthly equivalent of $72,000/yr (only get paid for 10 months). I've been there for 1 year.

I am not even really sure of what I should be going for in terms of job opportunities. I strongly want to get into industry positions, as academia is just a temporary landing place at the moment. But while I would consider taking an entry-level position given my lack of experience, I feel that most companies would find me to be an odd applicant, given my advanced degree. However, I also feel like I am highly likely to get turned down for anything above entry-level work since I don't have any previous experience on these types of projects.

And now that I am finally having some interviews, the question of salary is coming up, and I don't really know how to answer. I feel that I am worth more than a traditional entry-level candidate, and obviously would like to see an increase coming from my current position, but I also feel weird asking for higher-level salaries without any experience.

If anyone has any advice for types of jobs that I should be focusing on given my frankly weird resume, it would be greatly appreciated. Also, should I temper my salary expectations compared to what I am getting now, or how would you value someone with my experience level?

Yamaha XT500(G) 1980 rear fork swing arm pivot has a thrust bearing and needle roller bearing each side.    
Rotation is limited to a few degrees by the suspension. Impact is somewhat absorbed by the tire and suspension. There are lateral rotation forces from the sprocket offset to the one side and the brake drum on the other.    
Questions:
Could I replace both the thrust and needle bearing with one oil filled nylon (the green dyed nylon - not sure of the specific name) )bush?

I'm thinking 12"" x 12""x 1/4"" or 1/2"" if needed. What would the best plastic type be for this application? Let's say a 4,000/lb vehicle ÷ 4... So each sheet should be ok for 1,000 lbs. I would need some tensile strength, but I won't be on completely soft ground so it won't flex a whole lot, but on hardpack gravel or packed dirt it will flex some. I'm thinking something that has good strength for loads with a small point. If you look at images of standard jack stands you will see that the base of them have 4 points of thin, right angle steel. I don't know if this would contribute to a catastrophic failure of plastic by having such load on small points. Lightweight would be nice but is behind safety. There are various companies that offer plastic jack stand plates for sale, but do not specify the plastic type. They're also quite expensive. More so than buying a sheet and cutting it myself would be, I imagine. I was considering nylon or hdpe.

54,Energy last through an open door,1492795674,"I want to work out how much energy is lost when our disabled access doors are opened in order to justify restricting access to them.

Typically, used robots cost half as much as new robots.""

My question is if I have a small vessel but a comparatively large displacement, then I would have to get a significantly larger engine because the propeller and gearbox would not be correctly specified for the application. The variation outboard manufacturers offer is quite small so they would just recommend a larger engine when in fact, a small engine with the correct propeller running at a lower RPM would suffice. 

Is there a gap in the market for a small outboard engine, perhaps diesel, that uses a large propeller running slower which would be used on large displacement vessels?

70,Practical nonlinear control theory?,1492722151,"Hi,

Some background. When I went to university, they stuck to classical control systems. Since then I've taught myself as much as I can about modern, state space control systems. But I have some concerns. 

Last time, I made some progress between my copy of Nise's control book, based on some background in my AEM book which covers systems of differential equations and phase diagrams. Unfortunately that was a bit dry for me, so I stopped for a while. The latest push. I found [Steve Burton's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi7l8mMjYVE) video series and consumed the entirety. I feel like I have a good grasp of both linear systems and nonlinear systems which are linearized around an operating point.

From a practical perspective, the series doesn't cover nonlinear systems which are not linearized about an operating point. For that, I did some more searching and found the [Control of Mobile Robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSwCMK96NOw) lectures and watched those too. The problem is, it's proved during [lecture 3.3](https://youtu.be/_0TLenjWZ6k?t=726) that it's basically impossible to linearize the system, because then you lose control over some state. 

Without fully understanding the field, my next inclination is... why not just, instead of using a static state-transition matrix, use a lambda A that is calculated based on the current state? That is to say, A = A(x, params), which would allow you to simulate and reason about the current state of the system. My understanding is that the problem with this is that most of the control laws and observations that you would be able to use (controllability, observability, etc) are not valid for functionally defined models (or are there extensions that I don't know about yet?) 

So what do people do in practice? The end goal is to fully understand papers on generating and simulating humanoid robotic models. I just can't see how to get to a system that we know is nonlinear AND is designed to operate outside of an operating point, and still be able to make use of the rest of the control theory that's out there. Any advice would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
-Alex

I'm having trouble at my current job defining what I should be using as my 'lower limit' for statistical analysis and to determine allowable error in sampling. The trouble is, 3900 psi is our statistical lower limit, we start to negatively adjust the pay when more than 10% of the contractors product falls below this limit. Therefore I said that in order to meet this limit the mean of the contractor must be:

Lower limit = 3900 psi - Z * standard deviation (where z =-1.28155 at 10%)

Therefore, Lower limit = 3900 psi + 1.28155 * standard deviation

There has been some debate at work whether I should just use 3900 psi for the lower mean limit. My reasoning is the alpha is the risk to the contractor, and that risk kicks in as soon as the error is large enough that it affects their pay?

The 'engineering limit' is 2900 psi, which I am using for my mean value for my beta calculation.

I served in the US Navy for over 10 years as a nuclear machinist mate.  So I was basically a steam plant operator and maintenance technician.  Because I was on a sub I did get exposed to quite a bit of reactor plant maintenance as well.  Held a variety of training and planning jobs and worked with civilian shipyard workers in some of the planning phases.  Participated in a nuclear defueling operation.  My last few years I worked as a Quality Assurance Supervisor at a non-nuclear maintenance center.  I became a senior auditor and qualified as an ISO lead auditor as well.  I also became the QA shop lead and the AQAO (Assistant Quality Assurance Officer).  I was the supervisor for over 30 QA inspectors for about 18 months.  During this time I completed a Bachelor’s of Science in Nuclear Engineering Technologies from Excelsior College (All online, ABET accredited).

I separated from the Navy and moved back to Colorado and now attend Colorado State University pursing a Civil Engineering bachelor’s degree.  Despite not having to do any general education credits I will still have to attend for 8 semesters as many of the core engineering classes are not offered over summers.  I am currently finishing my second semester of my ‘freshman’ year.  I am a junior by University credit standards and am taking 100 and 200 level engineering courses.  If I arrange my schedule in a certain way I could start my senior design course my junior year and graduate 1 semester early.  I am using my GI bill and financially cannot afford to be a part time student.  I either have to be a full time student or work full time.  My GI bill will cover 4 spring and 4 fall semesters so this works out.  I have a paid summer internship lined up for this summer with a civil/geotechnical engineering firm that specializes in infrastructure and they have mentioned that if their opinion of me does not change over the internship they would like to hire me as a project engineer when I graduate.  The problem is I don’t have enough credits on my degree plan to stay full time during these 8 semesters.  I can take a few extra classes that I don’t need to hit full time, that would be the easiest solution, but I would rather get some benefit out of my extra work.  So I spoke to a few advisors and faculty members and was told I could add a minor in Construction Engineering.  It will only add 6 extra classes (16 extra credit hours) to achieve this minor.  There will be no math courses added hard sciences.  It will (obviously) add more work to my academic life but I’m wondering if there is a measurable benefit to adding it.  Due to my military and work experiences I know that I would prefer to work as a Civil Engineer on job sites in the infrastructure/construction management sector (I don’t really enjoy working long periods in offices exclusively) but I still have the desire to develop experience with structural design.

So I’m wondering if anyone can provide me with some specific information on potential benefits/drawbacks of adding this minor when it comes to professional development, job opportunities, pay, etc.  

I made this on a throwaway so I could be as specific as necessary to elicit accurate responses but avoided some details.  If you want to PM me to get more specifics please do.

Quantify the maximum possible flow rate using a given pump, and piping system

Basically, there is a batch process which requires the filling of a tank with water, which, given the current set-up, takes around 40 minutes. The pipe from the water supply tank to the target tank is rather thin (about 30mm ID), and it runs around the outside wall of the plant, and has many 90 degree elbows.
It would be a relatively easy task of changing the pipe so that it has a greater ID, less elbows, and less distance (about half of the current) from supply to source, but I need to quantify what the new maximum flow rate would be (and therefore, the new time it would take to fill the tank), in order to justify the change. 

I'm running into difficulties with calculating the flow rate given the following parameters:

-(all pump specs supplied by the manufacturers - head etc)

-Pipe material

-Pipe length

-No. elbows

-Pipe diameter

-Pipe elevation

First, is it even possible to do so? 
What would be the best approach? I assume I would need a few different formulas, including Darcy–Weisbach etc.
How would I choose the optimal pipe diameter?

Or am I best to model the problem using some engineering software? I have access to unisim - but my first attempts at modelling this problem were unsuccessful - I can't get the pump to calculate a flow rate (it seems I need to define it myself).
What information is needed to calculate a flow rate for the given pump/system??",AskEngineers,CaptainQueero,/r/AskEngineers/comments/66e0o0/pipe_flow_problem_help/

97,Biomedical vs. consultancy after degree in mech. eng.,1492623622,"Hi people,

I have quite a peculiar situation in my backyard. A little bit of background - I am finishing my Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering, and after a year (year in the industry) of an internship within a big corporation, they offered me a job. It is an interesting workplace, but it is more of a consultancy type work and is more business oriented. 


Considering that it is a safe bet, that is something I would have taken on, but I was contacted recently by a professor that I worked on several ocassions within the company (he is something like an advisor), and he suggested that I continue my studies on the Uni he teaches on, specifically Biomedical Engineering. Up to that point, I was simply aware of that field, but after a few conversations with him and a ton of google searches, I am completely lost. It is an interesting offer (paid masters + phd), but from a real world perspective I really cannot put my finger on it. 

I hope from you all to provide me with some perspective. Is biomedical engineering as glamorous as he presents it? Is it really true that I will be able to build on parts of my education that I really enjoyed (fluid mechanics, thermodynamics) or is it going to be completely different?

I am a young engineer working in one of the big 3 US aerospace defense companies as a mechanical design engineer. In school I always though working in design/development would be much more exciting than working on the industrial/manufacturing side. My experience in the design side so far has been far from exciting and is extremely slow and segregated. I rarely get out of my cubicle and talk with people. I am looking to switch jobs/companies and am starting to look a little more towards manufacturing jobs because I feel as if those roles could be more diverse and you’d be less likely to get pigeonholed and generally have more opportunities in your career. My question is what do people see as the pros and cons to working on the manufacturing side vs. more of the design side? Do you see different personality types in each? Do both sides offer similar kinds of challenges? Thank you very much for your helpful insight!

a quick summary of what our company is about, we are an aggrotech company, producing veggies and selling containers to the market, the container is the farm itself, ( controlled environment, hydroponics farming etc..) the containers are imported from the US, 
the each container has an AC unit, dehumidifier, co2 generator, water pumps, and a couple other equipment allowing farmers to control and monitor their farm remotely. 
the problem we are facing is, with the power supply, each container consumes 100kwh per day, at 60 amps using either 120/240 V on a single phase, or 120/208 V on a 3 phase connection with a 60 Hz frequency (if we change the AC unit to locally purchased unit the frequency wouldn't be a problem). In Dubai, electricity supply is 50 Hz frequency. 
I had many electricians coming to the farm, but none of them know exactly how to connect the container to the power supply, we tried connecting it on a single phase, but the container does not power up

I have never built an RC plane, however, I have done some work with robotics. I figure that I would construct the thrust system similarly to how the fellow in the video did, however moving the air intake to the nose of the plane and thruster to the tail (as seen on MIG 19s).
I figure that I would use an Arduino UNO as a type of brain for this plane, however, I don't know how I would communicate from a controller to the Arduino itself. I have never worked with radio signals and stuff, my expertise is with wifi control and such, which I would like to move away from, as radio is less expensive and better at long range, which is obviously better for this project.

I have a question regarding rear cargo carriers for my trailer hitch. I'm planning on hauling a 100 + lb cooler on the back of my Subaru Forester this weekend. I bought a 500 lb carrier but realized that the weak link isn't the carrier itself but my hitch. The stock hitch has a tongue rating of 175 lbs but from what I've read up it is actually less due to the leverage of the weight sticking out behind the car. I came up with the idea of using some ratchet straps linked to the roof bars to take some the weight off the hitch. I snapped a picture linked below. Is this safe?

50,Question about employment.,1492429297,"Hi /r/askengineers.  I'm not sure this is the correct sub for this.  Sorry if that is the case.  

Some context:

I'm an Air Force veteran with a background in PMEL (Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory).  It's calibration of electronics.  I specialized in RF/Microwave measurements and ended up needing to reference schematics and do some low level circuit design for test fixtures.  

About a year ago I was hired at a small company to do the same thing.  This time, I ended up needing to develop calibration procedures for our use (usually based on methods already used in the industry).  

About 3 months ago they offered me an open-ended promotion with a small raise and moved me to production/manufacturing.  They told me to ""make up a job title"" which I was not comfortable doing and ended up with the title of production quality control.  

Fast forward to now.  I'm needing to come up with ESD/EMI infrastructure, write all of our manufacturing and test procedures, do QA all on multiple product lines.  

Question:

When I search my job description (s) all of the related duties fall under engineering level jobs.  Now, I don't have an engineering degree so I understand why I wouldn't be called an engineer nor be paid like one.  The problem is, I'm not anywhere close to where I should be paid (in my humble opinion).  I'm talking ~25-30k short of what an engineer is paid to do what I'm doing according to ASQ and sites like Glassdoor.  Is this standard?  If not how do I approach my boss about this?

So far, I've made two designs, one being a tube and one being corrugated. I designed the tube using Matlab and equations for beams, and I designed the corrugated bar using Solidworks and simulation after getting a rough idea of what the bar would need.

Also, what would be the best way to go about designing objects with more complex geometry?

1,What type of combination valve (if applicable) do I need for disc/disc hydraulic split-system brakes?,1492186116,"Hi everyone, I am designing a braking system for the SAE Baja competition, a collegiate design competition for off-road vehicles.
Specifically, my design is for a split-system (independent front and rear circuits, each having its own master cylinder). Both the front and rear brakes use discs. The master cylinders will be mounted below the fire wall, so I know I will at least need a 2lb residual valve for the front. According to my calculations, a proportioning valve will be needed to ensure the FRONT brakes lock-up before the REAR brakes in panic-stop situations. I should also note that a hand brake will be tied into the rear circuit.
Do I need a 2 lb residual pressure valve for the rear?
Is there a combination valve that can do everything I need, or do I need to buy individual components? (front residual valve, rear proportioning valve, possible rear residual valve?)
If I can't use a combination valve, how will the rear circuit be arranged? (Rear master cylinder connected to proportioning valve thru stiff, stainless steel line =&gt; hand brake connected to rear circuit by braided-line thru t-junction, downstream of proportioning valve =&gt; hand brake/foot brake junction connected to 2 lb residual valve (if needed) =&gt; from 2 lb residual valve, another t-junction to split left and right brake lines which feed to each caliper by way of braided brake lines)

Additional information:
Using standard OEM parts for the Polaris RZR 900
All components will use 3/8"" thread for brake lines

EDIT: I meant to say I need the front brakes to lock up before the rear ones with regards to the proportioning valve. Also, i hadn't realized before, but the hand brake will be plumbed into the rear circuit, not joined to it by a t-fitting

I am looking for some software recommendations used in engineering firms to record employee project hours, and create project databases.

This same program can create new project ID numbers, update client information, determine if the project is lump sum or T&amp;M, associate the project with PO's and issued invoices, and also has the ability to print out cost reports of the entire project.

The Access program we are using is full of bugs and is always giving our IT guys a ton of issues.  Since all of our data is stored on this database, and the constant issues we see, we are forced to back up the information a couple times a day (not saying that the system crashes that often), but when it does, everyone freaks out because this program houses ALL project information relative to costs and employee billing hours.  

We create project folders for engineering content on the server (drawings, reference documents, calculations etc.), completely separate from the Access software, so we at least have some type of distance from it.

For charged vehicles (turbocharged or supercharged) an intercooler is included after the charger to lower the intake temperature. I understand the reason for this is to increase the density of air in the fuel/air mixture in the combustion chamber for better quality combustion.

However in a gas turbine, after the compression stages, as I understand it the air enters the combustion chamber immediately and ignited along with fuel.

Question is, why is there no cooling stage of sorts for a gas turbine? Is it because of mechanical complexity of cooling the air before entering the combustion chamber? Or something else?

As I said in the title I'm 28 years old, I hold a BSBA in Finance and I’ve been working in corporate finance for 5 years. I’m becoming more and more certain that this career path is not for me and after some soul searching I’m seriously considering a switch to civil engineering.

I know I will most likely have to get some additional schooling but want to avoid going for another degree right now. 

Any advice on some alternatives that would help me land an entry level job (or even an internship if it comes down to it)? I’m looking for certificate programs, classes on CAD drafting/design, etc; anything that would be an attractive alternative to a degree in engineering to an employer.

Thanks in advance

Problem is that last I checked we're almost at the Shannon information theory limits for bandwidth given the physical constraints involved so I doubt this ""free upgrade"" is going to be physically possible.

But something just occurred to me, I just don't know enough about transmission lines to know if it would help or make things worse. What happens if you connect up multiple wires in parallel to effectively increase the diameter of the wire?

This neighborhood was wired up in a rather stupid manner when it was built. Features include:

- wire gauge thinner than traditional POTS wiring, probably as a cost saving measure (I hope some asshole enjoyed his promotion while it lasted)
- cable is a little over 2 miles long between demark and telco pedestal
- they seem to have run significantly more than the usual number of copper pairs between houses and the pedestal. I think it's something ridiculous like 8 pairs per house.

Only thing I can figure is that someone thought that inverse muxed ISDN BRI lines would be the wave of the future thus everyone would want to have lots of ""bonded"" BRI lines or something. Ridiculous.

Anyway, so the question is, since there are are an excessive number of extra lines in the cabling that will never get used for anything, is it possible to connect multiple lines together in parallel to create a thicker line and reduce the SNR to support higher bandwidth? Or does this cause some weird transmission line effect that makes things worse?",AskEngineers,NeoMarxismIsEvil,/r/AskEngineers/comments/653tls/dslrelated_transmission_line_question_is_it/

59,Need help with scaling a cold drip coffee setup?,1491986903,"Hi guys,

Im am attempting to scale up a cold brew coffee machine to be able to produce larger amount of coffee that the small commercially available cold drip rigs.

For those that don't know what cold drip coffee is, its cold water dripped over a 8-12 hour timeframe that extracts a smoother tasting black coffee that has a similar caffeine content to espresso.

One of the benefits of cold drip is the column aspect which act in a similar way to chromatography columns whereby the heavier molecules take longer to pass through than the smaller molecules thus extracting with a unique flavour profile.

Example below.
Example of cold drip - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8pNmYrAYZI
Small scale that we are using - http://clean-machine.com.au/Yama-25-Cup-124oz-Cold-Drip-Coffee-Maker-Brown-Wood-Frame.html

In my experiments so far I crudely attempted to scale to a 20L tall keg (below) with the top cut off and a 3/4"" fitting on the bottom. 
http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/NNMAAOSwfcVUKVgY/s-l300.jpg

The 20l keg held about 6kg of ground coffee which would in theory make around 51L of coffee (59L input with 8 held in coffee) with the ratio/flavour profile we like on the smaller machines

I used a peristaltic pump to deliver the water at the required drip rate to deliver uniformly 59L over 10 hours.

I found within the first hour that the water was not passing through at a fast enough rate and that I had to stop it multiple time to let the water pass. After a couple of hours I stop completely as it seemed like it was failing. Some liquid passed through but upon throwing out the contense of the keg it showed that the water had found the path of least resistance and flowed past most of the dry coffee (what we call channeling)

Sorry for the long back story but I felt it necessary for my question

The questions if have are:

1) It appeared to me that the pressure or weight of the water (or the gas trying to go up) was preventing the water to pass / or compacting the coffee to make the flow rate slower. Is their a any knowledge here about how substances take on moisture, and what Surface Area / volume ratios are best suited for stead absorption. Maybe some water irrigation science could be applied here.

2) Are there any formulas I can apply to scaling up from the small scale test that will aid me scaling up. Ie. how does SA:V ratio effect the flow rates and channeling

3) Are there any procedures that I can use to stop the coffee from finding the path of least resistance. Maybe moisten the coffee before hand? Im not sure.

Thanks

66,"Any engineers in Canada, looking for advice on getting a job (recent graduate, no coop experience)?",1491950943,"Anyone in Canada with a degree in aerospace engineering have advice on job searching? I have graduated last June and I have only been to 3 interview tops. OSAP will be calling soon and its been far to long since I got any call back. I wanted to gain some Canadian experience for the P.ENG designation before I even tried to do a masters (since my overall cpga suffered due to family issues and an injury, took me 6 years instead of 4 years to graduate, thus hoping job experience would outweigh cpga), but no luck. Currently I am doing odd tutoring jobs and I have signed up for a CCNA certification course based on advice from a family friend. I would really want to work in a job in my field though. I have academic experience in C++, ANSYS, Matlab, CAD and I have been dabbling into Linux on ARM architecture and virtual machine to play with openfoam and such. I would like to end up working in aerodynamics, fluid mechanics/astromechanics (such as relativistic mhd), satelite design/payload design (i was designing a payload for my 4th year project) or something related to robotics/ai or computers since I love computers as well. I know wanting to do something is all talk but I need to get into the industry somehow and frankly I don't know which jobs specifically I should apply for?

67,Weld Strength Calculation?,1491938764,"How would I calculate the weld strength on this fillet shown here? 
http://imgur.com/6YIA1CK I'm taking stress = F/A so my force full tensile force of 12kN travels through the cross sectional area (8mmx length of weld). The stress is the yeild of the filler metal with a factor of safety applied. Also a weld efficiency of say 85% applied to the stress as well.

If this is right then is the material thickness pretty much irrelevant when looking at weld strength? Am I right in my assumptions here? The second weld which is a V Butt is simply the thickness of the weld with a joint efficiency applied?

70,Liability Questions,1491936807,"My city, Cincinnati, is enacting new inspection requirements for fire escapes.  By July of this year, all fire escapes must be inspected by a PE and then every 5 years thereafter.  I'm fully employed in an unrelated business, but I'm considering offering my services (through a community organization) to help manage the costs for low-income homeowners with fire escapes.  The idea is that I'd just charge a minimal fee to inspect and put together the required report.  In theory, I'll be doing this for the next few months and then [perhaps] again in 5 years.  I have no intent to be going into business on my own.

What are my options for limiting liability?  Is it possible to include some boilerplate language in each report that would protect me or do I absolutely need insurance?  If I need insurance, does it need to cover me for 5 years until the report has expired by law - or just for the period during which I'm stamping reports?

86,How to accurately dose Liquid Nitrogen for beverage cans (DIY)?,1491867796,"This question is for sure going to raise various concerns, but I'm hopeful there is a solution. 


I own a beverage company. We're looking to get into nitrogen infused beverages (in cans). The way you do that: dose a small amount of liquid nitrogen into the can before you seam the lid. 


The problem: the equipment to do this is expensive ($20K) and we're a two person startup trying to bootstrap it. So, to set the parameters of this problem, lets hypothetically say we have no access to such a machine and no money (which really isn't that hypothetical). Is there a easy/cheap way to dose small amounts of liquid nitrogen? We can't afford to invest thousands into a product until we have fully validated it. On top of that, it's very beneficial for us to stay local for manufacturing so we're eligible to get into stores with local supplier programs like Wholefoods (hence why going with an out-of-state small contract packager with the LN2 Dosing equipment is not really an option right now). 


This is currently our *last* barrier to entry preventing us launching our new drinks. I firmly believe there's always another way, one that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. We don't need speed (we'll be manually filling/seaming the cans at the early stage), just a fairly accurate result at an accessible price. Really hoping the Reddit community can collectively kick this problem in the teeth in an unconventional way!

Defending my master's thesis ""Motions of [Asymmetrical](http://imgur.com/a/UpYAZ) catamarans"". The thesis deals with the investigation of *Heave &amp; Pitch coupled motions*, in an irregular seaway. 

I approached my advisor to seek advice on what questions I might expect from other committee members. He said that he has no clue as it's something new every time. Also mentioned my work was mediocre and a lot could have been done. I got a *you're in big big trouble boy* kinda vibe.

I started with a CFD package, but the program failed to validate with published results. So this semester I started from scratch but used 2D potentially flow theory to calculate to calculate coupled Heave &amp; Pitch and Added resistance (drag) due to these motions. 

So the conclusion was, these new hulls did not perform any better compared to conventional ones, But they do have better-Added resistance compared to the conventional catamarans.
