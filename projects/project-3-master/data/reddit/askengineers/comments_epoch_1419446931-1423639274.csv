1,Jobs/careers for engineering grads with anxiety or depression?,1423626875,"Hi,

I was wondering if you could point me or someone like me in a direction that isn't easily visible to an entry level engineer.
  
My background is in civil engineering. I also have acute anxiety and symptoms of depression. I've found myself in a job in construction management. Everything is new to me, I've not prepared for a job like this. I have to constantly make decisions and communicate across several branches to ensure projects are complete. You really need to be of a certain personality to carry out this job (headstrong, thick skinned). I'm a mess. Suffice to say, I am not fitting into it well. Every phone call inspires my chest to race, and the constant stream of changing information about a project is hard for me to keep up with. My supervisor has been amazing and is always there for me, but I feel like I am not performing well. What other engineers make look natural is a bath of pain for me. I'm a sheep in wolf's clothing, and the hide is starting to peel off.
  
I was wondering if there is a place in engineering for someone with my deficiencies. Is there a job or role that someone with a background in engineering is suitable for? For example, I have considered drafting, and possibly becoming an inspector.
  
Thank you for any direction.

2,"What happens to a rocket's center of pressure as it approaches, and exceeds, Mach?",1423622469,"I am somewhat familiar with the concept of Mach Tuck, but I would like to know more based on my specific application. I plan to design a high powered model rocket capable of exceeding Mach, which concerns me about its stability at these speeds. My concern right now is that I assume the rocket's center of pressure will move away from the nose as the rocket approaches Mach. How can I counter this to maintain stability at speeds up to Mach 2? My plan right now is to design the rocket to be slightly over stable in normal conditions, in order to compensate for the drop in stability at Mach+.

3,Seeking Programming career advice from Mechanical Engineering job,1423621665,"Hi everyone,

I could really use some career advice. I have been working as an ME for about a year now, and am thinking about my future plans. I don't know what the etiquette is on this sub, but I would really appreciate your input: 

I'm currently a mechanical engineer, working at a small machinery company. I started in February 2014 after my graduation from a top engineering program (BSME) in December 2013. My GPA was very low (&lt;3.0), although I had one decent looking internship at a startup. I didn't learn much in college, but walked out with a degree, a little bit of coding experience, and basic engineering knowledge. 

My company is a mid-size manufacturing company (&gt;150 employees). As 1 of 3 of an engineering team, my duties have been substantial and have consisted of the following:

* 40% Machinery Design (Solidworks)- my designs have been implemented on a few of our most popular machines and are in numerous clients' fab plants 

* 30% Documentation (Solidworks, AutoCAD for air, SEE Electrical)- Part/assembly prints, PDM, electrical prints, air prints 


* 15% hands-on part fabrication, floor/assembly, electrical panels

* 5% coding- javascript google chart for tracking group tasks, solidworks macros using VBA, custom motor sizing calculator using Python

* 5% Engineering analysis (Solidworks simulation) + other failure calculations by hand

* 5% R&amp;D - implementing new processes, finding new programs to use, new standards to adopt, making new scripting tools

I am gaining an invaluable amount of experience in mechanical design, manufacturing processes, and electrical design. However, I know that I want to get my Master's degree in the near future, and it makes sense, with my background, to strive to do a robotics program. Additionally, I keep feeling an innate desire to do more programming, and am pretty sure that if I could go back and do college over again, I'd study EECS, with a focus on programming. 

What is the most realistic path I can take to get a programming-centric job? I have a low undergrad GPA, and a mech-heavy job. My current plan is the following: I probably will try to apply to numerous big companies at the end of this year as some form of ME-- Google, Tesla, Microsoft, etc. If I don't get any of those jobs, I will probably keep working and aim to get into a Master's program. Does this make sense? In the meantime, what should I set my sights on in the future in terms of career focus? In a perfect world, I would love to be a hardcore coder at Google, but my programming skills are NOT at that level and are pretty basic. 

Sorry for the rambling, that's what years of no writing does to a person. Thank you all for your help :)

I'll preface this with a little background information about myself; a second year undergraduate student studying Chemical Engineering at one of the 'better' universities in the UK. 

For this week I'm planning some activities to meet the above mentioned goal. 

I currently have a few ideas.

-An emulsion experiment. Forming an emulsion then adding a surfactant. Interesting but not exactly exciting enough to get young children engaged.

-Some sort of distillation experiment. Ideally an option where the feed, distillate and bottoms are colourful. 

-An experiment highlighting different fluid flow regimes, physically, using a clear pipe and some ink.

These are just vague ideas for the moment and would really appreciate some more more ideas or if anybody has some experience with this in the past.

For this week, the university will be providing funding so money is a minor consideration.

Please help me pick the hardware that I should focus my research on.**
  
__________________________________________
I am at the **very start** of building something very close to [this controller](http://shop.kids-of-all-ages.de/video/brushless-gimbal/hurricane-wheels/hurricane-wheels-brushless-gimbal-rc-interfacebox-bundle-preorder-only) device.  I am in the hardware spec phase, I guess you could say.  

I love the idea of a modular set of rotary encoders.  My main motivation for wanting to build my own is versatility.  I see the controllers that are currently available for astronomical amounts as a very specific thing.  I never really like my tools' uses to be so set in stone.  I want this research to inform other things (like a wireless follow focus that uses the same microcontroller with the same inputs as the wheels controller).  I have been thinking about it for around 10 years and I just don't think it would/should cost so much for something that only does one thing when that same hardware can be adapted to do MANY different things for different purposes.

**My ultimate goal is a user-programmable, versatile wireless pan/tilt/roll controller AND a wireless follow focus controller in one project/in one versatile box.**

Backstory:

When my dream of this stuff started, I was attempting to build a pan/tilt head that was controlled by an Arduino.  At that stage, the pan/tilt head would have looked like [this](http://www.mrmoco.com/34/) ideally.  Another photo of the [Mark Richards Moco one](http://monster-remotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SFH-30-pic.jpg)  

I wanted to be able to sit with the director and use my pan/tilt head as the Libra head has done for years (with [military-grade technology](http://procamrentals.com/wp-content/gallery/libra-head/162-6210_img.jpg)).

Now, however, the designs for pan/tilt heads have changed.  There was a German forum where the [brushless gimbal revolution](http://www.simplebgc.com/) started and it has changed my ideas (and most people's) of the design for the pan tilt head.  Stabilization, being something that the head's hardware takes care of, is one of the main benefits that has me convinced that it is superior to [this design](http://monster-remotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SFH-30-pic.jpg).  

Companies like Freefly capitalized on the craze by making their device ready for professional productions.  I was recently working on a movie where we used the [Movi](http://store.freeflysystems.com/collections/movi/products/freefly-movi-m15) a lot.  It was cool but I noticed that the operators were [using a set of joysticks](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0257/4181/products/freeflyMoVI-controller_1200x800_1024x1024.jpg?v=1405961612) on an awesome piece of gear that they had modified.  *It was cool, but I have always wanted to control a pan/tilt head with gearhead.*  And to be honest, there's no way to get the kind of precision that you'd need unless you use tweening algorithms like crazy on those joystick values.  I noticed a few instances of the cam op missing the headroom on the camera, which would have been a lot more intuitively controlled on a gearhead.  
If I could take the idea that I had been considering and modify it for current tech, I'd be able to get my pan/tilt head on the ideal device.  
____________________________________________

Anyway, being at the very start of this project, my initial research hinges on these two pieces of hardware (that I need YOUR help deciding on):


1. what high-resolution rotary encoder is in [this](http://shop.kids-of-all-ages.de/video/brushless-gimbal/hurricane-wheels/hurricane-wheels-brushless-gimbal-rc-interfacebox-bundle-preorder-only) device?  *The upper limit of my budget is around $550 for each encoder.*  It looks like my ideal encoders will be generating something like 180,000 steps per minute or 180RPM. 

2. what micro-controller should I buy if I want:


- MOST IMPORTANT: real-time, high resolution read of 4 simultaneous high resolution encoders 
- less critical read of around 8 pots or lower resolution rotary encoders (perhaps would require a multiplexer??)
- Bluetooth 4.0 communication of all values in as close to real-time  as possible into a receiver device (another arduino or a teensy 3.0??) that sends control signals to a few motor drivers

_______________________________________________

Currently, my research is learning toward the 32 bit Arduino Due for receiving the data from the encoders.  Are the pin interrupts fast enough to get real-time positional data of 4 high resolution rotary encoders or what?  Should I go with something faster?  If so, what kind of speed will I need from the pin interrupts?
____________________________________________

*Any advice at all would be much appreciated.  I have run into a brick wall because I don't want to buy hardware that is going to be obsolete or unsupported at a later date when I want better performance or specs.*  

The reason it needs to be modular is that I want the libraries that work for this device to also work for a device like [this wireless follow focus device](http://www.prestoncinema.com/products_FIZ-HU3_2014.html).  There is no reason a decent wireless follow focus should cost around $9,000 in 2015.    These devices are all doing a very similar task: transmitting rotational data wirelessly to control a motor.

Just a heads up: The motor controllers and motors are already sort of set in stone, so I don't need any advice on the motor end of this project.  

* The pan/tilt head will be [THIS one](http://www.came-tv.com/came8000-3-axis-gimbal-for-lots-of-different-size-camera-p-566.html), which receives a standard Spektrum RC signal

* The wireless follow focus will be [THIS](http://store.redrockmicro.com/microremote.html) and my device will replace the controller that is pictured, though I'll still keep the original, obviously.  

This is a problem that a community should be solving instead of a bunch of profiteers hoarding their expertise. 


I want to give this device to the community.  I am not in this for profit at all.  I just want this tool (as a filmmaker).  

While I understand the reason for closing your source, when the people who already make this stuff (and put the price into the stratosphere) pocket their IP, they do themselves a disservice.  An open source community has a way of working out the bugs and empowering people to go further than the inventor ever imagined.  It also blazes a path for future innovation.


_____________________________________________________
Edit 1 (updates):
Upon discussing it with a few manufacturers of rotary encoders, it's becoming obvious that perhaps the original Hurricane Wheels don't actually utilize absolute rotary encoders and most likely instead use incremental ones.  The latency of the absolute encoders bottom out at around 100 m/s and the latency I am pushing for is around 20-40 m/s from wheel turn to motor turn.  The incremental ones are rock solid up to around 800-1000 RPM and my needs are aroud 180 RPM.

I also have to pick an area of focus next semester and I want to try out environmental/water resources/water management.  I havnt really been exposed to this yet and I'm not allowed to apply to these types of internships through my schools website because I do not qualify as I am not an environmental engineering major.  I also havnt ruled out transportation/geotechnical/structural, but all seem fairly boring to me (definitely could be wrong because I havnt taken trans or geotech). Please dispute this if you can!

I enjoy autocad and have a minor in GIS, which is really fun.  Other classes I enjoyed were statics, fluid mechanics, earth science, and estimating seems pretty cool although I havnt taken it yet.

It's not that I'm unwilling to work, I am more than happy to do 40 hours worth of work. I just want the ability to do it on my time. I've made an agreement with my girlfriend that I'm going to give this job another two years before I make a break for something new. So with all that said, here's where I'll be at that time:

- BSME from decent school

- 1 year working in oil &amp; gas

- 2.5 years working in water purification

My current ideas consist of:

- Model engine that runs.

- Quadcopter with programmable location settings etc.

- Model rocket cabable of delivering some sort of payload (eg/ camera) and returning safely via. parachute.

Although I'm not entirely sure of my budget - I'm estimating I will have around £250 to spend over the course of the year, this must include materials as well.

I'm working on building a 6 degree of freedom flight simulator in Matlab, and at the moment am working my way through some of the examples to understand all the calculations. I have come across a problem.

50,"I'm involved with water well gravel packing - throwing rocks down a 1,500ft hole - how can I demonstrate that they fall evenly on the bottom, even though they only enter from one side?",1423477649,"Hey! [So I'll start off with a quick picture.](http://i.imgur.com/h3vf1Td.png)

Gravel packing is the process of putting gravel (3/16 inch average diameter gravel) down into a borehole. The borehole is about 1,500ft, and gets packed to 100ft above the water level, which means you put gravel between the bottom, and about 650ft from the top.

While they vary slightly, the average bolehole is 32 inches in diameter, with the casing being 22 inches in diameter. The gravel pack goes between the borehole and the casing.

Currently, the gravel (at a slow rate) falls from a chute **on one side of the borehole** and then falls a *minimum of 650ft* before going to the bottom.

I believe that 650ft of falling and bouncing around sufficiently distributes the gravel around the doughnut shaped area it needs to fill, while a partner of mine thinks that you need to have it fall from 2, or 3 chutes around the borehole to evenly distribute it.

As the gravel falls from the chute, it gains a fair bit of initial momentum perpendicular to the borehole, so it isn't being just *dropped* straight from the top as carefully as you can. 

I honestly don't know how to actually demonstrate this, beyond dropping a camera in there. Intuition tells me that stuff is bouncing around so much it's very close to even - I just don't know how to suggest/prove that.

56,Advice on what kind of experience would benefit a young engineer the most.,1423439266,"Hey guys, thanks in advance for your help.

I'm a soon to be Chemical Engineer with a great opportunity to intern for a biotech company through the summer and fall. I've been given three options and was wondering if you guys could point me in the right direction for the best use of my time while I'm over there. Eventually I would like to move into sales after some years of gaining experience. 

So I'll just go ahead and lay it out: 

1.      **Quality Control department (QC)**: Work in QC labs involve performing various biochemical/ analytical and microbiological assays/methods for proteins. The work is similar to Biochemistry/ Molecular biology/ biology research labs in the University. Assays/methods include pH, conductivity, osmolality, various HPLC methods (Reverse Phase HPLC, Size exclusion HPLC, Ion exchange HPLC etc.), SDS-PAGE analysis, Iso-electrofocussing (IEF), western blots, ELISA assays, protein concentration methods, and capillary electrophoresis etc.  
 
One important benefit by working in QC labs: One will go through GMP (Good manufacturing Practices) training which is very critical for Biotechnology/Biopharmaceutical/Pharmaceutical companies and FDA requirement. People who work in the R&amp;D departments do not get GMP training. Only in QC and Manufacturing dept. members do go through this training.
 
2.  **Manufacturing department**: In this department various size bioreactors and fermenters are run for cell culture and protein expression (which is usually referred as Up-Stream Process). Then expressed proteins are harvested and purified by different kinds of large column chromatography methods (usually referred as Down-Stream). As intern it may not be possible to get enough hands-on experience on operating bioreactors and fermenters (100L, 200L, 500L and 1000L) since it involves extensive training over a period of time. However, one can get limited experience as observer in an aseptic manufacturing environment and performing certain functions like buffer preparation, culture media preparation etc.
 
3.  **Engineering and  Validation Department**: This department performs instrument/ equipment Qualification and Calibration for Manufacturing department as well as for QC department. Currently 3 engineers (2 are PhD) are the members of this department headed by a Senior Director (who is also an engineer). They are responsible for performing IQ/OQ/PQ for many equipment/ instruments for GMP facilities (Manufacturing and QC).

So, for my goals, it looks to me like the Engineering and Validation Department would afford me the most relevant experience with handling and becoming familiar with equipment of this nature but of course I'm open to other opinions.",AskEngineers,Chem_E16,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2v8r8f/advice_on_what_kind_of_experience_would_benefit_a/

67,Stud Spacing Building Mistake?,1423415126,"For a structural engineer:  We recently purchased a home and had the good fortune of having the original building plans come with the home.  The home was built in 1992.  I was going to mount a TV on the wall and found to my surprise/disappointment/worry that the studs are 24"" O.C. instead of [16"" O.C. as are called for in the plans](http://i.imgur.com/DzjYInk.jpg).  

It could be that I am reading the plans wrong, but I read that it says ""2x4  @ 16"" OC.""  I could think of two reasons why the studs are at 24"" O.C:  a) to save money and time by a cheap builder or b) a mistake because it also says in the wall details something about sheathing being 24"" O.C. (I don't know what that means).  

[I read an article](http://www.builderonline.com/building/dear-builders-engineer-studs-at-24-inch-spacing_o) that 24"" OC 2x4 studs can be ok for ceiling less than 9 feet and moderate to low wind/snow loads.   But we have ceilings higher than this (vaulted ceilings with exterior walls in excess of 12 ft) .  The house is located in Fort Collins, CO, so wind and snow loading could be significant (I haven't checked ASCE 7 to see).

My question is:  Is my home built incorrectly?  And is it structurally sound or could it collapse during a significant loading event (tornado, high snow)?  It has been standing for over 20 years.

I can upload the complete plans if desired.  (I'm a mechanical engineer with experience understanding wind loads, snow loads, etc.. so feel free to get technical if you like)

Thanks for the help my fellow engineers (and contractors/builders)!

EDIT: I further looked and saw that the floor joists are 16"" OC like in the plans. I also looked that the studs in the un-finished parts of the house (basement and garage) are 16"" OC, as if the builder was trying to hide something.

I understand the basic principles of the Venturi Effect and how it relates to Bernoulli's Principle, but I can't really wrap my head around is how flow actually works in this sort of piping arrangement.

Pressure differential is the driving force for flow through pipes. Flow goes from areas of high pressure to low pressure. In the diagram, P1 and P3 should be equal by Bernoulli's equation (ignoring friction). How does flow get from section 2 to 3? If section 2 has lower pressure than section 3, shouldn't the flow go backwards?

I know t actually doesn't so there is obviously something I'm missing. My guess is that it is the total pressure, not just the static pressure, that provides the driving force for flow, but I'm not sure. That would make it so that section 1 has higher total pressure than section 2, which also has higher total pressure than section 3 due to friction loss along the pipe.

I took classes offered by university and also referred to some material from Purdue University. (they have it for free on net). Went through the Lindeburg FE-Civil book. Studied according to the specifications given by NCEES. 

The exam was on Friday, 30th January and results were announced on Wednesday February 4th.

82,What Engineering Fields are going to be in the most demand in about 10 years?,1423341320,"I'm a sophomore M.E student, but i'm considering a lot of different options. I don't have a passion purely for mechanical objects, I have a passion for wanting to solve problems, improving things, learning /understanding things, getting challenged, science/math, that spiel ya know?
      
So I hear that an M.E degree can get you into most of the Graduate programs....
            
        
-Whats your opinion on Biomedical Engineering? If the field blows up within the next two-three decades, then there is going to be a scarce supply of experienced workers to run the teams of recent graduates and handle the market demands. I've always been interested in being able to have people live longer and better. I'd argue that Biomedical advances will allow experts and experienced workers in other fields live and work longer, not to mention ourselves, meaning that we should all be clamoring to go into the field and make a contribution in some way.     
                      
-Also, what about Physics? I fucking love the stuff. I haven't had much experience with it but I've done well with the little I have had. My main apprehension about going into this field is my belief that the main contributors are intellectual giants and that I wouldn't be able to keep up and i'd end up being someone's book keeper. My other issue with it is that Physics seems to be academia focused and that I wouldn't be doing much for the world aside from satisfying my own curiosity. 
                    
-Of course there is Mechanical Engineering itself, but I all too often hear stories about Mechanical Engineers being used as if calculators. Its been said that you'll likely end up getting stuck in a place that you don't really solve problems and use your brain, you're given work and you do it. There was a thread in /r/Engineering where various people described their day-day. Of course theres a bit of that everywhere, but it seems more common in M.E   / C.E     
                
So whats your take on this?

83,"why does my freezer work, but not my refrigerator?",1423337327,"so I have a little dorm fridge, an Igloo Fr832b. it has your standard refrigerant/compressor setup (not one of those little thermoelectric ones). there aren't any fans or anything to move air - the entire outside gets warm, and the inside walls of the freezer and fridge get cold and convection does the rest. there's a single compressor for both the freezer and refrigerator. 

so up until about a week ago, it was working fine. then all of a sudden, the freezer was still just as chilly as it's always been (as far as I know - maybe it's a little warmer now and I didn't notice, but everything is still frozen solid), but the refrigerator section is almost room temperature. the only thing I did differently in that time was freeze blocks of ice to use in a cooler for a party, so I had the door open and shut a lot in that time period, but that was several days ago and I'm still getting nothing from the refrigerator.

I haven't had the chance to actually check the temperature of the back wall in the refrigerator, but to the touch it doesn't feel particularly cold. my friend has an infrared thermometer, and I've asked about borrowing it - I'll update when he gets back to me. 

the seals on the refrigerator door were messed up in one area, but I fixed it (I don't think it would've been messed up enough to do anything, it just slid around a bit) and it didn't fix the problem. I'll poke around back by the compressor a bit more and mention if anything stands out (I've got a superficial understanding of refrigerators from my thermo class, so I'll try to see if anything seems weird to me). 

other things worth noting - the outside of the refrigerator doesn't seem to be as warm as it used to be, and there's an odd gurgling noise in the coils just behind the freezer area that wasn't there before. I do have a lot of stuff around and on the refrigerator, but I left enough space for the heat to dissipate, and it worked fine last semester with the same setup. also, I tried defrosting the freezer to no avail.

repair history - I replaced the thermostat unit once, because the refrigerator stopped working completely. this is a different scenario, because just the refrigerator crapped out.

any ideas? I don't have the cash to buy a new one (especially since the IRS it taking its sweet time getting me my refund), so I'd like to repair this one if possible. ",AskEngineers,benevolentpotato,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2v48j5/why_does_my_freezer_work_but_not_my_refrigerator/

In my current position, as well as the previous couple of positions I have held, I have noticed the following trend:

(1) I consistently get assigned more work than my colleagues;
(2) I consistently get asked to take on more responsibility than what is fair for my title / job description.

To illustrate point #1:
 - in my current position as senior engineer, the department managers assign work directly to me instead of to the lead engineer or project manager;

- at my current company, some work that was previously the responsibility of another senior engineer (who spends a lot of time surfing, talking on the phone, etc with no disciplinary action) is now getting assigned to me;

- when I find issues in work (specification errors, design problems, etc) that was completed prior to me being hired, it is left up to me to fix those issues, instead of those who are responsible for those issues;

- in my previous company, less work was slowly assigned to the other two engineers (who were not performing, as admitted to me by my lead) and more was assigned to me, until one engineer quit and the other continued to do a bare minimum (again admitted by my lead at the time).  It got to the point where I was overloaded and quit out of sheer frustration / stress issues.

To illustrate point #2:
- I am asked to give presentations to management on certain issues instead of the lead engineer or project manager for that particular piece of work;

- In meetings, management ask me to provide direction, instead of the lead engineer, project manager, etc.

I know that as a team player, it's not unusual to go above and beyond your job description from time to time.  However, I feel like this is constantly happening to me, without the accompanying rise in salary and title.

This means these ""interlocks"" perform actions such as changing set-point values if certain values are exceeded, performing a routine if values are exceeded (E.g. open valve x, wait for level to hit y, close valve x), or just locking a motor off.

On the control systems, ""Interlock"" means the equipment is locked off or closed (i.e. valve is locked closed; motor locked off). Our operators use the term ""interlock"" as being locked off or closed. We can lock stuff open / on, but the control system does not call it an interlock. 

To me, ""interlock"" and ""permissive"" has always meant that equipment would be locked in a specific and safe position (valve forced open, pump force off, etc.) if certain process values or switches were triggered. For example, if a level hits the HIGH HIGH Switch, then interlock the inlet pump off.

Anything else that performs a ""routine"" to bring the process back to a safe reading would just be under the general term of ""Safety Control Action"". I am not sure what the correct term for these are, but the above is a term I have encountered previously. 

I just like making sure there is a distinction between the two types of actions when we have to do investigations and are discussing these systems. Our interlocks are implemented in a completely different way compare to other automation. If something fails, then there are drastically different potential causes.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2v0q7c/defining_interlock_and_safety_controls/

Im currently working on a problem my community has to cost effectively rebuild our motors.  the f20c from honda comes with a fiber reinforced metal cylinder liner that requires special pistons.  

The only supplier of these pistons is mahle and the oem spec pistons cost 1000 dollars.   mahle makes an aftermarket set that are improperly designed and crack- which still cost 800 dollars.

the current alternative is to sleeve the cylinder with steel at 800-1300 dollars and then run an aftermarket piston from other suppliers that cost 400-800 dollars(depending on source and requirements).   

im looking at a couple of different ideas of new ways of doing this and would like your opinions:

option 1.   bore the cylinder out to round again, nikasil coat the bores(dont know an exact cost),  and run an aftermarket piston.

option 2.  bore the cylinder out to round-  coat the aftermarket piston skirt with a ferrite(i think)coating to allow it to work with the frm liners.

59,Help with an environmental chamber,1423013379,"Civil engineering grad student here, and not so knowledgeable with environmental control methods. I'm hoping for any type of input into whether or not this could work. My goal is to create a controlled environment to cure concrete. Posted originally to r/DIY, but unfortunately haven't got much feedback yet - hopefully this is an appropriate question for this sub.

[Here is a quick sketch to illustrate a little better](http://imgur.com/aEfnS1E). I forgot to include that the material I was thinking about using to house the concrete (the 1.5m square area) is a clear plastic box. Being able to see in would be a nice bonus, not mandatory though.

Hoping to achieve a constant temperature of 25C and 50% relative humidity, along with a slight breeze. Hoping for an accuracy of +/- 1degC, +/- 3-5% RH and the air speed, well whatever the fan blows should be okay as long as its fairly gentle, I can just monitor and record it (assuming it stays relatively constant). The fan would blow the treated air through the chamber, and be allowed to escape out of holes I cut in the back of it.

I will use a 'weather station' that is not connected to the control system to monitor and record the temp, humidity and wind speed at various locations in the box as well. This whole setup would only need to operate for 3 days at a time.

For the humidity/temperature controller, I was thinking something like the [TH-20](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Digital-Temperature-and-Digital-Humidity-Controller-20-Off-TH-20-/320850333329), or one of these [THC Series](https://www.dwyer-inst.com/Product/Humidity/Temperature-HumiditySwitches/SeriesTHC#ordering). The biggest unknown for me is finding a heater and humidifier that is of appropriate size, and can be controlled by these products - suggestions?

Temperature outside of the chamber would be 20-22degC and 20-30%RH, so not really far off what I'm trying to achieve anyways.

The experiment conducted by Yoshio Watanabe involves playing with temperatures, frequencies and different biases. In particular there is one example (fig.2b) that I would like to achieve for my own purposes.

I emailed Mr. Watanabe to ask about how he set up the experiment and he told me that he used a power amplifier, function generator, and said that ""an inductor must be put between the power source and the lamp to restrict lamp current."" He then went on to say I should contact an electrical engineer lol.

SO here I am wondering:  1. is function generator needed if I only want a fixed frequency, and if not what part would I need to achieve that? 2. how does one pick an inductor according to that? 3. He talks about DC bias and from what I read it has to do with the inductor?

I work as a production and manufacturing engineer in New Zealand in an established steel refinery. We've had a safety concern raised about people crossing the factory floor whilst the internal crane is moving 50Tonne buckets of steel. 
Now, ideally we would simply install an interlock system consisting of gates that will not open if the crane is travelling. However, the floor itself has 10 possible entry/exit points, and we have had issues in the past regarding power failure, and emergency exits.

I need a way to ensure our factory operators will not cross under a moving crane. The training we provide is very detailed on this part of daily operation, yet some of our employees do not make the best decisions sometimes. The current prevention is simply a loud siren and flashing lights near the entry/exit points. 

The NZ work safety organisation has expressed concern over this operation and thus we need to do SOMETHING about it. I'm looking for a solution that may be a little out of the ordinary.

My initial idea was to install a laser activated STOP light near the entry/exit points, so if an operator crosses the laser to enter the floor, a large sign will flash and illuminate. I'm unsure how effective this will be over time, however.

I'm interested in small start-up companies, how technology is used in neat and innovative ways, embedded systems, and how technology (eg, the convenience and transfer of information) has impacted different societies. Preferably I would like to do an exchange that fits this ideal and is considered more technologically advanced than Canada. However, I am open to the idea that I would learn more from visiting a country that is less technologically advanced.

I would like to do a semester exchange somewhere between the months of August to December either this year or the next. By the way, it might be worth keeping in mind that I am female (ovaries and all) and acknowledge that this might be a factor to certain countries and therefore, impact my overall experience (which, weirdly enough, I would like to be positive).

I look forward to your thoughts. Thanks for you help!",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2um1pl/im_a_canadian_student_in_stem_and_would_like_to/
84,How to connect a surface pro 3 and a desktop to make a better work environment. (cross post with r/surface),1422941344,"Something I have always wanted to be able to do is connect my surface pro 3 to my desktop.

I am curious if there is any way you could have a docking station next to your desktop. So when you got home from work/school you could take your surface and place it into the docking station. 

The only kicker here is that I would like to be able to use my Bluetooth desktop keyboard and mouse to control my surface and my desktop at the same time.

So being able to run both my desktop and surface independently while, still being able to share files from one to the other.  

This would act like a duel monitor system but each screen will be using the computer its original system to run individual applications.

As an engineering student, it is nice to be able to run my coding programs on my surface (Matlab and MathCad) but being able to run my bigger design programs on my desktop (SolidWorks and AutoCad).

This way I can have the convenience to be able to jump back an forth between storage devices and computers. While not slowing down my rendering or processing speed.

89,Started new/first job: little to no delegation/organization of work.,1422922866,"Hey everyone. So ill give you some insight on what my new job is like and my concerns. I dont know if these are valid concerns or not but they have been bothering me and I am going to bring them up with my boss. I am a BSME working as a Technician, as long as I ""progress"" ill be moved to an engineer title in 6-12 months. But in the mean time I am trying to soak in as much as possible while im working with the equipment. 

This is a company with ~50 people, of which a good 25 are Techs. Its sorta a new company still (4-5 years). They are a tight knit group, most of them have been working there for atleast 2 years. When I was hired I was never really given any sort of daily tasks, I was just told to shadow a few people and what they do. Well after a few days I had a good idea how perform the basic tasks that occur daily and wanted to start performing them. Thats when things get hairy, no one wants to give up their ""work"", they have been doing it for so long that they are accustomed to it. Even when I ask to help they always tell me they got it and to go find something else to do (even though they are lifting alot of materials and its an easy 2 person job). They even start work earlier/omit me from vital schedule info so that I miss what they are doing. I tried to shadow other people and most of them are the same way, however the ones who were ""open arms"" are not in my division and they recently got a new hire and now the extra work stopped. 

The only saving grace I have is that i am doing alot of 3D modeling and drawings for them, I am the only one in the company that can work Solidworks and have very little of their equipment documented.. On one hand this gives me a bunch of work to do, on the other I am getting severely under paid to be doing it. I have been doing alot of drawing recently just to fill up my day so it doesnt drag on, but the minute another tech see's me inside the office all day they start with the ""Oh Concernedengi we needed you out there today where were you?"" and ""why are you doing XXXXX? Thats not real work"" and a slew of other annoying comments. I did not hear a single of them ever ask me (even know we talked/saw eachother all day) to give them a hand or that they were overloaded with work. They say that I should be ""out looking for work to do"".

Am I crazy for thinking this way of working is asinine? There is no one to answer to, or no one to go to, very little delegation of work and even when there is they (management) dont hold anyone to what they say. They dont really have any training program neither and its always every man for them selves.  The techs will just keep doing what they want. Apparently they have a high turn over rate in this group (4 more people were hired and then left after a couple of weeks) and that other people see whats wrong with it. I want to go to my boss with my concerns, and I hope that he will listen and make changes. However when that happens they will immediately know who ""Snitched"" and create new hostility. Everything in this group is dont by word of mouth and I am constantly being left out. I am trying to transfer to a different division in the company but im not counting on it. any suggestions?

Would such buildings even be achievable today?

This last semester I started working in a research lab doing CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) work, which is very heavily programming and math based. The professor I work under is fantastic, I am really exceptional at what I am doing, and I love the type of lab environment that I work in. I enjoy the CFD work but, am finding that I am only really interested in computational part and not very fond the the fluids part of computational fluids. The professor I am working for has mentioned that maybe I should look into going into computational science for graduate school, which sounds interesting but most of what I can find about it seems to be tailored to just CFD and FEA type of areas which just simply don't get me that excited.

I have also always been interested in robotics and AI type stuff, which is why I have the CS minor. I also fairly often in class daydream about robotics, exoskeletons, and programming related stuff. Unfortunately I haven't been able to explore this are much as my school has no program for it at all outside of one mechatronics class.

I took 4 weeks because they were sent back multiple times to either get better data or redo the graphs/tables showing the parts.  I did this myself and although I did not make graphs or charts it only took me 4 hours to complete.

I've been switching between copper sleeves and zinc-plated copper sleeves (both from McMaster) and while it would seem that zinc-plated copper sleeves are stronger than copper sleeves, in my experience so far this doesn't seem to be the case.  Possible reasons for this that I've come up with are:
-when crimped, the zinc coating and copper separate because of their different stiffnesses, causing a looser fit than just copper
-zinc is harder than copper (I believe, haven't looked it up), and therefore doesn't ""sink in"" as much to the cable as the uncoated copper
-initial corrosion between the copper and zinc (between time of manufacture and time of use) causes the coating to separate, causing a looser crimp

63,Looking for creative/economical ways to conceal acoustic panels in bedroom without limiting effectiveness (x-post from /r/audioengineering),1422558000,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I could really use some help from folks with more knowledge of acoustics than my basic understanding.

I have an odd problem. My roommate and I share a wall between our two bedrooms in our rented NYC apartment. The rooms are both long and narrow (about 8' x 17') with doors on one end and beds and windows on the other. The dividing wall between the rooms is one of the long walls and pretty much paper thin. The problem is that this means that when one of us has a, um... overnight guest, the unfortunate neighboring roommate ends up hearing every gruesome detail of the other's extracurricular activities. Being that we're both at or nearly 30, we'd like to think we're both a little old to be listening to this kind of thing.

I came across [this article](http://http://acousticsfreq.com/blog/?p=62) on making some DIY acoustic panels which sound like a great way to deaden the noise transfer between rooms, but stretching tapestries over these feels like it would give the room kind of a college dorm room feel that I'd like to avoid. 

**My question is this:** how do I diminish the noise transfer between rooms using panels like the ones in the article while working within the following constraints:

* Can't do any construction, so no hiding the panels between sheetrock
* Don't want to completely cover the wall up, so I need to maximize the efficiency of the panels
* I'd prefer not to just cover them with tapestries as shown in the article since it looks kind of cheesy and dorm-roomesque, so aesthetics should be considered

What if I made smaller panels and stretched art prints (posters) over the fronts instead of tapestries? The thicker paper might reflect some of the sound back into the room but it should still stop it from going through the dividing wall, right?

My words were stripped and re written twice in my own self assessment. Our goals were written after the year was done. It was an overall poor process. But this isn't my question.

When your boss says your work is amazing, but your ""soft skills"" will prevent your advancment in a company that has no room for it anyway, what am I supposed to do?

I exceed all engineering work, he agreed.
I communicated all issues in a timely manner and clearly to everyone, he agreed.
I met all my goals and developed new things for the company, he agreed. 

He said I need to work on my soft skills, I agreed.

Then he wrote my overall as needs improvement. No raise, no bonus, no path to success. And he ends the review with ""I don't want to know your 5 year plan, but think about it.""

Say you had two or three very large towers, maybe three times the height of the shuttle. I don't remember my physics vocab, so bear with me.

83,How can some one with a business background gain respect in an engineering and technology centered company.,1422473690,"I have a colleague who posed an interesting question to me the other day. They have a business background and are in an upper leadership business position at a large (top 10) specialty chemicals companies. Many of his peers and subordinates come from a technical background either in engineering or chemistry.

The question was how can some one with a business background gain technical knowledge and respect (not the exact word I was looking for but I can't think of a better one right now) in a largely technical company.  Sure the knowledge can be easy enough to learn on the level they would need from outside reading or shadowing, but even going to the extreme and going back to school and gaining a degree in engineering would not necessarily help gain them any respect among their peers because they had never worked in that position.

The question came about because I being an engineer myself asked about the usefulness of a degree (MBA or the like) for moving into a more business oriented field and they did not suggest it.  That coming from an engineering background there is not much that I could not easily learn on my own and it would not really gain me anything within our company.

8,Fluid Mechanics - syringe and small diameter tubing question,1422406315,"Explain to me the difference, if any, of adjusting the headroom in the beginning of a sequence to draw fluid from a reservoir using a syringe pump and small diameter (ID = 0.040"") PVC tubing.

The setup:

1. 10mL syringe pump connected to 375"" of the .040"" ID tubing. Tubing inlet/outlet has a sharp diameter reduction to .005"" (.25"" long steel tube). The fluid can be water throughout the scenario. The end of the tubing is inserted into a beaker of water.

2. The entire system is primed with the water, so the syringe barrel and entire length of tubing is full of water and at equilibrium.

3. The syringe is pumped 'X' mL, to give it '10-X' mL headroom.

4. The system returns to equilibrium. 

5. The syringe now removes the headroom, filling again with liquid, at a constant rate for all cases. 

It's my assertion, that rates being equal and starting from equilibrium, there will be no appreciable difference in each scenario except for the amount of time it takes to remove the headroom. In other words, it doesnt matter how much volume there is to replace, the flow rates will be the same if the pump rate is the same in all cases. No ""larger vacuum"" or pressure gradient is being applied here.

Is the outlook for biomedical engineering decent? 

I believe that I want to be a psychiatrist but the school I believe I'll be attending doesn't have an amazing premed program and the one that they do have seems to be very chemistry focused. 

I'm not too sure if biomedical engineering will help me too much in medical school but I'm really interested in engineering and believe that it may help me have an edge up on the other students trying to get into medical school.

11,Concrete Creep and Shrinkage,1422390385,"My goal is to measure (and minimize) the shrinkage of a concrete mix. I am finding that when I read about shrinkage, creep is usually also discussed. In simple terms, I understand that a difference between creep and shrinkage could be made if two identical concrete specimens were considered, where one specimen is subject to load and the other is not. The strain in the unloaded specimen would be the shrinkage strain, and the difference between the loaded and unloaded specimens would be the (basic) creep strain. 

However, I also read about the Pickett effect. As I understand, if a specimen was subject to drying and loading, the measured strain would be higher than the sum of the individually measured shrinkage and basic creep strains. This 'extra' strain would would the drying creep. 

My hope here is that someone could confirm or correct my understanding of these phenomenon. I would first like to measure drying shrinkage using ASTM C157. This test basically calls for the measurement of a 3x3x11.5"" prism 24hr. after curing, and then at different intervals to calculate the change in length. The specimen would not be subject to any load, and kept at constant temperature and humidity.

Would this test be a true measure of shrinkage strain, or would it just be a measure of shrinkage strain by a convenient definition - ie. is there some type of creep effect going on as well (even though there isn't an external load)?

I understand that this test would ignore the effect of plastic shrinkage, and I believe would measure drying shrinkage, autogenous and carbonation shrinkage simultaneously.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2tvo0m/concrete_creep_and_shrinkage/

22,What sort of jobs benefit from ingenuity?,1422344919,"I'm going back to school, likely for engineering of some sort (in transition..figuring things out).  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm guessing you hear this from most beginners - I feel like I do my best work when things require a level of ingenuity.

I used to work as a technician of sorts in the field but one of the things I didn't like about it was that there was seldom time to think things through fully to come up with a better way of doing something that really works well as opposed to strictly sticking to the established procedures.  Only under rare circumstances, where there was a lack of sufficient resources, did I get a chance to show a bit of ingenuity.  These were the moments I got a real ""high"" from, but it was required for only 1% or less of the job.  Typically this also meant that the people in charge couldn't afford the necessary resources to do the job properly (as I moved up the ranks, ingenuity was valued less because more $ solved a lot of the problems I had found ways around).

I'd like to increase that 1% in the future.  Is there anything I can look into?  I realize few entry level jobs would offer this level of responsibility but at the same time, I don't want to plan on working for 20 years until I get to be in a position I'm more suited to.  I'm relatively slow, cautious, detailed and tend to overthink things (grunt work = hell for me and everyone around, yet I tend to gravitate toward practical applications).

33,Traffic/Highway Engineers - How do you deal with the common folk's opinions/statements?,1422315747,"Hello gents,

Back in my junior year of college, I was torn between a structural focus and a transportation focus for my BSCE.  On one hand I was so passionate about fixing the road system, I wanted to really learn all I could to ""fix this shit.""  I mean, I was really into it and to this day I still remember quite a lot about what we learned.  At the same time, I really like the idea of being a structural engineer - since I always saw them as the stereotypical civil engineer.  I wanted to wear a hard hat and a tie like [that guy in the Swinerton signs](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000282435117/bff4a36d3ed74fb191de63744bc67fab_400x400.jpeg).  :p

Fast forward a semester or two and I landed an internship at a county DoT.  Most of my job was to inspect sites for permit compliance, but one thing stood out to me while I was there.  Congestion in the area at many 4-way intersections was terrible!  The county DoT came up with the idea to begin implementing roundabouts - they did all of the feasibility studies and found them to be very good at solving the problems.  The pushback from the townships, though, was unbelieveable!  They adamantly refused to allow them to be put in either because they didn't think they'd work or because they were ""European.""  It wasn't until the DoT forced a roundabout in at an intersection that people saw they were really good.  Now they are asking for them everywhere.

But that's just not the whole story.  I'm sure you see here on Reddit how many ""highway engineers"" there are whenever something related to roads gets posted.  It's like every poster has a Ph.D. in highway design and has intimate knowledge of everything vehicular.  It drives me bananas because I want to correct them, but there's not enough time in the day to explain what I know the plethora of people who believe something different - and they probably wouldn't accept it anyhow.

So, how do you deal with it?  I'll be honest, that DoT internship did a lot to steer me toward structures.  I just couldn't deal with all the people who ""knew"" better than everyone else.  (There was also some dissatisfaction with political meddling in the engineering, but that's a story for another day.)

I'm sure I'll deal with something similar when I'm working structures one day, but at least (hopefully) it'll be confined to contractors who've ""been doing this way for years.""  Most common folk don't have a clue why a steel beam on a bridge is a certain depth.  :p

But I swear, everyone and their brother will be able to tell you how road cones should be set up at a construction site, or how speed limits should be set, or how many lanes a road *should* have, etc.

34,"Is there an adhesive tape, putty, or glue that can adhere my ABS plastic speakers to an aluminum bracket?",1422314364,"I have created some brackets to attach a couple of speakers to some arms for surround sound at my PC desk. The brackets are made of **aluminum** for weight purposes, and they each have two faces measuring in at 3/8"" x 1"" that contact the base of the speakers (the speakers hang upside down, see picture below). This is a very small face, and the mounting tape I have purchased does not perform well enough at these dimensions, only offering a fraction of a pound of mounting force total.

**An image of the setup:** http://imgur.com/HaM8ZzW

**Schematic of Attachment Point (über rough):** http://imgur.com/Uf4PdUs

The mounting tapes available at the hardware store are rated (at best) at 4 inches of tape per pound. These are 1"" wide tapes, so that's 4in^2 per pound. At these specifications, I recieve only ~0.2lbs of mounting force per speaker, which weigh in at about half a pound. So, I am exploring alternatives.

**Command Strips** are on my radar, because they are rated at multiple pounds, and they are used with one strip per hook. If there is any shred of honesty in their marketing, that means that a single hook (therefore single adhesive strip) should hold the specified weight. That can provide me with nearly 2lbs of force per 0.5lb speaker.

**There is one problem**: I don't know about the materials I am using, and if the command strips' conventional adhesive will slowly release from aluminum or matte finish ABS plastic (I am assuming this is the material, as it seems to be what all electronics casings are made from in my experience). I am curious if anybody here can provide insight on the problem of **adhering plastic to aluminum, and if certain methods (e.g. adhesive strips, glues, etc.) are simply unreliable.**

*Alas, the ultimate fix is to switch to fasteners and drill some holes into the bottom of the speakers.* I don't like this idea because drilling new holes involves blindly drilling into an electronic device. The existing screws are angled to hold the face plate on, and I cannot use these. I have no idea what is behind the plastic and, although I know that much of it is empty space, it's not worth potentially destroying the speakers.

35,Preventing DC Arching?,1422313605,"Hey,

I'm currently on a student team that's working on an electric vehicle.

The vehicle is powered by battery packs made up of lipo cells running at 92.5V (25 Cells). The positive connection goes directly to the motor and the negative to the motor controller.

How it has been been operated in the past is that the cables are connected and the last cable (connecting the positive to the motor or the negative to the controller) results in a bang as the contact creates a large arch, likely as the capacitors in the controller charge. Not great for the system and potentially dangerous.

We have tried to place these relays in series: http://www.te.com/catalog/pn/en/1618387-3?RQPN=LEV200A4ANA

But it seems that has led to damage to the relays (permanently open/closed)

What options do we have in order to safely connect the controller/whole system to the battery pack, bearing in mind the battery pack is regularly removed/disassembled therefore it can not be a permanent wiring solution?

Ideally, I'd make the shelf out of 15mm plywood since I have that to hand and already cut to width, but with the loads I'm imagining (which honestly I'm just pulling out of my ass; it's going to be loaded with electronics test gear &amp; components drawers etc, none of which is exactly light).

I've been using the [Sagulator](http://www.woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator.htm) calculator with a 30kg/300mm centre loading, as a worst case, although in practice it's much more likely to be uniform loading (although I have no idea how to account for dynamic loads of humping new stuff on there, etc)

My original values (15mm ply, 25x10 edging strip) result in a nearly 10mm/300mm sag, which would touch the table (it's only ~220 off the bench)

So, my question is:

*Assuming rigid mounting on 3 sides (left, right, rear), and no front support, what's the most effective way to build a stiff shelf in terms of combining 15mm plywood boards, edging strips, and other ideas?*

(Cable or wooden tension supports from above are my fallback option, but I'd like to avoid them if possible)


My current idea is to route a horizontal channel in 2 pieces of 15mm ply, 8x16mm in each. Into this channel would be glued &amp; screwed a piece of 16x16x1mm steel box section, and the 2 ply panels would be glued &amp; screwed across their entire surface to form a single 1850x400x30 board with the steel reinforcement running lengthways.

An addtional pine edge strip of 10x36mm could be added to the front edge as well.

Is this a ridiculous idea? If not, would the steel beam be best placed near the middle or front of the shelf? I'm guessing pretty far forward.

Sagulator puts this at only 1.247 mm per 305 mm of sag, even without the steel beam, so I think it could work, but might be overkill if there's an easier way.

I can't easily support brackets or diagonal struts from behind.

Strange constraints, but hopefully someone will have some interesting suggestions. Thanks for reading this far.

50,How can I become a working engineer without any formal education?,1422245541,"Hello reddit! I'm 20 and live in a small town in Kansas. Nobody in my family has a job in science or engineering. Nobody in my family even *knows* anyone with such a job, so my exposure to these fields is minimal to non-existent. I've been to college twice but unfortunately due to financial issues I was unable to complete either semesters. I spent most of my days at work to cover tuition costs so I was failing (or very nearly so) everything but English anyway.

Due to financial limitations I have no possibility of college in my future. I don't own any tools of any kind that an engineer would typically have. I don't have a computer either.

If I know the names of topics and subdisciplines, I'm confident I can find the books regarding them; albeit very outdated ones. I have over 100 playlist ""classes"" saved on my YouTube account, some actual classes like Open Courseware and some less formal like Khan Academy and Crash Course. I have a few books saved to my phone too, but most of them require a lot of materials I don't have to follow along and nearly all of them seem to start in the *middle* of various degrees rather than the beginning. 

I want to learn things like scientific computing, software and hardware design, particle physics and mechanical/chemical engineering. Perhaps intentionally, my interests tend to converge towards things I'm neither remotely good at nor realistically capable of learning hands on.

54,Logic gates using levers for a combo lock?,1422232827,"I am not an engineer, and am looking for some guidance for a pet project I am working toward. I've read a lot about logic gates the past couple days, and feel as though I understand their function. I am trying to construct a combination lock that will open a door. This is in a game similar to Minecraft, and it has basic On/Off logic that can be applied to levers, lights, doors, etc in game. Binary behavior.

The goal is to have a 'keypad' other players can enter a code into, and if the code is right, it will open a door. All I have to work with are these binary state items. I am using a switch. Despite hours drawing and testing, I can't seem to get it to work. I have tried using only AND gates, then a combination of XNOR and AND gates. The game has a lot of limitations, but I've seen people who've constructed mechanical logic gates using lego's or pulleys and string, so it should be possible?! 

The items I have to work with can be turned OFF or ON. The game see's this state change and this can trigger another change elsewhere. Another player in the game made a video-only example of all the basic logic gates using small colored light orbs. I am sure you all will recognize them. Starts about :27 in... http://youtu.be/gRAgjk7tEjs

So as you can see, it can be set so that turning on or off one thing can trigger one or more things to turn off or on. You can set up a loop if you want (like the clock bit at the start of the video) where the switches just keep turning themselves off or on in sequence. Sadly there is no way to check the current 'status' of a switch and do something based on that status.

If someone could point me in the right direction for just a keypad with just 4 input buttons and a 2 ""digit"" code, it should be enough for me to figure out how to expand it to the 32 button, 8 input ""digit"" code I'd like to have.

TLDR: How to construct a 'mechanical' binary logic gate series as a combination lock using 4 input buttons, which will open a door if the correct 2 buttons are pressed!

Thanks!

Should I expect to be paid hourly or salaried?

If I'm offered X amount, should I be countering with X+30% because it is a 1099 position or will they already be including this?

From what I've read, I should keep good records on all hours worked and any expenses.  Are there any resources for doing this or should I just create an excel sheet?

92,How do you handle performance validation and energy analysis of HVAC Systems using simulation?,1422046773,"Fellow engineers,

I am a developing engineer (3 years experience) who has found himself at a 100ish person private A/E firm who consults for clients in healthcare, education, pharmaceuticals, and heavy industry. Doing HVAC / plumbing / fire protection engineering, design, and specification. Most of the commercial work is renovation or small (&lt;10,000 sq. ft.) construction, while the sky is the limit on the heavy side.

We use Carrier HAP for basic load calculations for HVAC sizing of equipment. It seems like all clients in our area are concerned with initial capital cost. As such we typically only specify multiple packaged rooftop units on small jobs and constant volume hydronic systems with constant speed AHUs on the larger project side.

I would like to have the conversation with current long term clients about spending a little more money during design development (heck, maybe even do it pro bono the first time or two) to perform an energy analysis of different HVAC air/water systems to show different break-even periods. For a small upfront cost - that I believe should pay for itself in energy savings - we can help our client build better mechanical systems. It is a win-win: we get a larger fee based off construction costs; client saves money over the lifetime of the use of the space.

Thing is, I do not know where to start.

I am plenty familiar with all the basic engineering systems and how to design them. If not, I have the books to teach me, and I really enjoy technical reading. I am also very familiar with performing financial economic analysis (PV, FV, Annuities, NPV, etc). I need to learn the correct software and approaches to blend these two skills.

* 1. How do you all go about presenting this to your clients?
* 2. What energy modeling simulation software do you use to perform your analysis? Any preferred reading materials to go along with using it?
* 3. Could you give me a success story or two?

A little background Information:

I used to live in the U.S.A from when I was 5 years old until I graduated High School. I was from Egypt originally and we moved back to Egypt because my fathers’ Visa expired. 

Now in Egypt I attended Cairo University and have a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Design Engineering (Not ABET Accredited but from other people who have been able to travel I was told that it is known enough that some corporations will hire you and most colleges will allow for a Master’s Program). The big issue now is that in Egypt the jobs and salaries are a joke. I want to go anywhere that would make me feel like I am living in a country that provides at least the basic needs to the people and where I would be able to build myself up in my career and just be able to live my life the way that I want. 

So I guess the question here is which countries would I be able to immigrate to and what are the processes that I would have to go through to apply for the immigration. I would prefer if I can go back to the U.S.A if possible. (I am the only one of my siblings that is not an American Citizen because I was born in Egypt before going to America.)

I know that there are already twin scroll blocker plates available, but they only block off the larger scroll, and are going to cause massive turbulence and thus reducing flow, to the 90 degree angle that the exhaust gases would be hitting the plate at when in the closed position.

My idea is a twist on the blocking plates, but instead is a divider, that would be controlled by an actuator. Example: http://www.spracingonline.com/images/news/thumbs/15.jpg

The only downside I can see to this is that having the smaller side scroll blocked at high flow wouldn't actually do anything to improve high exhaust flow, in fact it may actually be worse than just having both scrolls flowing freely.

I guess depending on how you think of it, I guess weapons-manufacturing could be considered environmental, but only if those weapons killed enough people. Like 6 billion or so. So that's not really pragmatic.

31,linkage design help - Bobillier line?,1421883380,"I am building pretty much the exact system detail in this patent: http://www.google.com/patents/US4388978

Much of my build was already fixed in design or actually constructed (including 'upper frame 10 and lower frame 11') as a design I arrived at before being aware of this patent.  I was figuring I could work out the steering linkage on my own once I had the rest in place, but would be quite happy to follow along the lines of somebody else's work.  I knew I wasn't breaking any new ground (was going off Norman Hossack's work) and was actually quite happy to see the close similarities to my design (such as the pull activated shock) in this patent, so would love to follow it fully.

The author asserts that ""The [steering drag link] rod is particularly positioned at an intermediate level between the upper frame 10 and lower frame 11 in a position such that this connecting rod is kinematically compatible with the deformable quadrilateral, i.e., that it has the same instantaneous center of rotation as the quadrilateral over the range utilized. One of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine the position and the length of this connecting rod for it to be compatible (particularly by construction of the Bobillier line). It should be noted that two specific instances of compatibility are constituted by a coaxiality of the connecting rod 15 with one or the other of the frames 10 or 11.""

I'm not skilled in that art... **can I perhaps find some clear guidance on how to do this 'construction of the Bobillier line', or otherwise determine valid pivot locations for the ends of the steering linkage arrangement described in the patent?**

Now... not so much. I plugged it in for the first time in a couple months and realized that the Master Out was cutting in and out, depending on how I held the audio cable to my speakers. So, I figured it must be loose. (I also checked with headphones. Problem is definitely the output and not the wire).

I opened it up, and decided to desolder the Audio Input jack (because I never use it), and swap it with the Master Out. It should be noted that the headphone out was and still is working perfectly. The pins on the board were in the same location, the jacks look identical, so I assumed the components were the same. Once I swapped and resoldered, I plugged her back in and much to my dismay, the Master Out does not work at all. Shit. And somehow, the Audio In (which I confess I did not test prior to swap) works... perfectly.

I see potential in a small hydro electric power plant (just for building, not practical use i.e powering something essential) since there is a small cliff there with a fall of 2m I was thinking I could excavate out a reservoir. The big reason for a reservoir is that the flow of water varies alot from day to day due to the location. (Note: This is a artificial made stream from the drainage from a field, we also own the land and a excavator. (I am a experienced handy worker, and will not be working alone))

The reservoir will be 2m wide 3-4m deep and 4m long (2*4*4=32m^3)
19.6KPa/m2 will be the pressure (if i calculated correctly.)
I was thinking I could use a mortar an brick wall with a concrete base that goes 1/2m deep into the ground and 1/2m into the sides to hinder leakage.
A pipe will tunnel the exiting water towards a turbine and then go into nature.
A finish on the outside to make a seal. and something on the backside to keep it from overturning like a steel grid mounted on the sides.

69,Appropriate power supply for tethered drone?,1421718730,"Hello,
I have a DJI Phantom remote controlled drone. I would like to replace the battery with a wire running to a power supply on the ground for the purpose of extended flight times.

The drone uses a 2200mAh 11.1V 20C battery (3S LiPo).  I am not sure how much power the drone draws, but those batteries last about 10-12 minutes (sometimes less).  The manual lists the power consumption as 3.12W

1.  How much power do I need to supply?  I assume something close to 11.1V, but how many amps?

2.  And how much voltage drop would I expect over 15m or 30m of cable?  This will require a larger power supply - do I go up in amps and voltage?

75,Commutation in a DC machine at the magnetic neutral axis (MNA),1421698385,"Hey reddit,

We learned in our course that minimal sparking will occur at the brushes when they are located in the MNA (I understand the concept of MNA). So I understand that if we put a simple closed winding in the MNA there will be no induced voltage (faraday's law) since the flux is maximal.

Now the issue I'm having is why isn't there any induced emf during the commutation, the armature windings are all conected to eachother so if there is a short circuit by the brushes during the commutation aren't all windings connected at that instance? Now some of these windings will see the maximum flux but others won't and so there will be an emf induced?

Could anyone explain me why this isn't the case since it's stated in my course notes that there isn't an induced emf (and therefore minimal sparking)... Do I interpret the windings wrongly ?

76,"Rigid-body aircraft: how do you deal with two separate, connected rigid bodies? (and some followup questions within)",1421697895,"I'm trying to write a program for Euler equation's applied to aircraft attitude and rigid-body dynamics. Euler's equations are described  [**here**](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-07-dynamics-fall-2009/lecture-notes/MIT16_07F09_Lec29.pdf) (PDF warning).

My specific problem deals with the internal forces in the aircraft: I have 6 pin-jointed structural members connecting two rigid bodies (in reality it's 8, but I reduced it to 6 to avoid an indeterminate system), and each member is described by a unit vector. I'm trying to solve for the internal tension/compression forces in these members in a scenario where the aircraft is landing on one wheel.

**EDIT:** [**Here's a photo**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Cessna_A185E_Amphibious_floats._\(6002935915\).jpg) of a similar system. In case it's not clear, the first body is the aircraft, and the second body is the pair of floats.

To do this, I took the external landing forces and calculated the linear &amp; angular accelerations of the complete aircraft, then separated both rigid bodies into separate kinetic bodies to solve for the forces in the structural members from both ""sides"".

With 6 unknowns and 6 equations of motion, I ended up with a 6x6 matrix and attempted to solve using linear algebra (i.e. AX^-1 = F), but the solution matrix for the resultant forces is blowing up.

---

I started having issues when separating the two rigid bodies, and I have some questions as I've never actually solved this problem before:

1. When separating the rigid bodies, can I let the vectors resolve positive/negative signs on their own for the sum of forces equations? (For the sum of moments, the signs are forced even though the unit vectors already have signs).

2. Dynamics tells me that the resultant forces should be equal for both rigid bodies. The fact that the sum of forces for each body ends up with equal and opposite values confirms this. But the sum of moments aren't necessarily equal. Is there some indicator I can use to tell for the sum of moments?

Anything else that I'm not thinking of is appreciated. I've hit a wall on coming up with a solution and have debugged the code to the point where I'm confident that it's not a coding issue, but an issue with how I've written my equations of motion / my understanding of the dynamics problem.",AskEngineers,dangersandwich,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2sywhv/rigidbody_aircraft_how_do_you_deal_with_two/

How it works:
A customer calls the front desk and places an order.  An employee would then load the robot and select the room destination.  The robot will find its way to the room by following a line and using a metal detector to detect washers under the carpet.  The washers are used to keep track of which room the robot is at.  When the robot arrives it will ring a doorbell to notify the customer that it had arrived.  If they ordered food they will have to type in a passcode that was told to them over the phone to open the box.  Otherwise the robot will always be stocked with pillows, towels, soap, etc.  After the customer has taken their supplies, a short survey will pop up on the screen asking questions like ""We're you satisfied with your order?""  If they were not an employee would give them a call and/or refund their order if necessary.  The robot will then find its way back to the kitchen (or wherever the hotel keeps it).

Other features:
1. The robot randomly generates the passcodes so they aren't the same everytime
2. It is equipped with LEDs that flash to warn people to get out of the way.
3. An ultrasonic detector is on the front that will stop the robot if someone is in the way.
4. If the customer doesn't take their supplies within 5 minutes (a doorbell rings every minute) then the robot will leave.
5. If the customer only wants towels and not food they can text the robot their room number and the robot will go there.
6. If the robot somehow gets off the line that it is following it will quickly fix itself and continue forward.

3,How to Research Asteroid Deflection Systems?,1421596767,"I previously posted this on the engineering sub, but after re-reading all of the rules I believe it might've not been fit for it. Here's the post again...

Hello All, 

I’m studying computer science (Could I say fellow engineers?) at a community college and since 2013 I’ve been highly interested in asteroid deflection systems. I got very interested after the Chelyabinsk meteor occurred and I’ve decided that I want to hopefully contribute to the research being done for early warning and deflection systems. Unfortunately I have a poor background in physics and engineering. Fortunately computer science requires me to take many fundamental courses for engineers such as university physics, and introduction to engineering. After that I wonder what specific books, online courses, or resources in general I could use to have a good understanding of this. To clarify a bit more I still have no idea of how I could work on such systems, but I would definitely love to contribute in some way. I was thinking some of the possibilities are researching how NEO tracking satellites work and research how those could be made more accurate. I was also thinking, this interest me the most, on researching and improving deflection theories to reduce the time required to deflect an asteroid. I do understand this is something better done with a group of people, but I have no idea of where to start. I contacted NASA and the B612 foundation a couple of months ago with no luck. Since I’m trying to build up knowledge for researching this as my thesis after I transfer to a four year, any advice from the engineers in this subedit would be appreciated.

12,Room Service Bot,1421555893,"At my high school I am on a team that has been designing a robot that is pretty much a bellhopper for a hotel.  We are making it out if VEX and Phenoix Contact parts and it is almost finished.

How it works:
A customer calls the front desk and places an order.  An employee would then load the robot and select the room destination.  The robot will find its way to the room by following a line and using a metal detector to detect washers under the carpet.  The washers are used to keep track of which room the robot is at.  When the robot arrives it will ring a doorbell to notify the customer that it had arrived.  If they ordered food they will have to type in a passcode that was told to them over the phone to open the box.  Otherwise the robot will always be stocked with pillows, towels, soap, etc.  After the customer has taken their supplies, a short survey will pop up on the screen asking questions like ""We're you satisfied with your order?""  If they were not an employee would give them a call and/or refund their order if necessary.  The robot will then find its way back to the kitchen (or wherever the hotel keeps it).

Other features:
1. The robot randomly generates the passcodes so they aren't the same everytime
2. It is equipped with LEDs that flash to warn people to get out of the way.
3. An ultrasonic detector is on the front that will stop the robot if someone is in the way.
4. If the customer doesn't take their supplies within 5 minutes (a doorbell rings every minute) then the robot will leave.
5. If the customer only wants towels and not food they can text the robot their room number and the robot will go there.
6. If the robot somehow gets off the line that it is following it will quickly fix itself and continue forward.

Assuming this grinder will undergo a fair amount of vibration during use, what methods would be acceptable for mounting this solidly to the plate?

I have considered drilling and tapping the plate, and bolting the grinder to it. This method could loosen over time though, I assume. (Due to the give of the rubber feet)

We have done this in the past using a variety of techniques, such as OptiTrack, IR laser, and incremental encoders(mounted weapons only). After each project, we always seem to find some new device or process that will make it easier and there are inherent problems to every method. I would love to hear from anyone out there who has done something similar and why they like or hate the method they used. 

Our main goals are the following:
 - know the absolute heading, pitch, and roll of a rifle in space
 - provide a wireless solution
 - minimize lag time (&lt;20ms position update)
 - provide a solution that is compatible with night vision equipment (some IR can be problematic)
 - minimize system components/cost

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks!",AskEngineers,rosco314,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2snad6/what_is_the_best_way_to_track_a_rifle_in_a/

41,I am having trouble with erratic readings from pH probes. 4-20mA. Water treatment.,1421423156,"So, this is a waste treatment system with an unknown waste water (they are secretive about their products). The system essentially treats and filters water to extract solids and waste. The system relies on pH to treat the waste water with chemicals.

I will try to simply bullet-point what I have observed.

* The 5 pH probes are 2 wire, loop powered probes run to 5 isolators, then to the PLC's analog 4-20mA inputs
* I do have remote VPN access to the PLC, so I can change it from my office.
* The problem was noticed when trying to calibrate/scale the pH (interpreting raw values to a usable pH number) with buffer solution (ph of 7 and 10)
* The probe would function properly outside of the tank in the buffer solution, but show very erratic readings when thrown into the tank. It was specifically when both pH40 and pH50 were in the tank together.
* The probe's reading would STABILIZE when the mixer at 40 and/or 50 were running, and if you turned both mixers off, the values would jump wildly.
* After this, I rewrote code to only accumulate data when the process was running, and the mixers were on. This mostly solved the issue, but in this attached photo, I've been seeing erratic readings even while the system is running
* http://i.imgur.com/gznItV5.jpg
* I have only come to a few conclusions. It is either a grounding issue, a ground loop, or their process water is somehow electrically charged.

I have had any useful help from a few technical resources such as my predecessor, two pH probe suppliers, and a few master electricians, but none have been able to help. I know it's a long-shot posting this here, but anything you can recommend as far as testing and troubleshooting would greatly be appreciated.

59,"How do I install a pressure/compression sensor into a mannequin for, well.. rope bondage?",1421356544,"So I'm a Kinbaku (Japanese rope bondage) enthusiast ([Wikipedia's page on Kinbaku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_bondage)). I've been studying it &amp; taking lessons fairly intensively over the past year, and really fallen in love with the artform. A couple of months ago, I picked up a [cloth mannequin](http://www.halloweenfxprops.com/full-size-dummy-mannequin-with-hands-fabric-cloth/) and added in a PVC skeleton with wire joints so that I could practice on it. Here's where you come in: Can you help me figure out how that mannequin can tell me - numerically - how tightly I'm tying it?

**Why I'd like a pressure readout:**

One of the hardest to develop skills in Kinbaku is the ability to accurately and reliably control rope tension. Basically, if you wrap a rope around someone's torso a couple of times and then add a knot, those ropes can be anywhere from Nearly Falling Off to Crushingly/Dangerously Tight. If you want to be good at this, you need to be able to apply rope at any level of tension within that range. If I can get numerical feedback from my practice dummy, that'd help me get much better at controlling tension.

**Where I'd like a pressure readout:**
In most standard Kinbaku ties, the arms are crossed behind the back, the wrists are tied together, and then the rope is wrapped 4 times around the upper half of the upper arms (roughly at armpit level), and 4 times around the middle of the upper arms (a bit above the bottom of the sternum). You can see that basic construction [over here](http://crash-restraint.com/blog/files/44.png)(No nudity, but I guess some workplaces might frown on it).

My goal is to figure out how tight those upper 4 wraps are, and separately, how tight those lower 4 wraps are. I figure there must be some way to install a pressure/compression sensor into the dummy at those spots and give me a numerical readout. 

**Mechanical/Electrical expertise:**

I have some technical background (did undergrad many moons ago as a mechanical engineer, didn't end up working in that field), but I'm not an electrical engineer or an experienced programmer. I've soldered stuff onto circuits before, I can follow detailed instructions on how to build devices/circuits, I know my way around a computer, and I took 1 semester of C programming (don't remember much, but understand the rough basics on how programming works). Happy to work at this and do research if you send me in the right direction (and ideally if you send me to tutorials), but would appreciate more details than ""Just program an Arduino to do it""

**Other possibly relevant thoughts:**

While it'd be nice to install these pressure sensors directly into my mannequin, it's not entirely necessary; if there's a way to rig sensors to a *roughly* torso-sized object that has a bit of give to it [stiffness between, say, a firm pillow up to firm rubber, but not as stiff as hard metal/wood], it'd be enough to let me practice tension. Thinking about it now, if there's a way to build an ""H"" out of wood (||------||), stick a sensor in the middle of that ""H"" (||----x----||), and then wrap that whole assembly in fabric or rubber or something until it has the size/elasticity of a torso, then that'd be enough. So if nothing's coming to mind with the full mannequin, how do I do *that*? What kind of sensor would I need, how does it work (How would you use/mount it to measure the compression in the middle of that ""H""?), and how do I get a number out of it?",AskEngineers,konto2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2sk1rp/how_do_i_install_a_pressurecompression_sensor/

62,Engineers: Help explain why this method of harnessing the energy of water pressure won't work,1421351781,"This is a concept I've had for awhile now, and I would love some feedback on problems with this system.  Please see here for a pic:  http://i.imgur.com/ciMtNPx.png

The basic concept is this:  Set a hollow cylinder at great water depth.  Inside this cylinder is a funnel, with a water turbine below the funnel outlet.  The extreme water pressure at depth, coupled with the reduced nozzle of the funnel output, should result in high water pressure to turn the water turbine, providing the means to generate electricity.  The glaring problem is how to recycle the water that enters the cylinder and get it OUT of the cylinder; it's impossible to eject it into the outside water as the outside water pressure won't allow that to happen.   

So, other than the problem of ejecting the spent water, what else is incorrect about this concept?  I am NOT an engineer of any kind, so please be gentle! :)


EDIT: 

Haha! Thanks so much for the responses. You've made me realize what an elementary idea this truly is. You all are correct, I basically described a hydroelectric dam, but in a much dumber way!
So let's instead consider this:
Would using the concept of extreme atmospheric pressure at great depths within the earth be a viable way to produce energy? Again, a drawing consistent with the abilities of a 4 year old: http://i.imgur.com/lFFNbqH.png
You drill a hole deeeeeep into the Earths crust, at two locations, connecting deep underground. Let's imagine we hire the guys that drill deep oil wells.
At one end of this connected hole/pipe, you pour in water. At the other end, somewhere not too deep, is a turbine.
The water is poured into this deep-as-fuck hole, and the increased temperature and pressure at depth turns the water to steam. The steam rises up through the other end of the pipe and allows the turbine to generate electricity.
Again, what are the physics problems with this concept? Am I grossly overestimating the ability of depth/heat to transform water to steam? Would the depth required to make this happen also make it impossible to reach with drilling? Would the hole collapse in upon itself?

71,Motorcycle steering linkage ideas? (fixed headset to offset suspended wheel),1421340950,"Basic mechanical engineering question about possible options for a linkage design, ideally looking for images I can use to guide my disign / construction.  

Am trying to figure out how I'm gonna set up the steering linkage for my home-built Hossack motorcycle front end.  My current plan for handlebars is to machine reducers for the motorcycle headset that allow me to run a bicycle headset inside the original motorcycle head tube.  I'd modify a bicycle fork to attach the steering linkages, or run them off the handlebars / handlebar clamp.

Here's a mock-up of the suspension system (without any steering in place).  http://imgur.com/a/qAPqy

The linkage designs I've for Hossack setups seen typically fall in two camps.  

One uses a headset directly above the upright, with a scissors link from the handlebar steering tube to the steered upright.  I could do this if I build a new headset (likely supported by a framework bolted to the side plates), but for ergonomic and cosmetic reasons, this is not an appealing solution.  AFAIK this induces some bump steer (IE, if the wheel moves up and down while the bars remain fixed, it changes orientation) that is proportional to the angle between the headset axis and the steering axis of the upright (normally quite small).

The other uses a drag link to steer.  To avoid bump steer, the rear (handlebar) ends of the drag link must be co-incident with the handlebar steering axis AND the rear pivots of one of the control arms (usually the upper), and the front drag link connection needs to be co-incident with the matching front control arm pivot.  My steering axis and pivot locations are not set up this way.  For the upper control arm it is close, but only by accident; making them an exact match would require some new parts.  The packaging near those upper pivots would also make placing steering components between them very difficult, and I don't want any steering components exterior to the plates.

74,Is power the most limiting factor during rolling (metalworking) ?,1421325743,"Hello
This is an old examquestion for one of my subjects. Im doubtful about my reasoning however, so ive come here.
Another variant of the question (or another question all together, im not sure??) is : ""someone said that turning up the power (doubling)  will be enough to double the thickness-reduction during rolling.



I know from my handbook that Power is related to the Forces, and that the perpendicular force of the rolls = the tangentr force x the friction coeficient. 
I also know the thicknessreduction capability is only limited by the frictioncoefficient (squared) times the radius of the rolling rolls. Is also noted that an increase of friction coefficient would bring about a larger force which would relate to a larger needed power.
So im extremely confused. Is power even a ""limiting"" factor? is it the biggest? why? If P inreases, doesnt that mean that the tangential force of the rolls on the metal will increase (which would lead to the resulting force pointing in such a location that the rolls will slip on the material (?)..
But if the friction increases, it always WILL increase the power but not the other way? Can a larger thickness reduction be brought about by increasing the radius of the rolls WITHOUT icnreasing friction (aka same contact surface?)?
Im terribly terribly confused, and the google has not been my friend. Ive tried asking other students but im sure the only answer i'll get on facebook from them is some patronizing sneers about how stupid i am, and surely ""this "" is the right answer, without answering why or how. Please help..

Then go ahead and bash. I'm not anywhere in the realm of engineering, but I was thinking about this a while ago. Decided I wanted to ask the opinion of actual engineers.

Recently I learned about the difference in spatial thinking/conceptualization abilities between men and women. One of my professors showed us an example horizontality test that was given to both men and women. There were multiple scenarios given, and then a question after each. My professor showed me these 2 scenarios:  [Horizontality Test](http://docdroid.net/p86k)

As you can see there is an astonishing difference between the genders when it comes to correctly answering something like this. Sadly I couldn't find the original study done, but I found a couple others to compensate.

[Study done with children on spatial orientation in the genders](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1206607)

At least to me, I think there is enough studies done to show males tend to have better spatial thinking than females. If you have any research that proves otherwise, please link it. Besides that, my question to you is: **How much do you think this mental component plays, if any, in the proportion of male to female engineers?**

One of the arguments against the difference in spatial reasoning playing a role in the gender ratio is the fact that females historically weren't taught anything in the realm of engineering. It was weird for women to be in this field. However, if you take a look at medicine, the historical context was a little similar. It was also dominated by men, but currently, there are more women in medical school than men now. [Just over 50%](https://www.aamc.org/download/277026/data/aibvol12_no1.pdf).

I am creating a small tracked unmanned ground vehicle with two driving pulleys/wheels (one on each side). I need to determine the right battery capacity for the brushless motor selected. I would like a run time of 30 minutes to 1 hour and average speed of 6 mph. I'm struggling with the process of doing this and would greatly appreciate any correction. Here is my understanding so far:

1.)	Determine mechanical power from torque and motor rpm

T = (mass of UGV)*(estimated acceleration from a desired speed in desired amount of time)*(wheel radius).

RPM = (motor kv)*(voltage of battery) 
This rpm value is without any load on the motor. How would I calculate the rpm with a load on the motor’s axle?

Power from rolling resistance force should probably be included. RRF= (weight of vehicle)*(rolling resistance coeff)*(vehicle speed)

2.)	Determine amp-hours

I found a [website]( http://www.powerstream.com/battery-capacity-calculations.htm) that explains how to convert watts to amps (See step A). Is this okay to do? Because I found mech power and I believe the website is referring to elec power.

I am thinking of using Scorpion HK-4015-1450kv brushless outrunner motor. I know these are usually used for helicopters, but someone helping me with this project picked them out. Is there a type of motor that has lower Kv that would work better with a slower moving ground vehicle?

95,Why do all people getting excited about 3D printing seem to ignore the principles of the economies of scale?,1421234457,"I'm an engineering student so yeah, it's hard for me not to get excited about 3D printing. What I am absolutely baffled about is how so many people, 'experts' even can be as naive as to say that additive manufacturing on local scales will change the way things are produced forever.

3D printing is great for prototyping, for manufacturing complex shapes in low volumes, for adding complexity to designs without adding the cost. I do even see the place of an industrial 3D printer as one of the tools available in an industrial workshop. But the 3D printer isn't here to replace machining, or injection moulding. To create better, more efficient moulds, yes. But not to replace those processes.

People waning custom objects? Perhaps. But even when we get to the point of being able to print, say, an entire mobile phone... Just think for a second. What will most people want? A phone of their own weird signature shape, or a phone that was produced professionally with suitable process and quality control AND is half the price of the former?

0,[Thermodynamics/Mechanical] Why can a 4-cyl turbo engine with X HP and torque seem to be more fuel efficient than a 6-cyl that produces the same power?,1421202026,"In light of some announcements at the Detroit Auto Show, I'm trying to get a themodynamically-influenced viewpoint on why smaller displacement engines with turbos will be able to produce the power of a larger, naturally aspirated engine.  When I've tried researching this question, I get answers like this: 

""With new technology, manufacturers can now achieve superior outputs with smaller-displacement engines, allowing the vehicles to hold onto their fuel efficiency"" - http://www.briggsauto.com/blog/4-cylinder-turbo-vs-6-cylinder-engine/

That's a load of negative net entropy to me.  I'm coming from a chemistry background, so in my view, the power that an engine produces at the crank with a particular engine design is mostly dependent on amount of fuel that is burned, regardless of total combustion chamber volume.

Total displacement is a good *starting* indicator of how much fuel an engine will gulp, but compressors like turbos and superchargers blow away that expectation.  The capacity for work comes entirely from the enthalpy created by the fuel combustion, so I therefore a expect a 2.0L 4-cyl turbo rated at 200HP (at some RPM) to gulp a comparable amount of fuel to a naturally aspirated 3.0L 6-cyl rated at 200HP (at some RPM).  Sure, the 4-cyl has a smaller displacement, but it also has a compressor ramming in more air (and therefore more gas is also injected), and since they both produce the same power, I expect the total enthalpy of combustion of these two engines to be comparable, and therefore the fuel consumption to also be comparable.

What am I missing?  I know that a 4-cyl will have a smaller crankshaft inertia, but that's all I can think of, so I have to be missing something big.  It seems like 4-cyl turbos, if you drive them nice, often easily reach 40mpg, whereas 6-cyl driven vehicles barely hit 30 if you drive them nice.  Maybe car mass?

Using displacement as an explanation for engine efficiency is like only using volumes in chemistry.  Sure, it's a great starting point, but the important thing in the engine is the quantity of fuel combusted, just as the important thing in chemistry is the mass.",AskEngineers,amdreallyfast,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2scsg1/thermodynamicsmechanical_why_can_a_4cyl_turbo/

8,Is software dev. or IT a reasonable hope when graduating with an EE degree? (USA - undergrad),1421193096,"Hi engineers of reddit. 

Background: I'm in the USA and finishing up a 4-year undergrad EE program (pure EE, not CE). I'm teaching myself C, know Python ok, and have 2-years intern experience with VHDL, FPGAs, and Assembly. I have a 3.8 GPA. I'm very interested in embedded software design -- or really any software. 

Context: All the jobs I'm finding with big engineering places are looking for weird experience (fiberoptics, high-speed analog, etc, etc). In addition, most software jobs advertise continuing education while EE jobs seem like they're just going to throw you into whatever and say, 'good luck'. The software atmosphere seems much more modern and fun -- but maybe that depends on location. So I'm considering IT or Software. 

Questions:

Would I be missing essential skills that would limit my abilities in a software role? I can learn tools and languages easily enough, but I'm thinking more fundamentals. Will people hire someone with an EE degree?

Should I take a few semesters of Comp-sci courses? 

Do most electronics-oriented jobs really just toss new hires to the wolves?

9,Why are oil tankers cost-competitive with oil depots in oil storage?,1421192156,"I'm not totally certain I've got the right subreddit for this: it seemed too industry-specific for /r/AskSocialScience's economists, and there isn't an /r/AskEnergy or similar. It occurred to me that there may be some petroleum engineers around here who can answer my question: if you can suggest another subreddit to ask it in, that would also be welcome.

I recently read a [news article](http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/crude-oil-seen-stored-on-tankers-in-2015-as-contango-widens/) about a global oil trading strategy in which traders lease oil tankers to store crude oil in, hoping to later resell the oil when prices rise.

This surprised me a great deal, since I know that onshore oil depots/tank farms exist. A tanker must devote space, materials, design expertise, labor, and other costly resources towards things that *aren't* safely storing oil, such as remaining afloat, moving from place to place, providing living space for its crew, etc. By contrast, an onshore oil tank just has to sit there, not leak, and be able to pump its contents elsewhere when the time comes, which seems like it would be far less expensive per unit of oil stored to design, build and run.

But apparently there are people out there willing to lease perfectly good oil tankers for the purpose of just sitting there and waiting. Why? Is land close to oil shipping routes just that expensive? Are stationary oil tanks more expensive to build and maintain than I'm giving them credit for, such that the oil-storage component of a tanker makes up an overwhelming majority of its capital and operating costs? Is there some kind of regulatory asymmetry, such that you can make environmental tradeoffs in a tanker that you can't in an oil depot?",AskEngineers,Toptomcat,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2sc7hv/why_are_oil_tankers_costcompetitive_with_oil/

20,How much money can I ask for a design (very little exerience in working as an engineer),1421174564,"I'm currently in my last year for a bsc. in Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft in the Netherlands. I work for a small business(unrelated to engineering) which provides a safe environment for kids to play at. The business is gaining a lot of investments to build more of these environments. It just so happens that there is a construction that has to be in every establishment, and the guys that designed it have done a horrible job so far (my boss). 

I'm on good terms with my boss and he knows that I'm studying Aerospace Engineering. He wants to have a better/cheaper design that fits the requirements and would be easy to build in all environments. This weekend he asked me if I could make him an optimal design, but without mentioning any compensation. I'm really excited to work on this project since it will be the first time I can put my knowledge to use. I just finished the last course of a series for structural analysis and design and I have the complete method on paper. The problem I need to optimize is about as complicated as the exercises I've done so far. My boss will be using this design for all the establishments that are built from now on, so there is a lot to gain for him.

To solve the problem I'm going to use Matlab for optimizing and solidworks/catia for the technical drawings. All these licences are freely available from my university, I guess that's part of where my college tuition goes. Anyway, I'm willing to make big work of this design process to get the optimal solution... but not for free. Now, I'm not going to ask the price a normal company would demand but I see this as a big opportunity and I want to make the most out of it. For the design process I will be using expensive software and ofcourse knowledge obtained through one of the (if not the) hardest engineering programmes available here, so I think I could ask quite a bit of money for this. Note that the construction will be built a lot (at least 50 units) and a single construction costs about 10000 euros.

After asking around I was told I could easily ask 50 euros an hour for this, but I need some point of reference before I start making big claims with 0 support. I estimate this will take about 30-40 hours of work which would come down to max 2000 euros. I would be greatful if anyone could give me some insight or point of reference for this.

21,Problem on how to dispense a single particle of sand at a time.,1421173906,"I am working with a professor of mine on a microscopic particle accelerator. We have most components thus far, but my problem is trying to dispense one particle of sand that is approximately 200 microns in diameter.

The idea I have involves using an actuator to push a metal plate that has a funnel containing the particles in it. Imagine the funnel is just resting on the plate, and slightly to the side there is a slit that is 200 microns wide. As an actuator pushes the plate, the slit would slide underneath of the funnel, hopefully only allowing time for one particle to fall through. A loose diagram of what I'm talking about is below.

http://imgur.com/76nwSK0

The only problem I can think with this is it is not very precise, and there could be plenty of room for error in terms of the funnel getting jammed or too many particles falling at a time.

I don't have a real grasp of this subject, but from some text-books I've figured out the following, and mainly, I just want to ensure what I'm doing is correct. •Mass Flow Rate Density x Surface Area x Velocity Density = pRT, so I assume I'd take P1, and divide by (T1 x Universal Gas Constant) Surface Area = (Pi x D12)/4 Velocity = Provided as part of the experiment.

Velocity Continuity Equation = p1A1V1=p2A2V2 Now that I have p1 and A1 from the previous part, I should be able to rearrange to get V1? I'm assuming this would be the same for V3, V4?

Each controller, has 2 RS232 and 2 IR outputs to control equipment.

Each controller will connect to their projector, using one IR output. They will turn on/off the projector, and change the input from VGA to HDMI depending of the need. The inputs comes from connectivity plates at the front where the screens are. Each room has one wall plate with HDMI and VGA inputs.

To use the rooms individually there is no problem.

The problem comes when they open the rooms moving the removable walls at the middle. They then want to see the same image in both projectors. Thats way I thought of adding the HDMI and VGA matrixes, and then call the inputs from the room controllers.

The thing is, the matrixes receive commands from RS232. Each room controller has 2 RS232 outputs, but I want to control them with any of those. 

With IR for the projectors I can make a button to just send the command to one IR output, or both outputs if I want to change the input on both projectors (connecting the IR output 2 to the other projector), but with RS232 I need to put a wire between the matrixes and the controllers, but I want to interconnect both controllers to the same matrixes.

45,Any engineers out there have experience with Japanese Engineering companies? (Operating in the US),1421079271,"I recently was hired on with a Japanese engineering firm, who designs/manufactures assembly and inspection equipment. They are expanding their company into America, and were looking for someone to bring in to assist in the expansion of their company here in the United States. The explanation was that I would work in Installation and Service (among many other things, sales, marketing, etc.) while the company is transitioning here (they already have some clients in my area), and then would transition into a management role when we hire new Installation and Service employees, etc.

Since starting, I have started to have some growing concerns,

First of all, out of all of the Japanese companies that are operating in the US that I have now interacted with (current/upcoming customers), 6 in total, have all had their management comprised of 100% Japanese staff, with all of the workers (engineers to average line workers) have been American staff. I have not had contact with, or seen a single American manager in any of these companies.

Secondly, I have also learned that in the other locations that my company has expanded (China and Indonesia) the management teams are all Japanese, and the workers are Chinese and Indonesian, respectively.

During the interview process, I discussed travel with them, and from what I can tell so far, the amount, and duration of travel (especially outside my metropolitan area) was GREATLY lied about. Only two of the current customers are within the metropolitan area. I am really not happy about this situation.

I have experienced some situations where they do not seem to think that I am an Engineer, or that I have any knowledge in Engineering, though my past experience contradicts that. On one occasion, the Vice President (he is currently the only other employee here in the States) was trying to explain an Air Cylinder to me, just a simple Pneumatic Air Cylinder, and was telling me that it's complicated and I can register for training... I was trying to explain to him that I understand perfectly fine, but he seemed to believe it was out of the realm of possibility. I have heard from some others that Japanese Engineers tend to not take much stock in the ability and aptitude of American (and any other) Engineers, has anyone had any experience with this?

Another reason for some concern is that, there is literally nothing for me to do. I am currently just looking over some drawings for some equipment that a Japanese employee is coming to install this week, but aside from that, there is nothing to do, and he doesn't know what to tell me. I am supposed to attend training in Japan for 3-6 months, but when I try and talk to him about it, he doesn't have any information on when that is supposed to happen.

Part of these issues could steam from a lack of strong English by the other employee that is located here in the US right now, but his English is not so poor that he cannot have simple conversation, etc.

I guess to sum up my concerns, I am concerned that perhaps this company is just using me, and has no intention of ever moving me upwards in the organization when the time comes, but will just move in a Japanese employee. I do intend to ask them these questions, which could obviously just be lied about, but I wanted to try and see how others felt as well.

Also, I have looked into whether or not it's a requirement for a corporation to have at least one permanent resident, or citizen for eligibility purposes (I would assume the VP just has a Visa or something) but was unable to find any information, it doesn't appear so, but I was unable to find a concrete answer. I could see this both being, and not being a thing, so I figured I'd ask, in case that is the motive of some sort.

I am 16 years old, from Israel. In the future I'm pretty sure I'd like to study engineering, but I'm not sure about the specific field. Right now, in school, I am majoring in Computer Science and Chemistry (didn`t take Physics because I was too lazy to stay the extra couple hours a week, a mistake, because Physics seem really interesting. Chemistry is fine and easy but still, Physics seems way more interesting). Obviously I'm also in AP Math.

As part of the Computer Science major, which I complete this year (11th grade) I can also continue to a program that, I think, translates to Software Engineering. After I finish that (end of 12th grade) I need to go to the army and because I'm taking the CS major with the Software Engineering thing, I can get into a special program in which I take a few university courses for a year and then I get placed in one of the IDF cyber divisions. Then during the rest of my service there I also continue studying and in the end of the 3 years I finish my service with a diploma (which I believe translates to a bachelors degree, not sure. It's called 1st degree in Hebrew). After that I have to sign on for 1 more year of service, continuing whatever post I had. 

In the end I will be 23, with a CS degree and 3 years of experience in the IDF. The thing is, while I believe that can be totally satisfying I also understand that job security in the programming business isn`t that good.

I am also interested in Electrical Engineering - like, what turns all the 1s and 0s we get in the form of electricity to, well, everything modern technology is -- 3D graphics, complex mathematical algorithms, communication between two pieces of hardware over wireless signals and all that stuff.

56,Materials Engineers: Do I need a Masters degree in today's economy?,1421034250,"Hello,

I am currently studying Materials Engineering in Canada, and according to my fellow students (and some coworkers at my current internship) most materials undergrad students normally end up going into a masters program.

Personally, I'm not as enthusiastic about materials as I should be. I am much more interested in the business side of engineering rather than the technical (i.e. R&amp;D) side. I'm also worried that I won't get into a masters program due to my subpar GPA. However, it is my understanding that most materials engineer are in the R&amp;D division.

What I'm currently struggling with is whether or not I should switch to mechanical engineering (I've enjoyed my previous internship as a mechanical field engineer). The pros are: 

- much more broad field/not stuck in research
- more hands on work
- don't necessarily need a graduate degree..?
- I enjoyed my construction/field engineer position a lot more than my current R&amp;D materials internship (both the people and large-scale project appealed to me more)


The cons are:

- I'll be wasting 2 years worth of materials courses
- tuition is expensive
- ME has an intense course load 

Furthermore, I need to remember it's only 1 co-op position, so I shouldn't expect everything to be like that in the future. Ideally, I graduate with a Materials degree and maybe go into another industry... but to be honest I'm not even sure what I want/like to do anymore. 

So, my question is whether or not my thinking is foolish. I'm not really sure what the economy/industry is like out there. Based on my two internships, I want to say I like the mechanical industry more, but I can't be sure all mechanical jobs are like that. So I guess it boils down to if it's possible to find other work with a materials undergrad degree?

Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this! I'm so sorry it's so messy. I'm very confused right now and sort of just typing out my thoughts :)

EDIT: One more thing, my perception of ME degree (probably biased) is that while it's a very heavy course load, they get to build/design projects (such as automatic cars etc) and that's what intrigues me. At my last co-op at a construction site, I was happy watching things get built / fixing problems along the way. However, am I simply glorifying Mech engineers career?

What kind of degrees/certifications are recommended?  Am I looking at a 1 yr certification, associates, or do I need a Masters?

Is a PE a requirement or a benefit for this type of work?  It seems like it wouldn't be a requirement at most companies.

What kinds of roles are there that bridge the gap between manufacture and engineering?  I've seen some shops that do rapid prototyping for various companies, which sounds like it would be interesting.

70,"IT major here, engineering has always been in the back of my head. Should I just give that thought up?",1421009809,"I'm currently in an Information Technology transfer program at my local community college. I really love working with computers and with the little IT work I have done I know I will be happy in this career. However the thought of becoming an engineer has always been present in my mind.

Obviously this is no where close to what actual engineers deal with but I LOVED this class. I love to build things and see how they come together, create something, and in this class I got to work with Turbo CAD (a really easy and fun program in my opinion), and build physical stuff as well. I don't want to sound cocky but I was one of the fastest learners in the class and the teacher really wanted me to pursue engineering after I graduated.

Right now I am trying to make up for that, currently working on a pre-college math class to finally learn most of the basics I half assed in school and I am doing quite well. The thing is I still kind of want to become an engineer but the math classes scare me as I have never dealt with anything close to the advanced math classes that an engineer major has to take and it scares me that I might not make it and waste my time. 

Please, I'm asking for some help and advice here. I don't want to go through college pursuing the wrong career and regret it afterward but I also don't want to fail out of another degree.

78,How to determine acceleration of body powered by electric motor?,1420992968,"Let's say you have a small 4 wheeled toy with power provided by a DC motor on the rear wheels. You power the motor at its max voltage. As I understand, a typical DC motor would provide its max torque at that voltage and draw the largest amount of current. As the toy speeds up (RPM increases), the torque and current begin to decrease until it reaches max speed. 

Assuming what I said above is correct: 

1. Is it possible to calculate the acceleration from 0 to max speed by knowing only the torque-rpm relationship? It seems unlikely because the torque is decreasing as the toy speeds up, and I don't see a way to determine how long this takes. 

2. At max speed, would the torque provided by the motor equal the torque from friction at the wheels, drag etc? I would assume so because otherwise the toy would accelerate forever.

90,How to Engineer a Tower of Spinning Boxes,1420929451,"Hello and thanks for taking a look! I hope this is the right place to solicit some advice. 

I'm designing a display and need some advice about the best practices for making six stacked boxes independently spin.
Here's a helpful image:
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/kRkYvZ0.png)
*
Each box is is 29"" wide, 29"" deep, and 22"" tall.

*This is for a retail display, so the RPMs will be in the 2-4 range.
 
* Three will spin clockwise and three counter-clockwise, and a little variance in the RPMs would be nice (perhaps speed control could be used to dial this in?) 

* Powered by 110 A/C.

* They will probably run for 2 weeks continuously at a time, 10 hours/ day. 

* This will be a small run and everything will be built to specification in a shop will full metal and wood fabrication options.

These are my thoughts:

1. Start with a central shaft of 2"" diameter tube, .25"" wall, steel. This will be welded to a heavy steel base plate for ballast. The power to each motor will run through this tube.

2. The boxes will be built out of plywood or MDF, with the appropriate shaft holes at top and bottom. Boxes can have open tops, removable panels, etc. as necessary.

3. The boxes will be connected to the shaft via [square flange shaft bearings] (http://www.mcmaster.com/#5967k93/=ves95m) (designed for a 2"" shaft).

4. Motor, drive, gearing. This is where I'm hung up. My gut feeling is to aim for a simple solution like an A/C gear motor mounted to the shaft, with a rubber friction drive wheel pressing down onto the bottom of the box. My concern with this is that the wheel will be pressing down on one side of the box, creating an imbalance. Could I solve this by adding an opposing idler wheel? What motor should I use. What drive wheel? Should I use two inexpensive motors, one for each side of the box? Is it okay to mount a drive wheel directly to a motor shaft?  So many options. So many questions.

What do you think?
Is there a ready-made, ""off-the-shelf"" solution to this problem? Can you point me towards an Amazon/ McMaster Carr/ Grainger link for the perfect product to solve this? Am I way off track and out of my league? What am I forgetting?

Yes, I have watched the recent Cornell/TEDxTU-Delft videos with professors who have ~studied this, as well as a few others. (TEDxTU-Delft: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y4mbT3ozcA, Cornell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcZCzr9ExKk)

Historically, people have said it is because of conservation of angular momentum, and the castor effect, both of which have been proven mathematically and shown experimentally as not necessary for a bike to stabilize itself (without a rider).  It has also been shown that bikes whose front wheel is not allowed to turn, will not stay upright.

To stabilize itself, a riderless bike, when falling to one side, turns its front wheel into that side which results in the bike turning, and coming back upright.  Two questions on this:

#1. If the front wheel has no castor effect (i.e. the point of contact of the front tire is directly below the turning axis of the front wheel such that a force at this point of contact cannot cause a moment about this turning axis), how/why does the wheel turn when falling without a rider?

*Note on #1: If the turning axis is not directly above the point of contact, this turning makes sense since a centrifugal force would result on a moment about the turning axis when falling.  This occurs for stationary bikes when they begin to fall and are slightly disturbed in one direction or the other*

#2. Why does the wheel turning cause the bike to be forced upright? Is it due to just centrifugal force? I can't seem to find anything explaining this with Dynamics equations or even vectors.

Relevant equations that are perhaps unintuitive would be extremely beneficial, I can't seem to find any except behind paywalls for a couple of papers on the topic.  This question has been keeping me up at night! Help/peace of mind would be greatly appreciated!

I live on the 7th floor of an apartment building and on my balcony I have some wind chimes to scare the pigeons away. It occurred to me today that the chimes are always ringing so there is a fair bit of wind there.

After seeing that wind turbine garden in Paris I'm thinking I can make a vertical wind turbine to harvest some of that energy. Vertical because the wind frequently changes directions and it would be easier to place.

I'd connect the turbine to a small 12v heater to heat my living room. That way I don't have to deal with electrical storage.


I want to do this right so before I go off printing the turbine on a 3d printer and making a stupid mistake I want to get some input. I'm a software engineer focused on machine learning and autonomous robots so this is slightly outside my field of expertise.

The idea is use a 3d printed blades and connect it to some sort of motor but I have some questions:

- what kind of motor? brushed DC? Won't the brushes wear down really fast? Stepper???

I have a flat area on my dashboard that is squarish, except all the sides are slight curves and the corners have fillets of different radii. I have measured and guessed and printed 1:1 and re-measured, etc and it never matches up. I'd like to CNC an aluminum plate that matches it perfectly (as far as inspection with the naked eye goes). This is a pretty simple shape as far as curved things go, there must be a better solution than trial and error?


I have a small CNC mill and I could potentially make batches and sell these plates online so I'd even like to hear about paid services. Maybe my university has some kind of scanner? The plate would end up engraved with room for toggle switches, itd be a $15 product that makes toggle switches look neat on a dashboard.


I've tried several raster to vector programs but can't find anything that actually works. The vectors are short lines instead of curves which makes for a rough edge when CNC milling.

18,How hard would it be to design aircraft engines with a fire once emergency afterburner (rocket) mode?,1420799958,"That would of course quickly burn through the remaining fuel; the purpose would be to dramatically increase thrust rendering the current fatal stall irrelevant and give the plane a chance at landing somewhere instead of crashing (because pilots don't have enough time to figure what is wrong for instance). (I have in mind AF447 and the recent AirAsia crash (in all likelihood))

e.g plane is falling down, few hundred feets off the ground, major spin/deep stall, pilots haven't figured out what's wrong yet, going to crash even if pilots figure what to do because they are not high enough. 

So they pull the emergency rocket mode that would probably destroy the engines using them as afterburners but help them recover from the dive,  gain altitude, before choosing a good spot to (crash)land, dramatically increasing chances of survival.

edit: maybe rocket mode, followed by optional jettisoning of the engines afterwards, (if flying over sea) to increase flying range after pulling that handle. how cool is that!

23,Are there any good resources on design for manufacturability of both electronics and enclosures for them?,1420788034,"I've been noodling around with an idea for a gadget for awhile, writing software, laying out circuits, scribbling out drawings on graph paper, etc. and I'm increasingly thinking I'd like to put it on Kickstarter and turn into a product. Without getting into the details too much, it's an electronic good that you connect to your computer, the size of pretty much every other random electronic gadget you might expect to find on a desktop (router, modem, desktop amps, audio interfaces, etc.). Bigger than a smartphone, smaller than an oscilloscope. 

I'd like it to have a more premium feel, and therefore likely a metal (probably aluminum), non-sheetmetal (or at least not thin sheet metal that's folded together...like you might find in a typical ATX power supply) enclosure and I'd like to attempt to do everything myself as much as is reasonably possible both as a learning experience and as a cost saving measure (ignoring the cost of my time unless it's absolutely ridiculously inefficient compared to paying someone). There are some pre-made enclosures that seem vaguely viable, but I think a custom one is preferable for my uses so long as it is not absurdly impractical. Plus, even if it is absurdly impractical, I'd like to learn at what point it isn't. (How many Mac Minis does Apple have to make before it becomes profitable for them to use a housing like that?, etc.)

I have an...I suppose reasonable hobbiest understanding of all/most of the fields involved, and I think have a technical mind with a willingness to learn, but I come from a software background, not a physical one, so I'm trying to find information on how these things are done at scale, and the considerations and costs involved in bringing a product to market. I'm having issues finding that sort of information online compared to information on how to make something functional on an individual prototype level. 

It's also frustratingly difficult to find ballpark estimates for costs for the manufacturing of a simple mechanical component. Most of the companies advertising their services want you to request a quote, which I suppose makes sense for them to do, but I'm not at that point yet, and I don't want to ask a business to hand hold me through the design process. What I have found so far is that people will discuss relative costs, IE ""die casting is quite expensive for low volume sand casting has a lower tooling cost, but a higher per part cost at volume"", but I'd love for an actual example rundown of a couple different items comparing the same basic shape/purpose with different methods. 

Obviously exact numbers will vary by the manufacturer themselves, the exact specifics of the object and the time that the resource was written, but something as general as ""An aluminum 10cm hollow cube with 3mm thick walls that you can screw the bottom onto will cost more than $5 and less than $15 if you make a thousand of them by die casting."" or ""You can reasonable expect a trained worker in China to put on 100 panel mount switches in an hour for $3 an hour, or $10 an hour in America, or a rate of X for $Y an hour if you have someone set up a machine to do it, but that will have a fixed setup cost of $Z"" would be extremely helpful. (All of those numbers are numbers I don't *really* know, but last example has variables because I couldn't even hazard a non-embarrassing guess. Though that doesn't mean my existing guesses might not be embarrassing too.)

Are there any good books or videos or resources of some sort for general best practices and general expectations in this regard? For electronics or the mechanical aspects? My Google Fu has been failing me for the most part. [I've found this video series and it's very helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXE_dh38HjU), I'd love to find other things like it as it applies both to that field in other ways, and as it applies to the manufacturing of enclosures and the like. Or hell, I find the whole thing very interesting; if you know of an exceptional resource about the manufacturing of anything, I'd love to take a look.

Another question I have is if I were to learn all I need to learn and do all that needs to be done, in my position as still a relative layman (IE I didn't go to school for it and don't have any experience with it), would you hire a consultant for any of the relevant disciplines? If so, how much would you expect to pay/would you charge to look it over and say ""Yeah, you're not going to find out in 6 months that 80% of them will break because you designed this like a moron."" or ""Yeah, you designed that like a moron. You should do this instead.""?

So as mentioned in the previous thread, I was to negotiate my lowball salary ($40k) to a reasonable amount after 6 months which I was hoping to be at least $50k (PEO states average starting is $55k). Today, after a month of my boss delaying my performance review, he decided that we should negotiate a salary in 3 months from now instead. My performance review itself was done today and he said he was really happy with my work and had no complaints but right now he can't afford to give me a raise (despite him taking yet another short vacation somewhere next week).

I'm pretty shaken up by this. I've worked hard and long hours to prove myself and I've improved many things in the office my coworkers would have never figured out. Everyone gets along with me and every coworker was impressed at how quickly I picked things up. I don't understand why he is doing this and it is really boiling my blood. My friends at other companies are getting 50-60k and I can't help but wonder things like if it's because I'm a coloured person that I'm getting paid less and taken advantage of. I mean I did not go bust my balls in engineering just so I can get paid less than a technical writer.

I held off looking for work for the past two months because I wanted to focus and give it my all but now I feel like a fool for doing that. All I've been doing all day is getting my updated resume ready and looking for places to apply (Vancouver's looking really nice right about now). Is there any steps I should take? I feel like I should talk to my boss again and make it firm that I think 3 months is completely unreasonable and goes against what we discussed. Not that I won't be actively looking for employment as this situation has left a really bad taste in my mouth. Another thing I found out which makes me hate working for this place now is that I found out the new guy we hired (who I've taken the initiative to train properly), is getting screwed more than me as in he has to do a month of unpaid training.

My EIT membership expired but I'm thinking of renewing it just for the sake of logging in my EIT hours before I quit to avoid getting potentially screwed as that would not surprise me at all. I'm moving out in the spring and was hoping this raise would help with my finances but now things are looking grim.

44,Fabric Structure Engineer Salary Negotiation,1420736750,"Hi.. I graduate in May 2015 with a Civil Engineering major and a Chinese minor from Lehigh University. I got offered a job with a small firm in Eastern Pennsylvania as an engineer who specializes in fabric structures. Firstly, I'm not sure if having a civil engineering degree going for a structural engineering job already gives them an excuse to offer a lower salary, I'm just completely clueless about what I'm worth as an employee. It is an EIT position. I think being a fabric structure engineer and not just a civil or structural engineer makes a difference. My meeting is next Tuesday. Can anyone give me any insight on what salary I should expect and how to negotiate if it's too low?

Thank you!

49,I'm designing an electromagnet and don't feel confortable with the numbers I'm getting.,1420721577,"
Hi everyone. I've forgotten most of what I once knew about electromagnetism and  I'm mostly following wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet#Closed_magnetic_circuit

Using what materials I have easily available, I'm trying to get an electromagnet to hold a bar being pulled by springs exerting about 150N.  
Since the tip of the bar has a ""small"" contact area, I'm assuming the magnetic pole area will be small enough that the magnetic field saturation (1.6T) will be the limiting factor (eq.3).   
For a coil made of 2 layers of 50 turns of AWG 23 wire and an iron core, I'm reaching saturation at just about 0.3 A, which sounds very small. This leads to a force of about 420 N (eq.4) so it would be more than enough, but I'm still not really trusting a machine that consumes so little power (0.4-0.5 w) to be able to lift 15kg.

Then again, I've never worked with electromagnetism before. I haven't taken into account a few possible power inefficiencies yet, but I don't think thats my issue yet. Does anyone know if my numbers are sort of reasonable or where should I be looking for mistakes? I can provide more details if required.

My question is: Is it possible to design a system, utilising a handful of receiving basestations with known position, that would be able to locate the platform with milimeter precision?

A first idea I had would be to somehow determine AoA using the peaks and dips in the interference pattern then calculating the position based on that.

54,Question about centripetal acceleration.,1420685321,"I've been trying to figure out this problem, but no textbook, video, or article has covered this specific issue.

We all know the standard centripetal force formula which is 

    F = mv^2/r

However, we are only ever explained this concept with respect to a constant radius, constant velocity object, or the centre of the circle is stationary. So in the case of a spinning wheel, all forces are effectively cancelled and there is no net force on the wheel.

What if, instead, we have non-constant velocity or radius, or the centre of the circle is moving; for example, a rolling wheel. That is, the wheel is turning and moving forward at a certain velocity (see crappy diagram).

http://i.imgur.com/CByAQTd.jpg

In this case, the instantaneous centre of rotation is in fact at the bottom of the wheel since it has no velocity at that point; the wheel is rotating about the axle only relative to the moving frame of reference. At the same time, the top of the wheel is moving at twice the velocity of the centre of rotation.

Since we have different velocities around the circumference of the wheel, there should (from `F=mv^2/r`) be a greater force acting at the top of the wheel than the bottom (see other crappy diagram).

http://i.imgur.com/WczFei1.jpg

Does this mean there is a net downward force acting on the wheel? If not, why?

Edit:
OK I just did it in my head and it made sense. If there is no force at the bottom *and* no velocity, then it would be impossible to then accelerate the particle off the ground since it has no momentum.

I'm trying to find an explanation as to how gyroscopes work ([specifically this wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H98BgRzpOM)), because the simple explanation of ""conservation of angular momentum"" and ""precession"" weren't sufficient:

- Looking through textbooks, it's often explained by saying that conservation of angular momentum causes precession, or that the precession is caused by conservation of angular momentum, so we end up with cyclical reasoning

- Some sources simply explain the mechanics behind gyroscopic precession, but don't explain why precession causes the wheel to create an opposing torque to gravity. Conservation of angular momentum is great, but there is always a torque due to gravity, so logically the precession must be doing something to generate a counter-torque along that axis.

My hypothesis was that the precession of the wheel causes the wheel to experience an unbalanced force, which is what generates the counter-torque, but that's not true. So I'm still looking for a physical answer that's more than just ""because conservation of angular momentum"".",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2rp9fm/question_about_centripetal_acceleration/

56,Using bacterial cellulose as a building material -- plausible?,1420680840,"Hello! I recently saw the TED Talk on [""Growing Your Clothes""](http://www.ted.com/talks/suzanne_lee_grow_your_own_clothes?language=en), in which a SCOBY environment is used to generate cellulose to fashion clothing out of.

The idea that comes to mind is using compressed layers of this cellulose in various patterns to create load bearing materials, such as that seen in organic structures like trees. 

Is this something that is plausible, and if so, something that a high schooler (soon to be studying Mechanical Engineering and Astrophysics at UofL) could investigate and fabricate?

75,"I sort of hate my job. Should I move on, or stay and see if it improves?",1420606870,"I accepted my first job out of college last August at a small company that designs and manufactures microphones. Not really what I had in mind, but I thought it could be a great experience since they do all their design work, most of their manufacturing, and even some R&amp;D in-house. They do a lot of plastic injection molding, and they make some of their molds on a 4-axis CNC which is a process I’d really like to learn about in detail.

I am now about 5 months in and I often thing about quitting. I’ve done very little work that I would call ‘engineering’, and most days I do 8 hours of assembly-line tasks. Sometimes it seems as though they don’t even need any additional engineers (they have an M.E. and an E.E. who have both been there a while before I was hired). They’re paying me very little ($15/hr), but I’m giving them the benefit of the doubt and attributing that to the fact that I’m still a temp worker (I should make the transition to permanent around the 6 month mark). Regardless, I can’t help but feel like they’re wasting my skills and my time, I know there are other companies out there that would hire me and pay me a reasonable engineer’s salary for doing an actual engineer’s work.

I’ll likely stay there at least until the 6 month mark. At that point, I’m told I’ll receive a raise and benefits. I’m somewhat doubtful the raise will be satisfactory, and I’m fairly certain I’ll still be spending much of my time doing assembly line tasks. It also would not surprise me if I didn’t even get a raise at this point; they don’t tell me much. I have a second job as a Lyft driver in San Francisco, and I make a lot more money doing that, so sometimes I wonder if I should quit my microphone job so I’ll have more time for job hunting and Lyft driving.

I’m always on the lookout for a new job, but I’m not having much luck. I got my current job because a recruiter saw my resume on careerbuilder.com, so I’m inclined to upload the latest version (on LinkedIn as well) and see what comes from that. I’ve given up applying online through job searching websites, nobody ever replies. I think I’d be better off speaking to someone face-to-face. I’ve been trying to find resources online pertaining to places I could go, and so far I’ve found eventbrite.com, Lemnos Labs, and a couple other startup incubators, as well as ASME. Any advice on finding companies or events that I could physically go to and speak with (or any job searching advice / stories) would be appreciated.

I think my resume is pretty good, considering my lack of work experience, but oh how I hate writing cover letters.

I’ve seen a few people post on Reddit saying that if someone finds them a job, they will pay the finder X%, or $X of their first paycheck(s). Does that work? I’d be happy to pay a fellow Redditor if they would do that for me.

I'm looking for some advice on **gearing** and motor interfacing, hopefully with some example parts. Let me walk you through my design so far to make sure it makes sense, and I'll list the parts I've already picked out. My main goal is to meet the torque/speed requirements and stay as inexpensive as possible.

(Warning - this post is a bit involved; it's become my side project / obsession. My background is that of a software engineer learning mechanics with the goal of building robot parts.)

-----------------------------

Here are the key performance requirements: the motor will be attached to a rigid rod of length 0.6m, and at the end of the rod it will need to move/rotate a mass of 6kg at a speed of no less than **0.75sec per 60 degrees**. This is the max torque I will need (at that given speed), and expect to operate on average maybe a third of that torque.

Using tau = r*m*g = 0.6m*6kg*9.81m/s², we see that the required torque is **35.316 Nm**. 

Power: using a speed of 0.75sec per 60 deg, or angular velocity w = 1.396 rad/s, P = tau*w which at that peak operating point described above is **49.31 W**.

For my design I need to keep it as inexpensive as possible, so I found this DC motor: http://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/banebots-rs-550-motor-12v-19300rpm.html 

Key specs: 19300rpm no load speed, 70.55 oz-in (0.498 Nm) stall torque. Using the 70% efficiency and doing a max power calculation at half the stall torque (and w), I see that power this motor could output is 0.7*(0.498/2)*((19300/2)*2*pi/60 = **176 W**, well within my application's desired power. Maybe I could have a stricter speed requirement and require it to rotate faster.

To hit the torque of 35.316 Nm - at the motor's peak power output point - it would seem I need a gearing ratio of 35.316/(0.498/2) ~ 142:1. However, I see that the motor efficiency is 70%, and knowing nothing about the gears to be used, someone online (no citation) said I should assume they have 50% efficiency to be safe. To account for this means to increase the torque output of the motor, by increasing the gear ratio to 142/0.7/0.5 = **406:1**. The resulting angular velocity, at the power max, is 19300rpm/2/406 = 23.768rpm, which equates to 2.489 rad/s or 142.6 degrees / s or **0.421s / 60 degrees**, which is awesome, this meets my application specs with room to spare - assuming my calculations so far are good.

-----------------------------

Now comes the tricky part, moving from the theoretical to selecting actual parts. I've done a lot of looking online for ways to gear a motor 400:1. I'd prefer not to custom-create my own gearbox if others exist, but if it means massive $$$ savings, that's fine. 

I've found a plastic gearbox that seems like it may work: https://www.pololu.com/product/70 
This one would also be fine at the 555:1 ratio: https://www.pololu.com/product/2391  

The ratio is close enough, it looks easy enough to assemble, the cost isn't outrageous. Here are my questions:

1) The gears on the inside are made of plastic. I'm not a mechanical or materials engineer; does anyone know if these plastics can survive the torque/stress/shear/etc that my application would exert on the gears? 

2) Unfortunately these sets come with their own mini-motor which I don't want/need. I need to replace it with the RS-550 above. What is the typical interface between a ""raw"" motor and a gear / gearbox like the above? I have no idea how they would be connected physically. Glue? Twisted on really snug? No idea.

My RS-550 says it has a shaft diameter: 0.12in (3.2mm). These gearboxes come with their own small motor which I don't need. They seem to have a shaft diameter of 2mm according to this data sheet: https://www.pololu.com/file/download/rc_260rasa.pdf?file_id=0J15 meaning that comparatively the RS-550 might be ""too big"" to fit into the gear. What's the right way to make it fit (assuming it somehow could)? 

3) Is there any way to know even a rough upper bound on the torque that a gearbox (of a particular material and dimensions) could handle? 

4) Further part recommendations and component selections are always welcome. While I am price sensitive, I would trade off some cost for a more robust design.

79,why do lightning rod systems have multiple rods (or how does lightning work)?,1420597918,"The context:

ChemE here. Electricity confusilates me (except for electro-chemistry). Where I work, 1 building has a lightning grounding system composed of:

1. two grounding poles, oppositely positioned on the  building circumference.
2. a wire circling the building underground, connecting both grounding poles.
3. 2 separate and opposite wires running from the grounding poles to the roof
4. a wire circling the roof of the building
5. six distinct poles, 4 on the corners, 2 on the ends of the ridge-line.

given my understanding of lightning, the negative charge from the ground will jump to the sky when the potential difference it great enough, and it will travel the path of least resistance, therefore it will start at the grounding pole, travel up the wire traversing the side of the building, through the nearest rod, and to the heavens.

so the question is, what' the point of 6 lighting poles on the roof when there's 2 paths to the roof? 

my electrically-un-enlightened mind tells me it make sense for 1 rod directly above each grounding pole.

I currently design low and medium voltage power systems for new buildings and construction projects.  I was attracted to this field because I was interested in power, when I interviewed I was told it was a very exciting field, that there were going to be a lot of changes to systems due to code changes because of Hurricane Sandy, and because they are a consulting firm they looked for good engineers who liked to talk with people and are personable, which sounded like a great fit. I am a very personable, nice person and I like to talk with people, I was very involved in service opportunities in college working with different people and found myself most at home there, because of the people, so it felt like it would be a good fit.

I'm working on a new project at work and the engineer in me wants to prove out the basic principle before I crack on with prototypes but I've hit a snag; 

I'm ultimately trying to calculate effective work in a system. This system has one face which is held firmly against a solid boundary and another which is free to expand. Air is then introduced into the system increasing Pressure through mass gain. Lets assume that both faces of the system are 1m^2 with a millimeter air gap between so there's an initial volume of 1x10^-^3m. Lets also assume the process is Isothermal and that the materials Young's or elastic modulus (E) is 0.05GPa

So the first law of thermodynamics is in=out we just need work in - work loss to get effective work, easy.

""Pressure""(P) and ""volume change""(dV) increases between two integral stages result in an increased level of work shown below:
W= PdV

This means that work used in volume change will be considered energy loss as only the work acting on the fixed boundary is utilized. 

Here's where I begin to get lost.. 
So I took the equation for work associated with the stretching of a liquid film where σ=surface tension:
Surface Tension Work= σdA

So I took this and replaced σ with E resulting in:
Surface Tension Work= EdA 
As I was dealing with a solid elastic material. At this point I'm aware that σ is measured in N/m whereas E is measured in Pa = N/m^2. Nether the less I continue to conclude that:

To calculate the total effective work of my system the following equation must be used:
Weffective = (Win - PdV - EdA / (Effective Area))
Which would give me a Kj/m^2 figure.

So can anyone help me find my solution?

This means that work used in volume change will be considered energy loss as only the work acting on the fixed boundary is utilized.
Here's where I begin to get lost.. So I took the equation for work associated with the stretching of a liquid film where σ=surface tension: Surface Tension Work= σdA
So I took this and replaced σ with E resulting in: Surface Tension Work= EdA As I was dealing with a solid elastic material. At this point I'm aware that σ is measured in N/m whereas E is measured in Pa = N/m2. Nether the less I continue to conclude that:
To calculate the total effective work of my system the following equation must be used: Weffective = (Win - PdV - EdA / (Effective Area)) Which would give me a Kj/m2 figure.
So can anyone help me find my solution?

In my case, it's a 250 gallon, which is 42""L x 48""D x 35""H.    Obviously it's going to be a function of the amount of water it contains, so in this case, just a function of the height of the water.  

Assuming it's perfectly square (which it's not, the corners are rounded, but close enough), and water having a density of 0.3613 lb/in^3, there's approximately 1.26 psi on the bottom of the tote when it is completely full.

So, what happens when we crack the valve on the side?  I don't know the exact size, but I can scale it when I get the actual measurement.  Let's assume it's a 1"" diameter circle.  What is the pressure coming out of that valve?

14,EE looking for career advice,1420430141,"Hi AskEngineers. I graduated with a BS as a EE in 2013 with my EIT. I had a strong GPA, and had worked internships every summer along with a job in an electronics testing lab during the school year. I took a job at a very large engineering company in the defense industry. I found that this company's work was a really bad fit for me, we were sent problems with military vessels and wrote responses. My technical work in the first 6 months was limited to writing letters which specified a sleeve to put over some wires, and a letter to unplug a computer fan. I was miserable and found another job at a very large tech company.

Very shortly into that job there was a large re-organization which has left me in a building manager type role. I look at finances and manage the contracts of our facilities team. It is a data center so I am around engineers, but since that re-org my own engineering work only comes sitting in meetings where other engineers discuss construction projects at the site. My responsibilities are entirely non-technical. I have now worked this position nearly a year and have once again found myself very frustrated with my career. I have spoken to some managers about moving into technical positions, but have been told the company very rarely trains entry level engineers, and instead hires ones who have worked for smaller companies for several years. The only positive is the pay and benefits are very good considering the work I'm doing.

All of this leads to me preparing to go back to work after a long x-mas break and dreading it. I still have a strong resume from my college years, but feel trapped here since I don't want to keep leaving jobs after a year (although I probably won't list the first job out of school on my resume since it only lasted 6 months). My goal was to work towards a PE, but I don't feel that is possible where I am now. I have too much debt to consider going back to school. I've started wondering if I should give up on the field and do something else, but also am pretty sure this has just been a bad string of luck. Any words of wisdom or guidance you all could offer would really be appreciated.


TL;DR-- worked a job 6 months, hated it, took a different job, got re-assigned as a building manager, unsure if staying is really doing me any good. ",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2rd7ro/ee_looking_for_career_advice/

31,How to anchor a shaft at one end with a bearing?,1420382926,"Hello fellow Engineers! I'm looking to make a wooden clock, and my design calls for several gear pairs with wooden axles that can only be anchored on one end. The forces applied are going to be very low, so I'm not concerned with warping. However, I'm not sure how to both anchor a shaft longitudinally while simultaneously allowing it to rotate.

Constraints: 

* There is a scarcity of space available - the assembly should be as flat as possible. (Quick sketch: http://i.imgur.com/Rxm2Htb.jpg).

* I don't want to have to machine the wooden shaft to cut grooves, keyways, etc.

* Ideally the assembly can be taken apart without breaking it (ruling out simply gluing the shafts to standard bearings).

**About me:** 

I am a 25 yo biochemical engineer who lives in Belgium. I'm currently very happy working as a process development engineer for an open/independent pilot plant for bio-based innovation. I enjoy debates, brainstorming and public speaking (which I do from time to time at conventions for work). In addition I also frequently do guided tours of our facilities for/with high school and college students. Due to the nature of my work I'm quite limited in how much I can do from home. This means I have a lot of free time, that I would like to fill more productively.


**Why:**


I think it's important for scientists (or anybody really) to do public outreach and engage in debates, especially in a field such as biochemistry where there is an incredible amount of misinformation about things like GMOs/sugar/gluten/... I have personally greatly benefited from programs such as 'Scientists@Work' and enjoyed science olympiads when I was in high school so I would like to 'give back'.

49,Help! Outside (color changing) RGB lighting system,1420312429,"Hello all,
first of all, I'm a college freshman interested in Engineering (particularly electrical). I have a little more than two weeks left until my break's over. Yesterday my uncle, who I'm visiting asked me to work on a project for him if I was interested. I said yes, since it relates to my interest in DIY/engineering. (This will most likely be crossposted in DIY/engineering)


My Mission:

My uncle's dock has nine particularly old marine lights that alternate sides every 2 pilings. Pictures below (sorry everything's flipped!):

[image 1](http://i.imgur.com/Y7dzYwg.jpg)

[image 2](http://i.imgur.com/FWmPBd6.jpg)

[image 3](http://i.imgur.com/BMwCxHX.jpg)



He wants the old lights replaced with a more sophisticated system- a system that allows the user to have control over the color that the lights emit- I'm thinking an RGB LED lighting system.


My Problem:

I'm relatively fresh to electrical work, especially outside work. I have no idea if it's even safe to operate on, and my uncle knows very little about the current system. Here's the control box:

[image 1](http://i.imgur.com/BgTYkcm.jpg)

[image 2](http://i.imgur.com/j84zouU.jpg)



The control box is barely labeled, and none of the lights out on the dock actually work well enough for me to be able to test the power. To the electrical engineers willing to help, what do you know about outdoor electrical work? Do I need to turn off all power to the house in order to safely work on the project? 


Also, I've no idea what kind of RGB LED bulbs I should buy. I went out and bought a cheap multimeter, wire strippers, and cutters. That's all I have for the project as of now. Is it safe to use the multimeter to test current of the dock without killing a multimeter fuse? 


I'm working in the dark here on a DIY I've barely any idea on how to complete, with a time limit of 15 days. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. ",AskEngineers,VintageMafia,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2r84qv/help_outside_color_changing_rgb_lighting_system/

51,"Making a Cyr Wheel, Seeking advice on structure.",1420307620,"First of all thank you for your time. I'm attempting to craft one of these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNSpDSbTjjw
Let me first preface this by saying im not a Mechanical Engineer of any sorts, I am Computer Science, so forgive me for asking potentially stupid questions

Now I have found some reference of a man who made one here:
http://www.valvers.com/engineering/making-a-cyr-wheel/

The problem is that he has access to a machine shop where as I do not. I am thinking of bending EMT conduit successively on very small iterations at small angles of degrees under the idea that if you zoom in enough, a circle is made up of a bunch of straight lines. I understand that this isnt time effective but it sure as hell is cost effective.


My question comes in as the guy who built his in the aforementioned link used aluminum piping with a 3.75 mm wall thickness. Having looked up the EMT specifications, http://www.republicconduit.com/Documents/EMT%20Electrical%20Steel%20Conduit.pdf, the wall thickness is only 1.45 mm (im planning on using 1"" diameter EMT)

However, the EMT is made of steel, not aluminum and after some quick research: http://aluminium.matter.org.uk/content/html/eng/default.asp?catid=217&amp;pageid=2144417130 I found that the Young modulus (I think read tensile strength resistance, i dont really know) Is 3 times that of aluminum. Im sure given real world interactions the 1/3 wall thickness and 3:1 modulus buff dont directly cancel, but would EMT conduit be structurally sound for this purpose? I just need to worry about deformation really or collapsing the wheel.

53,just like other guy I have to say something about my career aslo.... i feel like a paper pusher engineer. dont get to touch anything because we have subcontractors for everything. i just put it together...,1420302239,"
 I'm an EE and I used to work in a small company with about 120 people. The salary/benefits sucked but my job was very hands on and I got to learn a few things besides my major. Because it was a small company and engineering was even a smaller group, I did not see any room for advancement career wise or financially. 

After applying for jobs, I interviewed for a company that has those crazy requirements ( entry levels need to have 2 years exps etc;) and got in. FYI this company hires a lot of ""smart"" on paper candidates ( good school,gpa, experience etc) so it took a while.

Now the projects are diverse and the team im working with is good but for the past few months all I did was contact contractor A to get answers for contractor B so contractor C knows when to schedule installation and hardware at one of our sites. Sometimes I have to provide technical details on our systems so their device can be configured properly to work. Nope, im not allowed to touch anything in the field because of union rules so i just watch.

I have no clue about the actual ( engineering level not wiki)  workings of these devices besides a systems view of things. That's fine and dandy but i have to say that im basically a paper pusher type of worker here. I look around and see most of the guys are here because im not sure we can get better job than this benefits/salary wise in the area and it's a natural monopoly so you get the picture. I'm afraid i would start to get dumber because of the simple nature of the work here. There are other departments that are more in-depth but from my point of view, it's the contractor doing most of the hardcore engineering. We probably have 20% of engineers or fewer that actually design anything it seems and some these guys have ivy league degrees and phds.

I would like to get a view on how you would proceed given this situation. I suppose an engineer at Boeing who deals with the subs to get the aircraft together goes through similar tasks? i'm not sure. It sucks because it doesnt feel good knowing that a smart high schooler can do some of the jobs around this place. I find myself excessively bored ( because im waiting in between responses from contractors) and cannot do much on the computer because everything is monitored to hell.

58,trying to build a small underwater component to filter/separate solids from water,1420260464,"Hello All,


For a hobby aquaponics project, I am trying to build a small component which would sit at the bottom of a 300 litre ( ~ 80 gallon) water tank, under 2 to 3 feet of water, and filter out solid particles from water. Filtration would be  simple, using simple household mesh or sponge.   At regular interval, the filter would be manually cleaned.  Since I stay at a place with unreliable electricity , i want to make this

 * as little energy consuming as possible,
 * avoid using pumps, air compressors etc and
 * keep the size as small as possible , which can run comfortably with DC supply(9v , 12 V etc).

I am trying to find a simple mechanical way, to allow water in from one side,  pass it through a filter, trap the solids and send the filtered water out from other side. All of this underwater.  I am a software engineer by profession and  am completely clueless about how to design this component.  But If i have the design, i can perform little bit of molding and casting with resins myself .

It would be very helpful for me, if you guys can provide me some pointers regarding possible solutions.  Instead of mechanical filtration, if there are any simple electro magnetic ways of separating solids from water, please suggest them also.

Please let me know, if you need any further info.

Quick back story: 

Graduated with a BSME in 2010, I was a pretty average student with a 3.0.

I then worked a small sheet metal company as their ""engineer"", mainly making sheet metal boxes, doing CAD modelling, and writing G-code. Didn't use anything other than common sense that a 17 year old would have.

I then got a job at GE which i thought to be an incredible opportunity; wrong. I did one very niche repetitive task over and over for 3 years until I knew I was getting way too dumb, so I left. 

Heres the dilemma: I got hired as an engineer lvl 3 at a new company making 90k a year. I told them my whole story and that I wasn't very technical, but they still hired me. I think the GE on my resume looked good. 

Anyway, here I am in a fairly technical role, asking people beneath me questions everyday. I have forgotten everything and I don't know where the last 4 years just went. The other day we were talking about the youngs modulus on something and I had to stop and think about what that even was....

So basically, am I fucked? Do I start re-reading all my books starting with algebra 2 and statics? Should I go apply at starbucks?

If you have any advice on how to get back on track please provide your input. 

tldr; was in an engineering role for 5 yrs but never did anything technical, just got a new job that is technical and I think I am too rusty for it, how do I overcome this?

edit: just to clarify i dont think my coworkers are beneath me (i think i am dumber than them is the point of this post). i just meant i a lvl 3 askimg lvl 2 questions all day. feels  like it should be the other way around.

83,Can somebody explain why the space shuttle appears to launch in an arc into space?,1420162387,"I've been sitting on this for a while and I can't figure out the answer. Whenever you see pictures or videos of a space shuttle launch, it appears as if the flight path is an arc. Specifically, the shuttle is flying on it's back, appearing to be upside down. I have two theories why this occurs, but I'm not sure.

Is this because of the lift generated by the wings of the shuttle, in combination with the fact that there is more weight on one side of the external tank, that pull it into that orientation?

Or is it because after the shuttle launches, it is free from the rotation of the earth, and therefore does lunch vertically, however from our viewpoint it just appears to fly in an arc?

The salary/benefits sucked but my job was very hands on and I got to learn a few things besides my major. Because it was a small company and engineering was even a smaller group, I did not see any room for advancement career wise or financially. After applying for jobs, I interviewed for a company that has those crazy requirements ( entry levels need to have 2 years exps etc;) and got in. FYI this company hires a lot of ""smart"" on paper candidates ( good school,gpa, experience etc) so it took a while.

Now the projects are diverse and the team im working with is good but for the past few months all I did was contact contractor A to get answers for contractor B so contractor C knows when to schedule installation and hardware at one of our sites. Sometimes I have to provide technical details on our systems so their device can be configured properly to work. Nope, im not allowed to touch anything in the field because of union rules so i just watch. 

I have no clue about the actual workings of these devices besides a systems view of things. That's fine and dandy but i have to say that im basically a paper pusher type of worker here. I look around and see most of the guys are here because im not sure we can get better job than this benefits/salary wise in the area and it's a natural monopoly so you get the picture. I'm afraid i would start to get dumber because of the simple nature of the work here. There are other departments that are more in-depth but from my point of view, it's the contractor doing most of the hardcore engineering. We probably have 20% of engineers or fewer that actually design anything it seems.

I would like to get a view on how you would proceed given this situation. I suppose an engineer at Boeing who deals with the subs to get the aircraft together goes through similar tasks? i'm not sure. It sucks because it doesnt feel good knowing that a smart high schooler can do some of the jobs around this place. I find myself excessively bored ( because im waiting in between responses from contractors) and cannot do much on the computer because everything is monitored to hell.

96,Why is the HSPF rating so much lower than the SEER on heat pumps when the Reverse Carnot COP for heating is always larger than that of cooling?,1420075920,"Obviously in real life we are not dealing with ideal systems so the equation COP_HP = COP_R +1 doesn't necessarily apply but my impression was that it did capture the fact that any work input into the system is rejected to the heating side.  In the case of heating a building, this would make it more efficient than cooling since the energy input is rejected to the building rather than the outside.  Yet, from looking at [these](http://www.lennox.com/products/heat-pumps/) heat pumps, it would appear the opposite is true.  I am aware that HSPF and SEER are numbers generated under ideal circumstances and aren't necessarily meaningful when doing engineering calculations but shouldn't they reflect a similar trend?

Followup question: are heat pumps that are installed in colder climates charged with refrigerant to different pressures to be able to operate at lower temperatures?  I live in the Pacific Northwest where the temperature rarely drops below 35F and noticed that our pump shuts off at 27F assuming it is very low humidity.

It's been known for a long time that the sound of running water can make it next to impossible to decipher what someone is saying who's standing only a few feet away.

I've heard it explained that running water raises the backround noise level, but I don't buy it - because other sounds which do the same thing, even to louder volumes, still leave speech relatively easy to decipher.

My guess is that you have overlapping frequencies, so the superposition ends up destroying the integrity of the original signal.  However, after a quick search, I couldn't find any fourier transforms of the sound of running water to compare with those of speech, so it's only a theory.

Can anyone shed some light on this and whether my theory is correct, or if it's something else?

The objective is to eventually use these interviews for an educational and/or press platform for schools and universities to promote engineering to students. Since I'm an AE, most of the people I'll be interviewing (at first) will be in the aviation or space industry.

For the interviews, I'll ask fairly basic questions like:

* How did you get into your field?

* What's your educational background?

* What's the most exciting project you've worked on?

* Where do you see your field in 10 years?

As for style, I want to make it interesting to listen to, but not require the listener to pay 100% attention... so, similar to [*Radiolab*](http://www.radiolab.org/) and [*Serial*](http://serialpodcast.org/). The main thing I want to point out about these two podcasts is their high production value, which greatly improves the listeners' experience.

A quick bit of background:
I've set myself a little project to force myself to learn more about engineering, and it would involve a linear actuator. Piezoelectric materials have caught my attention, but I'm finding the jargon even more impenetrable than usual.
Therefore, I shall ask people who know ""things"" :D

The question(s):
The project as it stands would (ideally) require a 1cm^3 linear actuator providing a rhythmic displacement of approximately 1mm, at a frequency of either 6.4 or 3.84 MHz. This would be attached at one end, but the other would be free - the other end would be in air or vacuum.
Could a piezoelectric actuator meet these specifications, and if so how expensive/hard to produce would such an actuator be – could I throw one together from a kitchen timer's speaker, or would it be a custom piece costing thousands?

Finally, if such an element would be implausible or excessively costly, are there any alternatives that I may have missed?

23,"I want to build a prototype, but I need help with the name of one of the mechanical components.",1419901940,"Hello,  I want to build a prototype, but one of the components has me stumped, and I think i need some mechanical eng help.  To simplyfy, the system will have 2 parts: a ""black box"" and 10 feet of steel cable coming out of it.  The box will allow the cable to be pulled out at a speed of around 1 foot per second.  The box can provide 0 to 500 pounds of resistence on the cable.  The box will suck the cable back in when no pressure is applied to the cable.  The amount of resistance provided by the back box will be computer controlled in approx 1-2 pound increments.  This part shouldn't be too hard, its the next requirement that has me stumped.

The last requirement is this.  The box should operate in 3 modes: smooth, stopping, and reversing.  In smooth mode, the cable should come out of the box in a smooth motion.  In stopping mode, the cable should come out of the box and be stopped or significantly slowed for milliseconds at a time along the way.  In reversing mode the cable should come out of the box as preasure is applied, but the box will also pull the cable back in at millimeter to centimeter increments a few times per second.  Imagine a fish figthing as you try to real it in.  The movements would be computer controlled.

My problem is the black box.  Does a device like this already exist, if so what is its name?  If it doesn't exist, what components might I be able to piece together to get the desired affect?

Any ideas or advice is greatly appreciated.

I'm wondering why some engineers end up doing non technical work; I'm talking specifically early on in their careers. Is it a personal choice where you decide you don't want to deal with technical stuff, or did you start a career in that path and never really changed into more technical jobs?

25,Traffic Lights approaches in the UK (mainly London),1419895736,"Righto highway engineers, answer a structural engineer this question... Why is it in London there seems to be a often used road design where before a set of traffic lights the road will widen from one lane to two or three lanes, then immediately reduce back to one lane after the lights. I was pondering this and came to the following conclusions, but would like to know if I'm wrong... 

Pros:

1) Slightly more queuing capacity when the lights are red 

2) Easier to have lanes for turning left or right (although as they leave the option of continuing forward I'm not sure how much that actually helps) 

Cons:

1)Introduces conflict of merging unnecessarily

2) Gives impatient road users a half chance to overtake if they drive over the speed limit - this design seems to encourage this 

3) Uses road space that could be used for a segregated cycle lane (as 95% of cycling accidents are at junctions and most accidents are caused by motor vehicles, concentrating on junction segregation seems sensible to me) 

4) Usually allows an additional 4 or so cars to queue, so you save, what, 10m off a traffic queue. Seeing as the only time they get used fully is at peak traffic when the queues are massive anyway, what's the point? 

5) Pedestrians have to cross wider roads

An example, most traffic here goes straight and both east and west bound traffic goes from one lane to two that go straight on, one turning right. The straight on immediately reduces back to one lane. Why not have a straight on and right lane and a cycle lane? ...

http://goo.gl/maps/dixwk

So, am I missing something? Are all those 10m savings summed up actually worth the lost space and merging?

1.) Can I integrate a mirror-system on lens-system to project the image on the projection surface?          (Instead of using an expensive short-throw-projector)

2.) Can the projection create an image on a one way-mirror that the viewer can perceive normally?

I want to begin making gizmos and robots and that sort of thing in my hobbies, but do not know the best method for circuit simulation and (what would be helpful for me) visualization.

I have used the pencil and paper method, and done math to figure out how to size my resistors and capacitors for the timers and circuits that I want to build in the past. I'm aware of things like SPICE, but the initial learning curve is mildly intimidating.

I have a small amount of experience programming in python. I know a decent amount of LaTeX. I don't know what the best method for approaching the design and simulation of small circuits is.

46,"On the viability of a gyro-stabilized, bi-pedal walking machine",1419839584,"Hi, automation engineering student here.

I found this [website](http://cyberneticzoo.com/walking-machines/1981-the-walking-gyro-john-w-jameson-american/) a few years ago, it presents a toy called the Gyro-walker along with some formulas, estimated numbers and a patent (1982). Looking at the pictures I thought the Gyro-walker looked a bit like a bare bones Killa Kan from the fictional Warhammer 40k universe: [image of figure 1](http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2010/3/16/90592_md-LED,%20Killa%20Kan%20LED%20WIP04.jpg), [image of figure 2](http://www.braintyrefire.com/personal/w40k/Bad-Moonz-Killa-Kan-2a.jpg)

Out of nerdy curiosity have I pondered whether a ""Kan"" can function in reality using the Gyro-walker principle. The ""Kans"" can be thought of as something equivalent to a relatively small one-man operated tank, though estimating the scales we are really talking about here is hard. Based on Google results, the total height is perhaps a rough 4m which yields these very shoddy results based on [this image](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CpicIviwM20/T8SAbD_Jb1I/AAAAAAAAA2U/dYZ8AGxdO-g/s1600/Killa+kan+2+WIP1.jpg) in MSPaint:  

* total height: 4m  (13' 1.48"")  (465 pixels estimate...)  
* total width (""hips""): 3.31m  (10' 10.31"")  
* can height: 2.45m  (8' 0.46"")  
* can diameter: 1.63m  (5' 4.17"")  
* leg length (joint center): 1.85m  (6' 0.83"")  

Of course, the Kans probably won't have tactical advantage at all in a real world scenario but that is besides the point here. Here we will consider it purely as a means of transport of a single person at best, at speeds below say 21 kph or 13 mph. 

As the original article presented on the website can be hard to read, I compiled a resampled, OCR'ed PDF for easier reading [Here](http://www.megafileupload.com/en/file/592654/Gyro-walker-article---patent-pdf.html) (better mirrors are welcome)
The summary ends by asking how to control Gyro-walker and rightfully so; without control it is not of much use. I don't know how the remote controlled toy shown on the website work.
The ""Kans"" does not use the Gyro-principle as described here and are usually shown having separated legs with ball joints. Other than that they work by magic &amp; good will. Power transmission to the Gyro-walker's legs happens via a crank that does not allow for much control of movement, this is true also because the legs are dependent on eachother. The crank &amp; leg design, however, is an integral part of what makes the Gyro-walker work. The alternatives here, the way I see them, are:  

* Some how transfer power to the legs without the control impeding crank and still make it work (unlikely?)...  
* Use the crank but some how add more DOFs &amp; actuators to the legs to gain better controllability  

With this I am implying use of modern actuators, electronics &amp; control theory. Which sensors would be sufficient to use on the legs? Look at all the leg designs above, could they work outside on uneven ground? 

Let's ignore that finding a sufficient energy source is a huge problem as usual, would you say it is (even remotely) feasible to make a stabilized working model using a gyro as described in the papers? The numbers in the article speak for a wide range of sizes. Joining two bi-peds together by a linkage will give more stability of course but then it is no longer a bi-ped (hello BigDog, and BigCentipede if we carry on).

A summary of problems that come to mind:  

* steering &amp; stability issues due to limited Degrees of Freedom and I imagine feedback issues(?)  
* weight &amp; materials to support itself  
* good ground contact/friction (mud, wet soil and sand is probably very bad)  
* (depressing energy source issues...)  

This is a rather speculative post, however I think it will be interesting for everyone to hear eachother's thoughts about the article and what it might take to make a large scale working model reminiscent of a ""Killa Kan"".",AskEngineers,Photocurrent,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2qp0js/on_the_viability_of_a_gyrostabilized_bipedal/

It's a small county park, with a creek that runs through the park. The bridge is part of a small path that goes over the creek.  
*You can see pictures [HERE:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ceFfPfJnuE_7dclbAfdDMmV8rLJPgmGTeww2CgaF0zE/edit?usp=sharing) 

The existing bridge is in terrible shape.  Cement appears to have been poured multiple times (by the county).  It is in such bad shape, it is difficult to ride a bike over the bridge.  

An Eagle project is an effort to help your local community, typically getting all sources donated for the project.  We have been working with the county and have gotten approval to move ahead with the project.  **What is needed now is a diagram from a civil engineer, of the project.**  We will then present the diagram, work flow of the project, timeline, costs, etc. to the Board of Supervisors.  All of this will be done working in conjunction with the county engineer, who has been on site and approved the project.  The county will be demoing the existing bridge, and hauling it away. 

We had a local engineer accept to help, but she simply never got back to us after multiple attempts.  She appears to be too busy.  Nothing negative on her, we just need to get this completed, so are now looking for someone else to step in and help.  

To the question:  We live in Northern CA.  We are looking for a civil engineer (structural engineer???) that can: 
- Draw a diagram of the new, replacement, bridge
- Give us basic recommendations on how to build the bridge (we want to build it out of concrete and have discussed using large plastic (PVC???) piping so water can pass through and not go around the bridge (which is happening now and causing erosion).  i.e. How thick it will need to be, which piping to use, etc.  
- This will need to be presented by my son, a 15 year old boy, to the Board of Supervisors.  So, some ELI5 direction would be helpful.  

We are going to be asking the neighborhood for monetary help for incidentals.
We are going to be asking local builders to provide the cement for free.
We are going to be asking a local material center to provide wood, and framing material for free.
We are going to be asking local builders to provide their expertise and help in framing the project, pouring the concrete, finishing the concrete for free.
We anticipate many hours of help needed by many professionals, county personnel and Scouts to complete the project.  

- **Yes,** I know this is a large ASK.  A significant amount of time will be put into this.  We get it and would be grateful - as would the neighborhood we are looking to help.  
- **Yes,** someone who enjoys Scouting, has a boy in Scouting, was once a Scout would be ideal here.  As they most likely asked for this type of help themselves at one time.  However, that's not a requirement.  Anyone willing to help us with the project, and qualified, would be welcome.

49,How do engineers communicate at work?,1419835826,"I'm just wondering. I graduated 2 years ago and just got a new job. I'm a mechanical engineer and at my old job I worked on design validation. It was a good job although moving up was tough. Some engineers I've worked with were not good at communicating. Especially the older engineers that have more than 10 years of experience. Most of them had no capability of mentorship and were flat out looking to give you menial work. 

So I decided to move on to a new job where everyone here is a younger and it was better pay. Initially, I thought to myself this is perfect. And so far it’s been good with some exceptions. The quietness, which I thought was very unusual. Everyone at their cubicles is extremely quiet and no one really talks. If anyone does talk it’s like for 2 minutes and then everyone goes off into their own work. In the mornings, people don't say good morning or anything. My boss passes my cube a lot and doesn't say hi or anything unless he needs something; I did notice he goes to my coworkers cube a lot and starts talking about work. I think he does this because this colleague of mine does a subpar job at their work. When my boss and this coworker do talk, I can barely hear them even though my co workers cube is right in front of me. Everyone whispers when they talk. There is an occasional time every other day where everyone around my cube starts talking for about 5 minutes. Should I partake in these conversations for exactly 5 minutes every other day? 

Is this just the office environment; or is this how most engineering places are? I work at a really big company and my group is about 50 people all together and then it breaks down 10 managers with ~5 engineers each. I have no idea what the other 45 people in the group work on. I feel like engineering is just a bunch of bs where you just spend a couple hours doing some engineering work and then the rest of the time you just talk about it in meetings; where you make things overly complex for no reason. 

Is this how the engineering world is? If so, I kinda like it and I kinda don’t. It can be annoying at times people make things overly complicated and it turns into a competition of how the next person can restate the over complicated problem with a complicated answer. And another things that’s annoying is how quiet the other engineers are around my cube. Anyways, is this how engineer world really is? 

Anyways, just wondering what all of your thoughts are. Thanks!

50,Could a wind + fuel turbine engine be an effective range extender for an EV/ hybrid?,1419828794,"A simple prop attached to an alternator can produce electricity on a car.  Of course, a turbine engine can drive a generator to produce energy for a hybrid.  Would something like a turbo-prop arrangement used to drive a generator be a good solution to recover loss of power due to drag while at the same time be able to still generate electricity as a range extender for a hybrid EV?

I got my 10 year old son interested in resonant frequencies.   We discussed how a glass could be shattered when exposed to just the right frequency, so I suggested that we could make 'demonstrating resonant frequencies' the theme of his 5th grade science fair. 

Unfortunately, I can't think of an easy way to demonstrate this in a simple science fair format. 

What would you do?  I thought about demonstrating vibrating water patterns or shaking sand using on a speaker, but I don't know where I could get a cheap frequency generator which would allow us to vary the frequency to see the effects.

It's for small amounts of powder meant to be put in capsules for digesting.

The idea is to build it for no more than $100, I don't want to pay $2000 for the one above.

The other aspects of what I need from this dispenser:
-need to be able to preload the amount in milligrams of how much weight in powder it would dispense
-can put in multiple powders (separated)

It doesn't matter to me if it is a gravimetric dispenser or volumetric  as long as it works and can be done relatively cheaply.

Anyone out there that can point me in the right direction? What components would I need?

Could I hack any other existing devices and reappropriate it for this?

77,Intersection efficiency in California,1419617632,"Open discussion for infrastructure engineers, and I am especially interested from in a Caltrans / state perspective.

[One of the best of posts caught my eye](http://np.reddit.com/r/InfrastructurePorn/comments/1q3s1y/how_much_does_a_street_cost_infographic_os/cdav1up?context=4), and it inspired me to find this sub and get your experience and opinions.

Upfront you need to know I am an efficiency monger, and driving in urban areas of California has pained me for years. Not only for my sake, but for the rest of the state. I understand most people don't think about these things, much less get irritated by them. Most times I meet a red light, I am left wanting for a traffic system worthy of ~~2014~~ 2015; either a centrally synchronized system, or smarter independent intersections.

I lived most of my childhood in Orange County and currently live in San Diego. It appears as though southern California hasn't done much to innovate in this area. If I'm right, I would love to know why. Millions of people use this infrastructure every day. I imagine alleviating major inefficiencies on surface streets would also positively affect much of the congestion on our freeways, even if in minute ways.

On the surface, it appears everyone in the state would favor implementing a more efficient system; from the every-person who commutes daily, to first responders on duty, to the environmentally sensitive. Coming to full stops is a waste of energy. Accelerating from a stop is a waste of fuel and emits more carbon. Taking ten minutes to drive half a mile is less than optimal when apparent synchronization would fix the issue.

I don't want to make the mistake of the fellow in the thread I linked to; I understand engineers have their work cut out for them and do the best they can. I am just seeking clarity and a better understanding of how to encourage the state to adopt initiatives that could literally save Californians days of their lives.

Given there are systems implemented in many other areas of the world which seem to favor efficiency (roundabouts and synched lights for example), why has the California traffic grid been designed the way it is? Are there any efforts underway to increase efficiency?

I love my state and have a genuine curiosity for the infrastructure, so I appreciate your insight!

I recently found out that one of the companies could put their antenna up with a bucket truck possibly up to 35' Off the ground using an old light post we had lying on our property, problem is I have to get the thing anchored in the ground so that it wont move. The pole is currently 20' in height, made mostly of 1/8"" steel, with a base ~10"" across with 1"" anchoring mount holes, made out of 1/2"" steel. the pole is square from the bottom and tapers until 6"" from the top, where it has a ~2"" circular tube of 1/4"" steel.   The pole weighs about 250Lbs (this is a guess, it can be moved/dragged by one person and carried by two, I really have no way of weighing it) Ive found that I probably need a footing with a minimum diameter/size of 18"" across, and should use 3/4"" minimum but 7/8"" recommended size J/L anchor bolts for it. Since the pole could possibly end up being 35' feet high with an extension, and a PTP wireless dish attached to it, it will of course leverage a wind load against its foundation.

85,What is your experience as an Engineer in Construction Management like? Career advice appreciated.,1419561016,"I am in need of some career guidance advice. This is my second post about career guidance in reddit/engineering. 

I am looking to switch jobs in about 6 months or so, this summer. I would have been with my current employer for 19-20 months at this point. I am a mechanical engineer working in construction management. I do lots of fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer calculations to size equipment such as pumps, boilers, tanks, pipes, control valves, chillers, cooling towers, etc for factories. Although tedious at times, I do enjoy this type of work and do find construction management rewarding. 

The reason I am looking to change jobs, or career advice per say is the work atmosphere I am in. Seeing as I am 24 years old, I do not have much to compare my current situation to, so I came to reddit for advice. Some issues I see with my current employer and other engineer's my age are

1. The lack of training, mentoring, and review of work. This leads to disasters in the field (incomplete scope of works, millions of dollars wasted, etc).

2. Our company is about 300 people in size, 75% of which are engineers or architects. The company structure is flat. Upper management (the owners of the company) are out of touch with the engineers. There is no leadership or structure to advance or grow, no annual performance reviews. Performance bonus's are entirely political.

3. New engineers work the most hours. I've averaged 60 hours per week all year long and earned $70K this year and to weeks vacation. This is the norm for other engineers my age and in similar roles. I'm not sure if we're underpaid or overworked, but most engineers my age quit around the 18-24 month mark and move on. Meanwhile, the company owners put in 45 hours per week.

4. The work atmosphere can be toxic. I've sen coworkers torn down to shreds in meetings in front of 10 other people, on the verge of tears, people being told they suck, etc. I've been screamed at myself for not getting work done properly that I was never told to do or trained to do. 

I hate to bitch about my situation, I am grateful to be employed and to be doing great things with my education and skills. I would just like some feedback on my work situation (is this normal, common, etc?) And would other mechanical engineering careers in construction management be similar to the one I am in now? Essentially, I am looking to do the same job I do now in a different, more structured atmosphere with better advancement opportunities.

Unfortunately, the people giving me these projects (whether they are managers or clients), have not had the same mastery, and generally have a background that is completely different.  They come to me to get the job done, and in the beginning they’ll ask for my opinion, a cost estimate, and a timeframe - which I will give them.

Some of these people are reasonable – they have good instincts of what kind of work is involved and what the risks are.  I’m noticing however, that most of them do not have these instincts – and I am getting incredibly frustrated with them.

They will badger me on what work needs to be done, and they will treat me like I’m selling them a car.  They will expect everything to go 100% right, and when things don’t they’ll marginalize my work, even when things are going 90%.

I could chalk it up to these people specifically being bad clients/managers, but I would be turning down a lot of work if I avoided them.  (Maybe I should be turning them down.)

What are some ways I can manage their expectations?

91,Beam-bending formula accuracy?,1419527479,"Hey all! Wikipedia-taught person here, so forgive any naivete. 

I'm using a simply-supported beam bending formula (PL^3)/(48*E*I) to find the smallest type of rail I need to support a print head for a 3D printer project to keep it light. I'm coming really close with what is acceptable deflection.. how accurate is that formula? Typically overestimate? Underestimate?

More info: I'm technically constraining the beam at both ends, but I was told to pretty much model/expect it to behave as simply-supported. The formula also models the load at a single point in the center, but my bearing is ~4cm in length, so it will be a distributed load in real-life.",AskEngineers,ppsieradzki1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2qdha1/beambending_formula_accuracy/

94,Structurl Integrity - Crash Course Please,1419491232,"I'm interested in modifying cargo containers for other applications but am unsure how to calculate the structural integrity. Basically I want to cut holes in them but need to know how much I am effecting the ability of it to hold weight.

My physics courses didn't cover structural integrity but I imagine it is just subtracting the force acting against Gravity. But I know there has to be more to it.

Edit: More info, 40' High Cube Dry Coten Steel Cargo Container. I'm in the planning process and want to know where/how to make holes in the wall. The most prudent course of action seems sheering up the outside of each container as well as an 'frame' between containers. My standard layout of containers is planned to be 5 containers on top of 5 containers. I was going to crisscross the containers to so the load would be where the two containers intersect and should be sheered up as well due to load bearing. But with the way the shell works on the container I'm unsure of this and the physics behind this shell construction and just learning the vertexes involved in the calculation would be wonderful.

I'm also on course learning the trade through traditional schooling but learn hands on and guided better than the class room.",AskEngineers,Visrite,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2qcjp2/structurl_integrity_crash_course_please/

96,Masters degree in engineering possible??,1419468987,"Hey everybody,

I saw a recent post somewhat similar to my situation and it got me thinking a little bit. My question: how feasible would it be for me to pursue a masters in either Mechanical or Aerospace engineering once I get my bachelors?

To give everyone my background, the I am currently a junior in college in the US pursuing a bachelors degree in Engineering Management with a focus in Mechanical Engineering. Technically, it is a business degree with a fair number of courses in the engineering department. The engineering courses that I will take before I graduate include Statics, Strengths of Materials, Thermodynamics, Mechatronics, Differential Equations, a few levels of engineering-based physics, and some others that give me some background with CAD, Matlab, and the machine shop. Additionally, I will participate in at least 1 co-op before I graduate. 

What it be reasonable to transition from Engineering Management to actual Engineering? I'm worried that by not taking most of the upper-level classes required for an actual engineering degree at my school and missing the material covered in those classes, I would be at too much of a disadvantage to pursue a masters. 

If it matters, I've received almost exclusively  A's and B's in my engineering courses, and it would be too late to simply switch my major to engineering because I'd end up being in school for 7 years or so just for my bachelors degree. I'm currently just weighing my options for what to do once I graduate, and I figured this would be a great place to get some honest advice.
