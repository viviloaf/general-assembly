I am an engineer by trade. I recently took an MBTI personality assessment and learned that I am an Intuitive/Feeling type; meaning that I like flexibility, ""big picture"" concepts, and human relationships over structures, details, and rigidity. Obviously, the later personality is much more common among engineers and scientists. I love technology and science, but my personality does not mesh well with being a traditional engineer for this reason. I am wondering what kind of job titles out there in the technology/innovation world are better suited for someone who is more flexible and creative, and likes technology and science concepts at the cursory level but does not like working with details.

6,"How do I connect CO2 sensor with its own small relay, to activate an interposing relay, to turn on a timed fan?",1566378009," 

Hello Engineers,

I  have a CO2 sensor with a relay (normally open) with a contact rating of  1A 30VDC/0.5A 125VAC. This relay outputs from a 2.5mm phone jack port.

The CO2 sensor is powered by a AC/DC converter that powers it from 220VAC.

According to the sensor manual's description,

""The  meter is designed with a normally open relay to send output for further   connection. When CO2 readings go over the upper limit and cause   alarming, the relay picks up automatically and sends output signal. It  can be connected to a ventilation system or activator for conditioning   the air quality. The relay will drop out when CO2 readings fall below   the lower limit.

User can use 2.5mm mono phone jack plug to connect with relay output port.""

According  to this, I've purchased a 2.5mm mono phone jack cable with one  white-plastic coated internal wire and a copper wire-sheath around this   internal wire. I have a SPDT relay that has two DC holes (24v and 0V)   and 3 AC holes (220VAC feed, off, and on). I also have an upto 2 amp,  24V AC/DC power adapter which has one black and one red cable.

How  would I go about connecting this so that it worked? And would I need an  additional amplifier for the relay to pick up the CO2 sensor's signal?

I  believe I would have to connect the switched-live (terminal) cable from  the extractor fan to the on hole in the relay, and the feed cable to  the 220VAC feed hole. Presumably I don't do anything with the off-hole. But what about the DC section, and do I have the  right mono phone 2.5mm cable?

I'm currently being considered for a position with a very small software/engineering company (\~10-20 people) who primarily contracts to aerospace companies in Pasadena, CA.

The salary compensation is pretty good as well especially compared to what I'm currently making (I feel taken advantage of at my current job).

I'm a recent grad (graduated June 2018) and I'd be leaving a fulltime position at another aerospace company with okayish benefits, but I absolutely LOATHE my current job.  The program I support is an absolute trainwreck and I've been wanting to leave for a while now.  Since I'm relatively early in my career is there a downside to working at a small contracting company from a mentorship perspective?

Hey guys/gals,

I recently graduated from a top 5 engineering school in Canada in ME. I admittedly have a pretty poor GPA (2.32) but i leave it off my resume, and I have no internship/industry experience, believe me I tried.  
But I think my resume isn't bad, I have been applying for 8 months and have probably sent out 400-500 applications and have received ~6 in person interviews which all lead to no job for various reasons, with one exception all interviews went very well and according to them I was a good fit but the position was either not needed or they went with someone better. My interview skills are solid I think, I am very sociable and the interviews tend to feel like I'm shooting the shit with them and just elaborating on my resume, I had one interview where we talked about traveling for half the time and it usually feels like I'm a shoe in.

It just seems like there is always somebody better, even if its by 1%, and its getting to the point where I will have to go back to a minimum wage job just to stay afloat which will greatly hinder the amount of time I can put into applying.

Is the job market poor or is there something I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance.

27,Anyone else experiencing burnout?,1566342865,"Structural Engineer. I've had my stamp about 10 years now. Due to recent retirements, I've effectively become the lead structural designer on numerous multi-disciplinary projects that involve both structural and architectural aspects that I am responsible for. Thought it was something I always wanted, and I enjoyed it immensely.  

However, in the last couple of years, the workload has been piling on incredibly fast. So fast that I can no longer reasonably stay on top of designs and keep up with deadlines as a responsible designer. I've got 15-20 projects on the go at any given time, at various stages of design and construction. The capital cost of these projects is anywhere from $0.5M to $50M depending on the size of the project. 

In that sense, I have become the bottleneck on many projects, and I can feel the weight of $250M worth of work sitting on my shoulders. Maybe it's my personality, maybe it's my ethics, but I do my best to make sure my designs are correct before I stamp them, regardless if it means I'm working extra hours that I'm not paid for, regardless if I meet impossible deadlines or not. I haven't taken a vacation in a year. Haven't had any of the typical seasonal slow periods at work in 2 years.  

I am burned out. I do not know how to cope with it. I am missing time with my family. When I am home, my mind is on work. I can put on a façade for a few hours, but then I just get distant. My wife knows what is up and tells me to slow down at work, and I try, but that just puts me further behind.

**Background**: I am graduating from Electrical Engineering at the University of Alberta this spring, and I know this is the time to be looking for jobs. My thing is I want to be a little picky. I would really like to get into energy conservation or DER! It has been difficult finding jobs that fit this, and I am not sure if I am being too picky or if I'm looking in the wrong place. I am willing to travel anywhere in Canada, USA, or Europe. Additionally, I have catered my degree to power engineering and so I do not feel as confident applying to jobs in other areas (such as telecommunications, etc.). I'm really passionate about bettering the environment through energy! I would love to work on smart grids, or integrating local distributors, or retrofitting buildings to be more energy-efficient or anything along those lines.  I have an ok GPA at around 2.7ish, but I do not have much experience (I tried applying over the summer but no luck) and unfortunately, I can't seem to get a lab to let me volunteer with them (I have asked 7 labs/professors now). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Question**: Where can I look? Are there specific websites or cities or companies that I can look into? Am I being too picky and should I just take what I can get? What is your experience with trying to get into a specific field? Did you start in one place and eventually get to where you want to be? Is there anything I can do that can make me a better candidate for such positions?

I really need help with organizing and digitalizing the information in this new company that I work at. To give you a background about my work and the firm. I have BSc in Construction Engineering, so I am not that great with engineering management. And the firm that I work at gave me a task to organize all of their data. They have a very bad system where all the files are named the way the designer wanted, it is not centralized and they don't follow any standards. They don't also collect daily report, document their work and their tasks.

I have made extensive research and found that I should follow some standardized guidline to make all the files have correct naming and correct folder naming. I have found that BS 1192 is very popular. But later found out that it has been replaced by ISO 19650.

So my question is, can somebody please give me information about how they store data in their engineering company. How do they name the files, the folders, what information do they collect and so on. Should I just buy ISO 19650 standards and read that or there is an easier and better way.

57,UK Engineers who transitioned out in early 30s?,1566295097,"Question here for anyone based in the UK (maybe elsewhere in Europe too)

What paths have people who successfully left an Engineering career in their early thirties taken? I originally did a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering with management, spent the bulk of my career in the Automotive industry in more of a systems/electrical field (graduate scheme originally then towards the end this was mostly project management) but then have been somewhat out of the field for the last couple of years as I took a plunge on a short term move to Australia, worked in a more junior role in another industry and did a little bit of online work to complement this. 

Having returned to the UK, and given the preferences too of my (non UK) partner and her career my focus is on working around London or an equivalent European city (Maybe Amsterdam), and as most of the roles in Automotive do not facilitate this I am contemplating a career switch.

59,"Using the title of ""Engineer""",1566288613,"I wanted to get opinions on a line of thinking that I've held for quite some time. I am NOT an engineer, but I relate quite heavily to this sub because, despite my lack of a degree, I typically find myself doing engineering related tasks for almost every one of my employers. My role at many of these companies ultimately turns into the ""Jack of all trades, master of none."" And by that I mean, I end up in many varied roles that often require completely different skill sets. Just to give a few examples:

- Research and design a process for acetone vapor smoothing of ABS plastic parts
- Research and design improvements for mechanical and electrical design of custom made 3d printers
- Assemble and improve pick and place assembly line machines and implement mechanical improvements
- Develop application code (like G-Code) pick and place assembly line machines
- Develop software (like C++) for pick and place assembly line machines
- Machine parts on manual and CNC machining equipment (usually for said assembly line machines, but sometimes for other stuff)
- Maintain and troubleshoot CNC machining equipment

As you can see, a lot of my duties overlap with duties typical of junior software, electrical, chemical and mechanical engineers. I usually don't do mechanical design, but I have designed a few small parts in the past.

But I'm not an engineer. My job title doesn't have engineer in it. (However, my boss refers to me as ""one of his engineers"")

And until I go to school to get an engineering degree, I will never be one. I personally think calling myself an engineer dilutes the term significantly. I don't believe I'm nearly as effective at some of my duties as a properly trained engineer would be.

However, whenever I describe my job to someone new, they usually say ""Oh, so you're an engineer!"" and I have to quickly correct them that I'm actually... you know... not an engineer. And I always felt like this was the right and respectful thing to do given that I basically cheated my way to a position most people have to work for years to land.

I'm a BS in CE and therefore I took courses like Circuit Theory, Microelectronics, Measurements, Signals, Controls, Nonlinear Dynamics and Applied Electronics (basically telecoms and digital electronics), along with the maths, physics and CS ones of course.   


I'm about to start a MS in CE and I'd like to specialize in the controls/robotics field. There's a CE concentration called ""Automation and Intelligent CPS"" which consists of the following core exams:  
\- Convex optimization  
\- Nonlinear controls for aerospace  
\- Automotive controls  
\- Robotic systems  
\- Modeling and control of cyber-physical systems  
\- Multivariable and robust controls  
\- Discrete-event systems  
The other exams are more CE-oriented (Computer vision, Mathematics in Machine Learning, ML and AI, Databases 2, Computer Architecture 2, System programming 2).

Is this the right MS if I want to work with, say, robotics, self-driving cars, aircraft controls, defense etc.?  
I don't wanna be seen as a ""software-only guy"", but I also want to be the one who may write the equations, model the dynamics and design the controls. Are these courses enough, or will the lack of mechanics and motors disadvantage me? 

I could also choose a MS in Mechatronics Eng., but I'd sacrifice my CE possibilities (big techs positions, data science jobs, etc...) and pidgeon-hole myself. Furthermore, I know that MechX are not well seen in big companies, since they are not truly ME nor CE nor EE.

I'm here today to ask you where you draw the line between fulfilling your personal best practices on a project and just getting the damn thing done.

My situation is this: I've been tasked with streamlining the documents for a particular line of products we make for one of our customers. For some reason this multi-national customer of ours didn't have any manufacturing drawings for these parts. The drawings have been made by past employees by measuring sample parts. As such, there are slight differences in dimensions that should be the same across the board. Our customer obviously doesn't care, but in working on all these parts, I figured I would go about making all of these similar dimensions the same. In my mind, the advantage of this (besides ""I'm gonna do it right, God damnit!"") is reduced operator error and ease of inspection. This advantage stems from certain dimensions being what people expect them to be.

While the changes I would be making are small, they necessitate changing turret punch/mill programming which is work for other people. 

Does anyone have any hard rules or any decision processes about how/when to let go of doing things the ""best way"" in favor of just getting them done?

I gladly took it bc I had been struggling to get interviews let alone an offer. (2.85 GPA and no internships). Anyway, I’ve been taking this job by the horns and have been crushing it. The process to obtain a reactor operator license at this plant tends to take most people 1.5-2 years and I’m a quarter of the way through my qualifications after 2 months and am expecting to get my license after a total of 10 months. I am a bit over qualified as I am the only engineer, let alone nuclear engineer working as an operator and one of a handful with a 4 year degree. Anyway, the local power plant opened up positions for a new team of operators there and I kind of figured that I’d throw my name in the hat and apply, as several operators at my plant were doing the same. I also know one of the training instructors there because his son is friends with my youngest brother and I shot him a message about the openings and he told me that he’d give me a call to tell me more about it. He said my dad has been updating him with my progress and he is pretty impressed and said that he already talked to the hiring manager and recommended me and said he’d give me the hiring managers contact info and that the hiring manager wants me to give him a call too.

Just randomness and spontaneity and schedules subject to change with the job site being just as random, maybe even being sent to different cities or countries for odd jobs. Or perhaps more leniency with working from home.

23,Reviews for a company hints at layoffs for no reason,1566173351,"I’m currently hunting for a new job and am in the final stages with two company. One position is a straight engineering job, will most likely pay well and I would take this job strict for the salary, I know I wouldn’t enjoy it and it will really be a challenge for me to do well. The plant manager thinks I’m fully qualified but I’m not so sure (perhaps imposter syndrome). 

The other position is a sales/field engineer position that I think would really suit me and much more up my alley. It doesn’t pay as much (base salary) and I don’t earn commission until 6 months after I start. Also the territory I will be in is new so I will pretty much be starting from the ground up. Both jobs are in the same location. 

I’m definitely leaning more towards the sales job right now but upon reading reviews for the company, although there are a lot of great reviews and the average rating is 4.1(which is really high in my book), there are quite a few alarming reviews stating that they will fire sales/field engineers 4 months (and really whatever duration) into the job and won’t provide any explanation. 

I’m really big on job security(who isn’t?) and this scares me. I have a second interview with this company this coming week... is there a professional way to ask about this?

Hey guys, I'm a student in materials engineering and I'm thinking about pursuing a master's in MechE with the focus being on fracture mechanics, FEM of crack propagation and stress modeling and all that stuff associated with the field.

My main interests in my current degree lie in failure analysis and I've done a few projects on this, but I've only been involved in the materials side, meaning I do the microscopy and metallurgical analysis and all that is associated with an FA investigation. Lately I've been feeling like I've been missing something, and I realized that I could be much more valuable as a failure analyst if I was involved in the designing and analysis of materials/components and determining amount of cycles, load to failure, critical crack length, a materials ability to retard crack growth, and so on.

I was wondering if anyone here is also involved with this field and if anyone could give pointers on what I should study. I'm also trying to figure out the school for this.

28,Engineering with a BS in Comp Sci and a minor in Chemistry?,1566163500,"So I'm two years into college and trying to figure out exactly what I'm going to do. I am currently at a small satellite campus close to home and work. My original plan was to take all of my general courses and maths and basic classes here, and then transfer to the main campus to finish a BS in Mechanical Engineering. (My current campus has no engineering curriculum) I have pretty much finished all of the classes I can take here towards that degree, and am actually set to graduate with an associates soon. I was planning to work a couple years before transferring, but that's not really related.  

Anyway the school I am currently at is planning on creating a computer science degree, and it is very tempting for me to stay where I'm at and pursue that. I have already taken the couple classes that they offer (their current program is mathematics with a concentration in comp sci) and am interested in computer science in general. If I did pursue this, I was considering tacking on a minor in chemistry. 

My ultimate goal would be to work in the automotive industry, primarily something related to engines. Working at an OEM manufacturer would be great, but I would also love to work somewhere like Holley helping design performance parts. My thought process is that every aspect of automobiles are becoming more computerized and the code behind it is becoming more complex (I've been reading every bit of information about fuel injection and tuning I can find and quite enjoy the subject) and that having a minor in chemistry shows at least a basic understanding of the physics and chemistry happening in IC engines and in general. So hopefully this combo would make me desirable for one of those jobs. There's a man named Greg Banish who has written a couple books on fuel system design and tuning, owns a performance tuning business, and has worked and consulted for all three of the big three automakers, and others, as a consultant or engineer. I would love to one day be that guy.

41,How to deal with being the fall guy and one sided politics,1566142308,"Just as a little background, I work for a small automation company that focuses on the robotic programming side. We were just bought by another company and things seem to be slow. We are a sales based company. I am 7 months out of college.

Anyways, I have been crushed by these massive projects that no one really seems to know how to do. There is this sales guy (we'll call him bruno) that says his project are ""easy"" and that he did them before when he was an ""engineer"". Every single project I have done for Bruno has failed in some way. Every single one. I have been at work until 3 in the morning 3 nights in a row trying to make this crap he is trying to sell work. The sad thing is, other people make decisions in the project when I am the lead and usurp any from of control I have on the project. Bruno will just choose a robotic gripper and say ""here use this."" I have neither the experience or authority to place this stuff under my control sometimes. I also cannot change to another sales guy. 

When the feasibility studies or projects come close to finishing Bruno comes in on say Friday night and Saturday to ""finish"" them. He really does nothing but take my code and add a weird flare on it from his ""engineering"" experience (never went to an accredited school but acts like he's a grad student). The projects end up being a steaming hot pile of garbage that we deliver and sort of work (other engineers and myself made them kind of work through trial and error). Bruno then takes the good credit (literally takes my name off papers I have written) and grabs the greedy ears of management to talk crap about my performance throughout the project. His mistakes are ignored and they are pinned onto me. He can go above my manager, talk to the president, and make things look entirely my fault (when they were incorrectly scoped in the first place, a honest mistake I made, or whenever he made a mistake). It does not help that I am new to the workforce as well.

I am not perfect - I make mistakes; however, it is annoying to have someone constantly watching me and when I do make  an honest mistake say ""see, SEE? I told you guys he is the reason my project fail.""

So yesterday I was told I am going on a PIP. They say my performance is lacking and everything I do is half-assed (why do I stay so late then LOL, I don't want to be there at that hour). Who is writing my PIP? What criteria is this based off of? It does not seem like my manager is writing my PIP. My manager cared enough to say ""I will help you"" but he knows exactly what is going on and cannot do anything about it. What am I supposed to do? I have so many failures they are defining who I am at the company. It will now be even easier for the sales guy to pin things on me. This is definitely bullying and is impacting me more than I care to realize. Other sales guys do not even say hello in the office because I am quite certain he just talks about how bad a job I do (when I don't, I am trying my best). Should I try and fight this PIP through or just put in my two weeks? This is making me doubt my abilities as an engineer - however, I know I should listen to my gut and my gut tells me what is happening is not right.

58,Linear bearing for a mini lathe?,1566100462,"Hey guys, thank you for reading.

Im designing a small lathe for glass work, and im trying to figure out how to get both ends of the lathe to spin at exactly the same speed whilst being able to move the tail end freely to shorten or lengthen the distance between the two lathe chucks, and also being able to disengage one end would be ideal (for glass both ends need to have exactly the same rpm so there is no twisting when joining or seperating etc). Would I be best off using two electric motors geared down with the speeds adjusted to be exactly the same? Or would some kind of shaft be a better option? I was looking at spline shafts with linear bearings but they cost more alone than im hoping to spend on this project. 

I feel like a shaft would be the best option so that everything is always at exactly the same speed whether its only just powered up or running full speed, however ive got no idea what im talking about and struggle to even find things that might be a good option without the right terminology.

Can i simply solder more wire to the Load Cell side (the 4 wires going from the load cell to the HX711)? Or will this also present problems?

73,Can anybody explain/relate to the way I learned in college/learn in general?,1566056412,"So this is a bit of a different post. And please don’t roast me too hard. I wasn’t a perfect student. 
In college while I was working toward my engineering degree, something that I found was that I tended to do pretty terrible on all of my tests until the comprehensive final, which I would then ace or do significantly better on to pass the class with a C. Here’s an example:
Statics Tests:
T1:F
T2:F
T3:F
T4:F
Final: B
While studying for that final, everything just clicked and I didn’t even know why struggled with any of the tests. This was a trend in most of my classes and man did my GPA take a beating. 
You could easily claim I sandbagged and didn’t work until the final and some of that could be true, but I was studying for all of them, it just didn’t click and felt like brute memorization. I think the adrenaline of “ace this or fail” added to me being able to put things together. but looking back after each class, everything I was learning was kind of rough or not fully understood until I got to the final where I was able to piece everything together and understand the big picture of why certain methods were used. I just graduated and am working as a Reactor Operator Trainee studying to get my RO license and I’ve even noticed it in my studies at work. As I’ve been learning more about how the systems of the plant work, the first things I learned are becoming easier to remember and I’m getting a clearer understanding of them and why they operate the way they do. I’ve always felt like I understand what I learn better after I’ve covered all of the material and can see the big picture. Most engineers I know are not like that and just pick things up as they learn them. 

So, does anyone else need to see the big picture of things before they understand things fully? Is that a normal way to learn and digest information? Or am I just weird? I feel like learning in this way is not at all ideal in a school setting, but at work, it’s definitely helping me to have a deeper and more intimate understanding of the plant system.",AskEngineers,False,Schnieds1427,/r/AskEngineers/comments/crnq24/can_anybody_explainrelate_to_the_way_i_learned_in/

Unfortunately with being a startup and constantly wanting to innovate and get ahead of the curve, my company has unrealistic expectations for me and my supervisor.  They have given us so much work (some of which we aren't qualified for) and then they question why we are slow to approve things or do the changes the engineers request of us.  

To put things into perspective they have hired a ton of design and electrical engineers to push for faster innovation, but my department is stuck at a measly 2 people.  Although we do good work, 2 of us just isn't enough to keep up with multiple products, and who knows how many engineers at this point. More then once now we've been given tasks we aren't qualified for as well as people not following proper procedure and cutting us out of review stages.  As a result of cutting these corners us manufacturing engineers have to clean up their mess, something I spent the whole week doing and I still don't think its fully resolved. 

Things have escalated to the point my supervisor has had enough of this place and decided to resign.  Tbh I don't blame him since he's overworked more then me and he's been dealing with people yelling at him everyday to get things done.  Something that I expect will now be passed onto me.

With him leaving the company soon I'm at a loss for words on what my next steps should be.  Just getting this job was hard enough after school so I do want to stay longer to build experience and hope things improve.

I've been told by friends and family that I should demand a raise if they want me to stay.  The problem is, that won't solve the issue of being understaffed and overworked.

85,When is Masters by Coursework a good option?,1566032088,"Hi,

I was hoping for some advice on whether masters by coursework is the best option for me.

To give some context , I'm an Australian who completed a bachelor of engineering in aeronautical a few years ago (with an extra honours year). I had a tough time finishing it up and I couldn't find work in my field in aus. I've been working in building services as a consulting engineer which , although I was keen to explore a new sector at first, I've decided is not for me.

I'm interested in CAM and design so I'd like to get a job in manufacturing, product design or something related.

To that end I've applied and been accepted to a master's by Coursework in mechanical engineering at a uni in Melbourne. The course is 2 years, is a general extension of the material I learnt in bachelor's plus some computer aided design subjects and also includes a dissertation.

Will this be worthwhile getting an entry level role in industry? 2 years full time feels like a big commitment for something which isn't strictly necessary like an undergrad.

It feels like a lot of people do masters if they didn't get research exposure in their undergrad and want to go on to a PhD. I did get that exposure in honours but have no interest in an academic career and frankly don't excel in long open ended assignments. I can see that it's an important skill that I'd like to develop but I recognise PhD would be way too much for me.

So if I have no intentions for academic work and an undergrad that is somewhat related to the field I'm aiming for (related to mechanical at least) is it valuable to get a master's?

Not sure how much this varies between countries. A lot of the posts on Reddit or elsewhere regarding post grad is American centric of course and it can be hard to map that advice onto the slightly different aus system.

I still feel like I've never satisfied my true urge to do real engineering and use the math I learned in uni to good use. I still want to experience it badly. To do stress and fatigue calcs. To look at new problems from a mathematical perspective.

I've got an opportunity to work as a mechanical design engineer on Solidworks. However, I was advised that the engineers at this company use Solidworks every day, and that draftspeople typically only do 2D drawing production.

I'm worried I'll end up being being a CAD jockey, and that management is a better long term career path. IMO the best jobs require a a use of both technical and soft skills.

My main problem is the proper construction of the dosing device, which should work with an accuracy of up to 50 ml, with doses oscillating around 600 ml. To keep up with production, I need to dispense in less than 25 seconds.

First of all, I am currently concerned about dose accuracy. My first idea is based on the use of a water meter combination to measure the flow of liquid in conjunction with an electric valve closing the flow after reaching the given amount, based on the number of pulses generated by the water meter.

What water meter should I use that is able to generate the number of pulses allowing such accurate measurement? It seems that mechanical water meters do not allow such high accuracy of flow measurement.

Don't see alot of Env Es on here but maybe some of yall can post your two cents anyways.    I recieved my BS in Biology from a decent state college about 3 years ago.  I really just liked animals, plants and ecology and didnt give much thought to future careers.  Since then I have had a good bit of work experience I will outline below. I am also very passionate about water resources doing alot of hobby kayaking and river protection/ cleanup volunteering

Work Experience

Hardscaping 2 years - basicly extreme landscaping   retaining walls, natural stone work, concrete work 

Roofing 1 year- alot of inspections and commerical roofing, a decent amount of computer work and build quotes

GIS Specialist at my university 2 years - was very good at this but grew to despise doing it full time  did some ecology and erosion modeling work. presented at confrences and made decent connections during this job

Current job is an Environmental Sampling- doing water and methane sampling for landfills mostly. I like this job alot, being outdoors and low stress while still  being mentally engaging.

My current jobs seems to be the perfect oppurtunty to really have some direction and pursue a more advance career path. I have gravitated towards the idea of Environmental Engineering.  An online masters would fit really well into my current life schedule.

3,Mechanical Engineer looking for some Career Advice,1565984358,"Hello there,

I looking for some advice on career path based on my current situation and would love to hear y’alls opinions. 
 
Some background info on me: 
- Mechanical Engineer (BSME 2017, 3.3 GPA)
- EIT certified
- Project Engr internship for computer company
- 1 year - Eng Test Tech II for semiconductor
- 7mo (current) ME for Machine shop / sheet metal company (semiconductor industry)

Basically I am not satisified at my current workplace due to 3 main factors (payscale, management ping pong emergency decisions, and upward advancement) and I would like advice for paths going forward.

1.  Current payscale is below average by 10k for my exp. My boss wants to hire two more MEs and have them report to me, he bumped my pay by 2.5% but im still underpaid on average by 10k based on my exp and thats for my good work over 6mo and i doubt they’d bump for managing two other MEs (My college associate with similar exp is getting 80k a yr so bit of envy there).

2. Currently my boss is a nice guy and has quite a bit of experience however he is very deadset negative guy when it comes to projects and company outlook, ans its hard to keep motivated whenever he brings up all the negatives (i see it as we move at the company’s speed and if they change things we’ll follow suit, and just deal with it and show them to the best of our ability the time &amp; money savings of future planning).  

3. I want to learn more but the projects here are a bit too soft, design load test fixtures, vacuum leak fixtures, cost analysis on processes, solidworks design.  I just feel a lack of challenge.  I’m thinking about other certifications such as PE and Lean Six Sigma certs outside of work but im not sure.

Just looking for some advice on what I should do, I would like to get into Aerospace becuase I love space.  Not sure if PE is worth the study and $.   I wouldnt mind volunteering to work under a PE for study projects wise if thats even a thing.

I am about to enrol on another engineering course at another good university, however banks don't recruit from it. I will be starting from year 1 again. My question is, is it essential to do a year in the industry on a sandwich course to get a good job in engineering in the UK? 

I will likely be doing an MEng so the idea of doing an additional year in the industry is really offputting as it means I would've spent 6 years in uni since starting my first course. Would summer internships at engineering firms be enough to secure a good graduate job and are these internships common? Or do they prefer taking students through a year in industry? I am referring to graduate jobs that start on around 26 or 27k. At companies like rolls Royce or siemens. 

The course I will be taking will be mechatronics and robotics MEng, what type of job roles can I expect for this (will I be able to compete with other electrical and mechanical engineers for their jobs). Also, can I expect the good graduate schemes with 27k starting salary with this degree? I am in half a mind to continue my current course which is Mechanical and electrical engineering and finish with a BEng, that way I will be able to go for finance jobs as well as engineering jobs (depending on which takes my interest) .

I wonder if anybody of you knows how it is possible to actually get the steering wheel input from (in my case a Logitech G29) USB steering wheel and being able to transfer the input to another application.

I just want to mess around with it, and in the mid to long term I want to (maybe) control an RC Car with it. As I said, just for playing around.

I already asked this in [/r/simracing](https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/), as they build some really awesome custom rigs, but it seemed it is really more an electronics topic than a simracing topic. as the responses were lacking..

I just found out until now, that it should be possible with an outdated Microsoft API called DirectInput to actually get the input from the Wheel and Pedals. Is there no other way? I mean the driver software already reads the input with the correct bindings?

Another reddit user told me, using Unity would be the way to go. But I am completely new so Unity (messed around with UE4 a bit) and I would prefer to getting these inputs via COM port to forward it to the Arduino.

PS: I could live with the wheel connected to an Arduino directly, but I'd prefer to have it connected to a laptop thats communicating with the Arduino. That's the reason why I didn't post in [/r/arduino](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/), I just want to learn about your experiences with the connection from wheel to pc.

22,Architecture or Software Engineering in 2019?,1565960248,"I am 18 years old and live in the UK, just graduated from 6th form A levels with average grades. I have secured a place in a university in software engineering although in the last couple of years I was planning on taking architecture purely because I was good at art and enjoyed landscapes and buildings. But only recently have I changed because my grades were not high enough to get into a well reputed university which in my mind was a really important factor for me to do well in architecture and I've enjoyed writing code during the last 2 years. I will tell you what I think of both courses and please correct me if I'm wrong I really need this.

My understanding of Software Engineering is (which might be completely wrong) that once you have got your degree you will work normal hours in a big company and get paid decently. You will get assigned a piece of code to write, you write it, test it, compare it, adjust and repeat. But people have recently been telling me that the competition in software engineering is massive and it is really tough to get a job where you would get paid decently as companies would outsource their jobs to foreign companies that are willing to work equally as hard as you for a much smaller wage, and they will take over and the only way to stay in is to lower your demand and work as hard.

My understanding of Architecture is that once you have got your degree, it will be very difficult for you to find a job but once you do you will work for a big company as a drafter and take someones projects or design and draw drafts of tweaks on a CAD program for hours without any creativity inputted as you are only the middleman. You will get paid poorly. It will be like that for years unless you get a masters degree and apply for a more advanced job in which you can impact the building design directly but that will require 7 years of university. For you to do good in architecture you would need to have gone to a reputable university with a well known name. If you want to start your own company or workshop it will be really difficult to grow and make a name for yourself.

I would love to work in the middle east but to my understanding architecture is the better course to take if I wanted to work there.

Is what I understand of each course correct? if not please do tell me because I am a bit stuck at the moment and can really use experienced engineers' help.

&amp;#x200B;

I am early in my career, so I often wonder what skills I should/want to be learning. 

The formal definition of a skill is ""the ability to do something well; expertise."", so I jokingly think, hey I have no skills yet. But I also acknowledge I must have picked some stuff up along the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering what others think are important skills.

&amp;#x200B;

 The reason for my question is that earlier someone mentioned that making smaller testable cases is a skill, and I think I have that on some level. Maybe not an expert yet, but it is developing. I do not think I would have thought of that as a skill unless it was emphasized as such, and I generally think this is what we are just expected to do in school labs, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know what you think is unimportant skill.

&amp;#x200B;

It can fall under the lines, of leaning to listen, reading, simulation, etc. I acknowledge the results may vary widely, and I am just basically curious. I would appreciate if you would share an insight/experience in knowing/acknowledging how that is a skill and scenarios when relevant.

42,Thoughts on moving to a more technically-inclined/design-related job,1565925018,"Hey everyone,

I've been working for six years now, ranging from field engineer to sales engineer to working in production plants. I find these jobs are okay-ish, but at the end of the day I feel anyone with a good logic and communication skills can do it. There's not much ""engineering"" going on - no math, no theoretical application etc. What I do on a daily basis is pretty much reports, Excel, Powerpoint presentation, process improvement etc. It's mostly managerial and operational in nature.

I feel like I want to make the jump as a design engineer someday, or move into a role with more theoretical application (say aerodynamicist or a heat transfer engineer). I've checked jobs posting and mostly want past experience in the same ""job field"" or even experience in using software like ANSYS, CATIA etc which the last time I've used them was back in college.

I was thinking of going back to college and get a PhD, but I don't know what good it will do. And to think of the opportunity cost (college fees, vs 3 years of working experience + salary) that come with it.

Ultimately I can't be doing the same thing until I retire, because I still need to up gauge my skills, but then again I just don't see myself being say, the regional sales manager leading a team of sales engineer and my annual targets are all about how much I've sold in that year.

I've come to realize that I messed up by not doing a co-op or an internship. It never crossed my mind how important that may be, and personally I was going through a very hard time and didn't have the coping skills I have now to even handle something like that (still not an excuse). Once I graduated, I was dead set on finding a position as a Clinical Engineer; unfortunately the city I was in didn't have any positions available.

I worked hands on with patients, consenting them for numerous studies, conducting said studies and collecting data, and working with the IRB. I realized this career choice probably wasn't going to help me become an employed engineer.  I ended up moving back home to California in hopes that the plethora of jobs there would make it easier to find an engineering position.

47,[Long] Have I passed the point of no return?,1565920310,"Okay, this is gonna get serious. And, depending on your perspective, overdramatic.

So I'm going into my final year of undergrad aerospace engineering at a pretty damn good program. But my final year was supposed to have been this past one.

I'll explain. I transferred into my degree at my school after my freshman year, mainly because I was bored in a non-STEM degree... and also, yes, because of the earning potential for engineers (I wasn't expecting to be a millionaire or anything, just wanted a decent chance at financial stability).  So I worked hard, got good grades, and - long story short - got in by the skin of my teeth. 

It's important for me to mention that at the same time, I got involved with a student org that takes up a shit ton of my time, but it also makes me genuinely happy. I'd prefer not to go into detail mainly for my own privacy, but I think that should be enough.

So anyway, I started my first year actually studying aerospace, and that's when I learned how hard real engineering classes are. So I struggled, but I got by. A year and a half passed in this way, where I'd worry but eventually be okay. 

Then I failed a class. Actually, multiple classes in one semester. I chalk it up to a lot of things, including bad decisions with personal responsibility, substances, and time spent working the organization I mentioned earlier. And I know, I know. I'm supposed to be an adult, have my shit together, everything. Trust me when I say I did plenty of soul-searching after that. 

I came back the next semester, focused and ready to go. And I think I did pretty damn well, all things considered.

Then this past one I fucked up again. And there's definitely a pattern here: the organization I'm in has a way busier schedule in the spring than in the fall. All told I miss around 2 weeks for competitive things each spring.


I actually just got back from a research position I was really fortunate to get, and I think it went pretty well. I worked hard, fucked up a few times, but I got my deliverables in and did a pretty good job with them. 

And for the first time... I guess really ever in college, I finally know what I want. And I think not having a firm commitment to anything after college was a huge factor in me messing up. I just didn't care at some points. The idea that I could fail a class or ruin my own future just wasn't enough to get a rise out of me, and that's even bled in to some of my group projects. 

I'm not gonna call this depression, because I haven't seen a psychiatrist for it and self-diagnosing feels wrong.  And I genuinely do feel bad for making life even a little harder for my groupmates, and if I could, I'd do whatever I could to go back and fix it.

But I finally have a real goal, for the first time in a long time. And I finally feel some kind of ambition for my own future, which for me, is a huge step.

Look, this isn't meant to be a sob story or some symbolic comeback kid thing. I'm not expecting sympathy, nor do I want to be coddled. I just need to know: is there a way where I can feasibly get a job even soon-ish after graduation? And if so, what do I do? And has anyone out there been in a similar situation, and if so, what did you do?

55,How Aerospace Engineer Janet Todd Became a ‘Secret’ Muay Thai Champion,1565907702,"Martial artists come from all walks of life.Many find combat sports as a means of escape from troubles. Most find an appreciation and love for the discipline that is a part of the arts.

Few find them after establishing themselves with a career in an esteemed field like aerospace engineering, but that’s how Japanese-American Muay Thai pro and member of the ONE Championship roster, Janet Todd, is different.

The 33-year-old, who was born and raised in Hermosa Beach, California, completed a five-year master’s degree program in aerospace engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo when she was 23 years old.

She’d always been fitness conscience and athletic. Todd had done some kickboxing training to remain in shape during college. Her boyfriend and now-husband Dustin suggested Muay Thai to her while she was still in school, and Todd fell in love with the art. Todd was immediately drawn to the challenges the sport presented to her both mentally and physically.

“I loved it right away,” Todd said. “Learning new movements was really interesting for me because I didn’t come from a martial arts background. So learning to kick was fun because my kicks were probably really [bad] when I started. Being able to learn new movements and then perfecting those new movements was something I really enjoyed.”

Todd won her first bout by TKO, but still unsure of how she could make a living pursuing the sport, she decided to pause her career in Muay Thai to focus on building something with her engineering degree. She lived in this space of dual interest/commitment for four years, but she received an opportunity to replace an injured fighter on a local card.

Todd began training again at Boxing Works, which was run by the respected Bryan Popejoy. The connection with the gym and Popejoy changed everything.

Despite the short training camp set in her path, Todd won the bout and captured a championship in the process. The success was a validation she could accomplish great things and inspire other women and girls to get into combat sports.

“The feeling of getting in the ring and performing the way you wanted to perform—there’s no beating that feeling. I’ll do whatever it takes to get that,” Todd says.

Her inspiration is already apparent. One of Todd’s chief training partners is 19-year-old Jackie Buntan. The two women still train at Boxing Works under Popejoy’s tutelage and are in a position to grow the sport among women in their community and abroad.

“I appreciate the fact that Bryan doesn’t change his fighters into something else,”says Todd. “He simply tries to make them a better version of themselves, and that’s always my No. 1 goal.”

Todd has experienced exponential growth since she began her career. She held an amateur record of 26-8. She has captured 12 championships, including a WBC Amateur title, and three world tournament medals, including a medal at the Pan-American Tournament. Todd was one of two Muay Thai fighters from America to represent her country at the World Games in Wroclaw, Poland in 2018.

This competition was significant because it marked the first time Muay Thai was included after the sport received special preliminary Olympic recognition. The Games were a cause for celebration but also represented some personal hardship. Just days before she was set to fly to Poland to compete, Todd’s father suffered a stroke.

She contemplated not leaving, but her family pushed her to go and compete

“I wanted to fight my heart out for my dad,” Todd said. “I wanted to fight just as hard for him as I knew he was fighting for me and my family.”

She succeeded in that space and earned a bronze medal under some extenuating circumstances. With that experience behind her, Todd remained especially active in 2017. She competed 14 times in the calendar year, which set a record for Muay Thai competitors in the United States.

Todd wanted to turn professional, but quite frankly, she was devoid of opportunities in the United States. Instead, she remained focused on self-improvement. Todd’s personal mantra is precision, grace, and dedication, and this commitment helped to open up opportunities for her to turn professional.

56,Job question: too any opportunities and not enough time,1565902912,"I’ve given advice here before on topics as this, but I guess I’m looking for some outside unbiased advice...it’s my decision in the end, but I’d like some input. 

I’ll keep this short and brief because engineers like that kind of thing. 

I am being flown out in the final stage of an interview on Monday for a large agricultural company. The facility is state of the art, the people are great, and I’m sure the pay will be great. I currently work in agriculture as a product engineer/designer and I do not want to be known as the “agricultural machine design guy”. However, the job would be more involved than what I have right now. 

There’s another company I’m waiting to hear from that does R&amp;D and is on the forefront of technology in marine structures. Job would vary from building submarines, oil and gas structures, and even space structures. Pretty cool and much more technical than what I’m doing now. Pay would be good but not much room for growth financially. I want this more than the agriculture job stayed in the previous paragraph. 

I began my career as an engineering design intern for a multi-disciplinary company and moved into a contracted design engineer role. I was involved in many projects and I realized I wanted to be in defense after working on many defense based projects....

So to make my decision more complicated, I heard from a defense company today. And they want to interview next week.

The reason I’m looking for a new job is because my current location is not conducive to my or my family’s happiness. It’s actually quite terrible here. And each of the new jobs would move us back to our home state, where we would be happy and prosperous.

72,Signing over copyrights to my M.S. thesis... bad idea?,1565875722,"I was recently approached with the opportunity to publish my M.S. thesis in a book on sustainable water. At first I was pretty honored and excited about it, but then it hit me that I would be required to sign over copyrights. I have 5 journal publications already from different research I've been a part of and I know the journals have the copyrights to those which was no big deal for me. However, signing away the rights to my thesis feels a little more personal- even if I have no intention of ever publishing it elsewhere. 

Additionally, my thesis was part of a much larger project. Much of my work/writing is included in a paper that was never published. Even though my thesis is composed of my original work, I'm being told I must include everyone from the larger project as coauthors. Something about adding 8 other people to a book chapter on my thesis doesn't feel right to me either.

Am I overthinking this? Would you sign away rights to your thesis? Am I being petty about having to add coauthors? Should I do it anyway just for my resume? My thesis has nothing to do with the type of work I do as a water resources engineer.

Extra thoughts:
As part of my thesis, I developed a set of processes/tools that my alma mater is considering patenting and possibly marketing.

96,Math used in engineering research,1565823700,"Hello everyone.  I'm a rising sophomore engineering major who needs to confirm something. I know questions on the topic of how much math typical engineering jobs employ aren't exactly rare, but I haven't seen much clear information on how this varies with respect to the kind of work one does or their level of education.  From what I've surmised, engineering jobs don't tend to require math beyond algebra and trig since there are software packages, and specific empirically derived equations that are sufficient for most problems faced in industry.  However, whenever these kinds of threads come up, there are always the few odd comments that suggest engineering research tends to be more mathematically intensive, without going into any detail.  So, I'd like to know if there is any truth to the idea that research oriented engineering roles tend to actually make use of more advanced maths, and if so, in what capacity. 

 The reason I'm curious about this is because I really enjoy applied maths in the context of the natural sciences and engineering.  As weird as it may seem, I find everything from thermodynamics and and fluid mechanics to statics and dynamics intrinsically interesting due to the math component.  There's something about turning physical concepts into mathematics that I find very enjoyable.  Because of this, I've come to the conclusion that I am probably more suited towards the research engineering route, knowing full well that this will probably require a PhD.  So, knowing if there is actually engineering research that involves a considerable amount of mathematics will have a fairly large impact on my future.  If there isn't a high degree of maths involved in engineering research, I'll switch my major to physics and go that route instead. The reason physics wasn't my first option is because I find solving problems of technological and practical relevance with math more interesting than solving esoteric problems (although I am aware that applied physics does exist).

98,Electrical Engineering --&gt; Software Engineering,1565818354,"Hello!

I am entering my senior year in the Electrical Engineering program at my university, and wanted to know what steps I should take in order to move into the software engineering field after graduating. I have taken an elementary C++ course which taught me a lot about programming (this was the first time I wrote code!) and have been learning HTML/CSS (+JavaScript soon) to make my own website on the side. I also know the basics of Python, although I only have made one project with the language (relatively simple web scraper on Amazon).

On to the question, what should I focus on in order to make my goal a reality? I know it seems I am all over the place with languages but I haven't been able to narrow down what I should learn in order to compete with CS/SWE students coming out of college as well. I have considered firmware engineering, but would prefer a job that uses a 'higher' level language that would allow me to work remotely eventually. I have slowly started putting projects on my resume, but I don't know how I should proceed next!

How much time would it take for the inside of the container to reach 500C? 

The bottom of the container (surface area) is 109in^2

Thermal conductivity of type 304 stainless steel is 14.4 W/m K (watts per meter Kelvin? I dont really understand this variable)

The formula for heat transfer over time is Q/T = thermal conductivity x surface area x ((Temp1-Temp2)/thickness)) 

Plugging in all of the variables just gives me ""large number = Q/T"", which means nothing to me. 

I'm not smart, nor am I in school for engineering, so this is giving me a lot of trouble.

After reading all the rules and posting etiquette, I think this will not be a r/engineeringstudent question, however, if I was mistaken, feel free to remove for content purposes.

I have a bit of an odd question/situation, but would appreciate opinions from people in industry who have seen career outlook and earning potential first hand. 

To start off, I'm currently about to finish schooling as an A&amp;P aircraft mechanic, and start working in that field full-time. Long story short, I stopped attending a liberal arts college to obtain the A&amp;P certificate.  I would ultimately like to get a degree in something STEM, either mechanical or design oriented (Anything in Aero would be my ultimate dream job, but I'm extremely open to anything, so that is not a hindering factor). During the time I attended the liberal arts college, I earned 65+ credits worth of generals and a summer of Bio research experience (I was pre-med, but too nervous about GPA concerns to jump in headfirst, and come out with no job and immense debt).

I structured my prior college credits such that I could jump into any major, complete the major requirements, and finish out in 2 years. However, here lies the dillema. The liberal arts college doesnt offer an ME degree, but I could complete an ME degree at the state school in approximately 3.5 years.

This is my main question: Would the long term earning potential/job satisfaction of the extra year in undergrad, be worth the extra year of ME schooling?Instead of finishing out a math, comp-sci, or physics major from a liberal arts school? Does anybody have any similar anecdotes of non-engineering degrees, regretting it in industry later down the line?

We offer a refurbishment service where we will take used equipment, press the shaft out, and machine a new shaft to be pressed in. These pieces are basically just large rollers for industrial equipment. 

These shafts range in size from 4""-18"". 
We used to outsource the actual pressing but we recently acquired a 750 ton wheel press which we use to do this. We have no issues pressing the smaller shafts out but the larger ones present a problem for us. 

Typically we use oil torches to heat the roller part up and make the bore expand. However the amount of time it takes to get the head to proper temperature causes heat to sink into the shaft as well. 

We are trying to come up with better ways to heat the outer part faster before the shaft starts absorbing heat and expands. My idea was to switch to natural gas torches which burn much hotter and would heat it up faster but my concern there would be changing the properties of the metal where heat is applied and creating a soft spot on the roller.

29,Help sizing an electric bike motor,1565766172," 

Hi, 

I'm studying mechanical engineering and I need some advice from my colleagues. 

A friend of mine asked me to motorize his Graziella (a small Italian bicycle). His goal is to reach at least 40 km/h (24.8mph) and have a decent acceleration, while keeping costs low. 

My idea is to go with a 24V bike motor and a couple car batteries connected in series to power it.  

I don't know how to properly size a motor so please tell me if my math is wrong... 

To keep it easy I decided to size the motor in order to sustain a 40 km/h ride. 

I calculated the rolling resistance and the aerodynamic drag and then used the formula Power=Force\*velocity to estimate the power needed.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the formulas and data I used: 

&amp;#x200B;

\# D=0.5\*p\*w\^2\*Cd\*A    Drag force 

\# p=1.225 kg/m\^3           Air density 

\# w=11 m/s                       Velocity 

\# Cd=1.1                            Drag coefficient for a cyclist 

\# A=0.4 m\^2                     Frontal area of my friend on his bike 

&amp;#x200B;

\# Fr=C\*m\*g                       Rolling resistance (one wheel) 

\# C=0.005                           Rolling resistance coefficient for bike tires on asphalt 

\# m=110 kg                        Total mass 

\# P=Ft\*w                             Power needed 

\# Ft                                       Total force 

&amp;#x200B;

The results: 

\# D=32.6N 

\# Fr=5.4N\*2wheels= 10.8N 

\# Ft=43.4N 

\#P=477.4W 

&amp;#x200B;

According to this math my friend needs at least a 500W motor.  

Does this seem reasonable to you? 

Moreover, how should I dimension the transmission?

The company came back after the project was over asking us to produce more boards for testing. My partner and I are thinking of offering the company further development of their product as freelance engineers in addition to their boards. 

My partner just graduated with his degree in electrical engineering and I will be graduating with the same degree this December. The rest of the development is more mechanical heavy although I feel that my partner and I are capable. 

I was thinking of presenting our services in phases based on the different stages of development. We will be working part time on it (20 hours a week between the 2 of us) starting at $40 an hour for the first phase. We will negotiate higher wages as the project gets more complex in future phases. 

With the nature of the project, we will be building a final prototype rather than a market ready design. We believe the project will take us approximately 3 months to complete. 

Does r/AskEngineers think this is a good approach and does the pricing seem reasonable. I did some research on what to charge for freelance electrical engineering and I got a lot of different answers. It seems like I can charge a lot more per hour but with the work being mainly mechanical, it doesn't seem extremely complex/difficult.

48,Is needing a coding break unprofessional?,1565736958,"I can only do about 6-7 hours of coding a day; the day is 8 hours long, so with a few breaks, it works out. The rest of the time I return emails, read and write documentation and specs, and just do other things that aren't punching code into `vim`. After 6-7 hours of catching mistakes and being a human compiler, I feel drained and exhausted.

I started a new job as a senior software engineer. I feel like I'm not the only person who does this; the people on my team seem to do this, but just spread out their ""not coding"" time other ways (playing ping pong, reading each other's merge requests, socializing, etc.) 

Today my boss found out I do this when I started reading some specs for another task. Short story short, he wasn't happy, and I'm kind of at a loss about how to explain this without looking weak or incapable. I was sick this week, so I was trying to do work from home, and he kept telling me to take off. 

Truth be told, I can't afford to take off, despite having the flu. It took them a month and a half to hire me after my initial (supposed) start date, and after a month and a half of working there, I've only been paid for 1 week of working there because of their pay schedule. I really need money after not being paid for 3 months. 

So I'm doing whatever to keep up my velocity, including doing other tasks than the one I picked before I got sick. I spent a long time on a simple error before I realized that I needed to define something simple. Realizing my mental capacity was not 100%, I started working on other tasks, reading things that were trivial for me compared to what others could do. 

He found out, we had a bit of a tiff, and I'm left baffled. I can't be the only one who needs a break after coding for a while. Coding is hard. It's why software engineers are paid so much despite all the information in their heads being available on the interwoben.

64,Question about appropriate thermal conductivity for heating element in a seam sealer type device,1565716738,"

So basically I am designing a heating element to weld multiple layers of plastic together. It will involve a pneumatic press that holds the heating element to the material for a specified length of time to achieve a good seal.

For the heating element, would you want a metal with high or low heat conductivity?
Clearly you want the heat to leave the heating element and go into the material, so I think a high thermal conductivity would be good for that.
But in terms of maintaining the temperature of the element at the correct range, and ensuring the material doesn't get heated too fast, you would want a lower conductivity?
Perhaps it is a matter of balancing weld time, input wattage to the heater element, and the thermal conductivity of the metal? 

Pardon me if this is simplistic. My understanding is that heat entering the material means heat leaving the heating element. If my thermocouple is in the heating element,
then if my temperature reading dips after making contact with the material (assuming no other losses) this means that heat is transferring to the material I want to heat. 
Thus, if I want to maintain a steady output temperature, I need to try to keep the heating element at the required temperature during application by inputting the right amount of energy. Perhaps to get a really accurate reading of the weld temperature you would need to put the thermocouple in the material being welded, not in the heating element itself. 

One problem is that the heating element is sitting in the air before being applied to the material, resulting in the initial temperature needing to be somewhat higher than the desired output temperature.

I'm a EE whose studies are focused on power systems and controls. In Summer 2019 I did my first engineering internship at a building engineering/ MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) consulting firm with their electrical group. In a short list, I loved the company because:

* Short commute, 8 minutes away
* Decent pay, especially if I receive PE License and advance to project management role
* Outgoing team with many young people, lots of  socials and ease to get to know coworkers
* Newly renovated office, brand new kitchen, marble floors, snacks/coffee always stocked
* Small office setting, easy to interact with group leaders and get to know other departments
* Good stability/ career growth in MEP (demand for young engineers)
* Excellent office seating (quad desks with 4 ppl in a corner, great for collaboration/teamwork)

I understand that I probably had a great experience because I wasn't really stressed with deadlines like my team mates, and that if I worked there full time, I would probably see less through the rose tinted glasses. 

I am at a crossroad because the company was amazing to work for, but MEP is not exactly where I envisioned myself in school. As someone interested in power/controls, I would have seen myself in a more programming related role where I can apply software and EE knowledge. I think I can do the job, but it wouldn't be something I would be excited about, it would be more of just working for the sake of working.

1,"9 Years in, and I'm burnt out. I need advice.",1565656297,"So, story time: I got into a great engineering school, and ended up out of college with a small company that does a lot of high risk/high reward projects for many wildly different clients, been with them ever since I graduated. Many of the programs don't pan out, but it's ok - that's the nature of the work, and the work keeps coming. New grads love it because of the variety. I've worked on commercial products to stuff for the military, with scope ranging from things as big as an SD card to the size of a large pickup truck; name an industry and I've probably done something in that realm.

9 years have gone by there, I'm now one of the veterans of the company. And I'm done trying to wear every hat at the same time because of either internal factors or the customer changes their mind and we pivot 180 to do something else. I've learned to disassociate the program with the work - I'm as excited for making a missile as I am a coffee maker, either product has a way of getting from paper to production, it's just a different set of requirements, budget, and schedule, and the end result probably isn't going to look like the original because the customer wanted something that's physically unrealizable anyway. I only care about working where I have the skills/tools/people/resources that I need, and I can do my thing, so that the results can meet expectations, which may not exist. And I seem to prefer the shorter projects and get quite bored working on the longer programs - they stop holding my interest after a year or so of grinding away the stone, and it does show..

College and work both stress the ""work on your passion"" attitude, to take ownership of what projects you are given - and talking to some people who work in other companies in this area, they too tell me I need to interview around and find a project I'll fall in love with and work on that. After too many draining weeks working on everything I thought I loved, I have few fucks left to give and even fewer pieces of myself to sacrifice for my work. I moved my passions and life outside of my employer and engineering, and that mentally helped a great deal and gave me new perspectives. But I get the sense that I don't have a passion for engineering anymore. Also, some yellow flags are coming up at work indicating that now would be a good time to seek new opportunities.

Either way, I'm going to go on the job hunt and search around and see what comes out. However, what does reddit think about my rambling? I say I lost my passion, but I'm not sure if I think I'm done with engineering or just the job. Besides just jumping ship and interviewing around, I'm figuring alternate paths could involve getting a PhD if I find something interesting, jumping into government engineering and getting something stable, or just straight up go back to school, get a degree in something else entirely and change careers (which I started to a few years ago for PA school, but decided against it for a myriad of reasons). However I'm not sure how sane any of those ideas are. When I tell my engineer friends (coworkers or not) I'm thinking about changing careers, or that I don't do engineering stuff in my personal time, or that I want a stable job that isn't challenging, they look at me like I've got three heads and just spoke to them in Klingon.

2,Why does the Army want a hydrogen fuel cell pickup truck? Is it a wise decision?,1565655181,"Summary (from what I know of it just from reading articles on the net)

A couple years ago the Army ordered a few hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) Colorado trucks from GM. Colorado being their smaller version of a pickup truck. It had a 25kW motor (~35horsepower) motor, and they just messed around with it, shot it with bullets, shot it with rpgs, made sure it didn't explode, etc.

Now they're ordering &amp; testing a 100kW (~135horsepower) HFC motor on the larger Silverado platform. It seems that if this version withstands testing, they'll order a good amount of them for field use. 

Thoughts on this? Since they're shooting bullets and rpgs at it, it seems they'd use this in combat zones, not just transport around bases here in the states. 

If so, that requires a pretty large infrastructure in order to have resources around to refuel these vehicles. And it'd be a sister infrastructure to go alongside gasoline etc, unless this is the start of them moving to *all* HFC for vehicles over time.

I’ve come seeking your wise advice. 

So, I recently graduated from college with an engineering degree. I’ve been offered a job to work for an airline where I’d be making sure planes were up to different standards and regulations. This job seems like it involves a lot of paper work and not a lot of hands-on engineering related to my degree. I think it could still be pretty interesting work and that I would learn a lot, but I’m worried that it might limit my ability to change up industries in the future.

66,"Graduating senior with full time offer at dream company, but not in area of interest; Am I approaching this scenario correctly?",1565568062,"TLDR: New hire has been interning with dream company A for past summer. New hire has part-time internship during school year and full time offer in talks with company A, but not dream position. New hire wants to apply to other dream companies too to see if they could get dream positions. Unsure of how to leverage this scenario &amp; opportunities into getting into dream company with dream position without burning down bridges.

I'm currently interning at Company A which has always been a dream company of mine. They've offered a part-time internship for the next coming school year after I've expressed some interest. They also hinted at wanting me to return for a full-time position after I graduate in Spring 2020, which I also expressed some interest to. However, the position that this is for is not in my exact career interest. I am interested in design, but this position is more towards testing.

I want to stay at Company A, but not this position. I feel like I might have messed up by expressing interest in the part time test engineering internship (it actually was my idea - they opened it up for me after I mentioned it).  I was planning to go to my school's career fair to visit Company A, plus interacting with the design groups at Company A to try and get a full-time offer in design. However, I'm worried that the recruiters/managers wouldn't want me to be jumping across groups, especially after seeing how my testing group was willing to train/teach me some more with the part time school-year internship. In addition, it might be weird if I expressed interest in my testing group's internship/full time offer but went to the career fair for a different position behind their back.

In addition, I interned at Company B in the past which was only 2nd to Company A as my dream company. They've been wanting me to return and I've kept in contact with them, but haven't said anything exact about returning. I was planning to re-apply to them and see the opportunities I get again. I'm fairly certain I could get a design position here as it was what I did in my previous internship.

My preference for a full time offer would be:

1. Design at Company A

2. Design at Company B

2. Company A if I can't get any opportunities in design

3. Company B

If I decide to not go back to Company A, it would still be in my long term career goals to eventually go back to them as a design engineer, even if it means getting design experience elsewhere first.

With this said, my following questions were:

1. Would I be better off turning down Company A's offer for a test engineering part-time internship? I don't want them to use more resources on training me for a position I might eventually have to turn down / not want to do (since it's 3rd in my priority list), and potentially leave a bad taste in their mouth as the intern who expressed interest in the group but left anyways. A likely scenario I think might happen if I stayed with this part-time internship would be me finding the design role I wanted at Company B, and having to turn down Company A's testing position that I seemingly showed so much interest to.

2. Since my career goal is to be at Company A as a design engineer, would it be better for me to accept their test engineer position and try to move on later? Or would it be better to be at a different company but getting design engineering experience?

Company A &amp; B are in the same industry, and partners on several projects together. Company A however is extremely prestigious and well-known to those even outside the industry.

I earned a BS in a plant related field, and combined with my work history revolving mainly around mechanical assembly, technician type roles, and plant related stuff, lead to me getting a job as a technician at this company on the plants-in-space department.

Right now I'm a contractor, as they don't want to hire people right away apparently, and it seems as if they may opt to renew my contract instead of hiring me fully.

So I'm wondering how effective tolls are? They effectively comb traffic, some go through the ""fast pass"" lanes, the rest get staggered.

26,How can I get 18-19.5V from an ATX PSU without blowing myself up?,1565411448,"Hello Engineers! 

My mind has been set alight recently by the idea of putting a working PC inside a working Nintendo 64 console. Ideally, I'd like to power both devices with the same power supply, with the possibility of adding an external GPU later. But for now, it's just about the PC and the Nintendo 64.

I've been researching and watching tutorials on modding an ATX power supply into a bench top power supply. I'd like to use a similar modification to power an NUC mini PC and the Nintendo 64.

From the specs, here are their power requirements:

The Nintendo 64 has two DC inputs: Input #1: 12V 0.8A, Input #2: 3.3V 0.8A

The NUC mini PC has one DC input: 19.5V (±10%) 11.8A. (It's designed to be used with 230W AC adapters.)

I'm considering using a [400W HDPlex DC-ATX power supply](https://www.hdplex.com/hdplex-400w-hi-fi-dc-atx-power-supply-16v-24v-wide-range-voltage-input.html) to power the Nintendo 64 like this:

1. Use the +12V/GND leads from the CPU EPS socket for input #1
2. Use the +3V/GND leads from the SATA socket for input #2

But for the NUC mini PC, I think there are two ways to get to 19.5V:

* Use the -12V/+12V leads from the 24-pin ATX socket to get 24V, then use an adjustable step down converter to get down to 19.5V. [I was thinking of this converter in particular.](https://www.amazon.com/Aideepen-Constant-Current-Adjustable-Converter/dp/B0747QDRW9)
* Forget about 19.5V for the PC and undervolt instead. Use the -12V/+5V from the 24-pin ATX socket leads to get 17V. This is \~13% lower than what the PC is expecting, but it might still work with the stated ±10% allowance.

However, I'm concerned by both of these methods for PC power since they do not include a ground. So before I end up hurting myself, can you tell me:

1. Is this a stupid idea? 
2. If it's not stupid, which method is best and how can I make it safe and reliable?
3. If it is stupid, how should I power both devices with one power supply?

Here's a picture: https://imgur.com/a/QJ3ANOO  
  
The problem I'm running into is that when I put the threaded rod between the pillow blocks and then tighten the bearing's lock collar, I think the bearings are out of alignment. When I had this attached to the wooden headstock, there was a very noticeable difficulty in rotating the threaded rod. It would be mostly smooth, but one section of the turn took an extra bit of force and caused the bearings to try and shift. This led to a lot of vibration when I had the shaft spinning.  
  
I took it apart and put everything on a absolutely level surface and when I assembled everything like in the above pictures, rotating the rod caused the pillow blocks to shift back and forth by about a half inch with each turn.
  
I've not dealt with pillow block bearings before so I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong. Do the pillow blocks need to be oriented in a certain way (lock collars facing or lock collars not facing)?

I'm a 17 year old currently making an Ion engine but I'd like to do more than make and try to understand what I'm doing. Currently I know how to make the thing, I think I understand Cathodes and Anodes well enough (of course nothing advanced) but I'm getting slightly confused on reaching the breakdown voltage of air. 

I understand the standard unit for an E field is V/m and that the breakdown voltage of air is 3.0kV/mm. With a 30kV DC power supply feeding a cathode, would this be enough to reach the breakdown voltage? 

What I currently think is yes, it would be as it is constantly emitting 30kV across a small space. Am I right or is there more to it (of course there is going to be but, ya know...)?

39,Any aeronautical engs around? Google appears to be overly optimistic about autogyros. What are their major disadvantages when compared to other types of aircraft?,1565383696,"Context: if there's a machine that is affordable and easy to fly, then I'd like to become an amateur aviator. No matter if that's an airplane, chopper, motorized paraglider, balloon or whatever as long as it gets me off the ground. Autogyros look attractive.

This is what I have learned from googling so far. (I'll call them gyros for short). Please correct me if any of the following statements is wrong or only partially true, assuming an ultralight vehicle:

* A new one can be afforded by a price more expensive than a car but still comparable (five figures)
* Gyros cannot take off vertically, stand still on the air, or land vertically.
* Nearly 300m of runway are needed for takeoff, but some of them have a ""jump-start"" feature that allows them to take off without any running distance. (Bonus question, how does this ""jump"" feature work?)
* In any case they climb at no more than 45° after take off. Since tan(45°)=1 the math is simple, you're at risk of crashing at take off if the distance to the nearest obstacle is comparable to its height
* They can land at a very low speed, around 20 km/h. Landing angle is almost vertical.
* A very small space is needed for landing, comparable to the length of two buses
* In case of emergency during flight (engine failure or running out of fuel), they can glide about half as much as an airplane in terms of horizontal distance for their altitude
* They can land softly without fuel
* In case of emergency, due to the short running distance, it's easy to find a landing spot
* If case of emergency landing, if you run out of running distance, it'd be a low speed crash comparable to bicycle speed so it's totally survivable with moderate injuries
* They are more stable than airplanes or helicopters in bad weather
* They have a fundamental flaw that can cause you to oscillate. This can tilt them beyond the tolerable angle and lose lift, so they fall like a brick
* Despite being easy to fly and easy to land, statistics show the have more accidents, though most of them can be attributed to lack of pilot training

Any other disadvantages that I'm missing? Why do they have so many accidents if they are so easy to fly? Is their oscillation flaw responsible for them?

81,Representing Engineering Judgement through Data?,1565330862,"After reviewing designs (ex: bridges, concrete structures, various infrastructure, etc) from both experienced and less experienced Engineers, the level of risk each Engineer is accounting for is noticeable. A conservative design can result in high costs in both construction and maintenance (also, increased schedule durations). Is there opportunity in extrapolating data assessing Engineering judgement and the final product?

For instance, once a bridge is constructed - what was the maintenance record over 1/5/10 years? And while it was being constructed, was there opportunity for less costly design without jeopardizing public safety? For instance, we consulted with various Engineers since we believed our Engineer of Record was out for lunch. Independent consultants provided alternative designs at half the cost and easier constructability.

Is there opportunity in utilizing mass amount of data with regards to various designs? I understand each consultant/Engineer is independent, but can this be useful for optimizing future designs? There's numerous structures and designs but I don't see anywhere where this data is being accumated.

Why does erosion control seem so wasteful and pointless?

Sorry I hate that term..... and the permanent BMP's just completely screw up the flow lines of ditches and inverts of pipes. I've seen where we put rip rap at the out flow of the pipe but why not just put a structure that you could remove a grate and clean out sediment? I would think it has to do with cost, but when you just throw silt fence and waddles at everything money doesn't seem to be an issue. I don't get it?

I imagine P = I * V wouldn't help since ""I"" would always be equal to zero during charge shutoff.  Would it be accurate to let i=0 and essentially just use the voltage output of the panel as the watts?  Or is there another formula that I can use just knowing voltage to calculate power output?

What I'm confused on is would this still be convection if the heat source was at the top?

There was one PE in my old company who was helping as an ""indirect supervisor"", but honestly I haven't wanted to spend the time required to apply only to have that nearly 4 years totally rejected, plus I don't have any PEs available to verify experience at my new company.

I'm torn when people ask what I do because I'm technically *not* a Professional Engineer and haven't been able to take the FE, so how can I share my field without having to constantly explain and cover my ass with my titles/job description?

How do I share with companies/recruiters my qualifications and experience despite that they say they're looking for a ""Mechanical Engineer"" even if I know that their workload and requirements don't warrant a Professional Engineer.

69,feeling humiliated. My intern project failed miserably. Anyone ever doubted whether you were good enough for engineering?,1565191081,"Basically: the company I’m interning for has a wash bay. Equipment comes into the wash bay for cleaning/repairs. One equipment/trailer in particular would get packed with sand and they’d have to clean it out and the sand would go into the sump of the wash bay. Every year it’s costing them close to $200,000 to clean out the sumps (third party with vacuum truck$. So my idea was to catch the sand/water mixture that comes out of that trailer &amp; filter out the water. Then take this sand over to the “sand piles” at the yard- so that it could all be contained in one area &amp; would be easier to dispose of/ would reduce the amount of sump cleanups. 

1) my container didn’t even work. It was a 2 piece container and the water/sand would leak in the space between the two (maybe could be fixed with weather strips or some rubber material that creates a good seal)

2) but worst of all...talked to real estate today, my last day before my presentation, and they told me that a containment area wasn’t possible- there’s no space. And according to one guy, it’d actually cost us more to have the sand some place in the yard where the wind could just blow it away, etc. So the sand has nowhere to go after it’s caught with the container (if that thing ever even works)!!

So basically this whole summer was a failure. I feel like I shouldn’t even be an engineer. 

And yes, I had gone to real estate a few times before but that one guy wasn’t there until yesterday when I went. And some of the engineers had told me about them putting the sand in “sand piles” out on the yard before - but according to real estate, they get fined for doing that b/c the sand is wet/contaminated. 

This just sucks. Tomorrow is my presentation. I probably just won’t mention the fact that the sand has nowhere to go because...it’ll just be so embarrassing. I’ll act like I don’t know. (They probs won’t even think of continuing with this idea since I’m just an intern anyway)


Most of all I feel so guilty that I wasted a week of the welders’ time in building that container. They could’ve been doing more important things for the company.

I do have some “long term” solutions at the end of my presentation, thankfully, but they’re just ideas and nothing I actually worked on since I was mostly focused on that container :( 

I just feel like the worst engineer ever. I was so embarrassed when it didn’t work and now I feel so stupid after what real estate just told me. 

I just needed to rant. This is just making doubt whether I should go into engineering at all. I don’t want to keep wasting peoples time and money with dumb ideas.

Problem: I need 4 x vertical(Z-axis) hollow rods in a row, (""A-D"", 4mm ID) to rotate as follows: A &amp; B counter-clockwise, C &amp; D Clockwise. A &amp; D need to rotate at 2x the rate of B &amp; C.

They need to be driven by a single rotary input of force (hand crank).

I have 4 worms and 4 gears that interface, and was figuring I could put all four worms directly on the single input crank,  but of course I forgot that they all drive in the same direction, and then sitting 'flipped' doesn't change the drive direction.

So back to the drawing board - New layout produces the correct desired output. This has the worms ""|"" in parallel, on opposite sides of A&amp;B, &amp; C&amp;D.  


ala: |(A) |(B)  (C)| (D)|

  
But how would I link the 4 worms to a single rotary input? Only thing I came up with is a chain drive and sprockets, which is probably getting too cumbersome and fiddly.

80,Why can't you daisy-chain UPS to extend battery except that the batteries don't want to?,1565155146,"This is such a weird page for me:

https://www.power-solutions.com/pressroom/newsletter/2013/09/top-4-reasons-you-should-never-daisy-chain-ups-systems

First of all, I get what they're saying that all chained UPS will immediately simultaneously discharge, since they consider the power off.

First of all, even so wouldn't only the last one be under any load? Like if I have wall&gt;1&gt;2&gt;3&gt;4&gt;PC, then if I disconnect them, all 4 will discharge. But the PC will draw its watts, say 200 watts.  Meanwhile 3 will not be under any load, for 5 or 10 minutes say, because where would the load come from?

Basically I don't get it. They can't simultaneously discharge because only the last in the chain gets the load.

Finally, isn't it just a matter that they don't want to pass through power from another UPS? If you found a kind that didn't notice, then when wall was disconnected, 2, 3, 4 and PC would all think it was still still connected, until 1 fully discharged. At that point 2 would fully discharge then 3 would fully discharge then 4 would fully discharge and at that point the PC would turn off.  Only because they ""notice"" that the power from 1 is not ""on"" anymore (because it's not ""good enough"") do they start discharging rather than passing through.

So basically it seems to me that if you found a brand that didn't notice or differentiate normal wall power from a UPS output, there would be no problem daisy chaining them.

For the course on analog devices, which of the two following options would you prefer for a required course all EE's take:

1.) No BJT coverage, but instead go much deeper into MOSFET behavior and design.  FET devices vastly outnumber BJT devices these days.  Further, going more in depth on one device type will allow more sophisticated analysis and design than what they'd see in option 2 below (due to time), and I figure if you know one device really well it's not too bad to understand the other type of device.  

2.) Cover both BJT and FET devices, though at the expense of depth.  With this course setup students aren't masters of either device, but have a foundation to draw on when they might see either type in the wild.  Time limits the depth that is possible.

82,Engineering Entrepreneurs -- Do you still value your degree?,1565155083,"Hi there!

Going into second year EE and starting to doubt my need to get a degree. My dream has always been entrepreneurship, but I figured that I should learn how to build stuff before going off and doing it, which coincided nicely with my parents wishes for me to follow traditional schooling. However, I have slowly started to break down and question more and more whether I really need to be paying all this money, or if I can be a great entrepreneur without. My interests lie in fairly high-tech fields, namely AI and Aerospace, although I'm already self teaching myself to program neural nets, so maybe I can teach myself rocket science too :P Here's how I see it:

Pros:

\- Gain life experiences that I may never have the opportunity to have again

\- Network and meet people who I may decide to start a business with (although a successful mentor of mine said he never found anybody interesting to partner with in university)

\- Make friends, enjoy life without the weight of the world on me, and allow my biggest issues to be what I'm going to get on my physics final and what the pretty girl across the class thinks of me

\- Take classes in areas I may never have considered of interest to me

\- Work on projects that bolster my problem solving skills

\- Participate in clubs and extracurriculars

Cons:

\- An incredible amount of money gone. I'm from Canada so I pay a fraction of what US kids pay, and I don't have any student loans on my horizon, but my parents are struggling to pay.

\- A degree that is essentially worthless to me, apart from being a representation of aforementioned experiences

\- Years gone by that I could have been starting a business and doing what I dream of doing

I'm looking for an electric motor for a project but there's so many damn types and options to choose from that I don't know how to filter the selections down to what I need. My needs are pretty simple; I'm looking to build an automatic pot-stirrer that I can vary the speed with my arduino, preferably digitally but beggars can't be choosers, and I need a motor that meets the following criteria :

1) may be stirring for hours and used again on another pot a little afterwards so it has to be something like a fan motor that can take the continuous work load.

2) will be used to stir sauces that are a little thick, perhaps like tomoto sauce, condensed milk or elmers glue consistency, in a 20 liter pot that's 12"" in diameter, so has to have some decent torque. 

3) motor speed should be variable to somewhere around 10-30 rotations per minute at most.

4) will be mounted on top of the pot to a long rod somehow, perhaps with gears, and the rod will run down the center of the pot and have attachments on it that will stir the pot. The attachments are rectangular spatula-like blades, say about 2.5"" high x 12"" wide, one on the bottom to scrape the bottom of the pan so it won't burn the sauce, and perhaps two more along the length of the shaft to help stir. 

5) should be able to fit on a metal ""bridge"" across the top of the pot and shouldn't be too heavy either so that, say, an older woman in reasonable shape (mom?) should be able to mount it.

I hope I've provided enough information, I was trying to be as verbose as I could in my description. Based on this criteria, how can I go about finding a motor that would suit my needs? I tried several sites and the options are overwhelming, I don't even know where to start!

69,Simple and elegant solution for a 4-way hinged A-frame?,1565017033,"Can anyone recommend a simple solution for this? It will be an A-frame for holding up a suspended load. To keep this simple, I'll give the parameters we're working around and exclude those which aren't relevant:

1. Prefer it to be hinged at the head in all directions
2. Needs to be made with only laser cutter and Tig welder
3. Needs to maintain strength similar to the hinges as shown
4. Don't worry about how we connect the load; just keep in mind that it will be suspended below the head
5. Uses 50mm OD pipe x 5mm wall x 270 cm length and 10mm plate
6. Extra pieces of plate or pipe can be used between hinges as long as it's fairly simple and just as strong

Please refer to these images for the general idea: 

https://imgur.com/a/vzitqcY

As you can see, the A won't work in all directions. If we open up one A, the other will bind. We just need the other A to open like the first A so that we'll get a pyramid shape.

My problem is that, whereas most kayak hatches are round, mine are rounded rectangles. If I follow the instructions above, there will be pressure on the corners of the oval but not much on the flat side sections, and water will get in. 

I am currently imagining making (from minicell foam or 3D-printed plastic) D-shaped sections for the flat sides, to effectively make the perimeter an oval. I don't know if that works, though.

87,Load Cell Measurement on a Test Rig Issues.,1565002204,"Hello,
Currently I'm having issues calibrating a test rig that is manufactured, I can't explain much what it does but basically pushes a load with test media on downwards onto an object and measures the distance through the media it has gone over so many test cycles. 

However we are having discrepancies between our main rig and our smaller versions that we send out to customers. Currently this distance is far different between the machine both initially and after all the test cycles.

The head of the rig (where the load pushes down) are [supposed] to be 80N +/-1N of load when fully loaded with test media running on a free slide, the plates attached to this slide and the fully loaded test media make up the 80N of load.

I'm not too versed in load cells which is where I could use the help, but lets say I have 2 machines A &amp; B.

Scenario A: If when lowering this head for calibration which just measures the load of the head (first pneumatically and then taking the slack by hand to lightly lower it onto the load cell at various points) I get Machine A (Original Rig) at around 81.4N and Machine B at 80.8N which is within tolerance.

Scenario B: If I then apply some load myself and take it off Machine A is around 87.8N and Machine B is 82.6N, also measured at various points which is out of tolerance on both.

Their are a number of other factors it could also be (the object that goes through the media runs on an electric slide, potential friction on the free slides, how the object squares up to the media), however for now I just want to focus on asking the question on which scenario is a better indication of what load on the object is being applied. 

A difference of 0.6N is easily acceptable and would suggest other issues. A difference of 5N+ would be a big issue and require re calibration on the original machine (it is a fairly old machine!) to get the load down.

However, I am in the military and I will get out in 3 years(about the time that I turn 26). Prior to enlisting I completed 2 years of my BS in chemE, then I had financial troubles and decided to join the military. In order to take advantage of the tuition benefits I switched my major to software engineering and I should have that completed around the time that i get out.

Ideally, I’ll be getting out with my BS in Software Eng. and have my entire GI Bill to work with. The GI Bill offers 36 months of free schooling and a housing allowance. The 36 months is class time so it’s good for 4 school years.

My current gpa is a 3.37 and I haven’t taken the LSAT yet but I want to attend Pitt’s dual JD-MBA program with my GI Bill.

Prior to attending law school I want to work as an engineer and get some experience. I figured 2-5 years would be adequate for me to transition into law. That would make me 31-34 years old upon graduating. 

I don’t mind computer science, but my passion is chemistry. Unfortunately, circumstance has led me astray from that and I’m not sure how or where to fit the final 2 years of my ChemE BS into this.

6,[Career] Need ideas for job titles to look at,1564969900,"Apologies ahead of time for a text-heavy post, this has all just been bouncing around my head for a few months. 

I'm roughly 2.5 years into the workforce in the USA after graduating with a BS in Manufacturing Eng. So far I've had two positions but I think I haven't found what I'm looking for yet. 

At the first job I was a sort of ""general"" technical services engineer at a small plant. I would do the plant's tooling/fixture design and fabrication - conceptualizing, design in CAD, CAM programming, running machines, assembly, installation, and qualification. I had other duties as well but I absolutely loved this aspect of the job. I ended up leaving that job due to life changes but I miss being the go-to design/machining guy.

At my current job I'm a product applications engineer - basically taking existing products from the company's portfolio and adapting them to new applications. Occasionally I get to do some light prototyping + fabrication/machining for some projects and I absolutely love that aspect of the job, but those opportunities are rare and most of the time I'm bogged down in more of a project management role.

I know for certain that what gets me up in the morning is the prospect of *making* things. I spent a huge amount of time in college in my school's machine shop messing around, and in my spare time I play with free CAD and my welder at home making whatever I can think of. I adore the rare times at work when I can create but I feel that those activities probably aren't typically assigning to ""engineering"" roles. 

I'm wondering if any of you wonderful folks can suggest career tracks to investigate into that might be more in line with what I'm looking for. Is ""prototype engineering"" a thing? I'm wondering if maybe I should have just been a machinist...? I've given some thought into investing in some equipment (CNC plasma table, etc) and trying to run a small one man job shop, but my gut tells me it would be hard to compete with all of the other places out there. 

Honestly if it means taking a pay cut and losing the ""engineer"" title I think I'd be open to it. I'm just desperate to avoid a cubicle for the next 40 years of my life and actually produce things I can hold in my hands.

11,Part time vs Full time for Masters?,1564958397,"Hi engineers, I am currently a young engineer, 22, working in the structural engineering field for a firm in Sacramento with my BS in civil engineering and I am thinking of pursuing my masters in Structural Engineering. I understand that my salary will probably not increase much if at all, but I see that in California, structural engineering jobs usually require or highly prefer a masters. I also moved to Sacramento for this job but eventually want to end up back down in Socal to be closer to my family and I believe a masters would help me land a job down there and give me better opportunities.

I have been pondering a few options and just wanted gather the advice from some of you guys. I haven't applied or been accepted to any grad programs yet, so basically I would start Fall 2020, next fall and just work and save money for this year. I have been considering applying to UCSD or Cal Poly SLO, my undergrad school, and doing their 1 year program for the fall 2020. However, I also have been considering just continue working in Sacramento for this structural firm and doing a part time masters at CSU Sacramento. 

I am kinda trying to figure out which road would be the best one to take. I am really considering the part time road because I hear the CSU Sac caters there program for working professionals and offers night classes; I am looking in to this currently. My work doesn't offer tuition reimbursment, but I don't really care, it would cost about $2500 for a part time semester, and I would be able to continue working full time and make a good salary and gain structural experience. I am worried, however, that working full time and school part time may be to much and I really dont want to drag this masters out over like 4 or 5 years, ideally I would want to finish in about 2-3 years. This is why I am considering just biting the bullet and going back to Cal Poly or UCSD, if I get accepted, because I could knock it out quick, but at the cost of not making a salary and paying more in tuition, but only for 9 months. 

Also, specifically for structural engineering, does the prestige of the school matter? Obviously UCSD has a better program than CSU Sac, but would firms look down on a CSU Sac masters? I still would be learning pretty much the same concepts, but I know certain companies like certain programs more than others, and I don't even know if I would get accepted to UCSD. Or is the masters even worth it in terms of effort and money, would just working a couple years, and getting my PE be enough to transition to a career back down south? I am cautious of this route though, because if I do decide to pursue a career in structural engineering, I would think a masters would always benefit and since I'm young, this would be the time I would want to get one, if ever.

My role is not well defined and it means I am able to work cross departmentally depending on the project and its relevance to my skills, it has become hard to pin an average salary on it and the current problem for me is that just by looking at relevant and similar job titles I'm being underpaid for a ""graduate"" by more than 20% if i compare the average starting salaries of aerospace graduates.

I'm attempting to do some calculations to figure out CG positions of an aircraft over the course of its flight. However, going through the aircraft flight manual yields an interesting item referred to as the ""moment index"".

According to [Aviation Glossary](https://aviationglossary.com/moment-index-or-index/), it's defined as:

&gt;Moment index (or index). A moment divided by a constant such as 100, 1,000, or 10,000. The purpose of using a moment index is to simplify weight and balance computations of airplanes where heavy items and long arms result in large, unmanageable numbers. 

General equation for the index is: 

&gt;Index = (Moment/C) + K  
&gt;  
&gt;Where C and K are constants

**I'm curious to know if anyone can provide me with a textbook reference for moment indexes. I couldnt find it anywhere.**

I'm building a freeze-dryer to preserve food (for hiking and such) and I basically need a vacuum pump that's able to hold a vacuum of 0.006 atm or lower (to be below the triple point of water). There are quite a few inexpensive models that seem like they would do the job (e.g., [this](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06XRL2BWS/?coliid=I1AWH7ZPPY75XP&amp;colid=25TTIX382ZY89&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)), but they require oil for operation and I read that it's bad to get water vapour inside them, although I couldn't find much details on what the issues would be.

From what I understand, the oil serves to lubricate and seal the space/intersection between the vanes and the wall of the chamber. I figure that if water vapour gets in the pump from the low-pressure side, it may/will condensate and mix with the oil when it reaches the high-pressure side. However, I'm not sure what kinds of problems this can cause.

An oil-free pump would be an easy solution, but those I found either can't reach such low pressures ore are much more expensive than the oil-sealed ones.

Given that the goal of the system is to extract water vapour from frozen items, it would be nice to know whether I can go ahead with an oil-sealed pump or if I have to figure out a system to prevent the water from reaching the pump, which AFAICT would require a second vacuum chamber that would be cold enough for the vapour to turn back into ice at low pressure.",AskEngineers,False,Xilef11,/r/AskEngineers/comments/clxwhn/what_problems_do_water_vapour_cause_in_an/

30,Impact forces from drop test,1564925214,"Hi All,

I have a few questions I was hoping this community could help me out with.

I'm trying to determine whether a small latch on a consumer electronic device will hold during the impact from a drop test. If the peak deceleration that occurs during impact is say 1000G but this only occurs for a fraction of a second, is it possible to make a reasonable estimation of the overall stresses and deflections that will occur on the mechanism parts without using FEA?

I think the part thats throwing me here is that this high deceleration occurs for only a split second. Initially, I thought I could just multiply the mass of my parts by the deceleration rate to get the overall force they would exert at the time of impact, but im a bit unsure.

For example, in my design I have a spring loaded latch, if the direction of impact is in line with the latch travel direction then 1000G x the mass of the latch would be the force applied to the spring? I can calculate the spring's deflection under that load but this would be for a static condition rather than a dynamic?

Any advice would be appreciated!",AskEngineers,False,jttomlinson2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/clwacq/impact_forces_from_drop_test/

34,I don't feel safe at my new job.,1564920990,"So as the title says, I don't feel safe in my new work environment and I'm interested in other's input.  This is going to be a little long so I apologize in advance.

For the bulk of my career I have been doing PLC/ Instrumentation &amp; Controls commissioning.  I was a ""Road Dog"" and worked in a bunch of different industries.  I worked on a few oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, water treatment, waste to energy, government buildings, etc.  I was severely injured 3 years ago and I just started working again about 6 weeks ago.  Working turn overs, expansions, and new facility job sites over the years has made me extremely safety conscious.  I was injured through no fault of my own.  I was injured due to short cuts being taken on safety devices.  Basically, my blood reaffirmed an OSHA regulation.  As you can imagine I am ridiculously aware of safety issues now.  I suffer from anxiety and depression issues now due to the accident.

I accepted a position as a maintenance shift lead at a medical supply manufacturer due to the pay being INSANELY high and no travel.  I won't say the name but if you've ever visited a doctor in America, then you've used one of their products.  There is one guy that has my same title and has been there for 5 or 6 years.  He's been bullying me  and making a hostile work environment.  I won't bore you with the details, but he dug himself a pretty big hole and then (meteorically) pushed me into a corner.  It triggered a full on panic attack and I ended up going to the nurse.  She got HR involved and I'm on paid leave until that is straightened out.  I don't foresee him being employed there anymore for a plethora of reason that I let HR know about.  I'm not sure if I'll have a job anymore though.  Only time will tell.  

On the day of the big blow out, I knew something was going to happen so I walked around the plant and took pictures of all the safety and housekeeping violations that I saw.  I took over 270 pictures of different violations.  The most common ones were flammables not being in lockers, liquids and cans of compressed air not stored properly, slip hazards, and ladders not stored properly.  Some very concerning ones are emergency exit doors in the production/ clean room being blocked on both sides and hazardous materials being discarded into grey trash cans and totes from Wal-Mart with no labels.  I used my own phone because they don't have a camera to use.  I brought up the flammables and compressed air to my boss on Monday of this week and we are working on that.  Sadly though it took some convincing. 

Now that I've had a few days away from work I see that I was on edge the entire time I worked there.  I think all those safety issues were eating at me, along with the jerk bullying me.  Since I didn't nothing wrong other than scream like a drill sergeant and use a bunch of foul language and I've shown that I can do good there, I assume that I will be asked to come back to work.  But I really don't know if I should.  Part of me feels that since I'm the only one with the balls to speak up I should go back and really push all the safety stuff to get that place safe and get their machines dialed back in.  The rest of me is saying shut up, show up, and keep looking for a job that is within my qualifications and take the pay cut.  Other factors are I'm pretty much broke due to not working for 3 years and I am also a single full time dad.  I do have a second round interview with a different company on Monday.  I'm hoping that goes well.

35,I'm killing power tools too quickly. Any ideas on how to extend their life?,1564918740,"Issue to solve:  
\-Burning up angle grinders and small stick welder units frequently while running in high temps (90+ ambient) and on small generators (4.5kW Kipoer diesel, 8kW Predator gasoline, 4.5kW Daewoo diesel, and Lincoln Ranger Welder/Generator - 10kW rated output).  


So, potential issues are the heat, dirty power from the generators, or possibly surges/brownouts.  


I can't fix the heat, though I am considering putting timers on the grinder circuits to force a break every 30 mins of continuous running.  


I also have a small surge protector for a 15A plug that is used where the welder plugs into the generator when it is running on 120VAC. Do any of you know a good line conditioner/surge suppressor for 4.5kW or range that I could hardwire into the generator?  


Is it possible/helpful to add a capacitor to the grinder or welder circuits to reduce the surge current off the generator? Maybe this could keep the system a little more stable? Is it a terrible idea?

38,"3 years into a job, and a mentor gave some advice on a Masters. Now I don't know what to do. I'd like to acquire more data points.",1564891263,"**Background:** Small company- Mechanical engineer with enough programming/electrical experience to step into those roles daily. First job, interned for 3 years prior, already a number of projects under my belt, works well within my team. Business is good, we're doing well, I love what I do. Great, sure.

**Problem:** I'm unhappy with the monotony of the job and now the more corporate/sales fuckery that happens daily (re: existential crisis). I've stopped getting more from the job then it gets from me. I miss learning like I did before- so a Masters degree is the next logical conclusion. Maybe this will bump me towards deeper work as well. There's also a great school with a Robotics Degree near me, since that's essentially my job. Do a masters in 3 years, have the company pay, stay on for 3 years- then reevaluate. Good theory, and something I can work towards. Rough draft of plan complete.

**Calculations:** As I said, we're small, and no one here has a Masters yet. There's no plan for this. So I had a meeting with my (newly promoted) team leader and (newly hired) PhD Researcher before bringing it to my higher VP manager and CEO. I figured these two that I interact with daily would be great advice for figuring this out. The meeting went like this:

Me: ""I want to get my masters, here's how/when/where. Here's a draft of some memos to lay some groundwork.""

Team Leader: ""Cool, lets do it""

PhD:(paraphrasing) ""A non-technical/non research/non thesis Masters is good for a small pay bump, but otherwise is just like a Bachelors. With the amount of people that have that type of ""easy"" degree, it's not worth what it was anymore. Plus I'm going to advise that the CEO not pay for that."" (with the full disclosure that he's been a stuffy researcher for several years before his last job, might be biased.)

Me: ""Yikes.""

He then suggested that I pursue a more research driven degree, take 2 years off, work in a lab, publish a paper/thesis- as this would be the only real way a Masters would mean anything. While this sounds great, it's a bit of a diversion of my current plan. I wanted to keep my job and be better at it, not leave entirely. Plus, I wouldn't have a guarantee to come back to the same spot, maybe interview. I asked if I could do research and stay- which the answer was that it would be far worse to half ass Masters and a good job. 

Makes sense, I admit. All of this deflated my position quite a bit. We left it at that, leaving saying I'd consider what he said, and now I'm a stuck a month later at what the hell I should do now. 

**Solution:** none

**TL;DR: PhD/mentor says a Masters without a research/thesis isn't worth it, and I should either take time off to do it or not bother at all.** 

**Conclusion:** Do I still try to pursue this? I'm not sure what to do here. Maybe I'll do some programming certifications or online courses first to broaden my skills- that thought I am starting to like.

When I started college in 2006, I had smoked weed on and off my senior year of high school, and then through the 06-07 freshman year into the 07 summer (30 - 40 ish times through the 2 year timespan). I decided I wanted to go for a job that required a TS, and stopped smoking immediately, not smoking for 3 years. I went for a university co-op program with the Agency that required the TS clearance and made it to the polygraph (this was winter of 2010). I admitted all use, but honestly didn’t remember the very last time I smoked marijuana, so the timeline was about 2 months off on my SF-86 than what I stated during the polygraph (I openly admitted that I didn’t remember the exact timeline of use, but knew I hadn’t after the summer of 07). Either way, I failed the polygraph, and while I was waiting for a retest, all the co-op positions were filled, and my clearance process was halted (they specifically said I was NOT denied my clearance, but the process just stopped). Fast forward to my graduation in 2011, still didn’t smoke the whole time, but got an engineering gig as an EE at a large company in a state where recreational use was legal, and the company didn’t really do government contracting and didn’t require a clearance. Smoked marijuana on and off again through working at this company, but stopped again in winter of 2016 because I was thinking about working in the federal sphere again. What do you think my chances are of obtaining a TS this coming winter should I go through the process again? Should I wait a couple more years in the private sector before pursuing this to see if marijuana moves to a more federally acceptable place in 2022 perhaps?

Last semester I took a class on the basics of FEM using MATLAB that I quite enjoyed. I was wondering how these concepts might be applied for dynamic stress simulations.

For example, let's say I have an object that is represented by a basic system of trusses, and I apply a sudden impulse to the object, say, from a rocket motor. I know how the object would react from a rigid body perspective, the resulting velocities, etc. What I'd like to understand more is the internal stresses caused by the impulse.

Another example would be the same object falling and colliding with the ground. I'd like to be able to model the resulting stresses to the various members of the simplified system.

To be more specific, the methods we used for our truss and frame analysis were simply static. σ=Eϵ was the basis of the FEM method we used. The structure that we were analyzing would need to be fully fixed in place, otherwise the linear algebra would fail and give weird results. 

If I wanted to know the internal stresses of a free floating object, what sort of equations would I use? How would I represent the object's own inertia as being a sort of constraint? How would I include a representation of time?

My end goal would be to design a real-time simulation engine for very simplified soft-body physics. Think Beam.NG or Rigs of Rods, which I suspect use similar techniques to what I describe. I've tried researching this sort of stuff, but FEM past the basics is a rabbit hole of complicated information that's well beyond my level of understanding, so I'm not sure where to begin or what paths to follow.

No, not the  childish giggly stuff about relieving stress with vibes.   Rather, those  who stated that the engineering community does not accept this process.    Which portion of the engineering community is a worthy question.    Those in manufacturing use the VSR Process on a production basis.     Here is but one of hundreds of examples :

Shear  frame being stress relieved at Adira, a Portuguese company that has  been VSR Processing their frames for 20 years +.  Adira reports no  variations outside tolerances (which are quite respectable, several  1/100's of a mm, full length), if stress relieved in this manner, saving  both time, energy (compared to the natural gas consumption of PWHT)  while improving quality.   Equipment produces superimposed plots of the  structure's resonance pattern, which undergoes a change during SR, but  then stabilizes, indicating dimensional stability.   Cycle time of less  than two hours, including setup.    Photo of VSR setup can be seen at top of [www.advancedvsr.com](https://www.advancedvsr.com)

A photo gallery on this site shows a few dozen other examples, including the 177 ton, 5.5 story tall, storm-surge gates for the City of New Orleans.   Most structures are smaller and lighter, ranging from 0.5 to \~ 60 tons.

Another  issue in the original post :  It was stated that the applicability of  the VSR Process is highly alloy dependent.   This is NOT the case, but  rather, workpiece configuration (you need to resonate the workpiece with  sufficient force), and material condition (heavily cold-worked or  hardened materials resist the effects of vibration).   Agreed, such  material conditions might well accompany certain alloys, but the alloy  mix or chemistry is not the limiting factor.     Since the process works  by causing plastic flow (a universal requirement of any form of stress  relief) / dislocation migration on the granular level, when such  migration / plastic flow is difficult, due to material condition, so  indeed is ability to apply VSR.

As-welded,  cast, or hot-rolled, or nominally cold-rolled,  regardless of alloy, as  long as healthy resonating is achieved, it will work, and at times is  either more effective or more practical than thermal treatment.

Certain  alloys are also placed at risk of loss of required properties if  thermally processed, such as austentic stainless steels (Sigma phase  problem), low-carbon / high strength steels (hydrogen-embrittlement), or  welded titanium alloys (reduced fatigue life), if thermally processed.    For these, a properly performed and documented VSR Treatment is a  better alternative.   Bimetallic structures also, such as hydroturbine  discharge rings, some of which are 10 -15 m dia.

See [https://www.advancedvsr.com/risks](https://www.advancedvsr.com/risks)

But  agreed, there needs to be more research in this field.   One of the  challenges is that a good model of how dimensional stability in complex  structure (such as the shear frame sited) is achieved is not in-hand.  NDT, at least presently, cannot parse out whether such a  structure is stable or not.

Or, in other words, the VSR Process works very well, and repeatedly, in practice  . . . . . . but not in theory.

There is a several thousand workpiece / year raging river of anecdotes currently, building up for a few decades.

56,Masters in Environmental Engineering vs Second Bachelor's in Civil?,1564849459,"I'm looking for practical advice. I am currently working on a second bachelor's in Civil. I'm almost done with my math (just need diffy Q) and about to start statics and CAD. Over the summer I got the opportunity to work in a research lab at the local university in the EnviroE department. I really like the work and found out I could instead apply for a master's in Enviro and forgo the second bachelor's once I finish my math. I could potentially get some funding or a TA position that could cover half my tuition which is appealing. However, I am concerned about the marketability of a master's in EnviroE in the job market, especially since my undergrad degree is a BS in psychology. I am also unsure if I'd be able to take the PE. The advisors are no help in answering these questions. The lab can't either because they are career academics. I am not interested in academia. I am interested in a career in engineering. Beyond my first degree, I have 4+ years working in an analytical chemistry lab (it's a long story how I got into this with a psych degree) and 3 years teaching experience in STEM. So, I do have work experience as well as technical lab skills and public speaking/presenting/managing people/ community engagement experience from my years spent as a teacher. My goal is to work either in water management or air quality, potentially a government job. I also am somewhat interested in traffic engineering. My biggest interest in environmental impact, and I do know that a civil degree can be applied to both the civil and environmental field. However, I also want flexibility in where I can find a job, stability in the job market, and work/life balance. So, I would take work that isn't my ""dream job"" in order to have the ability to work in a place I want to live and work/life balance, hence my interest in government jobs. I'm less concerned about a very large income, I just want to be comfortable and have good balance. I don't need to be making 6 figures if I can still find jobs in my current area and would be fine at the $50-60k range. I would never turn down more money, but I wouldn't say it's my biggest goal so long as I am making more than I did as a teacher. 

From a practical stand point, would it make more sense to pursue a second bachelor's in CivilE or master's in EnviroE? The advantage of the master's would be reduced tuition and the potential to teach at the community college level eventually if I wanted to, but I am unsure if my previous degree would hold me back from engineering jobs and how marketable an EnviroE degree is compared to a Civil degree.

Q1: Why are houses not built with support beams that run perpendicular to the outside block walls, as in Figure B above? This way the beams would be shorter and thus stronger, right? Is this done to lower costs or is there a more fundamental reason?

A box that has a crankshaft, and two connecting rods that is under a vacuum (with no air inside of it.) The connecting rods are facing opposite each other and attached to the crankshaft on one end and then to a diaphragm on the other end which is part of the side of the box. The connecting rods are oriented such that when one connecting rod is fully extended it pushes the diaphragm outwards whilst the other connecting rod pulls its diaphragm it’s connected to inwards towards the inside of the box. The flexibility of the diaphragms and the outside atmospheric pressure and vacuum on the inside causes the reciprocating between the two. I am sure a better material could be used but to visualize the concept imagine the diaphragms are both made of rubber.

71,High school senior in need of help please,1564793025,"Hi guys, 
I know this may be irrelevant but I'm posting it anyways since I believe you could answer my questions better. 
I'm a highschool rising senior, international student applying to US universities this fall and willing to continue my mechanical engineering career in the US. 
I have a problem in choosing colleges to apply to, specifically the college I'm applying to in ED. Since ED is my best bet to get accepted, I want to apply to the best school possible. 
My question is whether I should choose a school that has a very good reputation and a high rank but no co-op program or an optional one (say ivy leagues or northwestern or JHU) or if I should apply to one that also has a good reputation but not highly ranked but requires co-op to get the degree? (say for example RIT ) 
The thing is that I feel that a required co-op program would be my best bet to get work experience and network in order to get hired after graduation while not being a US citizen. However, I'm afraid that the fact that the school that requires co-op is ranked low and has lower acceptance rate than other more elite schools would be a drawback for me finding a job after graduation. While the other more elite schools could be more presentable on a resume. I know I could still apply to co-ops and internships without them being required but again I'm international and I feel that the career services center would care more for me getting one if it's requires than if it's just optional or not even there.
My stats are also very high so I feel that it would be a loss if I apply to a less ranked university when I could've got in a higher more elite one easily. I know nothing is too high for an international since I need financial aid which draws from the institution's own money since I don't qualify for federal aid.

77,Is this job making me travel too much? Please give me some advice!,1564777360,"Hey everyone, thanks in advance for giving this a read and giving me your inputs

A little background at first: I just graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a certificate in Public and Professional Writing. I didn't do famously well, but I managed to have a GPA a little above a 3.0 and internship experience all while working through mental health issues, working two jobs, etc. 

Fortunately, I was able to find a job immediately after graduating which I graciously accepted. It's an automation and validation company in the Philadelphia area, and I'm currently nearing the ending of my informal training period. We work a lot with Rockwell software, PLCs, that sort of stuff. I like the coding aspect of the work, and I like the clients that the company typically works with (lots of pharma which was my main focus in the first place). Throughout the training, the job has been going rather well! The pay isn't bad, 67.5k per year paid monthly, but I feel like I'm slightly underpaid for the area. I get that though since I only just graduated. I feel as if I've picked up on the material rather well, and I got selected for a project rather quickly working under a current engineer! This is where the real pro/con debate comes in.

Pros of the situation: I'm going to be taking on a lot of responsibility, and there's an expectation for me to grow into the role. I feel as if this will be a great chance to work with a pharmaceutical client, learn about their processes and pipelines, and really develop both professionally and within my company. The role is one where we have an ongoing contract with them, and if they need anything like a fermentor reconfigured or something fixed, I'd be the person to talk to. Like I said, lots of responsibility, but lots of really great opportunities as well. 

The cons (and really the point of the post): It's in Maryland. About 3 hours away from my apartment and my home office. I get compensated for hotel, mileage, food, etc., but I'm also going to be expected to be there from Monday morning to Thursday around noon consistently. I would get paid for driving home in the afternoon. 

When I interviewed with this company, I was told that there would be a traveling component to it, but it certainly was not impressed upon me that it'd be quite like this. Additionally, when I formally applied to the position, the job description said it would be about 40% traveling. In my head, this sounds like it'd be a Monday-Tuesday type situation, or maybe even a Monday-Wednesday afternoon type situation. I could live with this! Go down, help fix somethings, stay in a nice hotel for a night or two sometimes, and then head back home to keep working on stuff at the office for the rest of the week. Am I getting paid to little for this much traveling?

But Monday-Thursday...consistently? Am I wrong to feel like that's a bit of a higher tier when it comes to traveling?  

I've engineered my life to be in the Philly area for a lot of personal reasons. I have family connections to the area, I have a personal connection to the area, my fiancee and I signed a lease to live here under the assumption that I'd only be away from home a little bit. Now to find out that I'll be gone for more than half of the week...it's taking a bit of a toll on my mentality. It's hard to be involved in social/personal hobbies when I'm stuck in a hotel room most nights. I've done the trip once this past week, and it feels like you're still at work even when you're not because you aren't at home where you feel the most comfortable. I've tried speaking to the person above me about this, but he keeps dancing around the bush about how much time I'd be traveling. That being said, the hotel staff knows him by name, and there was someone in my position before I started who left after only two weeks, neither of which are good signs in my opinion.


At the end of the day, I'm really just looking for some sort of advice from anyone that has been in a similar situation as mine. Do you think this the type of situation where I should just grit my teeth and bare it for the time being? Did my company essentially do a bait and switch on me (which is my feeling considering I didn't even get asked if this project was something I wanted to work on)? Does travelling get any better? Should I keep my eye out for another job somewhere else? And if so, how do I explain that I left my first job after only about 2 months of working?

Thanks in advance for any advice everyone, I'm really in a weird spot and I'm not sure where to go from here!

80,Which graduate job should I take? (UK),1564774177,"So I majored in Chem Eng and have two job offers after a long search though neither are directly relevant to my field

I'm eager to get started so not to prolong the gap on my resume since graduation but need some advice on what is best to pick for my future career aspirations - which is towards IChemE chartership at a large corporation in either chemicals/oil-gas or large engineering consulting or maybe even continuing in operations.

I haven't had much luck with grad ceng roles at large companies unfortunately and I don't really know what do with that. For example a few months in to my search after graduating I attended an interview for a small consultancy which tested me on degree level unit operations material that I couldn't answer as well as I hadn't refreshed myself on it and wasn't warned in advance, that terrified me pretty badly.

Anyway, I did manage to bag two offers finally, though they're more management and less engineering

Offer 1:

Company Size: Very Large Popular Multinational

Work: Graduate Shift Manager

Salary: Near 35k

Thoughts: The company is really great on paper, plus the benefits are incredible. The only concerns are reviews from previous employees of bad work-life balance (shift work, potentially 50 hours+ no OT) which doesn't phase me too much, but also of the high turn-over rate of the role I'm going in to - possibly because of termination due to the very metric driven systems they have in place? It would be a nightmare getting fired from my first (graduate) job so this scares me the most. I'm assuming since the work is mostly people management I won't really use my technical skills as much so I'm not sure how I could break back in to engineering/consulting after some time in this role. Progression within the company supposedly amazing if you stick it out.

Offer 2:

Company Size: Mid-Large National (Not very known)

Salary: Near 25k

Work: Graduate Operations Management

Thoughts: The role sounds very similar but it's more focused on project work on a site which I guess is more relevant? There's not much else to say except this is for 2 years, the work life balance will probably be better as it's a 9-5, far less responsibility in management, there aren't many poor reviews. Progression opportunities within the company seem limited.

94,UK Chem Engineers - which grad role should I take for my career?,1564759828,"So I majored in Chem Eng and have two job offers after a long search though neither are directly relevant to my field

I'm eager to get started so not to prolong the gap on my resume since graduation but need some advice on what is best to pick for my future career aspirations - which is towards IChemE chartership at a large corporation in either chemicals/oil-gas or large engineering consulting or maybe even continuing in operations. 

I haven't had much luck with grad ceng roles at large companies unfortunately and I don't really know what do with that. For example a few months in to my search after graduating I attended an interview for a small consultancy which tested me on degree level unit operations material that I couldn't answer as well as I hadn't refreshed myself on it and wasn't warned in advance, that terrified me pretty badly.

Anyway, I did manage to bag two offers finally, though they're more management and less engineering

Offer 1:

Company Size: Very Large Popular Multinational

Work: Graduate Shift Manager 

Salary: Near 35k

Thoughts: The company is really great on paper, plus the benefits are incredible. The only concerns are reviews from previous employees of bad work-life balance (shift work, potentially 50 hours+ no OT) which doesn't phase me too much, but also of the high turn-over rate of the role I'm going in to - possibly because of termination due to the very metric driven systems they have in place? It would be a nightmare getting fired from my first (graduate) job so this scares me the most. I'm assuming since the work is mostly people management I won't really use my technical skills as much so I'm not sure how I could break back in to engineering/consulting after some time in this role. Progression within the company supposedly amazing if you stick it out.

Offer 2:

Company Size: Mid-Large National (Not very known)

Salary: Near 25k

Work: Graduate Operations Management

Thoughts: The role sounds very similar but it's more focused on project work on a site which I guess is more relevant? There's not much else to say except this is for 2 years, the work life balance will probably be better as it's a 9-5, far less responsibility in management, there aren't many poor reviews. Progression opportunities within the company seem limited.

0,How does fluid shear effect a damping system?,1564749869,"I thought I understood what fluid shear (in an oil system) is, but the results of fluid breakdown seem to be different from what I understand should be happening.

I have a hydraulic damping cylinder, contains about 20ml of fluid. The fluid is forced through a tiny adjustable orifice to create resistance in both extension and compression. In testing, I am finding that over time, the cylinder actually heats up FASTER and has increased resistance than with fresh oil.

I have used both basic light mineral oil as well as high VI and found the same result.

In my head, the fluid breaking down should cause it to be thinner, and thus, less resistant (low viscosity would flow through the orifice easier).

4,"Looking for advice on self regulating heating cables, or other safe DC powered heating solution.",1564746948,"I have been fiddling with the idea of making a safe heated bed for my cat, since she is old and we have a different opinion about optimal room temperature :)

I've been looking for simple and safe DC powered heating solution for a long time, and recently i have stumbled upon something called self regulating heating cables.

I have bought 4 meters of 12v rated cable, ""Minco"" branded.

**Now for the problem and question:**

I've hooked it up to 9V 3A power supply, which is about half of the rated load for that length.

If i put the cable under a thin blanket, it goes up to 100C at half of the rated load which is above rated temperature of 70C. It does however seem to stabilize at around 70C in the air ( on top of said blanket ).

This kind of sucks, i was hoping the self regulation capabilities would be much more precise, at least withing 5C, not 30C.

Reducing voltage makes it seem to only heat slower, and not change the regulation threshold.

As the title suggests I am 30 years old (six months shy but I'm owning it), and am hoping to get some advice on becoming an Engineer at my age. Specifically I was hoping to get into 'Ecological Engineering' but midway through my second year of a BoE - Civil and Environmental, I'm starting to think I may be going for the wrong degree and that what I want to do isn't a real job. So with that I'm also looking for any guidance you all can give me on possible positions to aim for that may get me close to what I want.

Sorry this post is so long, skip to the last paragraph if you just want to see my questions, but here's what I think is relevant/needed background information:

I was a ground equipment mechanic in the US Air Force for just short of 10 years. For the first 8 I worked on just about everything at an airport other than the planes so I have general experience with diesel, turbine, and small gas engines, hydraulics, electrical, and all kinds of equipment inspection and maintenance. For the last 2 years I worked in an office as a safety/security/deployment manager so I think the civilian equivalent of personnel management or HR. Unfortunately, I was force retired in December, 2018 after reconstructive surgery on both ankles. (My legs are fine other than some nerve damage that I take light pain meds for, but basically the cartilage is gone from both ankles so the docs said they don't want me running anymore and the military just doesn't put up with that.)

I was living in Spain at the time and only had about 2 months to make decisions, get all the paperwork approved and move countries so please forgive me for not doing enough research but I knew that I wanted to work in 'Ecological' Engineering ( building eco-friendly houses, buildings, even cities whatever.. my imagination was a bit out of control). I know many of you may ask why not Engineering Mechanics with my background, but I felt that although I did enjoy working in mechanics, Ecological Engineering is my dream and I just didn't see a way to match the two. So anyway, I applied for some Uni's, got accepted to a few, and eventually chose to move to Sydney, AT to attend the University of Technology Sydney for a BoE - Civil and Environmental.

Now I'm midway through my second year and having a lot of doubts. I was accepted to a mentorship program and was lucky enough to get a mentor who works in Environmental Engineering. However, I now see that he works in an office full time and he has even told me that he only ever does paper/office work as he is a Consulting Engineer. He does not get to work on site or assist with the build at all as I had previously thought would be possible. I've also been to several Engineering Events now where everyone I talk to seems to do the same. He has told me to look into Contracting Engineering jobs but I have only been able to find general information so far and don't know if that's really much better or how to go about ensuring I end up as one.

Although diesel maintenance wasn't my favourite I have always loved working with my hands, getting dirty and being exhausted at the end of a long work day, and seeing projects through from start to finish. I had thought, and really hoped, that as an 'Ecological' Engineer I would be able still do that while working on much larger projects, with lots of different people. I've worked both ends of the spectrum of manual labour and sitting at a desk for 10 hours and know that I want something in between. I also want to work in something that gives back to the environment while also creating/building to improve life for humanity, hence Ecological Engineering if possible. So my questions are these; which fields in engineering would allow for that type of work or would be the closest fit? And what steps should I take to ensure success as I have very little relevant background work and am starting at such a late age?

It involves everything from the basics like thermodynamics, chemistry and physics to advanced control theory, machine design, robotics, machine vision and process modeling and simulation. Im skipping a lot but it focuses a lot on industrial process and manufacturing automation.

My questions are:

1. Out of engineering school, what can I expect. What kind of work do control engineers fresh out of college usually do ? 

2. How did your tasks changed with experience and the new technologies ? 

3. What kind of salary should I expect right out of college, after 5 years and after 10 years ?

4. Is there a lot of demand ? As I can see, control engineering programs are pretty rare compared to Electrical Engineering. Are there a lot of EG that branches into this field ?

29,What can I do now as a newly graduated MechE that could really help me get a job? More details and background inside.,1564695482,"I am currently having issues just obtaining any kind of position in the Mechanical Engineering industry. What can I do on my end that could boost my chances of getting a position? Any softwares I should be attempting to learn, specific tolerancing and design details like ASME or ISO, any classes I can take that are relevant in industry that are not assigned in College, specific organizations to work with / volunteer? Just anything for me to work on now that could be significant for my resume and when I’m attempting to apply.

Below is a bit of background of myself.

Hi everyone, I’d like some advice or direction.
Currently, I’m a recent graduate with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. It’s been approximately two months since I’ve graduated, and I have yet to find a position. While it’s only been 2 months, it honestly feels like I’ve been out of work for like 10 years. 

Outside issues: I have a reduced search radius when attempting to find any kind of mechanical engineering position as my partner has recently got an opportunity in her field (Nursing). I’ve been with her for 5 years now and I’d like to keep being in this relationship, but this also hinders my ability to try finding a job in other states. She doesn’t want to quit her newly acquired jobs nor does she want to move as she’s content now. This is completely acceptable as I would be the same way in her shoes too if just getting into my industry.

Personal Issues: I’m going to be honest here. My current interests are in Design (Machine Design), Robotics, Automation, Theme Park rides and attraction (very recent interest), and Manufacturing. Those are the ideal areas I’d love the opportunity of working in. They are influenced based on specific classes I took and projects that I’ve done. To be realistic though, I’m going to have a tough time finding entry level positions (I feel anyway) in Florida and based off my resume / experience. 

My goal now is to just get into the industry. Personally, it really doesn’t matter (usually) what work I must do. I just want to have the opportunity to learn, be more knowledgeable, have my employer be happy they selected me, and just give it the best to my ability (at least above average work). That makes me happy overall compared to anything else. Unfortunately, I can’t really convey these last 3 lines of information as it doesn’t fly well in an interview process.

Background: 
*	Recent graduate with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (ABET accredited) in Florida
*	2.99 GPA 
*	No industry experience (attempted, few interviews, no follow through) 
*	Projects I’ve completed consist of projected from courses
*	Volunteered with local/worldwide organization (FIRST) for a few years
*	Working retail for 7 years
*	Currently learning Python
*	3 certifications in SolidWorks (1 Associate in Solid Modeling and 2 in FEA)

I can forward my resume in a private message, if anyone would like to see it as I believe I can’t just blatantly post it in this subreddit.

Current Projects:
*	Preparation for FE (Mechanical)
*	Learning Python
*	TI-RSLK robotics project
*	Volunteering with other communities in my area

I’m happy to give more information or context. I just want some advice.

30,Tools/methods for wooden structure strength analysis?,1564693675,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I am looking for tools/info for analyzing the strength of a wooden structure. I am a third (ish) year mechanical engineering student, and my education has pretty much consisted of exclusively metal thus far, and very little on the topic of complex frames, so I don't know where to begin.

For context, I have been cleaning out an old barn (built in approx. 1920s) and I've discovered that a portion of the foundation has shifted considerably -- about 3 inches outwards -- and is flexing the wall with it. I live on top of a hill in a rainy location, so shifting ground is fairly typical, especially over the nearly 100 years the barn has been standing. I asked the owner, and it seems that this shift has been here for a long time, perhaps nearly 20 years, but I don't know if it's gotten larger during that time.

I'd like to approximate how much this shift has compromised the overall structure of the barn. Humans don't spend much time in the barn, mostly just moving hay in and out of it for a few minutes each day, but there are 2 horses with stalls in the barn. I want to know if the structure is unsafe for this purpose. Is a bad snow storm going to take it down? Could it fail unexpectedly at any moment? Outside of this bent wall, the construction seems dry and intact.

Another point worth noting is that the barn has a garage added on using more modern construction. The foundation of the garage section is in fine condition, and the garage itself does not seem to be bowing with the barn. Is this garage potentially holding up the compromised barn?

My first instinct is to model the barn in CAD (Solidworks or Inventor, depending on my mood) and use the inbuilt FEA tools to simulate the barn with a prescribed displacement. This seems like a daunting task, though, as the structure is somewhat complicated, and I'm not sure what details can be simplified. I'm also familiar with the basics of FEA, and could possibly write software in MATLAB or Python to analyze the basic frame.

Are there any tools specific to structural engineering that are employed for this sort of analysis? Would modelling the basic frame yield reasonably accurate results? What sort of factors of safety do structures like this have, if that's even a design consideration to begin with?

My research (google) into the subject has yielded lots of material properties of wood, but very little information on the construction technique itself. Near as I can tell, buildings like this are designed more by tradition than analysis.

I'd love to hear from somebody with knowledge about structural engineering with some advice on how to approach the problem.

The project is supposed to look like a weird mechanism so industrial parts are all fine and dandy however and while they’re cool with the compressor component they dislike the 1 gallon tank attached to it, don’t need that big of a tank, but I need some kind of reservoir!But a gallon is a bit much, I could easily get away with a half gallon. With that said the base of this project is a 2” tall hollow metal box, so I am curious if it is feasible to weld together a flat flask like shape with rounded corners as air compressor tank that’s about 12”x 5” x 1.5” (30.48 cm x 12.7 cm x 3.71 cm) to fit into the bottom of the piece?

Last week, I met an employee in R&amp;D for an open-door-policy/coffee chat-esque meeting and he actually referred me to the specific R&amp;D manager responsible for hiring full-time. I plan on reaching out soon.

My concern is really a matter of me not knowing what this can be defined as and therefore, how to best approach the situation. For example, all of my coffee chat meetings with employees were very casual. I was just learning about their work, etc. (no expectations of jobs, no resumes, not trying to pitch myself, etc.). Similarly, for job interviews, everyone is on the same page—the candidate wants a job and the interviewer wants to hire someone.

I've never been in this situation before; it's not a full on job interview (at least I don't think so) but neither am I here to just learn about themselves and their work. 

How do I properly approach the situation? What should I expect? and all the other nitty gritty details like is it too bold to send a resume, to say ""I want a job on your team, what do I need to do"" or is that exactly what I should do?, etc.

72,2 Months In and Lost,1564612863,"Hey r/AskEngineers,   


I graduated in May and have since begun my full-time job as a Quality Engineer for an international consumer goods corporation. The company is sourced-modeled and does no manufacturing of their own in the states. My office building is a cube farm of various corporate departments with no manufacturing space, just a small UL Lab with maybe a dozen technicians.  


I've been here for 2 months, and I'm lost as to what I should be doing. The office is an hour away from my house, and I drive about 100 miles roundtrip a day, so having little work becomes draining when you have an hour drive to cap the day off. The department is growing, which is good, but I usually have maybe an hour or two of work a day, if that. I usually spend the first 20-30 minutes going through overnight emails and approving ECOs, and then twiddle my thumbs until I have meetings to attend. Rinse and repeat.  


I've talked to my boss a couple of times about the lack of work to do, and he attributes it to a general lull in the company, as products that have been in development reach their launch phase. To date, I've tinkered with our SQL  QA database,  began studying for the FE exam in hope of obtaining my EIT, aggregating and condensing online customer reviews, and picked up odd jobs where they show up.   


On one hand, I feel like I'm being paid to have minimal work and just learn the ins-and-outs of the company, which I understand, but I feel generally unproductive and definitely suffer ""imposter syndrome"". I also can't expect to be able to play the ""ignorance card"" forever. What else should I be doing? The company is generally positive and seems like there's a lot of room for growth and development, but it's tough for me because I simply don't know what I don't know, and any manufacturing issues are in a delayed response due to being manufactured in China.

74,For consultants / pseudo-consultants: Billable hours question,1564603883,"Greetings all.

I am a licensed engineer in the US (two southeastern states) and have a ""day job"".  My employer also allows me and a coworker to consult off-hours. We have ethical and conflict of interest boundaries in place with respect to who we can and cannot contract with. 

Some of the work I do as a consultant is repetitive.  I. e. I will design a package for a client, and bill that based on actual hours spent learning the job.  Writing code in a particular new controller, for instance, is something that requires research and testing. 

If I am able to re-use some of the work on a subsequent job, I bill just the hours required to adapt and test for that additional application.  For instance, one project took 40 hours to develop for the first installation, but only 6 hours to implement at the second site for the same client.

Based on what that client is telling me, a competitor of mine bills each project the same amount. They are a lot more expensive than I am, as well.  This one client mentioned that in his opinion, the competitor's ""second job shouldn't have been as expensive as the first, because they had already done practically the same thing"". 

I quote jobs very conservatively, using a ""not-to-exceed"" price, and then bill actual hours. 

For another client, I was effectively promised 5 jobs.  The price for each job ended up being similar- and it reflected the R&amp;D cost (excess time spent doing the first job) spread across five projects - I did the work once and then copy-pasted the next 4.  Any future project would likely be billed at this (1/5 R&amp;D + Implement) price, since it was demonstrated to be low bid and competitive. 

For those of you who quote/estimate and bill clients based on hours, using copy-paste work, how do you do it?

If you are able to copy-paste across clients, does one bear all the cost? Or if you know up front of similar work coming from the two, would you split the R&amp;D between the two?

77,Does backpressure prevent venturi devices working?,1564601195,"Hi all!
I’m trying unsuccessfully to use a venturi syphon/injector on a hosepipe to add liquid fertiliser inline  when watering my lawn and can’t work out why its not working or how to move forward to success.
With the venturi device connected directly to the outside tap the device works and collects fluid from the holding container. However, once I attach an end of line device such as a sprinkler it stops drawing liquid.
With no end of line device attached it doesn’t matter where in the line I add the venturi, at the tap, before the reel of hose, at the end of the hose. It will work.
However, once I add a sprinkler/end of line device the venturi will not work. Changing the location of the venturi device with an end of line device attached makes no difference, it won’t draw fluid.
The flowrate stays the same with or without a device attached to the end of the hose.
All I can think is that with no device attached the pipe is free flowing with no back pressure? A device creates backpressure which for some reason prevents the venturi from working?
I’ve tried a gun attachment, bar sprinkler, rotary sprinkler &amp; impact sprinkler, all when attached at the end of the line stop the venturi drawing liquid. 
I’ve got a 1/2-inch venturi device currently although I have found a 1/4-inch model all the way up to 2 inches however all would require adapters to increase/decrease ready for pipework.

The leak tester pulls a vacuum inside of the pipes, and if any helium gets into the pipes it will detect it.

83,Automotive Engineers - Can you provide feedback on my car technology survey questions?,1564592051,"Hi r/AskEngineers,

I’m Tamara, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon and my current project is a survey where we’ll be asking for forecasts about emerging car technology, mostly EVs and AVs. I’m looking for feedback on my  forecasting questions before I send out the survey. This will help ensure that I’m asking questions that people understand and that will give me good data. Your help is very much appreciated :). If you’re interested, please read on…

&amp;#x200B;

A bit more about the survey: I’m targeting people who already know a good amount about car technology (and related policy issues, etc.) to fill out the survey, so it’ll be posted in places like this subreddit, sent to university research labs that study car tech, etc. I’ll be asking for 80% interval estimates--that is, if you answered 100 trivia questions like “How tall is the Eiffel Tower?” the actual answer would be inside your interval about 80 out of 100 times (you give a high and a low value, like 500 feet to 1500 feet, where there’s a 1 in 10 chance the actual answer is lower and a 1 in 10 chance the actual answer is higher).

What I’m looking for in terms of feedback: Are the questions specific enough? Are they too specific/obscure? Should I phrase something differently? Will people be able to answer questions about both electric vehicles AND autonomous vehicles, or is there not much overlap in the EV and AV folks? Will people be able to provide decent estimates for the current values, or should I provide the current values for them? Would it be better to ask for 2 or 10 years in the future? (I want to ask for 2 years because then I can go back in 2 years and see how good the forecasts were, but I also don’t want to ask questions where there won’t be appreciable change in just 2 years.) Are there any other forecasting questions you think would be interesting to ask? How long would you be willing to spend taking a survey like this if the compensation were: no compensation, a raffle for a $50 Amazon gift card (chance of winning about 1/20), $5 as long as you finish? Any ideas for where else online I should post the survey?

Tldr: just finished 1st year of EE with 70% avg after repeating the year. I'd  like to find a work placement  in ai or robotics before the end of 2nd year. No related projects or experience to demonstrate skills. Don't  know how to search for them and whether  i have any chance of securing one. How do i proceed?





I'm  a student from the EU going into 2nd year of my Electronics  degree in the UK. In 3rd and 4th year i will be having shared  modules  with the CS department  and will be specializing  in AI.


I am planning  to start applying  for internships from mid-August - September.


The issue is i feel incredibly  under qualified even though  not much is supposedly  required from 1st years. 


I have no projects  I've  done outside  Uni in my field. I'm  also currently  not a member  of a university  engineering  society  (planning  on joining  the robotics and ai soc next year but i wouldn't be able to include this in my cv until at least the end of 2nd year). The only extracurricular thing ive  done this year was joining a team sport and competing  a few times until i stopped  after spring break to concentrate  on exams.


The worst part is I have repeated  1st year as i just didn't  attend  my 2nd semester the first time. During my repeat year my avg is about 70% which is not that high. And i don't  know how i would  explain during  an interview  why I've  repeated - i couldn't  possibly  omit this fact, could  i.


I would  be happy  of taking  unpaid  internships during winter, spring or summer break. I'm  not fussy about  location, it's  not even  necessary  to be in the uk. I just would like something  to help me in the pursuit  of a career  in ai or robotics. I just don't  know what my chances are.


Also, could you advise on how to approach applying? Using indeed.com, many of the positions require more experience than i currently  have. Ive  thought  about  emailing  small companies  i find on gogle whether  they'd  be happy  to have an intern to train no matter paid or unpaid but am not sure if this is appropriate. Also, ive  heard people apply to more than 20 internships  per week when applying, but i don't  even  know where to find these. Most as i said seem to look for more qualified  people and on these work related websites they seem to run out of positions.
