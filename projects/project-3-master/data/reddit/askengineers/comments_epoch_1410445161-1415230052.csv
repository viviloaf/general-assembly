2,"[Structural / Solid Mechanics] Some questions about Mohr's Circle, Failure Criteria.",1415227676,"Hello /r/askengineers :) I'm not sure this is a suitable thread for this sub, if not, i apologize and please direct me to the right sub!

I'm having a Structural Mechanics course this semester, and my solid mechanics course was already 1.5 years ago, which unfortunately means that while i found it relatively easy to brush up on the problem-solving approach, that wasn't the case for the more ""fundamental"" aspects, the physical interpretation of it. You know when you're solving some problem but then an existential crisis hits you and you ask yourself ""but WHY is it like this?""? That's it.

I realize Google would be my friend, but i was hoping for less formal and abstract explanations than what you usually find.

What i wanted to ask, was this:

1. What exactly does Mohr's Circle represent? Let's keep it in the plane. We got shear stress on the vertical axis and normal stress on the horizontal axis. What I don't get is this: If you have a beam subject only to bending moments (Y,Z), no torsion, on any given cross-section on the YZ plane, there are only compression or traction stresses, right? In my ""visualization"" of it, on any dx/dy/dz element we have the normal stress due to the bending moments  on one face, and nothing more. Where is the shear stress? Does it exist in this case because there is a normal stress differential between 2 points on the YZ plane with different distances from the neutral axis? (don't know if that's what you call it, english is not my first language. Anyway, the axis along which the normal stress is 0.) That's my guess, but i really don't know if it's right.

2. Failure Criteria. It's very easy to understand the Max. Normal Stress criteria, we must have the max. normal stress not exceed the yield strength of the material. Trivial. Now the Max. Shear Stress criteria (Tresca, right?), i'm having some problems with. From what i understand, when you apply this criteria, you are looking for a normal stress which is equivalent to the shear stress that equals failure on a given point. How does this work? And why is it that this value is 2 times the max. normal stress in a plane state of stresses?

I realize these questions may be kind of off-target and revealing of my ""fundamental"" lack of understanding of the material, but i would greatly appreciate if you could help shed some light over this :) 

I have just begun to REALLY study for the test (in approx. 2 weeks, yeah i know...) and while i seem to be able to solve problems and be critical of the results, sometimes i feel that in the process there are some steps i don't fully understand. I hope the answers for these questions will help with that...

10,Questions about Software Engineering,1415207205,"Hey Engineers of reddit, 
I'm a 19 years old guy from Canada with some questions.

I'm currently studying 3D animation in college because even though I'm a beast at math and science, I can't help but enjoy the most technical art I could find and one that connects with stuff I love, video games and animation movies.

Now I've been thinking about going into Software Engineering as a backup plan for the 3D industry because getting a job can be tough, but after reading a bit about it (I also have some programming background (html,css,javascript,php) I started thinking I might actually like to do that for a living just as much as 3D, but possibly with a better salary. Also, my experience in 3D could allow me to work on interesting projects with the other students I believe (Interactive 3D stuff, indie video games, interesting UI using 3D and Photoshop skills I have).

Now I want someone to clear all my misconceptions about Software Engineering so I'll explain what I think I understand of it.

- You are not just a programmer, though you are one.

- On top of being a programmer, you must design programs yourself, their architecture and the way they will work. (This is the biggest difference between Programmer and Software Engineer (I think))

- There will be a shit-ton of math classes (I'm not really scared of math, passed the ""toughest"" high school math classes with like 96% average and didn't even study. I'm also known for having a ridiculously good memory and logic.)

- Basicly this job requires, ingenuity, creativity, logic, thinking outside the box, planning, the ability to doubt yourself, self-criticism and mathematical skills.

I'd really appreciate any input from someone who knows more than me and especially from a Software Engineer.

What I wanted to do is do something similar, but turn it into a baseball scoreboard that would have 7 switches and 7 LEDs for tracking Balls, Strikes, and Outs (3 Green, 4 Red). 

These are the Red LEDs I wanted to use: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10632
These are the Green LEDs I wanted to use: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10633

The plan was to have 1 main battery power source and 7 sets of Switch/LED/Resistor wired in parallel. However, I am having trouble figuring out exactly what power source and resistors to use.

My thought was to use 4 AA batteries, but would that be sufficient (as a rough goal I was looking for about 4 hour run time if all 7 LEDs were on, but I'm not sure how practical that is)? Since parallel circuits drain a lot more power, do I need to have 1 battery per Switch/LED/Resistor or can I use a single power source? Should I be using a 9 volt battery instead of AAs?

The other problem I was having was figuring out what resistors to use. All the resistor calculators I have found don't seem to accommodate what I want to do as they don't allow to for multiple color LEDs or the fact that anywhere from 1 to 7 LEDs might be on at the same time.

I have a lot of spare time at the moment as I'm in the period between high school and university, so I thought I could give it a go at making something like this.

55,Need Help Sizing Servo Motors: Continuous vs Intermittent Duty,1414986484,"Hey guys, I'm currently sizing servo motors for my company, and could really use some help. There are no motor experts where I work, and I am wondering if I really need to calculate RMS torques/worry about intermittent duty cycles. From my research, it seems as if speccing off of RMS torques and rated speeds will save you money and decrease the max torque needed. However, I am under a time crunch and my boss mentioned that he does not care about splurging on motors and wants a large safety factor-- in that case, can I just choose my motors off of my calculated maximum torque and speed requirements?

My reasoning is that to calculate the RMS torque, you need to use acceleration/deceleration times, as well as your time at max velocity and dwell time. However, when calculating my max torques, I am assuming an average acceleration by using only my max required acceleration and velocity. This means that for calculations regarding acceleration time, I am estimating a decreased acceleration time in order to reach max velocity: t_a = V_f - V_i /a_max.

By doing so, I'm overestimating the specs that I need for my mechanism, right? A reduced acceleration time will increase the required acceleration torque.

I'm doing a preliminary shaft design and I haven't had much experience with helical gears.

But when the electric engine kicks in the gears change direction, so will this reverse the direction of the thrust force?

Intuition tells me no, and that the thrust direction depends only on gear geometry and not direction, but I want to make sure before I design the bearings and supports for uni-direcitonal thrust.

My family owns two business here in the depths of North Philadelphia for over 10 years, and among all the issues that come with having a business in the ghetto, two has gotten increasingly annoying and I was hoping some creative engineering minds would lend us some ideas! 

Our two businesses consist of a beer store, and conveniently right next door, a laundromat with the latter being the problematic force since we normally don't have any one there (because it basically runs on it's own). I also live in a small building next to said laundromat. [Here is a rough diagram](http://i.imgur.com/RgEQJCr.jpg).

1.  On a daily basis we have people who park their cars behind our laundromat without any clothes to wash, and extracts buckets and buckets of water from our sink to wash their car. As you can imagine, it has been very costly to fund these free car washes. 

I can't really come up with a way to deter this activity. In the ghetto, signs are never noted, and asking them to stop usually ends in aggression. Would there be a remote way to stop the water from *just* the sink from &gt;20 yards away? 

2. Another problem involves a group of homeless people who often urinates/dedicates on our cars and the walls of our laundromat. Recently they have become bold enough to do it right in front of us and right in front of our customers.

68,Does the shape of a wing on an airplane really make or break the ability to fly? Lengthy details inside...,1414954921,"Humans have been flying for over 100 years now so it's pretty clear we have things figured out but I'm having a problem with the bernoulli effect. I'm going to try to pose my questions without sounding like an idiot.

We've always been taught that the bernoulli effect is the sole reason behind flight. You always see pictures showing how air moving over the top of the wing is lower pressure so it creates ""lift."" Nothing else is given credit. I'm sure that's a significant contributing factor and all but is that the really the ""sole"" purpose flight in possible?

I visited the Intrepid Museum in NYC a bunch of years ago and saw this exhibit where they tried to demonstrate this. They had two miniature model airplanes side by side in a box mounted on posts with powerful fans installed in front of them. You would press a button to turn on the fans and only of of the planes would actually raise into the air. The only catch, the plane that lifted off started off with regular shaped wings and it had its nose pitched up into the air prior to lift off. The other plane sat flat on the bottom of the box and had two massive cubes as wings. I drew a very rudimentary example of this in MS Paint [here](http://imgur.com/eGPgzXF).

First off, they gave one of them a massively unfair advantage to start off so the wings would catch the wind no matter what. Second, they sentenced the other one to remain on the ground no matter what because it didn't even have wings in any sense of the word. I know that if they gave the second one comparably sized and completely flat and symmetrically shaped wings with the same angle of attack as the first, it would have taken off too. I thought it was a very poor method for trying to make the case of the theory of flight.

It really got me thinking about how flight is possible. I assume that with enough speed (and the proper weight, ""wing surface area"", etc...) than anything can be turned into a plane. (not plane like airplane, plane like something to stand on) Example: Totally disregarding buoyancy, you (or any object) can travel any direction under water if you have enough thrust -- up, down, sideways, whatever -- because you are kind of ""planing"" through the water. (forgive my ignorance on proper terminology) You don't need teardrop shaped wings. Rockets appear to prove this possibility. (obviously they have wings/fins for stabilization though)

So really, what causes lift? Is it the ability to travel so quickly through air that it becomes a ""plane"" of support, or is it because of the shape of wings? It seems that whatever direction you force wind will cause the wings to move in the opposite direction, thus angle of attack, bernoulli or not. Did the Wright Flyer's wings have the same teardrop shape? Do modern day fighter jets? Why can modern day model airplanes with completely flat wings fly?

That seems crazy but is that realistic for a product of that nature, or is my calculation flawed?

Thanks in advance

He basically sees me as ""second in command"" even though my experience is far less than his.

So our office is currently in the process of hiring a junior level structural engineer. My boss has met with the candidate once so far, and plans to meet with them again this coming week. He suggested that I also have a conversation with the candidate, though in a much more casual way than an actual interview. He wants to talk to me next week about some ideas I had about how to actually go about this.

So, as I've never been on the other side of the table, so to speak, I'm just wondering if I could bounce some ideas off of any of you that have been on the interviewer side of things.

Essentially, I'm thinking that I can show the candidate a few of the projects we're currently working on and allow the candidate to see how we approach our work. Then I was thinking that I'd ask the candidate to talk about a past project, any potential problems that arose, how they addressed them, how the work was completed, etc. Again, the idea is to keep it pretty informal and just allow them to talk.

My goal is to try to get an idea of how the candidate has gone about setting up projects, marking up drawings, reviewing shop drawings, answering RFI's, etc.

2. What field should I work in while I get my degree?

**My situation:**

-NASA Ames Mechanic - 1 year (coop)        
-Food/Drink Server at Hofbrauhaus of Las Vegas - 1 year          
-Apprentice Electrician - 1 year (texas)

**My options:**

1. Moving to the bay area of california and getting work at one of the Tesla manufacturing facilities. Moving on to some kind of engineering role when I graduate.
2. Joining an industrial electrical contractor, and getting into sales engineering after I get my degree (Installing the technology now, selling it later)
3. Getting experience with the oil/gas industry, and transitioning to an offshore engineering position when I graduate (This could be troublesome since I can't fly in/out of drilling rigs while going to college because of my schedule).

A few limitations: These will be small animals (e.g., 10 cm body length, 8 g mass) and so transmitters would have to be proportionally small (ideally not much more than a gram or two). I'd like to be able to log positions several times a minute throughout a day, though if battery life only lasted a couple of hours the data would still be useful. Vertical as well as horizontal position is highly desired, and centimeter accuracy is ideal. The maximum range would likely be around 10 meters, though the longer the better. All of this equipment would have to be field-durable, if at all possible. 

What I'm imagining: It seems like, given these limitations, I will need 3, potentially 4 permanent base stations that are recording the relative position of a small, constantly pinging radio transmitter affixed to the back of the lizard.  

After quite a bit of searching around, I'm pretty confident that there isn't a ready-to-go kit out there already.

16,How can I perform gas exchange in an incubator?,1414703510,"Hi, I'm a senior electrical engineering student and I am working on a design project this year. My group's project is to design an incubator for microscope slides. Essentially, my group's client performs laser surgery on cells in petri dishes and in order to verify that his surgery was successful he has to check on the cells 4 or 5 days later. In order to keep the cells alive for this time period he needs an incubator that will maintain the CO2, humidity, and temperature levels within certain setpoints (higher than atmospheric conditions).

We are building this incubator from scratch and I have been tasked with handling the mechanical/hardware aspects of the project. Needless to say, as an electrical engineer, this puts me a little out of my depth. 

Let me describe what I envision for this incubator. It will be a small enclosure, probably not exceeding 0.003 m^3 in volume. It will be designed to be as air tight as possible, but naturally I imagine there will be some losses (we have a very meager budget of ~$300, so the construction quality of the incubator will be far from perfect). In a separate enclosure there will be an ultrasonic transducer which will be used to produce water vapor and a source for CO2 (just a CO2 canister like the ones used in a paintball gun or SodaStream). Each of these will be connected to the incubator with tubing and, as I understand, I can use a solenoid valve to control their flow (sensors will be placed within the incubator for feedback control). Additionally, should the  CO2 or humidity levels within the incubator get too high a third solenoid valve will be connected to the incubator so that it can be vented to the surrounding environment.

Basically what I'm wondering is, are there any problems with the design as I envision it? Are there any additional parts I might require to accomplish gas exchange like this, or just a better solution in general? One thing I wonder about is that the pressure within the humidifiers environment might be lower than the pressure within the incubator itself. Can a solenoid valve still be used to pass the water vapor from a low pressure environment to high pressure one?

I've omitted many details of the project, but please feel free to comment or ask questions about other aspects of the project.

If I cannot find projects to build practical experience, I hope to at least have supplemental presentations to educate the club.

From an engineering perspective, are there any concepts that you see entry level technologists are regularly deficient in when they shouldn't be, and can you think of any projects or easily illustrated concepts that would help with these deficiencies? 

Also, posts of any low cost projects, that offer a sense of competition, would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance!

22,Help sanity check and/or troubleshoot my mass-spring system simulation (x-post from /r/AskPhysics),1414686359,"I have an odd system I'm trying to simulate shown [here](http://imgur.com/3LLHqeV). Mass m1 (~55000 kg) is suspended from spring k1 (120 N/mm). Directly below is mass m2 (~41000 kg) resting on both a spring (4100 N/mm) and a damper at 5% of critical. I have defined the displacements x1 and x2 so that x2 = 0 mm in m2's initial static equilibrium state, and x1 = 0 mm just as m1 comes into contact with m2. The point from which k1 is suspended is moving downward at a constant speed of 0.2 m/s.

I have modeled a compression-only spring between the two masses as a piecewise function: the spring force is zero if x2 &gt;= x1, and otherwise the spring force will equal an extremely large stiffness (~3e6 N/mm) times (x1-x2).

I used a simple RK4 algorithm to simulate the lowering of m1 toward m2 and to determine the time history of the impact force. [Here](http://imgur.com/1gkJ8Yu) is what the displacement time history looks like (x1 is blue, x2 is red), and [here](http://imgur.com/OCIlrGG) is the impact force time history. Please excuse the Imperial units on the graphs :) .

I think my model is working decently since I'm getting impact force spikes at the same time steps where my two displacement curves intersect. However I'm a little skeptical of the magnitude of those initial impacts. The biggest spike works out to something like 4.5\*m1\*g which just seems high to me.

I hoping someone might be able to offer a sanity check of these results or offer some way to refine the simulation.",AskEngineers,rylnalyevo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2kslc7/help_sanity_check_andor_troubleshoot_my/

43,Help with finding the acceleration of pendulum system in a different sort of way...,1414609826,"Hi.  I'm trying to think through/ find a way to solve a single link pendulum system.  
The system can be described (using Latex symbols)

$x = lsin\theta$  
$y = lcos\theta $

$\dot{x} = l\dot{\theta}cos\theta $  
$\dot{y} = -l\dot{\theta}sin\theta $

$\ddot{x} = l\ddot{\theta}cos\theta - l\dot{\theta}^2 sin\theta$  
$\ddot{y} = -l\ddot{theta}sin\theta + l\dot{\theta}^2 cos\theta$

I decided to go in-state since I could attend University of Louisville for essentially free with my current status academically, but they do not, nor do any Kentucky schools that I can find, offer Aerospace or Astronautical engineering degrees. 

I want to pursue a career in the astronautics/aerospace field (private companies like SpaceX, etc. -- **not** looking for criticism or advice on companies), but was planning on going for a mechanical engineering major as it was the closest I could get in-state. Is it worth getting into some debt to go out-of-state to get a degree in a more specialized field on engineering, such as an aerospace engineering degree? I have been told that your major doesn't determine your career necessarily, but when it comes to a degree in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering (with an astrophysics dual major or minor), is the curriculum going to differ so much that I can't succesfully hold a job -- or even get one -- in one field or the other depending on my choice?

Another topic of concern - I would be going into college at 16 years of age. My father has reservations about going out-of-state until I'm 18 -- at which point he says he doesn't give a fuck. If I went 2 years in-state with Mechanical Engineering, would I lose 2 years of my life to my previous major if I switched to Astronautical Engineering? I have been trying to cross-reference classes and course calendars, but classes seem to be described so differently between colleges it is difficult to accurately compare the two.

I don't know what kind of debt I would be looking at, but I'm sure it would be approaching 6 figures if I went a full 5 or 6 years out-of-state. Less if I spent 2 years in-state first. Is the specialized engineering degree going to limit me, or be essential for my career? 

I am pretty lost and could really use some guidance right now.

The idea is that one would press the up or down button twice within 1-2 seconds to auto roll the windows up or down. 

A PLC would be great if it wasn't so big and clunky and expensive. I only ideally need 2 inputs and 2 outputs at most (need to do more research on how signals are sent for power windows). Currently I'm thinking about using a Baby Orangutan B-328 Robot Controller but I don't think I need the motor drivers. Are there any other compact programmable relays out there?

66,How to get into Consulting/Contracting?,1414528628,"Hi All,

I'm an EE who has been out of school for two and a half years.  I've got a degree in Mathematics (concentration in statistics) and a degree in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in uWave and RF.

That said, I've had two jobs (one was a contract that's coming to an end).  I enjoy the idea of moving around from one job to the next on a 6 to 12 month basis as opposed to being in a single place for a long tenure.

My questions are these:

* What's the difference between an engineering contractor and and engineering consultant?
* What's the usual amount of experience that's required for people to take you seriously (i.e. have a reasonable chance of success) as a consultant/contractor?
* My contacts have all been through a private recruiting firm...Is that unusual to rely on a recruiting firm for a whole career? 
* What are the pros and cons to contracting/consulting vs working at a company?
* In my state, it's $150 to start an LLC.  Does this ever make sense to do with only 2-3 years experience?

I spoke with an engineer today who suggested putting in a gravity type retaining wall made of poured concrete to meet all of the NY requirements.  The thing I'm having trouble with are a few of the things he said.

1. First and foremost, he said it would probably be a $4000-$5000 project for him to draw up plans because he would need to excavate to check for bedrock depth and get soil samples.
2. The gravity wall would have to be about 10' wide at its base to accommodate the height (making it a 9' wall ultimately).
3. The base would have to be dug 4' down into the ground to reach the frost line.

Essentially, the red and blue parts move once a color sensor decides what color object it's sorting, and I need criticism/advice.

EDIT: Updated model!

An explanation of the parts, since I was pretty vague.

From bottom to top.

4 bins for the 4 colors of objects.

two sorting planes(blue). They each slide independently to direct the object into the appropriate bin.

Motors for moving the planes (Orange); rack and pinion system to move the planes(purple)

Primary sort system (Red) Slides left or right to direct the object towards the appropriate bin.

Color sensor(Aqua)

So, for example, if I had a green object, the red plane would move towards the right before the object is dropped into the sorter. The ramp slides it towards the blue plane on the left, which further sorts it between red and green.

if (red or green)

{

 move red to the right

94,Stay or go. A young engineer with a dilemma,1414395822,"Hi Engineers,

Some background: I am a traffic engineer in Australia with a couple of years experience at one of the more successful/reputable firms in our field. Recently, a small group of senior staff have moved on to form their own competing company.

The dilemma: This small company are apparently pretty busy and are seeking to hire new staff. I have applied for a position and was offered one at a salary 10% higher than my own, with the potential for bonuses/raises should the business do particularly well down the track. I have put it to my managers that I have received an offer and they are currently mulling over a figure to throw back but it may not be as high.

Here is where the dilemma lies. My current employer is a fairly large company where young engineers are handed plenty of responsibility to manage jobs/interact with clients. In a client-focused industry, this allows you to build lasting relationships that shore up a future career. Whilst I will probably get the same opportunities at the new firm, I will be the smallest fish in a small pond and the opportunities may not present themselves as often. 

Similarly, there are risks in the move that the new company may not perform to expectation and I could be out of a job in 6 months time. Whilst I don't think this is the case, as the founders are well-respected and well-connected there is always a risk.

In contrast, should the new business go very well, I would be sitting directly under the directors (for at least the time being) which surely puts me in good stead for the future years and potentially buying in when the opportunity arises.

Ultimately, I am unsure about which path to take as both have their positives and negatives. I am seeking some advice from established engineers who have encountered a similar situation in the past or can shed some light on other things to consider about a move.

I haven't provided you with all the detail but happy to answer specific queries in the comments.

97,Should I go to grad school if I want to work in Aerospace?,1414375984,"Hello, engineers! 

I have known that I want to work in the space industry for a very long time, and seeing everything Elon Musk and his fellows have accomplished has only made that conviction stronger.  I hold a Bachelor's (2012) and a nonthesis Master's (2013) in Mechanical Engineering.  Upon graduating last spring, however, I failed completely and utterly at finding work outside oil and gas.  As a result, until recently my plan was to build work experience and contacts until I could eventually convince someone in the space industry to hire me.  

I spent a year and a half as the only mechanical engineer for a general contracting company (I left for a few reasons, but their refusal to hire another engineer to support an engineer in his first job is chief among them), and I recently started a job designing structural pipe systems and modifying existing systems to suit customers' applications.  However, considering how many structural engineers there are that probably want to get into the space business, I am not sure that this is the best long-term plan to get where I want to go.

If I return to grad school, I would pursue a thesis Master's in Aerospace Engineering (my college did not offer any degrees in the discipline), and since the deadlines for application to Fall 2015 term mostly fall from late October to December, I would likely apply for the Spring or Fall 2016 terms.  I would very much like to work part-time for either a professor or a connected company, but I worry that this could spread my time too thin, since I have very little research experience on which to base a judgment.

So basically I'm trying to make a valve that will allow liquid through for a premeasured volume or duration of time, and then it will close and cease allowing liquid through, similar to this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YPJm8F0epg


The difference is that I'm looking to have the constructed out of metal, so it will have a much longer lifetime, and I'm trying to make it so it doesn't have to be physically rotated to be reset.

The device I linked to above functions on the density of the plastic allowing the ball that closes the valve, by floating up to the top.

Is there any valve like this or another application that would have a similar end result?

I appreciate any tips or advice towards creating this.

Thanks!

1,MIPS requirements?,1414361328,"I'm attempting to design a computer system but I'm new to this and I need some help. The computer has to be able to work in the following modes.

Operational Mode: Collect data from sensors attached and perform local housekeeping tasks

Data Collection: Take data from attached payload device (could be anything, camera etc) and save it to an ssd in a lossless format.

Transmit: Send stored data wirelessly( just need to be concerned with what the aerial is doing)

Routed Transmit: Act as a bridge between another computer and the aerial .

For these modes I need to ascertain a series of assumption for data rates and MIPS. I know that the payload input has to operate at 1 Gbps but besides that I am unsure as to what else to do.

I am aware there are alot of considerations when it comes to MIPS and that parity checking can affect it however Since this is something of a generic example and I am new to this I could use some help in understanding how to estimate them.

3,I need a little advice regarding something I'm making.,1414313906,"Before I even begin, I'd like to say that I am an engineering student and smoke marijuana. The questions I'm asking are in order to smoke in a different way. It's a product I'm looking to design, but only for me and some other people. I figured I should explain it because it's easier to answer a question if you know the full purpose behind it. I also am asking you guys before doing research so I can know better what I need to know about and look into.

In order to understand my questions you'll need to know what a bong is, skip this paragraph if you already do. [Here](http://galeri7.uludagsozluk.com/277/bong_420525.jpg) is an example of a bong. The dark blue part is called a stem, and at the top of that part is the bowl. The chamber, stem, and bowl are all separate, detachable pieces of the bong. You have to be able to remove the bowls. You use a lighter to ignite the weed that is in the bowl. You put your lips on the inside of the top of the bong, making a seal, and suck. The suction pulls the flame into the bowl, igniting the weed, and sending all the smoke to get filtered and cooled through the water and into your lungs. Bowls will vary in size, but typically you have to move the lighter to ignite the whole bowl, if you held the lighter in one spot the whole time the flame probably won’t even touch all of the weed.

The device will have two separate bongs. The entire piece will get moved around like a regular bong would, but both bongs will be attached in fixed positions to the device. Both bowls will be lit simultaneously with one switch. The switch won't be in a fixed position, and will ignite a flame above both bowls. The entire point of this device is that you only need to do one thing, use the switch. Everything else is hands-free and works on its own.
The design I’ve got worked out is very simple but effective. It’s going to have a butane lighter above each bowl. Attached securely to these lighters is a bicycle brake cable. On a bike, you can have one brake handle control both brakes with a device called a dragonfly brake cable. Using this, the ignition can be controlled by a single bike handle.

Usually you would use a [Bic](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/BIC_lighter_2008-12-31.jpg) to light the weed. They provide a really nice flame that will light it, but not mercilessly burn all the weed. Bics have a couple problems though. First, you can’t simply put the flame over the weed. You have to hold the lighter just to the side of the bowl and pointed towards it. Then you let the flame flow in, otherwise the suction can blow the flame out. This means that the lighter would have to move around the edge of the bowl while still pointing in, which would be really difficult to design. Second, the flames can also easily blow out on a windy day. Third, they also have flints which need to be struck to light them, which would mean me really simple device would have to become a whole lot more complex. So with this device I think it will be a lot more effective to use butane lighters, as it has none of those problems. The only problem with butane lighters is that they, in fact, do mercilessly burn all the weed if positioned incorrectly. Because of this, I need to come up with a hands-free way to move the butane lighters horizontally, 8 times, for a total distance of 2 centimeters. I’m thinking that maybe when I pull the bike handle, it also slightly moves the slighter, and then can be reset after the bowl is cleared. However, I don’t know how to make this into a reality, and this is where I need advice.

I'm currently an undergraduate mechanical engineering major interested in getting a job as a systems and controls engineer, making this decision off me finding the following courses: Signals and Systems, Linear Control, Digital Control Design. But other than these courses I don't really know much so I hope some people here can answer these questions.

* 1) As a systems and or controls engineer, what are your daily tasks and what type of projects have you worked on?
* 2) How much classical control theory do you use in the industry (Bode diagrams, Nyquist plots, transfer functions, pole zero analysis, etc) or are there programs that render these sorta useless.
* 3) Are there a lot of ME's in this field? My peers and I often find this material very challenging, while the EE's who take these courses do better/find material less challenging and say that their prior course work is more relevant to subject matter (especially in signals and frequency analysis)
* 4) what are important takeaways/things/ programs to know if you want to become a controls engineer? Should I learn anything outside of university coursework that will come in handy?

I'm using AspenTech's *Exchanger Design and Rating* (standalone, though within *Aspen Plus* is also possible) for calculating specifics such as tube count, shell length and diameter, nozzles, baffles, etc., based on cost minimization.

---
---


I had some difficulty deciding which stream should go on the shell side and which on the tube side.  The cooling water's high flow rate makes it seem like the best choice for the shell side. However, it has the highest fouling resistance, which advocates the choice for putting it in the tubes, rather.
I know it is preferable to put the *high pressure* fluid tube-side, since having it shell-side would require a thicker shell wall (more expensive).  Pressure does not seem so bad (max 4.5 bar), so I don't think that would be a problem - either stream can go anywhere (in terms of P)?
The hot stream's very low allowable pressure drop should be kept in mind.

Eventually I chose the **hot** stream to be in the **shell** and **cold** stream in the **tubes**.
(*EDR* also calculated the probability of that being the best choice = 60%)

---
**TEMA Types**: BXM


**B,M**:  for their low cost and simplicity. I don't *think* fouling will be that bad?

**X**: because the pressure drop by using E exceeds the allowable pressure drop.


*EDR* then found the following results to be optimal:

* Unbaffled
* Shell size = 501.6 mm
* Tube length = 4600 mm
* Tubes = 315
* Nozzles: 5 hotside in, 3 hotside out

---
Now, the important part:
---
Could you please comment on my choice of stream sides and TEMA types?
---
What/where the HX will be used for, was not specified.  Available TEMA classes: B, C, R. I chose C (general service). Correct?

19,Best way to protect against NO SSR failure,1414162887,"It's my understanding that normally-open SSR's tend to fail closed.  I'm considering an application using one to switch a 1kW heating element at 120VAC to heat water in the 120-190F (48-88C) range.  I can't find a thermal cutoff switch that would protect against an over-heating condition with sufficient precision, so I need a better way to protect against a fail-closed SSR.  My first inclination was to use another relay (SSR or reed), to essentially short hot to neutral and blow a fuse, but that sounds like a fire (or at the very least, problems with blown fuses due to transient accidental triggering, not to mention the size of the resistor to prevent tripping the circuit breaker) waiting to happen.  What are the best practices to protect against this?

Also, with that said, hopefully somebody who knows a whole lot more about SSR's than I do will be answering this.  I'm also concerned about the logistics of sinking the heat of the SSR.  What would be ideal would be to simply sink the heat into the water vessel, since that's what I want to do anyway (heat water, why not use that ""wasted entergy"" for something useful), but nobody seems to make an SSR that can tolerate temperatures that high--or at least that I can find searching Mouser.

We recently decided to add a few effects to our set, one of which includes a solenoid-operated air cannon that will shoot out a puff of dust when one of our stuntmen does a high fall onto a foam fall bag. The air cannon is old hat for us, and we usually operate them on a direct switch running 120VAC or through a 12VDC switch running to a 120VAC relay that operates multiple cannons.

What I am trying to do is eliminate the need to have someone standing by a switch to set the new air cannon off at the same time as the stuntman hits the bag.

There is a second compressor (spare) available to me that is an exact duplicate to the one on the rig currently. Here are the two ideas I have to choose between.
1. Attaching the spare compressor after the air storage tank. The first compressor will fill the storage tank to an intermediate pressure, then a valve will release this air into the second compressor bringing it to a high pressure.
2. Buying a new compressor with a larger volume stroke to place in series before the existing compressor. Or buying a new compressor with a smaller stroke volume to place in series after the existing compressor.

64,Make up air calculation for sweet potato in convection oven,1413923112,"All,


**Question:** Would anybody know how to calculate make up air requirements for a forced air convection oven.


**Background:** We are making sweet potato chewy treats for dogs.  The potatoes are prebaked at 400 F for 2 hours such that the starch converts to sugar and the ""chewy"" profile is kept when drying (this is why the treats are chewy as opposed to crispy).  We then slice the potatoes to 1/2"" and put them in the same oven for 10 hours at 180 F. 


**Problem:** Condensation forms while drying.  This is believed to extend the dry time.  If the condensation can be removed (with added ventilation), the dry time will be reduced.  

**Proposed Solution:** Add a makeup air unit (or blower) for added ventilation.  


**Variables:** We are going to draw makeup air from outside of the oven and exhaust heated air to roof.  What other variables do I need?  RH?


I need to know what cfm I should be using for the makeup air.  We remove 196 kg of water from the start of the dry to the end of the dry. Oven operates at ~200,000 BTU/hr.

72,What kind of jobs could I get with an A.S. in Engineering?,1413899408,"I'm currently in community college studying engineering. I'm in my second year and I am not sure if I'm ready to devote another 2-3 years at a state university for a B.S. in Engineering just yet. Part of the reason is cost; neither me or my parents have the money to send me to university and I really don't want to take out loans.

Another reason is because I just applied for an apprenticeship to be an electrician for my dad's labor union. I am actively considering taking the apprenticeship if I get in 1.) I will have a nice paying job anyway and 2.) If I decide to continue my education the labor union will pay me to get a degree. I could be an electrician, get a degree in my spare time, and become an engineer for the union or a shop.

Lastly, overall I am not sure if I really want to stay in school any longer at this. I really just want to find an engineering based job that pays well so I can get on with my life, move out of my parents house, and be independent.

74,Choosing a transistor,1413896956,"Trying to make a very simple [circuit](http://i.imgur.com/kkRkwzw.png) (ignore the ammeters, they're there to check if the design works).

What I want to do: drive low-impedance (1.9 Ohm) LPG injectors as well as high-impedance (16 Ohm) petrol injectors. They can't just be mixed due to high current in the ECU with the low-impedance injectors. Adding a resistor would drop the voltage at the injector and may affect its performance.

So the transistor I need should be able to handle upwards of 6.32A (according to my calculations for 12V).  
I realise I'll probably need to mount them on a heatsink, that shouldn't be an issue. For this I'd prefer non-SMD components (and also for easy of assembly).

I've been looking, and can find plenty of transistors in the 10A range, but they all state higher voltages than the 12V I'll be working with.

89,Do you or do you not search for solutions to things that others feel are impossible or improbable and why?,1413835738,"I was thinking today that there are many types of ways of thinking when in engineering. Some people it seems are extremely repulsed by finding answers or looking at solutions that others have deemed impossible or improbable. For instance the airplane was seen to be impossible and so many engineers just would not allow themselves to look into that realm of possibility and try it out and would even deter others from looking into it.

Are you of the group that is against looking into what others have tried and failed at doing and the engineering comunity says is impossible because it would break the known laws of physics or are you of the group that wanders into the fringe areas of study and are willing to take chances to see if things actually are as we currently know them to be or not? If you are of either group could you say why you are of that group of thinking? I am curious to know why my fellow engineers do what they do and think what they think.

I myself like to look in the areas where others are not willing to look. It has given me the ability to do some pretty awesome things. Of course looking inside the box is always the first option.

99,"State of /r/AskEngineers: deployment of new CSS style, changes to flair, and sidebar overhaul",1413768603,"Well, it's been two weeks since new mods were hired and we've been hard at work since then to improve the subreddit. Today I'm proud to finally reveal all that we've been working on.


##### [](#icon-information) CSS Stylesheet

I used the stylesheet from /r/netsec as a template and adapted it for use on AskEngineers. Visually, the two subs will appear the same, but there were a lot of back-end things that required fixing. The style may change over the next few months so that it isn't a direct copy of their style, but I feel it is important to deploy this as soon as possible since it makes everything else work.

If you notice any visual bugs of any kind (no matter how small), please send us a message about them. I did some brief testing on Firefox, Chrome, and IE, but as with any type of web coding, it never works perfectly the first time on every browser.

**edit:** to expand on this a bit, my plan is to use this style on a temporary basis only, while I make another stylesheet from scratch. I felt that I needed to deploy something usable in the meantime both as a test run and to build a foundation for more important things. I'm not a css guru by any measure so I'm learning as I go.

##### [](#icon-information) Flair

Flair is being redone to adopt the system that's being used in /r/AskScience and /r/AskHistorians. I will make a separate post about this at a later date to provide more details, but essentially we will be switching over to a merit system where users can apply for flair based on how well they can answer questions in their field. If you want to see an example, check out the [AskScience panelist thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2aypoy/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xi/). This means all currently existing flair will be removed, and any new flair from this point forward must be granted by the moderation team.

You can expect this to be implemented over the next couple of weeks. We realize that AskEngineers may end up being a different type of sub, so if this system doesn't work out as intended after a few months, the mod team will consider other options moving forward.

##### [](#icon-information) Other stuff

We've done a few other minor things like condense the sidebar, update the submission page so that the rules are clear (and *hopefully* stop all the posts that shouldn't be submitted), and refine AutoModerator's rules.

We're tossing around a few ideas for new weekly threads, and all of your suggestions are welcome.

---

As usual I'm interested to read everyone's thoughts. I'm hoping that these changes will do a lot to improve overall submission quality, and act as a foundation for things like AMA panels and engineering case study posts.

A few things were rushed but hopefully the edges will be smoothed over as we get used to all of this new stuff.

**edit:** the css style is a bit buggier than I was able to determine from testing, so if it makes anything unusable, uncheck ""Use subreddit style"" in the sidebar until further notice.

0,Strange DC motor torque performance,1413766991,"My goal is to control torque in a DC motor, but I am getting strange results. Here are my steps:

* establish torque constant - measure current draw while moving at a constant angular velocity at 100% PWM and 3, 50 and 75% stall torque

Think of a lowrider hopping or so. initial jump can be small (inch or two) but can be made to add up (in rhythm) to 'jump' higher and higher.
I was thinking of using hydraulics (like in lowrider cars).

I have experience with pneumatics and could make it with that, being it just not powerful enough to create enough lift. No experience at all with hydraulics.

budget is about 1500$

any tips, sources or maybe better ideas how to do this?
what kind of flow, pressure etc would I need?

I was just wondering:

Could the Buncefield explosion have been avoided if either: 1) fans ran around the tanks 24/7 (so gas vapor could never accumulate); 2) some feature was installed around the tops of each tank that collects fluid and sprays it noticeably outward (to avoid the coanda effect, which hindered early detection); 3) or both?

This is for a shifting system for an FSAE car (College related; for a club, not a class). We want to use paintball tanks to run the pneumatics, scaling down the pressure to roughly 100 psi. The system would require 3 air cylinders, which brings me to my first question:

I'm looking for a cylinder capable of providing a 1 inch throw forward and backward, 2 inches total. It also need to be spring return in both directions. I'm not sure what one would call this type of cylinder. I found one online when I first started looking into this a month or so ago, but (regretfully) did not save any info from it. Does anyone know the name of such a cylinder? Link to my crappy paint drawing to help explain what I mean: http://imgur.com/8u86Uhm

My next check would be to see if the solenoids I'm looking at function as I think they do. I want to use a 2 position, 3 port solenoid to run a single action spring return cylinder. When ""off"" the solenoid would vent the cylinder to atmosphere, and when on supply the pressure. I have found plenty of solenoids that seem like they would work, but I wanted to verify that connecting one in such a way is correct. Second paint explaination: http://imgur.com/OhTOHl4

Connecting problem 1 and 2, would using 2 of these same solenoids be the correct (or easier?) way to go to run the 2-direction cylinder? From the diagrams i found of more complex solenoids, I could not find one that would pressurize one side while venting the other. Any suggestions  of how to operate this cylinder?

26,"Is CMfgT recertification worth it (also, how to cite EIT, CMfgT, and other non-PE certs)?",1413565888,"* First a little background:

I'm a MechE who's worked mostly in design and QA.

If you're unfamiliar with CMfgT, it's [SME's Certified Manufacturing Technologist](http://www.sme.org/certified-manufacturing-technologist-certification.aspx). If you haven't heard of it, that's OK, no one who's ever interviewed me has heard of it either. It's the first step to being a Certified Manufacturing Engineer, and unfortunately their technologist to engineer progression can give the wrong implication, given how the terms are typically defined by ABET and degree granting institutions.

Anyway, I passed the FE and graduated a few years ago and passed the CMfgT exam a few years before that (I think as a sophomore in college). I just now realized my CMfgT has actually lapsed (I thought it was a lifetime cert, it may have even expired before I graduated).

When asked in interviews, I've likened the CMfgT to a mini-FE. It's a 3 hour exam and easier than the FE. It was decent enough resume material for a thin undergrad resume, but now I'm not sure it's worth renewing with the EIT on there and largely superseding the CMfgT.

I hate to drop the accomplishment off my resume, but it's almost $200 for a certification that's apparently largely unknown, and has the potential to confuse prospective employers as to whether I'm an engineer or technologist. Does anyone think it's worth keeping on there? Would I be OK to list the years the cert was active, or would that raise red flags as to why it's no longer active? Would I be OK to just list when I passed the exam?

* Secondly (and I know this has been asked at least a couple times before):

How should these things appear on my resume and/or e-mail signature? I know I'm entitled to put ""Bat Masterson, EIT"" or ""Bat Masterson, CMfgT"" or possibly even ""Bat Masterson, EIT CMfgT"" at the top of my resume or in an e-mail signature, but I'm not sure how that's viewed by HR and hiring managers.

Would it be preferred to just put the EIT in an accomplishments/qualifications section of my resume? How about for e-mail? Leave it off, put it all on one line, or do something like this?:

&gt;Bat Masterson

&gt;Engineer-in-Training

&gt;bm@gmail.com

&gt;1-800-555-1212

Lastly, should the way I reference it be dependent on where I'm applying? As an ME, the industry exemption means a lot of places might not care, but if I'm applying to gov't contractors or places working in construction it might be more relevant.

**tl;dr: Is CMfgT worth renewing and mentioning as an EIT? How should I identify myself as an EIT/CMfgT?**

45,Question on the effect of rapidly releasing gas under water on said water.,1413501704,"I have an interesting situation.

The scenario:
An existing smallish rectangular tank, about 10'x7'x5' (LxWxH), filled with water. A refrigerant compressor filled with Nitrogen between 350PSIG and 450PSIG is placed inside the water tank to test where any potential leaks are coming from. The Client would like a removable lid, of sorts, placed on top of the tank to ""mitigate"" the water splash in the event of a failure in the compressor and the compressed gas inside rapidly releases (the term explode has been used, but I like to shy away from it in this instance).

The Question:
I need help identifying a force the resultant water splash would impose on this new lid. I'm not looking for help for designing the lid. I'm ignoring the potential issue of the compressor rocketing out of the tank (by request of the client). I'm only interested in determining the force that the water would impose on the lid if the gas inside the compressor rapidly releases (almost instantaneously for worst case scenario). I can then hand that information to the structural engineer to deal with as they see fit.

Sketch of the situation. Far right picture is possibly understating the potential issue.

I need to effectively reduce this value by an unknown number (more info still to be found).

53,How do I reduce pitting in a Baja SAE reduction gearbox?,1413481048,"I'm a member of the Drivetrain group of my school's Baja SAE design team.  We're currently trying to design our reduction gearbox which goes between a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and the drive axles.

The CVTech CVT that we're using has a top ratio of 0.5:1 and a low ratio of 3:1.  Given our max engine speed of 3600 RPM and a rolling radius of 10.675 inches, to achieve our desired speed of 40 mph we need a reduction of about 11.25:1.

The design I have right now is included here: http://imgur.com/a/1lls9

As you can see, the design of the second stage has an insufficient safety factor for pitting (Sh).  I've never done this type of design work before so I'm not sure what variables to change to fix the problem.  One major restriction that we face is the size of the gearbox. In order to fit within the rear dimensions of the car, the outside dimensions of the gears cannot increase to much larger than they are now.

I've been researching gear pitting and I've found that lubrication can reduce that phenomenon.  We generally use SAE 75w-90 Gear oil in our gearbox. Do you think that would eliminate the pitting?

75,Looking for help in understanding power available and propeller efficiency,1413396123,"Had a practice presentation today, and I had plots of power available at certain altitudes, and this is for a variable pitch turboprop. 

I'm not sure how exactly to explain my plot, but at 0 velocity, I have that the available power is 0, then it somewhat linearly increases until some velocity (V1), and has a near constant available power (PA1), then eventually, at V2, it near linearly decreases down to 0 available power. 
                           ___  
Kinda looks like   /      \      with power on the y-axis, and velocity on the x-axis. 

So I was told that this is wrong, and I'm trying to understand why it's wrong. From what I have found during my research, propeller efficiency depends on the advance ratio (freestream velocity/(engine rpm*propeller diameter)), and it depends on the propeller pitch. 

So according to that, with no freestream velocity, the propeller has no efficiency, and with no efficiency, the shaft horsepower (SHP) provides 0 power. 

Am I wrong with that part of propeller efficiency? I figure if someone can explain it to me, I might be able to fix my info. Or maybe my info is correct? If so, when we're not moving, how can I say we basically start to move? Would that have to do with the static seal level thrust produced by the engine?

Also, as velocity increases, and eventually power decreases, the propeller efficiency greatly drops. Is this just because of tip loss on the propellers, or is there something else I'd need to talk about?

Any help would be very greatly appreciated.

95,How many kilowatts of heat is typically output from a 4 cylinder engine at idle?,1413332516,"More specifically, how many kilowatts of heat are expelled via the radiator water, since some will be convected/radiated from the engine block etc.

The engine in this case is a 2.4 litre diesel (4 cyl) in a ford transit camper van.

I'm considering installing a heat exchanger in the radiator water lines to heat a hot water tank for a shower.

These heat exchangers are specifically designed for the purpose and have a copper core that is fairly effective at transferring the heat from the engines glycol mix to the fresh water tank in the shower.

I want to estimate the heating capacity in kilowatts that I might get. 

And from there, how much time it might take (for example) to heat 25 litres of water from 20 to 60 degrees celsius when the engine is idling and the engine coolant is at 75-80 degrees C. Which I think I can work out since I've found it takes about 4 joules (watt/seconds) to heat 1 gram (1 millilitre) of water by 1 degC or 1K)

An approximation based on some typical numbers is fine, as I don't  know the exact efficiency of the heat exchanger, or the exact diesel consumption of the engine at idle which would help in estimating the heat output of it.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2j9qj7/how_many_kilowatts_of_heat_is_typically_output/

10,Dual chamber verticle water heater via a campfire,1413265335,"I am trying to find a way to heat a barrel of water in a reasonable enough time using a campfire/bonfire.  The barrel of water has a shower head on it to allow for hot camp showers in the middle of the wilderness where no facilities are accessible. 

SETUP:

Diagram: http://i62.tinypic.com/2mn24c7.jpg

A standard sized steel barrel 8 feet in the air on 4x4 wooden supports with water 2/3 full.

A 2 foot by 2 foot steel cubed water chamber on metal supports directly in a bonfire with a 3 foot diameter *very hot camp fire

2 steel pipes connect the steel barrel and steel water chamber

pipe #1 will go from the bottom the steel barrel to the bottom of the steel chamber

pipe #2 will go from the top of the steel chamber to the top of the steel barrel (at the top of the water level 2/3 the way up)

I personally don't think water convection alone will be able to cycle this water in a convection current, with hot water being drawn into the upper pipe in the steel chamber leading to the top of the steel barrel. And water from the bottom of the steel barrel being drawn into the pipe leading to the bottom of the steel chamber. For this reason I will have to install probably 1-2 pumps somewhere along the water cycle.


My question is, would this work? If so what is the most effective way to install these pumps?

I am a manufacturer of science kits in Taiwan/China, and I was wondering how feasble this is if I rescale this(maybe make it smaller, float a couple of coins or paper clips?). I am guessing I need very thin yet dense copper coils to produce that kind of magnetic field.

1. How much current and power (watt) would I need to achieve this? (I am guessing collombs law, but not sure how the number of coil circles co-relate to the strength). 

2. How would I place the coils? One going clockwise on top, one going counterclockwise on the bottom?

3. Is this feasible under $8? Does anyone know a simple bill of materials needed? (China components are very cheap IMO). 

4. If I wanted it to spin, I guess I would put two coils at different positions, and maybe control the strength to produce a spinning torque? 

Where I work, it is by trial and error, rather than theory, so I need a place to start.

29,Need help settling on a career,1413186218,"Hey guys, I have a few questions for y'all regarding a career. 

I'm 27, an EE, and graduated from a top 10 university 2 years ago. 2.6 GPA. No recent internship experience, but I did intern as a Process Engineer (doing IE work) for a well known automotive OEM back in 2008-2009. 

After graduation I started a business with my dad buying, rehabbing, renting, and flipping properties. I was the analyst, planner, general contractor, laborer, plumber, electrician, roofer, framer, etc. I handled every aspect from selection and acquisition, hands-on rehab, to property manager and lease consultant. No formal training, I just learned, asked questions, and became decently good at what I did.

Now that the real estate market has caught back up, and the opportunities are not as lucrative, I'm planning to hand the reigns over to my dad and move on to a real career. 

I was never really all that into EE and having the break really made me realize that. But now, I don't even know where to start with a career. 


1. I like tinkering and doing hands-on stuff. On my free time I wrench on cars and do a lot of DIY home upgrade stuff, for fun. Being an EE, I'm awesome diagnosing automotive issues relating to sensors/electronics and how they translate to mechanical problems. Also can upgrade, rip out and rewire an entire home to proper code, easy, no problem. Same with building and troubleshooting circuits with diagrams. Soldering, prototyping, etc.. But I don't really like the complicated math that's involved in the design.
2. I also really enjoy the analytical side of engineering. Doing regressions, statistical analysis, looking for trends, predicting the future, six sigma, etc. Enjoy doing financial, social, and economical analysis and making decisions/recommendations for investments. Also entrepreneurial stuff. 
3. I really like working with multiple levels of people. Vendors, marketing, investors, government, clients, contractors, etc. Also enjoy working project-based with various scopes to keep the work load interesting.
4. I'm not afraid of putting in work, getting dirty, working behind a computer all day, on the field, in a lab, or traveling. Anything will do for now.
5. I like an industry that is growing, and the workplace relatively young, and social. 
7. I learn things very effectively by doing, seeing, touching, and hearing. Textbook stuff, not very much. 
6. Regarding EE, I took a very general/survey route. Off the top of my head, I had classes in DSP, power electronics, controls, circuit design/lab, IC wafer fab, embedded design, networking, biomedical systems, and Java/C/C++/Matlab/SQL. I was never any good in any of that, am very very rusty now, and probably wouldn't want to consider a career if it involved a lot of what I've learned in school.


Some things I've come up with: 

- Financial analyst for a commercial real estate firm
- Associate project manager for a construction firm
- R&amp;D for a small engineering firm
- Quality/Test engineer
- Field engineer

It would be great if some of you guys could lend some advice or share your thoughts. Thanks a lot! ",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2j3k4c/need_help_settling_on_a_career/

31,Am I going to have a bad time as an EE if I don't enjoy programming?,1413170206,"I'm a freshman in college, planning on majoring in Electrical Engineering. I picked it initially because I liked electromagnetism in physics class. 

Right now I'm taking an intro class on signals; it deals with spectrums, fourier series, DFT, FIR, and FFT. We use Matlab for all of our lab assignments, and they haven't been going that well (mid-80s). 

I don't enjoy programming too much, and I'm having a really hard time figuring out the lab. I took Java in high school and did fine. However, I'm not that interested in programming. I know a lot of EEs who are super interested in Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but it's just meh to me. 

Half the lab assignment is me struggling with Matlab - trying to figure out the syntax and debugging it are frustrating to me.

Anyways, this is one of my first EE classes, but I'm wondering if I can get by in EE without programming? Are there parts of EE that don't involve much programming? I'm honestly more interested in the physics and math portion of it. I'm thinking of switching to chemical engineering (I like chemistry) or even physics or chemistry.

36,"Aerospace Engineers of /r/AskEngineers, would you recommend your career?",1413151531,"*A* couple of years ago when I was in Wales visiting family, my uncle (who happens to be a materials engineer) and I were sitting down discussing my plans for the future over breakfast. I told him about my interest in space and told him how I was thinking about aerospace engineering. His reply was unexpected. He seemed very adamant that I should reconsider careers. He suggested materials engineering, or civil engineering. Now, I'm not someone who likes being told what to do with my life, so I shrugged it off, and didn't think about that conversation until recently. 

*My* friend and I were hanging out at his house, and his step-dad had just gotten home. This was my first time meeting him, and seeing as my friend knew about my interest in aerospace engineering, he brought it up to him. His step-dad is an aerospace engineer, and when I found out I asked him where he went to school, and what he thought of his profession. His reply remind me of my uncle's. He told me that I should probably consider a career in materials science and engineering. He said something among the lines of, ""it's well known how to put aircraft into the air, and spacecraft into space"" and ""you can always make materials cheaper, more efficient, and better in quality"". He seemed disappointed in his career choice, to be honest.

*I'm* aware of how you need to consider the demand of a profession when you consider careers. Money is not something I'm trying to obtain here. I'm trying to pursue dreams of my own. I want to be happy with what I do. Though hearing their ""words of wisdom"", I can't help but feel conflicting feelings inside. Are there any aerospace engineers (or any engineers who might have any insight on this topic) who might be able to give me an idea of whether or not they have a point, and if I should reconsider careers? What should I do at this point? Would you recommend a career in aerospace engineering, and why?

Thank you!

37,(Industry PhD's especially) Have you been stuck in a niche due to your past experience? How did you get out?,1413149760,"I feel trapped in my career and am wondering if anybody else (in particular PhD's looking for/working in an industry career) has been in a similar position and how they handled it.  I don't want to chance compromising my identity so I'll refer to everything in pretty vague terms.  Sorry for the wall of text, I really appreciate anyone's time who reads it.

I started my PhD in Fall 2006 after doing well in a Master's program at a different institution.  I joined one of the larger labs in my field within the department.  I said I wanted to work on technology A (which that lab does work on) but my adviser more or less pushed me into working on technology B, although mostly used in conjunction with A.  I  wasn't really crazy about it and was concerned I would basically be a technician for one particular machine (nobody in industry uses technology B, it's 99% a research tool), but another senior grad student I respected talked me into it, saying that the student who was currently working on it had published some sophisticated papers, and companies would be interested in the skills I learned along the way.  I was a first year so I was afraid to push back.

I convinced myself it could work out, I had some ideas about projects, and maybe I could use it to get more into technology A and other areas.  In grad school it's really easy to get ""tunnel vision"" about your project though, so you just focus on taking the next step, getting decent results, passing your qual exam, etc. I had this so I went with it rather than making sure I was acquiring skills for a future job.  I should also note that B is notoriously unreliable so I spent a LOT of time diagnosing problems and trying to get it to work for that day which of course doesn't make it into a paper or a resume.

I graduated in 2012 and had a tough time finding the kind of job I wanted, which is something like research/R&amp;D/tech dev/advanced product dev.  Companies never tell you why they don't hire you, but I imagined a lot of them felt like they could get someone who was an expert in what they are doing (e.g. technology A).  I ended up in a postdoc basically using this same technology, in a very different way, for what is considered a ""hot"" field right now, albeit for fundamental science in an area I really don't care about.   I thought maybe this could turn into something big, getting some experience in a technologically important field, but that aspect hasn't really gone anywhere.

Now I'm basically in the same place, maybe even worse, because companies see my resume and it looks covered in technology B (both grad and postdoc), so that's what I come across as, a ""B"" guy which they don't need when they can get an ""A"" or C"" or ""D"" guy. I do tailor my resume as much as possible to each job but if I downplay the ""B"" stuff, it looks thin, or if I just try to reframe it anybody who knows the field reasonably well will understand what my focus was.  I know I could really excel in something else if given the opportunity and a modicum of training.  I think this is getting worse as companies are getting more and more interested in specialists, and because of the huge numbers of PhD's they are able to get them. 

So I guess my question is: Has anybody been stuck in a career rut due to spending many years working on a niche technology, and successfully managed to break out into an industry career?  Were you able to make it the kind of career you wanted out of your PhD, or was it just something you could get?

I am currently a junior in Mechanical and I'm struggling.  At this point i'm realizing that this isn't really the direction I want to be taking.  

What I want to be doing is designing a product, and seeing its way through fabrication and development.  I want to know how to make things.  Ive been getting experience in the machine shop through student orgs and a place called Tech Shop and I'm loving it in there. 
Mechanical isn't doing that for me, or at least not yet.  Im being taught how to analyze systems to find pressures, volumes, temperatures, find the current and voltage across blah and blah and I'm just over it all.  Its making me miserable.  

I found that my school offers a Manufacturing Engineering degree.  From what it sounds like, its what I want.  Designing a product with CAD, understanding the materials needed and processes required to make it cost effective and efficient, etc.  
Im wondering if any Manufacturing Engineers are on here that can give me any guidance.  I want to talk to as many people as possible before I make a switch.  Id be adding on an extra year, but it will be worth it if it stops me from being miserable and will be something that ill enjoy.

 - Architects don't sleep. I NEED to sleep.
 - They don't make much money for that hard work. Well...
 - If they DO make money, it's after a lot of time and I kinda need a quick stable and good job.

Resuming, to every con I found in Architecture, there was a pro in Engineering. And now I'm into this, and after more research I'm stuck with Civil and Mechanical.

I thought on being an architect because I love building, drawing, and stuff, and Civil is similar to this because they're the ones behind every single building. I also knew they have a good starting salary and will be really needed in the future (but I don't live in the US so I don't know).

And Mechanical was like, EVERYONE praises it, it pays even better, seems to be an very interesting area and have much more chances abroad.

And now I want to know which of these two should I stick to. A little bit about me now, I do VERY good with math, especially geometry. Physics are fun for me.

I've known since I was 5 that I deep down I wanted to be an engineer and now that I'm in my final year of high school it's time to choose what I want to do and where I want to go. The truth is I'm not sure what branch of engineering I should go into. Hopefully you can help!

Essentially I have 2 major reasons for wanting to enter into the engineering field. First and foremost I like solving problems involving logic/math/physics. It helps that this is also my strongest subject (which might be why I like it). Secondly, my father owns a small engineering and fabrication shop that I've worked at since I was a child. Each yea I have learned a new skill and each year that new skill makes me want to delve deeper into the world of engineering (for example this year I was in charge of materials and had to learn how to keep the correct flow of metal in the shop etc). With these factors combined I can't think of a better job for me.

Right now I'm split pretty much 50/50 between mechanical and electrical engineering. I'd like to list a few things I'm strong in/interested in doing and maybe someone can point me in the right direction. 

*work with math and physics to solve problems

*create units that work with electricity or have moving parts within them.

*eventually get a masters degree (been highly recommended by my father and other engineers I've talked to)

*i like programming, but not enough to do it 40hrs a week. A little programming here and there would be nice though.

*have a tangible item at the end of a project. I'm not interested in only doing work on the computer.

*whatever I become I would like to have decent job security. Spending 4yrs on a degree with no jobs in Canada would be a waste of my time. 

*i want to choose which materials to use and how a part should be assembled. 

Like I said earlier, my father is a mechanical engineer. I enjoy what he does except I'm very interested in technology and I find some of the product we ship a little boring (big metal clamps to hold transformer cores). I want to find a balance between technology  and the large stationary objects I currently help create. Because of this I don't know if it's best to enter the realm of electrical or mechanical engineering. Some guidance would be appreciated! 

PS. I have talked to my dad a bit, but would like to here other opinions. He sometimes forgets that I'm not interested in exactly the same things he is. As a result his advice often leads to him advising me to do things because it's what he enjoys not what I enjoy.

You can work-harden it to increase the concentration of dislocations.

I am having some issues making [this](http://es.tinypic.com/r/dg6qkl/8) circuit in OrCAD Capture Lite.  [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/la9qd00g96irgbj/ns_pulser%5B1%5D.pdf?dl=0) is the link to the original paper with more information.

I can't seem to find the MC33151 part, nor the DE275-501N16A component. Anyone know what these are called in Capture Lite?

Everything left of this, I have built, and it generates an inverted 5V pulse, which is nice.  


Once these parts are found, my next question will be, how do I implement a trigger for just a single pulse?  I want to have the option to switch between a continuous pulse train and a singular trigger-enabled pulse.

Any help would be fantastic!  Specially with the components hunt.

Thank you!

I can calculate the heat loses at a given temperature of the air and the PVC pipe, but not for the whole process (im guessing some type of integrals are involved)  i think the coefficients of convection change with temperature, so the losses are different at different stages of the heating process. 

Ultimately what i need to calculate are the ***heating times*** and the ***Power***  I must provide the system.

15,"First post, big question",1412817551,"Hi. First off, I love this sub. It's so fucking interesting it makes my head spin. So thanks for all that, honestly. Second...what should I learn? Let me clarify. 

I'm a machinist, or I will be again on Monday. I love doing things with my hands. Unfortunately, I also love social sciences...soft science, not like math. I have a BA in psychology and have worked in behavioral psych since 2008 or so, with a couple years off because in 2011-2013 I also worked in machining and destructive testing. 

I looked at my future recently (turns out it's not set) and realized I need to pick one direction and move forward. It was up to a psychiatric nursing MS or get into machining again and really get into metals and material science. So, I decided against heath care....it's honestly tedious and annoying. Easy money, but what comes easily is rarely valuable in the end. 

So here's where I am stuck. I am going to do some welding and some more CAD/CAM stuff so I can get deeper into the design side of things. Then, I am going to start some industrial maintenance learning, because I eventually want to be able to access machines remotely and diagnosis/fix/run them. I've done some networking classes, and it's cool. But....would I be wasting my time by doing this all piecemeal? Machines are increasingly online and therefore part of the internet of things, but what field is that? I could do two semesters, 3-4 classes per semester, in a few fields at the tech school level and translate that into a good living. However, would I be better off just spending two semesters doing math and physics and do a second bachelors in Engineering? I'll need to study my dick off to get good at math again, psych only used SPSS. If I did that, what would I study? General engineering? Computer engineering? Would I take a lot of classes that would be irrelevant to what I want to end up doing? I'm into my mid 30's but I'm single and can pay for school, and I'm eternally curious. To a fault. I want a degree in everything. Lol

20,Quantifying a large irregularly shaped items volume.,1412811693,"My task seems simple, I am to calculate the volume of large rock stock piles. Piles are approximately 200' long x 100' wide x 30' tall. The piles are not stacked conically as if the piles were created from one stationary pouring spot. They are stacked from a piece of machinery called a tele-stacker which pivots in a point away from the pile base and extrudes in and out to form the pile, so its fat on one end skinny on the other. On top of that volumes are always taken away from different spots and it creates a very irregular shape. Also the rock is expensive, so accuracy counts, I am thinking on the range of +/- 20 to 30 cubic yards. 

Currently the way we do this is by gps base station and rover, man traverses up the sloped sides of the hill and taking as many shots as he can, then importing the data into cad to create a measurable volume. This is both dangerous and inaccurate.

I am currently looking into laser scanners as an option but am kind of at a loss as I have never dealt with the file types these scanners create (point cloud as a .las is what I found most to create), and wondering about the turnaround of the data  is like and how much back end work I would need to do this task.

**Background:**

I've recently been fortunate enough to get some undergraduate work in my area in a company that does not want to spend the money to hire an engineer in my field. I'm keeping things intentionally vague because I'm particularly worried about this.

Before I got this job I was using marijuana to manage my anxiety and PTSD. Since getting this job I have been going to doctors I am on SSRIs and am going to counselling but it has been extremely hard and my condition has gotten much worse, partly because of not being able to be in a haze (due to drug use), and partly because every week I go to counselling and have to examine my problems which leads me to touch on things regarding my PTSD.

The last fortnight has been extremely hard, I am moving house, still studying and supposed to be working but I got no hours in. My anxiety is causing physical health issues as well, I have a suppressed immune system and have been getting fevers, migraines, nausea and vertigo. All of this my doctor and cousellor knows and are working with me.

**Actual question:**

What I want to know is what I should do regarding my job? It's something I need to do to graduate, and it's also a great opportunity, but I am seriously worried about not making my hours and messing up the opportunity. I have been getting doctors certificates but I have said the doctors don't know whats wrong with me (as they often don't when I get physically ill). I don't know whether I should speak to my employer about my issues, how much I should tell them, or if I should postpone my internship due to health issues.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I would also love to hear about any engineers that have struggled with mental health issues and if/ how it interfered with your work.

Also I'm from Australia, so if there is anyone Australian that might be able to give a perspective based on the work environment here that would be helpful too.

36,Ways to improve a small intercooler?,1412736341,"I own a old turbocharged car with an air to air intercooler. It is a small unit that relies on a hoodscoop/ram-air setup to pass air through it. The flow rate at up to 15psi is acceptable, the problem is through normal engine operation the unit becomes excessively heat soaked. The charge air temperature likely induces detonation causing the electronic controller to drastically limit maximum charge pressure and timing advance.

I'm not after mechanical diagnosis. I'm curious what methods there are to manage (lower) the actual temperature of the heat exchanger.

From factory the intercooler is equipped with a water spray down feature (think 2 window washer jets). I find it hard to notice any effectiveness though.

From what I've read, design and internal flowrates matter little. Mass seems to be the largest factor. Is that correct? would adding mass (like a passive heat sink) make a tangible difference? 

It's a cheap enough unit to replace if I ruin it and I have access to a good variety of mechanics and shop tools. Any weird/crazy/good ideas?

I really hate to even ask because for one I am so shameful about this but here I go:
In 2009, when I was 22, I was convicted of 4 felonies and 2 misdemeanors.  These consist of two felony drug possessions, vehicle theft (because I was found in possession of) and a counterfeit money charge. The misdemeanors are also drug related.  These were a direct consequence from making stupid decisions and hanging out with a bad crowd, and I haven't touched drugs since then.  I was sentenced to state prison, even though it was my first offense, for 16 months.  Therefore, here in the state of California, I will never be able to expunge these.  The will be there forever.  It is what it is.
Fast forward til now, Im 27, beautiful family, no police contact or trouble and I am in school studying computer engineering.  I get great grades, love school, and have lasting relationships with peers and a couple professors.
     I confided in a friend about my past and she said that I have no chance of getting a job once I graduate.  For some reason, this crushed me.  I know it will be challenging to gain employment, but now I am second guessing myself.  I will continue to finish my degree no matter what, but its kind of depressing to think about.  To be 100% honest, my passion is in mathematics, but I don't want to teach or go into finance, where I know I would have an even harder time finding employment. Don't get me wrong, engineering is awesome and I know I am happy with it but sometimes I find myself day dreaming about studying mathematics...I really love math but I just cant go there...
Now, my question(s):

1. From your experience, is this true? Do you think I have no chance of getting a job in engineering? 

and

2. If you are an employer that would consider hiring some one with these flaws, what qualities would you like to see in them that would make you actually hire them despite the felony convictions?

46,"Is it possible for a smartphone to connect to a ""local wireless"" connection of a 3ds and acquire information?",1412706613,"The title is pretty much the entire question, but to elaborate:

The days of multiplayer with clunky cables has long gone and the new 3ds'es (and 2ds'es) use [""local wireless""](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/701/~/internet-vs.-wireless---defining-the-difference) now to host and play local multiplayer. 

However one of my biggest gripes has always been the bad visibility of this. You could be in a room with 20 people playing the 3ds and you would have no way of telling if any are playing or hosting a local match or which game, even when you start your own 3ds.

What's worse is that  you have to launch the specific game someone is hosting for and then work trough all the menus to the multiplayer section and even then you will only be able to see **rooms for just the specific game you're playing. That also happens to be not in progress**

So i figured that since the 3ds are obviously broadcasting some sort of signal when you host a room, or are playing local multiplayer. There must be a way to connect to, or at least see this being broadcasted with anything cable of recieving wireless communications. So is there any way this could be done with a smartphone?",AskEngineers,EnslavedTuna,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2ikyxa/is_it_possible_for_a_smartphone_to_connect_to_a/

49,"Need to add ventilation to a sealed/air tight display case, I'd appreciate feedback on whether the solution I came up with would work.",1412702256,"I have a display case that I need to add ventilation to, the case is sealed in a way that wasn't meant for easy opening (the need for ventilation was discovered later) and I need an elegant way to add ventilation which won't draw too much attention.  I think I have a way to do this but I'm not sure if it will be enough,  I'd rather not go ahead and modify the case only to find out it's not enough and a more drastic solution is needed.

So here's what I've come up with,  since the sides are lined with [standard 4mm wide holes for pegs that hold the shelves](http://i.imgur.com/nGkZT6b.jpg) I was thinking of simply drilling few of the inner unused holes right through the side. This gives me a few 4mm holes to the inside of the case. Then I could plug them with [Aquarium T connectors](http://i.imgur.com/ltn592r.jpg) and connect them all to a small (and silent) air pump (I don't know much about air pumps,  was thinking about the [Tetra APS150 or similar](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tetra-T283-APS150-Air-Pump/dp/B0055F7FUS)) which will pump air into the case causing the inside pressure to build. This should eventually force air out through holes that I will drill on the opposite side and create circulation.

The case is split into 2 isolated sections, each 28cm x ~100cm x 76cm or 213 liters if my math checks out.

 I wouldn't need much ventilation, optimal solution would be running the pump for a single day to ""replace"" the air inside and this would be done weekly.  I was thinking of 2 holes (top and bottom) into each section, 4 ""input"" holes total, connected to a single pump and same amount of ""output"" holes on the other side.  Does this make any sense,  would it work? The Tetra APS 150 gives a 150l/hr throughput.  Also, would it make a difference if I'd connect the holes in sequence or make a single connection from the pump/or multiple pumps to each hole.

52,Entry Level Engineering Roles that can translate well into a Robotics career?,1412694439,"Hi all,

I'm a recent mechanical engineering graduate, who is very interested in working in the controls side of robotics. I hear a masters is a great door opener for the robotics industry, but I don't think I have the money or motivation for that at the moment. 

So, I've been researching both the automation industry (PLC), and the embedded hardware (firmware) industry. Both seem to require skills that I've picked up, but both also seem to require very niche skills as well, that wouldn't be taught by a degree.

Can anyone who works in these roles describe what they do on a daily basis? I take it PLC does a lot of ladder logic programming, CAD, and troubleshooting robots on site, while firmware engineers do a lot of DSP, circuit design, and C coding? I perhaps get the impression that if I go one of these routes, it will diverge from any job related to designing say, consumer robotics or something. I would be totally fine with that if I enjoyed the job, but I'm just trying to look into these sort of things as much as I can before I try to pounce on something.

I know there is a lot of ""grunt"" work as an EIT but I have gone so far as to ask for work on the side to further my experience to no avail. I have also asked if there is anything I can work on or improve and was told everything I was doing thus far is good. Is this normal?

Should I sit tight and just accept the remedial mind numbing tasks or should I start looking for another job at the end of the year?

61,"EE stuck in a technical support position. I want to get back to engineering but I'm not a recent graduate nor I have actual engineering experience, what to do?",1412655494,"I was the best in my Electrical Engineering class, loved the projects and aced all of them. I had to work during the first couple of years of my degree to pay for tuition so my early grades were not so good, but the last two years were straight As.

I was looking forward to a long and fulfilling career in engineering, either in Software or electrical engineering, but I finished my studies in 2008 right when the recession hit.

I spend more than a year living with my parents looking at the student loan bills piling up and applying for jobs, got a few interviews but no calls, so I just started to apply to any job where I could use my skills and landed a Field technician job at a small company.

I took the offer with the idea to pay my student loans as fast as I could and to get out of there, but I was soon promoted to Software support specialist for a big region of countries and started doing big client presentations, flying all over the place and generally finding out that despite not enjoying it, I was pretty good at it.

I got bored and started asking for more technical positions in the company, but the engineering office is in a country with strict immigration laws so that was out of the question, so I ended up accepting an offer in the global support team, handling more complicated cases and talking more directly with engineering.

I hate it.

I'm feed up, I want to do engineering, it is what I went to school for and what I'm really good at. I really like low level programming and I think my degree and experience are a good fit for an entry level position in embedded systems (I love to get my hands dirty with oscilloscopes and whatnot), but they either look for a student or someone with some experience, so they never call me.

Recently a big company, where I applied to what I can say would be my dream job called me, after nearly pass out when I realized they wanted to interview me, I realized they where calling me because my resume caught their eye for guess what: a technical support position (I'm still applying for it hoping to transfer sometime in the future).

I graduated 5 years ago, so I'm a little rusty and not entirely familiar with engineering procedures, but I'm confident I will pick it up quickly, and I have been working on personal projects that keep much of my education fresh in my head, plus I have the experience of working at a small office and dealing with big clients.

How can I get an engineering company to hire me? Do transfers from support positions to engineering really happen inside big companies?

As one of the newly added mods I want to address a few of the issues that many of you have been giving us (the mods) feedback on, and what we've been doing to fix these issues.

---

###New rules and guidelines

Looking at [our traffic stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/about/traffic/), AskEngineers gains 30-50 new subscribers each day, and gets a surprising number of unique hits each day as well. Despite this, our community's size is dwarfed by the other ""Ask"" subs such as /r/AskHistorians, which has subscribers numbering one order of magnitude greater than us at 325K, and /r/AskScience, which is yet *another* order of magnitude greater than us at roughly 3.6 million subscribers. I think there are two main reason for this:

1. low amount of content submission

2. generally low comment quality

\#1 can only really be fixed by increasing the number of subscribers, which in turn is driven by \#2. People that are interested in engineering content generally don't like to see things like joke threads etc. which are commonly found in the default subs (engineering humor aside).

Over the past few days I worked on overhauling the AskEngineers wiki. In particular I want to point out our [**new rules page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules). It looks like a lot, but should take you no more than 15 minutes to read from start to finish... and if you can't be bothered to read the entire thing, I urge you to at least take a minute and read the first three sections: Civility, Scope, and Comments.

AskEngineers also seems to be divided into a few distinct groups based on what they believe should be allowed as submissions, and I tried to write the rules to address this issue. For those of you that are too busy to read the rules, the tl;dr is career and professional development questions, as well as less technical questions will continue to be allowed because they're relevant. I know that's probably not what some of you wanted to read, but the mod team believes that this is the best policy for the subreddit moving forward.

**If you are truly bothered by career posts, I recommend you make liberal use of the 'hide' button below a submission so that you no longer see it in your feed.**

---

###Voting on content

As anyone that spends much time on reddit eventually realizes, the voting system has a lot of weaknesses. Specifically, the biggest problem is that it doesn't rank things based on quality, it ranks by popularity, which are often very different. On reddit, whatever gets the most upvotes the fastest is the ""best"", which means a subreddit's content inevitably drifts towards things that are quick to view, easy to understand, and non-controversial. This is true for both submissions and comments. This bias can be managed with moderation, but never truly solved because it's inherent in the site's entire model.

Comments are meant to answer questions and generate discussion. We recognize that there simply isn't an objective measure for whether a particular comment is ""good discussion"" or not; sometimes even some of the comments that seem the worst actually end up being a ""trigger"" that starts off a great discussion, and if that comment had been removed, the ensuing discussion may never have occurred.

While the mod team can't dictate how you should vote on something, nor will we ever ""remove the downvote button"", we do urge you to follow these guidelines on votes:

* **Upvote** something if it's interesting, relevant, or otherwise good in some way; e.g. [good questions are specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_questions), and [good answers answer by thoroughly explaining something](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_answers). You should also upvote even if you disagree because it drives discussion in a positive direction.

* **Downvote** something if it contributes nothing to the discussion, is blatantly incorrect, or if it breaks the subreddit rules. If it's a question that you don't want to see, use 'hide' instead of downvoting for no reason other than general aggravation. *A downvote is not a disagree button or a ""I don't want to see this"" button.*

* **Report** something if it's a personal attack, violates the submission rules, or otherwise doesn't belong in AskEngineers. Please don't use it as a ""super downvote"" button because it isn't one; it only annoys the mod team by clogging up our moderation queue.

---

###New wiki pages

Finally I want to conclude by introducing the other new wiki pages. Please check them out if you have time:

* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq)

* [Library](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/library) &amp; [Library Queue](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/libraryqueue)

---

Thoughts? There is certainly a lot to talk about, but resolutions to these problems have been a long time in coming. The mod team can't fix everything right away, but we are working on what we can in our spare time to turn AskEngineers into a much better subreddit and be in the same league as the other ""Ask"" subs. At the end of the day, we can only do so with the help of the individual users, so do your part by reading and participating in the discussions.

70,Cofferdams and Turbidity Control,1412615028,"Hello everyone!

Disclaimer: I work for the company that invented water filled structures 25+ years ago.

I've been doing a lot of reading about Water Pollution, the Clean Water Act (specifically section 404), Cofferdams and Turbidity Control. I'm wondering if any of you have specified or used a water-filled structure for a cofferdam or turbidity control, and how did it turn out? 

It seems that the traditional methods of constructing a cofferdam are to either dump tons of dirt into the body of water or to pound sheet piles into the ground. Obviously, both of these methods have a large environmental impact, while also being relatively expensive. Turbidity control is generally handled with a turbidity control curtain, but these are useless in waterways with any flow present; the curtain gets pushed around, allowing turbid water to enter the main water way.


Using the on site water as a fill material seems to be a very practical idea, especially when the CWA requires complete removal of the (presumed earthen/steel) fill material from the waterway.

As far as turbidity, these water-filled structures form a seal from the bottom of the water column to the top, and are heavy, so there's no flapping or other movement that would allow turbid discharges.

From an environmental standpoint, it seems that water-filled structures have a minimal impact on the waterway they're being installed into. No turbidity releases, no days of pounding sheet piling, just using the on site water to control the on site water.

I'm finishing up my final few classes for my undergraduate degree and even have a couple of Master's degree design classes under my belt.  As a fun self-project, I wanted to try to design my own home using everything I've learned...

* I know how to design a slab for a house.
* I know how to design masonry retaining walls.
* I know how to design concrete or wood support columns.
* I know all about shear walls, rafters, etc.
* I even know where to look things up in the IBC, ANSI, ASCE, etc to meet legal requirements.

But what I don't know, is how to even start a project!!!

Every class in school presents information in their special segmented matter.  Almost every design problem starts with ""Given P...""  But how do I even know what P is?

I don't know where to start!  Do I start with the wind loads and then design walls?  How do I get the load for the foundation?  Do I have to sum all of the materials used to design the home in addition to the live loads?  What about the walls of the basement?  Do I just use the standard 2.65 S.G. for the soil since I don't have any soil testing results for this hypothetical home?

Basically, what I'm hoping from you paragons of applied mathematics, is some guidance on how a typical structural design goes in the very initial stages.

73,Are there engineering jobs that would 'fit' a bit better for me?,1412606175,"I'm a pretty new mechanical engineer.  Just started working in May.  I'm a design engineer and I work on medical devices.  Currently I'm working on a device that is nearly to pre-production and we're mainly doing final testing as well as documentation (that really should have been done ages ago like DFMEAs).

Honestly, it's the job I always thought I wanted.  Working in R&amp;D in new product development, it's an environment with a lot of ages of people which is great as my ideas aren't automatically discounted due to being young/lack of experience, I'm working on products that can make a real difference in someone's life, and overall things should be ideal.

But they're not.

I'm incredibly bored, it's very difficult to stay motivated, and even harder to stay focused.  I sit down to work on problems, and my brain just cannot hold all the information it needs to in order to actually solve a problem.  Honestly, at the current rate of work, I give myself 6 more months before someone starts talking to me about shaping up my game or I'll be fired.

I'm trying to shape up my game now.  But it's very, very difficult.

I'm beginning to wonder if maybe my long time goal of being in R&amp;D new product development isn't actually for me.

I spend some time in grad school before dropping out (developed severe clinical depression due to a medication - didn't know it was the medication until after irreparable damage, at least with the time I was willing to spend on a masters, was done).  While I was pursuing a masters degree, I was a TA and really enjoyed it.  I love teaching and tutoring (I tutored throughout undergrad).

Inside the box there was a note however, saying the fixture should only be used with a lamp from energy efficiency class D or E, further specifying that a halogen tungsten filament lamp was preferred. It also specifically stated that  it wasn't designed to be used with lamps from energy efficiency class  A+++ to C (mostly fluorescents and LED). 

I was a bit confused by this. In contrary to an upper limit considering wattage, I can't imagine why there would be a lower limit (?). Can anybody explain this to me ? There are no electronics whatsoever inside the fixture; it's just a simple screw terminal (neutral, phase and ground) with straight wiring.

The idea revolves around a Solar charging battery within a wristband that is also a Watch. But the Watch and Small light function is powered off of a battery similar to a normal watch battery, just to add a function to the writstband. (May or may not be taken out)

The Solar Panels come in to play, when the person is outside all day or most of the day in a developing country and the Wristband is charging while the User is going about their daily business. So when they get home they detatch the Battery from the bottom of the Wristband (which also is the link that allows the Wristband to wrap around the wrist). 

So once the Battery is detatched they can plug it in to power a low energy conuming LED lightbulb in a lamp or even make it the battery within a circuit of Multiple LED Lightbulbs. Anothet prooduct that could be of use was also a Lower Power Consuming Radio.

22,How should I power my garment factory in Haiti?,1412290062,"Looking for input from anyone who's had experience powering factories/buildings, preferably in developing countries where skilled mechanics and locating replacement parts are tough to come by.

We have a diesel generator that's linked to a compressor and they bring in electricity &amp; compressed air in to run the lights &amp; machines. We're completely off the grid because it's unreliable and power surges can damage/destroy the old machines we use.

Lately the generator has been down a lot (trouble with filters, leaks, and who knows what else). It's very expensive to run and it's without a doubt terrible for the environment.

I'm wondering if solar (or anything else) is strong and reliable enough to power 60 sewing machines, 3 cutting blades, lights for a factory about the size of a football field, 10 computers &amp; our server room for **6 days a week (around 60 total hours per week)**.

23,How would you use these mechanical properties as they apply to a bow?,1412287141,"Hopefully I can find someone to help here...

Basically, I am an amateur traditional bowyer trying to expand and modernize our field. I created a spreadsheet for the mechanical properties of several species used for making bows, data was gathered from The Wood Database and the Forest Product Laboratories. Also the Imperial system was used since it is mostly for American bowyers. Here is the file. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5GmFhNj7jLNQTVNMFM4QWU3amM/edit?usp=sharing[1]

The question was prompted by [this article](http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/bow-woods/) which is trying to create a ""Bow Number"" for all the wood species. However his reasoning is flawed because the general belief of bowyers is that a higher modulus of elasticity is preferred due to less material used for bow for a given draw weight, which means a faster bow. His equation does put Osage Orange and Yew at the top which are the two best woods for bow making, however Locust, hickory, and Ipe still aren't very high. Is there an equation that could be more accurate than this for a ""Bow Number""? meaning an accurate way to determine if a wood would be useful for bows. Here is what I do know:

1. Strain on a bows back is Tension (Modulus of Rupture?). The belly undergoes Compression, and Shear is on the sides. An example is Cherry which is stronger in compression, will generally break on the back while it is being made. Hickory fails on the belly while the back is almost unbreakable. Osage orange is fairly even and breaks are generally attributed to a defect in the wood.

2. A lighter bow will be faster than a heavy bow. We can modify designs to suite different woods but this is typically true. An Osage Orange bow will have lighter limbs than a hickory bow even though the wood is heavier. that also works the other way because Juniper is so light it creates a faster bow than hickory.

3. Wood good for bows in descending order(speculation): Osage Orange, Yew, Black Locust, Pignut Hickory, Hop Hornbeam, Hard Maple.

4. Wood that isn't so good for bows are: Silver Maple, White Walnut, Red Oak, Paper Birch, Black Cherry, Sassafrass.

65,Help choosing linear actuator/linear motion system,1412112399,"I am currently designing a system to measure the vertical leaps of athletes.  Basically it consists of a frame that stands upright roughly 13 ft tall, and has a touchscreen that moves up and down with the help of a linear actuator.  A tablet will serve as the user interface and store the jump data and be used to operate the machine.  

I inherited this project and the previous group was using a 12V DC, 36in stroke screw type actuator.  
Specifications: http://www.aeicomp.com/Image2/CSeriesActuatorsSpecifications.pdf

The current actuator does not have sufficient stroke to cover all of the various heights we need to move the touchscreen to.  It has been proposed to link two of them in series to solve this issue, but I want to reach out to you all for some other ideas.  

I have been looking at belt driven actuators, which seem like a great fit for this application because you can customize the length and they are very precise.  That way I would only need one actuator for the entire machine.  The only problem is they seem to be very expensive, and I have to request a quote on such a system.  

-The entire machine must be less than $1000 
-I need to stop the touchscreen at 1ft intervals from the base to the top and be within 0.1in at each stop 
-Touchscreen weighs 50lb max (do not need a heavy duty actuator to lift it)
-Travel distance of 7-8ft
-Ideally powered with standard wall outlets

Any ideas for an accurate actuator/linear lifting system ($750 or less) would be greatly appreciated!

73,[Tunnelling] How do TBMs work?,1412066938,"Evening to you all, according to my time zone that is.


For one of my subjects (uni that is), I have to write a technical report on something. (pretty much anything!) 
The Gotthard base Tunnel had piqued my interest recently and so I'm reading further about tunnelling and tunnel boring machines. **You can skip the wall of text and just direct me toward more info explaining the GBT or Gripper TBMs, or if you feel kind enough to explain; I promise, your efforts wont go to waste.**

The following is what I think I understood about the subject so far:


The machines used for GBT were Grippers(they are open shield as the ricks are hard and wont fall or squeeze back?), which were efficient for time and cost, correct or have I overlooked something? 
Is [this](https://www.herrenknecht.com/en/products/core-products/tunnelling-pipelines/gripper-tbm.html) the best available cross section photo and info about them?

According to the two documentaries I've seen about it, [Big Bigger Biggest - Tunnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8C8ushPtWw) &amp; [The Longest tunnel in the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaTN_R1b00I), the process of work in the GBT is as follows ( please point out what I missed and misunderstood)

Most of the tunnel is being excavated by TBMs (65% according to an outdated[ source from 2008](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alptransit.ch%2Ffileadmin%2Fdateien%2Fmedien%2Fartikel%2FHeinz_Ehrbar-Gotthard_Base_Tunnel__Experiences_with_different_tunnelling_methods_paper_Sao_Paolo_pdf.PDF&amp;ei=KF0qVNWbKsL98AXV-oKIDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNESHEkYkIWY_j88PfB7MdrEJPP3cQ&amp;sig2=l3vUTpRw0bVQ9zyQopZzcg&amp;bvm=bv.76477589,d.dGc&amp;cad=rja)), however the middle section; Sedrun's access shaft section, is being dug using blasting and conventional methods.

*As for how the TBM's are working the following is my understanding:*

* The cutter heads chips away the rocks, rocks fall into the buckets around the cutter heads, they fall down the conveyor belt to be reused^1 ^2?

* just after that we have the machine drilling holes  to install the steal mesh and steal arches^3

* the shotcrete then is sprayed and dries off in few seconds to make sure nothing falls on the workers.

* I saw this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsSlvH92Tl0), but I am assuming the concrete segments are also installed using Gripper TBM and not just the DSU TBMs? so there is the mesh, arches, shotcrete then concrete segments? unless I'm going overboard with assumptions as usual.

* the last thing I remember is there was a section that surveys the upcoming path ahead ( it did not explain how exactly though)

beyond that I do not know much, but would like to. 


^1 Are the mucks used in making the making of shotcrete or the concrete segments? are either of them being made inside the machine at all, as it is over 400m long? One of the docs explained that the mucks go to the factories in the bases to be used in the concrete mix, but wouldn't it have been possible to do so right on the machine or is the journey back and forth from the bases to the machines more efficient and plausible? 

^2 How frequently were the custom made cutterheads replaced in the GBT? and how frequent was that compared to other types of rocks TBMs were used for?


^3 Are the steal meshes and arches stored somewhere on the machine? or are they being supplied daily or something?

His role is engineering manager and as per his job description he holds an engineering degree. But I can't shake the feeling that he's substantially, if not grossly, under-qualified for the position.

Ex. While preparing a report, I mentioned that one of the reasons a particular measurement was off-spec was because the first measurement of the diameter was when the product was at 140F, whereas the second measurement was at 77F. I stated that thermal expansion was the culprit. My boss says that's impossible, temperature couldn't possibly cause that to happen and blamed lack of repeatability in the instrumentation as the cause. So I performed the test again, four more times in fact, and each time reached the same conclusion. I preformed dozens of lab tests where I recorded the diameter as the product cooled down. I wrote down first-hand accounts of the machine operators who attested to this shrinkage. And still, my boss claims the material ins't shrinking. At this point I'm at a loss. I don't know how to go about engineering a solution to this process problem if my boss refuses to recognize it is a problem.

89,Cation Exchange System - Aquarium LSS,1412003188,"Hi Folks,

I have toying around with a water treatment system for an aquarium exhibit I manage and could use a reality check before I do more R&amp;D into this.  

We have a large (12,000L) Amazon exhibit, which we would like to have running at a pH of 6-4 (reflective of *in-situ* seasonal conditions).  However, due to local source water and institutional standards we are reserved to having our make-up water at 7-6.5, which brings me humbly before you today.

Initially I was considering using CO2 for acidifying the exhibit, which is fairly common in the industry but because I'm a bit of a mad-man I would like to try something new.  

Our freshwater make-up system has a few components to make it fish ""friendly"", one of those components is a cation exchange system which acidifies our tap water(pH of ~9.3) to 2.2 and is then mixed with source water to achieve a set point using actuated valves.  I'm familiar with how this system works and how we achieve our end product and in an ideal world I would replicate it within my gallery so we could drop our pH to the basement but alas money is an object for a mere aquarist.  

Based of my knowledge of this system I am entertaining the idea of using a cation resin media in a fluidized bed/reaction chamber to achieve our desired pH within this exhibit by regulating flow within the reaction chamber and turnover rate for the system overall.  

So I've a few questions for you hard science types. 

NOTE: I know there are a lot of factors that go into answering these question completely but a general answer with a brief rationale will suffice.

1. Will it work in a simplified system without actuated valves and a PID controller? 

2. Would a ""strong acid"" or ""weak acid"" resin be more appropriate for this application? IE) Would one of these to cause the pH to drop too quickly? (These animals can handle some extreme water parameters but it does have to be a gradual change once we hit a certain threshold) 

3. Would a fluidized bed severely compromise the effectiveness of the system? It's my understanding that a compact bed is more efficient at ion exchange. Ideally, I would like a fluidized bed to avoid anoxic zones within these reactors but I can adapt the system to deal with the repercussions of such.

4. To what degree do organic compounds affect the effectiveness of cation media? The system has a pretty high bio-load and good amount of particulate matter. I'm prepared to add micron filters to this system if it the system demands such.

5. Should I just stick with CO2?   


I truly appreciate your time and insight.  Please feel free to add any commentary or ask questions, regarding the system that may help us figure this out.

Thanks so much!

Besides the usual things like Audio in\out, Volume and the main button that most of the headsets have, I want the BT module to be capable of the following:

* Pairing to multiple devices simultaneously. Two is the minimum, but I would rather having the option for more, if it wouldn't be too complicated.
* It would have the ability to dial.


Another feature that I would like to implement is caller ID. Not necessary. But I would like to know how it could be done.

I got the rest already figured out. I know how the program would be like (Which action invokes which process, It won't be much of the problem to write and flash that once I'll find a module).

I want to go from the 3.5"" exhaust port on the blower down to a 1.5"" tube.

I'm wondering about how much of a hit I'll take in efficiency and blower power with method A vs. method B.

a) Use a funnel epoxied on.  

b) build an airtight box.  Epoxy the motor outlet into a hole in the box.  Have another hole that the 1.5"" tube is epoxied into.

[shitty diagram of A and B](http://i.imgur.com/us0gkc1.png?1)  (ugh, pretend ""inlet"" says ""outlet"" in that pic)

I'd prefer B.  For one, it'll be easier to seal tight.  For two, it makes for a smaller overall design.  I know as a chemE who took lots of fluid dynamics stuff, i should know this....but it's been too long and I have no idea.  Will B be worse than A?  A lot worse or a little worse?

Thanks.

Edit: Realized I should expand a bit more on this.  This blower will be going into a coffee roaster.  Think big popcorn machine, like one of those air poppers.  The 1.5"" pipe will house a 2KW heat gun element, which will then expand into a 3.5"" diameter roast chamber, which will contain 250-500g of green coffee beans.

The idea is to make a fluidized bed with the coffee beans, getting a ""spout"" of beans and promoting good turnover in the bed so all beans roast evenly and simultaneously.

See, the bean bed will form a rather severe restriction, so that's where this problem becomes some kind of weird hybrid between statics and kinetics. I know, were this system static, (no flow), A would equal B.  I am pretty sure that in a high-flow situation, A would be far more efficient in terms of pressure drop compared with B.

But I'm not sure in this case, where I'm relying both on static pressure and air velocity, as it takes the right combo of both to achieve my goal....and I'm not sure how much of a hit I'll take with B compared with A.

Some distributors of this product ship it with 4 unbranded CR123a (16340) 3.7V unprotected Li-ion batteries. I want to get a few additional batteries to have on-hand, but the amount of brands, opinions, and differential mA ratings on the market are kinda overwhelming and a bit confusing.



I've never purchased nor worked with rechargeable Li-ion batteries/chargers before, but there seems to be a strange niche market for their consumption. The choices and consequence of each choice seem a little more high-risk than usual (exploding batteries, mismatched chargers, incorrect labels, etc.). I’m hoping someone can enlighten me. I’ll outline a few of my questions/concerns:



The battery websites are mostly focused on flashlights as the device. This 3-axis gimbal device I have has an overload current protection of 800mA. Does this mean I don’t need to be overly concerned about damage to the device if the batteries have been overcharged or contain a high mA rating? Does the overload current protection imply that I shouldn’t use batteries rated above 800mA? The device uses three cells in a series—do cells in a series combine to have a higher mA rate or is that rate always constant? Many sites have warnings and cautionary tales of the wrong battery destroying a flashlight. Is there an mA rating I should stick with? I’ve seen 550, 750, and 850.



In general, are protected recommended over unprotected?



Are there any advantages/disadvantages to a LiFePO4 (LFP) or LiMn2O4 (IMR) battery? I’ve seen some claims that they are safer and others say that is false. I’ve also read some claims that they put out ~15% lower voltage. Are they something to consider or something to avoid?



Thanks in advance to anyone who wants to take this on. I know reddit and /r/AskEngineers is not a consumer reports forum, so don’t feel like anyone needs to recommend actual products or band names. I would simply love to obtain a better understanding of these types of rechargeable Li-ion batteries in general.

Everyone I have asked within the company has said that you do not negotiate for this program and that if you attempt to, there are many other candidates waiting to accept the same offer (the program is somewhat competitive).  

Am I truly stuck on negotiations here?  I like the offer, but I would like it better if I could negotiate.

Naturally people are talking about a space elevator, but I don't think that's possible. I'm not a structural engineer (I'm mechanical), but from what I learned about Euler buckling in my sophomore strength of materials class, there is no way in hell you could possibly cantilever a rod about 100 km high. I don't really care what its made out of, that's way too long. Your effective length will be 200 km! (Assuming you're just going to the Karman line). Also, there's that whole wind thing. I imagine a lateral load doesn't help. It's so tall you would probably have to start considering the spin on the earth contributing a lateral load as well. Then throw in disasters, where ever its located you have concerns about tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes ect. 

How could you possibly construct this thing? You can't just make something 100 km long the turn it 90 degrees and shove it in the ground.

How could you possibly inspect and maintain something like that?

41,How to characterize a slug of air?,1411696497,"At the office, [I have a gun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3Ia-o_PnDY).  As with most guns, there is a slug of air that comes out of the barrel before the projectile (if you watch closely, you can see evidence of it in the video I linked).  For various reasons, the desire to characterize this slug of air has been stated.

How would you go about it?

My first thought was to use confetti.  I figured I could put a few bags of confetti in the muzzle of the gun and simply watch it with cameras.  The problem, however, is that the confetti will be at the bottom of the barrel.  As a result I would expect that the confetti would characterize the lower portion of the slug quite well, but what I really need to characterize is the central portion of the slug.  This in turn implies that I need some way to support the confetti in front of the muzzle.... A way that won't interfere with the projectile but at the same time will disintegrate easily.  Maybe a paper bag held by a string?

Am I missing something obvious?  Thoughts?

I probably wouldn't have two devices plugged in at the same time to the same converter. Is it even possible to make it universal or would I have to pick one or the other?

I've read that Samsung chargers have the two data pins connected, but then somewhere else say they use a few resistors to vary voltage on them. Some iPhone tutorials say it's supposed have 3.xx volts on one pin and 2.xx on the other, some just say short the data pins. Can someone shed some light on this?

I assume nothing bad could happen by shorting the data pins, so is that just my safest bet?

Ideally the tool would have:

- infinitely adjustable torque settings within a range

I know Cleco and other companies make DC and pneumatic driven tools, but they are designed for an assembly-line environment, and each tool only works within a narrow band of torque (and isn't easily adjustable). 

A tool like this would greatly speed up maintenance time and productivity for my shop, and wouldn't require tool changes to set a fastener's torque. One would use only a few drivers for the entire maintenance procedure!

Does a tool like this exist?

Edit: I have fallen victim to the non-proofreading mistake. The title should say ""Does such a torque driver exist?""

Material will be provided by organization.
The bridge should weight around 900 grams.
The bridge has to be at least 1,20 meters length 
The bridge has to surpass a 1 meter vain
The maximum length of the bridge is the length of the Popsicle sticks.
The bridge to support the most weight until breaking wins.

If I hook a vacuum gauge up directly to the pump, I get somewhere around 10^-2mbar. If I connect it at the end of all the tubing/valves/box, I read somewhere around 1mbar.

So my question is this: If I wait for hours and hours, will the vacuum in the box eventually go down to 10^-2mbar or not?

From what I can remember, when there's a fluid flow, any bend, valve, joint, etc will cause a pressure drop.  So under continuous flow, If I have pressure X going in at one end of my setup, I'll have pressure &lt; X at the outlet.
But this is for continuous flow, will it be different under vacuum? With enough time will most of the air molecules eventually wander their way to the pump? Or will the pressure gradient be big enough that they dont have any driving force to wander over to the pump? Are pressure drops under vacuum and continuous flow the same or different?

88,How high and heavy need a weight that is dropped over 24hrs be - to generate 20kWh per day?,1411539249,"My latest home energy bill has spurred me to ask this question! Apparently our ""Average Daily Usage"" for normal seasons is ""20kWh"". (And what does that mean anyway - 20kWh x 24hrs = 1 day total? or 20kWh over 24hrs equals 0.83kWh per hour?)

What's that equivalent to, in terms of gravitational potential energy? 

Imagine I have a block of iron weighing many tonnes placed at the top of a tower, and it fell slowly from top to bottom over 24hrs, generating power through gears/cogs attached to a generator. (Don't worry about how the block of iron gets to the top of the tower each day - that's not important. Imagine a Giant lifts it up). 

I'm trying to work out what's the equation to use to generate a ""daily average usage"" of ""20kwh"".

The equations I've found online so far are:

Potential Energy (PE) = m * g * h

E.g.  100000 * 9.8 * 20 = 19600000 Joules = 19.6 megajoules = 5.44... kilowatt hours

But does this mean a 100 tonne block has to fall in 1 hour to generate 5.44 kwH?

I also see the equation: power P in kilowatts (kW) is equal to the energy E in kilojoules (kJ), divided by the time period t in seconds (s).

But I'm not sure how to relate this formula to what I want!

In the winter, I belong to a club that does ""track days"" on a small indoor go kart course with 150cc or below dirt bikes with trail tires. Its non-competitive, but people like to show up with their own version of ridiculous, like bigger guys riding tiny 50cc kids bikes with big bore kits installed that make them quite fast, or guys on liquid cooled motorcross bikes that have twice the power that you need for the course, but they just like pulling wheelies down the straight. 

The majority of the people, me included, just ride the 100-150cc trail bikes which are air cooled, and include basic power mods like bigger carbs and aftermarket exhausts. 

So i was wondering what would I have to do to adapt a small turbo to the bike, granted that its carburated. Im not looking for huge power gains, or to blow my engine in the process, but I would like the bike to be significantly faster, and Im doing mostly for the ridiculousness factor. 

For a more specific question set, Im looking  for advice at solving the following challenges:

* Fueling: I know about accelerator pumps, I wouldn't know where to start in adapting one. Maybe building an FI system with a cheap micro controller and a battery would be easier? The bike has an e start and a battery, so powering it wouldn't be an issue. 

* Cooling: with low enough boost this may not be an issue, however I don't know how much an air cooled engine can take. Definitely would have to run higher octane gas to prevent knock though. Possibly run E85 for its cooling properties? 

* Waste gate, blow off valves. Do I need them or can I get away without them?

without a way of seeing the problem (which might be an UI bug? i'm using CentOS.) (the error occurs for all the parametric values.)

Tried also putting units after the parametric sweep values like 

    r {1[nm],2[nm],3[nm],4[nm]}

Edit: My model is time dependent and defined to run until non-convergence.

35,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice right now on a career path",1411321861,"I'm currently in my third year a ChemE Undergrad at a top 10 ChemE University (don't want to give too much info away) and have been actually doing fantastic at school (GPA 3.5+, VP of two organizations, Project lead on 2 projects) so far. Everything has been a ton of fun and I always enjoyed classes since I've always pictured myself working in design work on refineries or chemical plants or whatever out of school. Right now I have interviews with three different companies lined up and I'm almost certain I'll be offered from the top company I want to work with. Sounds awesome right?

Well, sort of. I just don't know if I want to go into private industry anymore. I'd be fine doing a job where I constantly moved around and had to face new struggles consistently; however, I'm worried that the industry I want to go into will cause me to go stagnant. I've always loved new challenges, the thought of sitting behind the same desk at the same company designing similar style plants for twenty years scares the heckfire out of me.

And thus, here comes to major issue. I was in a long distance relationship for just about three years, and that just ended a month ago. There is now nothing major holding me back from really going wild in my career path besides what my family expects of me. And thus, I am very seriously looking into going in the Naval Nuclear Propulsion field out of college. I suggested that when looking at colleges back three years ago and my family understandably said hell no. I'm basically the closest thing to a teddy bear you'll see in a human being: loving, caring, and overall overly optimistic. The Navy Life shouldn't be attractive at all to a guy like me. And yet, certain things like constantly having new challenges arise, being able to potentially lead several hundred people within a short six years, being able to experience other parts of the world (even from a healthy dozen miles offshore at two thousand feet underwater), and not worrying about money for a while sounds fantastic. I'll earn probably twice as much in my life if I go private, be able to have a happy loving family I can drive home to see every day, and stay in the same city for the rest of my life. Even still, that just doesn't appeal as much as the alternative right now.

37,CAD Data Management - Drowning in Spreadsheets and Databases!,1411314360,"I partially own a small wiring harness company in South Asia. We provide automotive wiring harnesses to local vehicle manufacturers.

We don't design any wiring harnesses, rather the customer approaches us with drawings and we make the wiring harness based on that particular drawing. So when it comes to CAD, we don't have any Design specific needs.

However, before we begin our work we first make a drawing ourselves. This shows various locations and is based on our terminology so everyone in the company can understand it. Our CAD software is a very basic - MacDraft, because it's just a basic 2D Drawing.

In the last 3-4 years, I've noticed that my employees spend a lot of their time in Excel and database software when making Bill of Materials. Most of it is copy-paste and is quite prone to errors and revision control is almost non-existent! Querying stuff like ""How much of Terminal XYZ is used?"" takes quite some time as they have to compile the data.

What software would you folks recommend for us? We're not a large company so most of the high end stuff is out of budget for us but I'm OK to spend $5k on a solution provided it's not cloud based (we have atrocious internet here.).

My requirements are simple: help my employees manage our product's data/bill-of-materials and have revision control for the product.

What I have envisioned:

There should be a central DB which has all parts/materials listed (server on a LAN). When making a drawing, the users picks those parts and places them in the drawing. If the part does not exist in the DB, it means it is Unidentified and we'll have to ask the customer or one of our suppliers to identify it later on. Meanwhile, the person doing the drawing can continue with their drawing while using a ""Unidentified"" part on the drawing. A Bill of Material of this drawing is generated once it's finished and the Unidentified parts (also listed) are then identified with some help.

Once parts are identified, the drawing is updated and so is the BoM. Is this sort of thing possible? My main goal is not the drawing/cad but rather the product's part/data/BoM management. If that can be done independent of the drawing, that's fine too.

The only way to figure it out is to be a math-magician or have an appropriate cattle scale to perform the movement on.

This is a picture of what the car deadlift apparatus usually looks like, but as these are typically custom made, the proportions can be all over the place.  I have posted on the picture what each section's length dimension s are at each length

* first length - 18.5"" / 46.99 cm

* second length - 14"" / 35.56 cm - The rear axel rests in the center of this section, precisely in the middle  (as seen in the picture)

* third length - 77.5"" / 196.85 cm - This length is actually adjustable and can be pulled out in 6"" / 15.24 cm increments to length the lever making the movement easier

The pull is made from 15"" / 38.1cm at the end of the third length


The weight in question today was 2400lbs / 1088.62 kg on the rear axle, wheelbase of 104"" / 264.16 cm

48,DIY Granular Solid (Cat Kibble) Dispensing Methods?,1411226758,"I'm in the process of building an automated cat feeder, and I'd like to include the feature of timed dispensing from a storage container into the feeding bowl(s).

I've seen a huge variety of dispenser mechanisms in 'how it's made' type production line videos, but have no personal experience with any, and can't really afford real ones anyway.

I'll lay out the requirements &amp; constraints first, followed by my current thoughts on possible designs. Any suggestions welcomed.

**Requirements**

* Store at least 2 days food (~150g/cat)

* Dispense to 2 separate bowls (or be simple enough for 2 parallel units, 1 per bowl)
* Dispense in 5-10g quantities

 * Individual dispensing error is less important than total daily error. (+/- 50% per portion is acceptable)
 * Total daily error (per cat) should be no more than +/- 10%
* Dispensed quantity (either daily total or individual) should be measurable for error correction/fault detection
* Cat-safe

 * No exposed wiring, mechanisms, etc.
 * Accessible/cleanable food contact surfaces
* Cat-proof
 * Violent frontal assault
 * Sneaky paw-up-tube
 * Chewing on protrusions

**Optional requirements**

* Bulk storage (1-2kg)
 * minimal atmospheric ingress to bulk food (to prevent staleness)
* Reliable unattended operation with remote monitoring/fault detection.
 * Fail-safe (overfeed) failure modes

**Constraints**

* Budget of approx 100-150GBP for (dual) dispensing system (i.e. can't really just get an existing industrial unit unless it's going cheap on ebay)
* Parts readily available in UK (no Mcmaster-Carr `:(`)
* Prototype-able with minimal machine-tools (although basic lathe &amp; drill-table might be available, along with hand woodworking tools)
* Simple Is Definitely Better

**Notes**

* Food is primarily 'Royal Canin' granulated kibbles, which are [roughly triangular](http://www.petsunleashed.com.au/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/60x60/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/r/o/royal-canin-indoor-cat-food-4kg-2_1.jpg) and about 10-12mm corner-corner.

* Loose packing volume is approx 100g/cup (dispensing volume is therefore ~1/10 - 1/16th of a cup) Included for visualisation purposes; dosing should be done by mass.

* Food granules have something of a tendency to interlock, and require quite a high shear force when, e.g. scooping into a cup. This can also lead to 'clots' clogging flow if trying to pour through a small enough opening (from experience, not yet quantified)

**Design Ideas**

The simplest ideas I can come up with mostly involve a gravity feed hopper, with some sort of flow interrupter. In the absolute simplest case, this mechanism would be completely duplicated per-bowl so no output redirection is needed.

The problem I forsee with this style is that the hopper opening needs to be quite wide to avoid clogging, which is going to lead to a very high flow rate when the interrupter/gate is opened. Additionally, trying to close the gate may require serious force to overcome the granule shear forces and move aside or crush any jammed granules that would prevent it from fully closing.

Possible gates would probably either be hinged flaps, or some sort of rotary 'hole/no-hole' disk. (subject to above note about problems re-closing) [**Edit**: a linear gate riding in grooved tracks might also work, but I think more prone to jamming than the hinge-flaps?]

Quantity control is something I have no good ideas about; IIRC industrial systems tend to dispense into a container or staging dispenser which can measure its own tared mass. I'd need a staging unit otherwise I'd have to measure weight directly from the feeding bowl itself, which is subject to all kinds of catty interference.

Perhaps something like [this design](https://imgur.com/1D9DFc0) [apologies for terrible diagramming], where [B] is capable of partial rotation around 2 pins which rest on sensors for a strain-gauge or scale.

So the gate at A opens and food trickles into the bucket B until correct amount, then A closes, and B is rotated to dump food down one of the chutes selected by C.
There might be some sort of baffle after the output to prevent reaching up from the output side to the mechanisms.

I'm hoping this can be primarily built (or at least prototyped) from plumbing parts, wood, and steppers or RC servos for the actuators. Sensing (apart from the load cell) would be either microswitch limit detection (or reed-relay/magnet) 

Control will be whatever MCU dev board I have lying around I can find a working programmer/compiler for, or a raspi/arduino if I'm desperate.

I've considered non-gravity fed designs using either a lifting screw or conveyor which would give much better control over the flow rate, but I think the complexity makes them undesirable unless entirely necessary.

**Questions**

* Are there any fatal flaws I haven't considered?
* What's the best option for a gating mechanism?
* Are there better ways to do any of the bits I've suggested?

50,Why do wireless point-to-multipoint systems tx/rx on the same frequency (half duplex),1411200079,"Instead of using all this silly CSMA/CA - rather than use a 10mhz band centered on (for example) 5850 mhz, wouldn't it make more sense to use say the lower 5mhz to transmit and a upper 5mhz to receive? Or alternatively use Vertical polarized transmit and Horizontal receive to keep the bandwidth the same.
It seems like that way all the transmitting client radios wouldn't cause possible interference with the AP/themselves due to reflections/etc. - and in my experience it seems most issues on ptmp are with the client transmitting back to the AP, if they had their own 'clear' channel for that it seems like many issues could be avoided altogether.

Is there some electronic/electromagnetic reason the antenna simply can't transmit on one and receive on another?
Obviously 802.11x are all set up the way they are, so it would need a new standard, but I've never seen even the commercial guys that don't rely on the 802.11 standards like Canopy Wireless do something like this.

The equation they apparently used is:


T = c D F

T = Torque required (inch pounds)


F = Bolt tension desired (Axial Load) (pounds)


D = Nominal bolt diameter. (major dia.)


c = friction constant

I understand GPS is not accurate to the cm, but will it be consistently (e.g.) 4m out over, say, 30 minutes, drifting as satellites move? Or does it tend to jump when a satellite becomes available?

I guess I just want to know if GPS can give me a consistent, relative position over ~30 minutes (I can reset the finish line position every 30 minutes).

60,How should I label my x-axis (thermodynamics)?,1411133715,"I work with engines. I need to produce graphs of various quantities (thrust, efficiency, etc) against fuel flow rate into the engine. 

Now, because I am comparing different fuels, my x-axis cannot simply be the fuel mass flow rate (kg/s). This is because different fuels have different enthalpies of combustion. So to produce a meaningful comparison, my x-axis is the fuel flow rate multiplied by the enthalpy of combustion of the fuel in question. This gives me a value in Watts. 

Now my question is: what should the axis label be? 

I could label the axis as *Heat input (W)*. But, not all of the fuel is burning, so this would be a misleading label. A more truthful label could be *Flowrate of chemical energy (W)*, but (1) this doesn’t sound all that great and (2) I’m not 100% sure that chemical energy and enthalpy of combustion are the same thing.

So here is what is going on and any input or opinions will be much appreciated.  So at the U of U. they make MSE and ECE very difficult and I have seen friends fail them or barely squeeze past them I figured I wanted to take ECE and MSE over the summer so I had plenty of time to make sure I understand the core classes.  The thing is, is that MSE and ECE are supposedly really easy at the community college and it is very easy to get good grades there.  My only concern is that I will not learn MSE and ECE as well there.  But I'm thinking it is alright because I don't think you use MSE and ECE in upper division courses.  So I was just wondering how much MSE and ECE you use in classes like Thermodynamics, Fluids, Heat Transfers, Element Design, Mechatronics, Manufacturing, or Strengths 2?

I heard you don't want to take Thermo or Dynamics and the community college because when you come back to the U of U you won't be prepared.  So I was wondering how much MSE and ECE is used later on.  Again I just wanted to make sure I took full advantage of learning/understanding my math and physics classes so that is why I broke it up like that.  And I don't know anyone else that is doing it like that so I'm a little nervous.  Do you guys think I made an alright decision splitting it up like that? thanks

Please verify that I did this correct, because an error in these three calculations might be the cause of my troubles for the calculations of the next values.

My next step consisted of finding I2, V2, and P2:

    I2=2V/6ohm=333.3mA
    V2=2V
    P2=2V-333.3mA=0.67W

This is where I stopped to think. Using KCL, there is no way I2 and I1 could be equal. Because I1=I2+I3, or, (I2+I3)-I1=0. Thus, I3 cannot be 0. This leads me to believe that either I1 or I2, or both are incorrect. Do you guys see where I am going wrong with my calculations?

F-35 Latest: Engine Fire Cause Emerges

&gt;[The three-stage IBR sits behind the front fan in the F135 and compresses the air before passing it into the high-pressure core. Each stage is separated by a stator and rotates within the casing, which is lined with an abradable strip to maintain tight clearances between the blade tips and the inner wall of the compressor casing. This enables tight tolerances while reducing pressure loss and some rubbing is acceptable. In the engine for AF-27, the blades were rubbing far in excess of the design, creating excessive heat and microcracking in the blades. The resulting high cycle fatigue failure forced the section to “come apart,” Bogdan says, prompting the fire June 23 at Eglin.](http://aviationweek.com/defense/f-35-latest-engine-fire-cause-emerges)

F-35 Head Bogdan Explains The F135 ‘Bad Rub’ Fix

&gt;["" Basically, the blades on the fan rub a spot on the engine cowl. The blades are expected to rub on the cowling and dig that trench. The problem is that the blades are getting hotter than expected. Bogdan said that the plane that blew up was damaged during two seconds of flight when the test pilot — operating well within the safety envelope of the plane’s abilities — put G forces, yaw and roll stresses on the plane all at the same time. The titanium blades heated to 1,900 degrees, as opposed to the normal 1,000 degrees, and began to crack. The fissures grew over time until, on June 23, when the pilot was taking the plane down the runway for takeoff, the fan blade “cracked,” Bogdan said. The circular part of the engine stretched out and shot through the left fuel tank. Fire resulted.

93,Drive shaft (automotive) vibrating only when under load?,1410953128,"My front wheel drive automatic transmission car started the weirdest behavior a week ago. It vibrates like a paint mixer above 40 mph, but only when on the throttle. Taking my foot off the gas makes the vibrations go down significantly, and putting the car in neutral makes them go away completely - smooth as glass. I suspected it was something with the engine or transmission because of this, which sucks. There was no check engine light though, which would be pretty unusual if it were an engine problem this severe. The engine revs fine in neutral and sounds normal, too. 

I took the car to my mechanic, who test drove it, and said ""I've seen this before and it's almost certainly a bent drive shaft"". That's good news in the sense that it's not an expensive repair, but I wasn't sure how that fit the symptoms. I figured if the vibrations came from a bent shaft, they'd  only be a function of deflection from straight and rpm, not load. I asked him and he responded 'it has to do with torque and harmonics"" but didn't go beyond that. 

My question is twofold. Is there an explanation of why a shaft would vibrate intensely when under torque, but not vibrate noticeably when unloaded, despite almost no change in rpm? Could this be due to other components (like the CV joint, which is part of the drive shaft assembly), or the suspension being less effective at dampening vibrations due to the load? If so, what's the ""explain it like I'm an engineering manager"" version of the physics involved? If not, any insights as to what could produce that sort of symptoms? Transmission maybe? I'll be out of town for a week and my mechanic will have my car the entire time, so I won't know first hand till next week...",AskEngineers,paracelsus23,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2gnfj5/drive_shaft_automotive_vibrating_only_when_under/
94,Motorcycle - dual discs in front. Why?,1410948688,"I recently started riding motorcycles.

I've noticed that larger displacement bikes tend to have two discs up front which brings me to the question of why. Unlike a car, braking on a motorcycle tends to be less effective given the need for the rider to balance, steer, and try to stay alive on top of braking, this further gives me more things to think about.

Here are some thoughts or anecdotes I read online on why, but I have thought of equally convincing why-nots as a response to them.

1. A motorcycle tends to have a higher centre of gravity, meaning that weight transfer is more pronounced compared to a car. This means the front:rear brake bias on a motorcycle is more front skewed. 

    **My** **thoughts**: Sure it does, but then squeeze a little too hard and you'll go over your bars. Also, I find it hard to think that weight transfer beats absolute mass. We're talking about two hundred KGs vs a minimum of 1,000KGs for a typical car.


2. More bite. 

    **My** **thoughts**: Even with my single disc I find going over the bars possible, what more with two discs?


3. Better heat distribution between two discs, since they are all so light and cannot retain much heat 

    **My** **thoughts**: The motorcycle discs are a lot more exposed to wind compared to a car's discs. Even if you factor in a potential bow wave (bonus question: does it?) leaving a low-pressure zone where the disc(s) and hub are, there is still a lot more wind than a typical car's wheelwell, which we will use a normal passenger car with no cooling ducts as a model. Do note that many non-sports bikes also do have dual discs up front.


4. It looks damn good, and its just a marketing thing.

    **My** **thoughts**: Try as I may, I really can't disagree with the first bit, as I want one too (See #2). I haven't ridden a dual-disc motorcycle.

I can't think of the dual discs acting as a redundant system since they run off the same hydraulic circuit, with a T-nipple connecting the lines from the lever and both calipers, and the only thing I can think of would be the ease of modulation on dual discs.

Sweeping the net doesn't seem to get me anything because its mainly forum talk.

Just wondering what others thoughts would be on an engineer with one specialized field of study, e.g. Bachelor in Chemical Engineering, then going back to do a diploma in Mechanical or Electrical engineering to diversify their technical knowledge and potentially move into other industries?

I know it's not equivalent to doing the bachelor, but it still involves getting the technical know-how. 

I think the benefits are that a diploma is much cheaper (10% of a bachelor here) and it helps make someone a jack of all trades which would be a good way to get the foot in the door.

1. Rotate about the centre of the circular plate (after grabbing the ball, it would be able to rotate the ball about the axis of the string).
2. Move the whole claw up and down (to approach the ball from underneath).
3. Open the claw (the claw will self close mechanically with pulling springs).

1. Worm drive. A motor turns the worm drive which the plate will be placed on.

3. Strings that run along the outside of the claw fingers, then have a motor somehow simultaneously pull all 3 strings downwards to open the claw.

44,Best practices for bolts clamping plastic parts in multicopters,1410682879,"I fly multicopters. A lot of frames use plastic arms made by a company called DJI. They look like this: 

http://i.imgur.com/zZrIEQB.jpg [1]

and are described as being made of ""PA66+30GF material"" i.e. glass filled nylon.

The motors are bolted onto the end of these arms using M3 cap head screws through 4 plain, moulded holes in the arm (i.e. not the end with the moulded inserts in the picture above). To be clear, the cap screws go through clearance holes in the plastic and  engage into aluminium threaded holes in the motor I.e the plastic is just clamped. 

So far I've seen a number of failures around this interface, namely:

1. Screws coming loose, so the entire motor comes free
2. Screws appearing to be sheared (i.e. the motor still has the remainder of the screw left)
3. The arm failing at the point where it becomes thinner, and on inspection there is a significant depression around where the cap head has been.

It's become apparent to me that this particular bolted interface is hard to get right. If the bolts are torqued high enough to stop them coming loose, the plastic part of the joint is deformed, reducing the preload, and then the bolts come loose (I believe this is called embedding). This deformation is also causing the arm to be weakened greatly.

My engineering handbook has the recommended torque for an M3 cap head screw at 2.48Nm. If I were to tighten these that hard, then the plastic would be greatly deformed, almost to the point of failure.

Through a process of trial and error, I have found a torque of ~0.75Nm results in very limited plastic deformation. Combined with the use of thread lock, these bolts seem to hold fine, but this is clearly a very limited sample set.

I remember from my days of being a marine engineer, most critical fasteners are tightened by number of turns rather than torque, as torque is only a proxy for preload.

So, my question is, what is the best practice for dealing with these bolts? Would it be best to tighten by number of turns and use thread lock? How much deformation of the plastic would be an acceptable amount?

Unfortunately, I can't change the design of the arms or use larger cap screws or washers as there is not enough space. ",AskEngineers,cybergibbons,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2gcsz3/best_practices_for_bolts_clamping_plastic_parts/

46,Bearing inner race keeps drifting out.. pics inside for diagnosis and solutions please!,1410658341,"Hello I have a meat flaking machine which has 2 bearings either side of a drum. When the machine is on the bearing inner race (the inner ring which between the roller bearings and the shaft) keeps moving axially off the shaft. This is causing it to touch the end plates which results in wear, excessive heat and sometimes smoke from this friction. 

Should the inner race be able to move like this? It seems a tight fit on the shaft and theres no way i can just pull it off with my hands. Would putting a shaft collar on either end sort this out? It would mean machining new end plates to accomodate the collars as there isn't enough width avaulable at the moment. On thing I am worried about is that I believe the drum is supposed to 'float' slightly when in use, the shaft collars would stop this but then on second thoughts, the shaft shouldn't move axially anyway, surely?

[PICS HERE](http://imgur.com/a/xBvWG)

UPDATE: I went back and managed to remove the bearing. Hiding behind that was another bearing! Unfortunately there is no data on that face of it except for the make which is SKF and the numbers 06 52. I don't know how much this helps.

I don't know what this bearing is for but it is almost impossible to get it out due to the way it has been put in. I can't see any damage to it. Question is replacing the first bearing. I can get a replacement but how do I stop the inner race from drifting out of the shaft?

To shift from one usage to the other I think about hydroelectric power and technically, I could use the 'free water' to generate 'free electricity'. So then my mind wanders further;

It states that; to determine the amount of hydroelectric power you can generate it is determined by the ""river flow"" and the ""distance the water falls - or travels"". Well, I have many different pipes in my house and this brings me to my ultimate question:

62,Basic questions on suitable metals for a product,1410543866,"Greetings all. If this is in the wrong sub my apologies ahead of time. I am a non-engineer with an idea for a stupidly basic product I think would benefit a niche (or at least me personally!). However I am having a little trouble figuring out what might be the best metal to use given the purpose it would serve. 

Essentially it would be a small concave dish used to soften hair wax/oil mixtures that are very firm at room temp. This process is traditionally done by hair dryer which I think is a massive pain. In my brain the dish would be heated by running it/submerging it under warm water. Once pulled out of the water (it would have some sort of rubber holder on the sides so you arent touching the metal) you would place a dollop of the hair product in the concave area and wait X amount of time until it is softened to your liking.

So in order for this to work I assume I need a metal that:

* Can absorb heat from the water well
* Can retain that heat for at least a couple minutes or longer
* Can deal with frequent interactions with water without rusting/etc..
* Not very expensive

    &gt;Conventional TENS has low intensity, just above threshold, with the current set between 10-30 mA

* How a TENS unit could be constructed. 

    &gt;The resources for this do include circuits. But I don't want to just grab someones circuit off a website and build off that.

I am also interested in understanding how to control the frequency within a circuit. Only resource I could find so far was [LC Circuits] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit#Applications)

86,for acoustic engineers and anyone who knows about ventilation: building a portable soundproof space,1410469354,"Just so you all know where I'm coming from, I'll soon be graduating with a bachelor's in computer science. 

I've recently started on a project to create a portable space that I can reliably and easily use to do anything that benefits from quiet: sleep, study, et cetera. Let's say for now that money is not a concern. My current constraints and preferences are: 
* must fit in a full-size van (with the back seats removed)
* must have interior dimensions of at least 2 ft * 2.5 ft * 6 ft 
* must have some way of getting in and out, obviously
* must have a ventilation system so that I can stay in it for at least 12 hours at a time
* must have some way of getting power inside, whether that means plopping in a big battery, or whatever
* must have an external smoke detector that can be heard clearly inside
* must minimize maintenance time and cost
** preferably runs everything on wall power
** preferably has no time limit on occupance
** [et cetera]
* must maximize soundproofiness, of course. Let's say that all audible frequencies are equally bad (correcting for differences in human sensitivity for different frequencies), and that the soundproof space will be sitting in a garage in a typical neighborhood. 

What I hope to learn from you guys is 
* important things to consider from an acoustic engineer's point of view
* estimates on the best I can do in terms of soundproofiness
* any discussion about design. I'm hoping I can sort of crowd-source this part of it. I think it would be awesome if we came up with something useful to many people, and had the design here on reddit for anyone to use.

87,(career advice?) If I trained as an electronic engineer- what would my job be like?,1410468378,"I'm currently intending to pursue a degree in electronic engineering, I enjoy electronics and programming, and designing things in general, so it seems like a good idea.

But I don't actually know what I'd be doing day to day, as an engineer, all the engineers I'v spoken to have been in very different fields, and were more along the lines of mechanics, or surveyors.

I like to think I'd be with other engineers, tasked with designing a thing, but I imagine there are many other tasks one could be assigned.

If anyone can tell me what sort of stuff I could expect working in the industry, I'd appreciate it.

89,Help with a cable flexure device,1410464735,"I'm an engineer that has recently taken a new position and need help with a demanding project my company is doing. We want to design a flexure device that bends a cable back and forth up to about 500,000 times. It will need to go up to 90 degrees in rotation both directions. One cycle would involve rotating left 90 degrees, stopping, rotating right 180 degrees, stopping rotation left 90 degrees.

My design idea is to use a stepper motor, but I'm having difficulty figuring out what value of torque I need to run this machine at 1cycle/second. The length of the rotating arm is 16inches and the weight is somewhere around 5 lbs. I think I calculated inertia correctly.

Currently the pipes are about 7-8 ft from ground level and are horizontal to the ground.  I would like to know how to calculate the arc that is created when these are draining rain water - as I would like to direct them down to make the arc less so that I am able to extend the sidewalk.  

I know that it is silly but if you could try to explain with examples and steps that would really help me so that I would be able to do it on my own for the various sizes.
