4,Failing at my internship and want to quit due to stress (ME),1592414427,"I am 2.5 weeks into my unpaid internship at this medium sized manufacturing company and I can't handle it. On day 2 they gave me this used up metal cap , which I had to take measures of, to recreate it in SW. Well today my supervisor came frustrated to me telling me I screwed up the distance between the drill holes and basically ruined the crude steel piece. So basically I just learned after 2 weeks that everything I do in SW as an intern will be manufactured without anyone checking it. I am really stressed RN and don't know what to do. Is it normal practice that companies proceed to give interns the task to build something for production on **DAY 2!?**  They said ""We have no time for reviewing your stuff since it would take the equal time used for creating it"". They don't even fill the title block which usually includes **Drawn**, **Checked, Approved** block. wtf?? Why am I as an intern getting full responsibility of my actions/work without any benefits of an actual worker?? They have only 2 engineers there and they have hardly any time to help me with my tasks and I am tired of asking about every single detail.

Honestly, I feel like I have been baited into this. It doesn't feel like learning or training and I am just there to do the ""dirty"" work for them since they are overbooked and don't care about training someone.

10,[Fiction] Help me make my modern pirates sound knowledgeable about their stolen boats?,1592407126,"Hi all! I’m a desert baby with almost no maritime knowledge, but I’m working on on a chapter that involves lots of boats. The short and sweet of it is that I’ve got a band of contemporary pirates with a small fleet of various stolen boats. It’s a soft fantasy/sci-fi setting, so I can hand wave away a few things but, like ... the laws of physics still apply. I’ve been doing a fair amount of my own research, but Google is only getting me so far. I’m looking for suggested resources (I’ve already been all over marineinsight.com) or answers to some of the questions below. Thanks so much for any advice you’re able to offer!

**Some questions:**

1. In my heart of hearts, I’d really like them to have snagged an empty oil tanker on its way to load back up ... but I’m not sure it’s feasible to possess something like that with any degree of safety, even if I claim they magically cleaned it. Can anyone tell me what cleaning and/or retiring oil tankers looks like? It looks like at least some of that labor is outsourced to poor countries, and it’s a pretty dirty and dangerous job. Are there mechanized processes for any of that?

2. If not a tanker, then I still want to give them a bulk carrier or a crate ship—something big. What kind of knowledge and experience is needed to captain something like that—not legally but to avoid tipping the thing over? (The folks managing it are all side characters, so they can be as knowledgeable as I need them to be.) How many people does it take to keep something like that operating safely? How much lodging for crew is typically on a big shipping freighter?

3. How easy is it to track boats on the open ocean? (Assuming my pirate gang has located and destroyed onboard tracking hardware.)

4. I know that with bulk carriers in particular, load shifting can be a hazard that can cause tipping. How much does crew movement and activity affect the balance and safety of the ship? (Thinking of fight scenes on the deck, for example.)

5. What would moving between boats look like? (Looks like underway replenishment of supplies is usually done with cables or helicopters, right?)

11,How do I match dielectric impedance to waveguide/microwaves?,1592406524,"Hello all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping you could help me out with a bit of a problem I am having. I'm a Biomedical Engineer (student) and have a good amount of experience with electric fields due to my research. However, I have been tasked with a new project involving microwaves, which I frankly know nothing about. I was hoping someone could clue me in on what to look for or point me in the right direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to do is maximize the wave transfer (maximum heat converge) from a waveguide to a dielectric rod (focusing lens). I have the material properties, specific dimensions, as well as the frequency of the microwaves. I do not however know where I should be starting or what equations I should be focusing on. I do have access to COMSOL, Python and MatLab, and know how to use all of them at an adept level.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a general idea maximum transfer heavily depends on geometry and the angle at which the microwaves intercept the dielectric and maybe something to do with Snell's Law. I should be looking only at the nearfield, reflection coefficient, and radiation pattern. I've looked at several papers/methods but all of them have some factor that isn't explicitly explained and is hard to infer as someone who isn't well versed on the topic. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you know anything about microwaves personally, or could point me to some literature that sounds like what I'm testing (maximum heat converge of microwaves to dielectric) I would appreciate it greatly.

13,How much can I differentiate my work as a stress and materials engineer?,1592402710,"*I just want to say that I'm not interested in civil engineering when I say structures/stress and materials engineering, but mechanical engineering and designing moving objects (see example at the bottom)*

Choosing structures and materials for my career is one of my considerations, but I'm very hesitant.

My wish is that my career lets me differentiate my work, because I believe that this is where i can create the most value. And that's why I'm also considering to choose 'Business strategic analyzises and systemdesign.' In a career like that, my success will depend on how I differentiate my strategies and designs.

**My question is, how much can I differentiate my work as a stress and materials engineer?** Because so far, the internet has made me very hesitant. According to them, stress and materials engineering is not much like. i.e. an engineer who works on the engine, because that engineer can improve the performance of an engine. Whereas in structure and materials engineering, you only have so many options, and it's almost always carbon or steel depending on budget

My best way of explaining it is as follows: I like watching F1 for the race between the engineers on each team; who can make the best car.

i am a student and was working on a uni project. i have to perform ""Energy conservation analysis of a recuperative air preheater"" and i have the air and flue gas data of a power station which dosent have said airpreheater.

i have gone through several papers  but i dont have a clear idea on what steps to perform. Do we just assume the dimensions (like dia, fin type thickness,etc) or from some manufacturer's and apply the heattransfer eqs on it.? or we have to first design and come up with these dimensions. i have come accross several papers that just put a design parameter table, and perform the calculations on it.

since the project is not a designing of air preheater but EnergySavingAnalysis so do we design it for the sake of our case study? or what? im sorta traped in this loop...

43,"""Artificially Softening"" FEA Results From Small Elements??",1592354949,"I keep going back and forth with a coworker on some FEA work I'm doing. We are comparing some different designs that involve different contacts and features. Basically I'm using an adaptive mesh until total strain energy is less than 2% change from last loop with relatively low stress errors. The actual measurement of interest is usually mesh converged several iterations before those other convergence criteria. One of the designs has more complex stress gradients from more/different contacts, so that design takes about 7 h-adaptive loops to converge, the other simpler design (less contacts essentially) only takes about 3-4 loops. My coworker doesn't agree with the results and says I'm ""artificially softening"" the results of the more complex design by having these smaller elements. This doesn't make any sense to me. One design has obviously more complex stress gradients to capture, it will require more refinement in those areas. As for ""artificially softening"", I don't even know what to say to that, that would seemingly contradict the whole idea of checking your results for mesh convergence in general and imply you're supposed to just know what size the elements should be to give ""correct"" results. He seems to want all the designs to have the same element size to compare them even though the boundary conditions are fundamentally different.

I'm not an FEA expert and my coworker has more FEA experience at a previous company but this just seems, well, wrong to me. I'm not really sure how or what to do here to get him on board with the results. Measured results would be the go to but that's not an option at the moment.",AskEngineers,False,truije15,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hagpc4/artificially_softening_fea_results_from_small/

First some background but scroll to end for tl;dr and questions.

Got a sales application engineering (hardware) position in my field straight out of my masters, worked 2 years as an electronics/controls tech after undergrad but not super applicable.

They're excited about me because my degree is specialized in their industry. I'm excited about them because in grad school and my tech role the technical work has been very isolating and I was looking to move to sales for more people oriented roles. I didn't expect to get straight in and not having to grind out a few more years of engineering unless I choose to (this company has a history of people moving between sales and engineering) is super exciting!

Pretty sure this position will mostly be what qualifies more as pre-sales engineering. I'm mostly being boots on the ground for region based sales reps, and making SOWs for engineering. But I did make it into the commission structure (although I was initially told this position was below that, think they were scared their salary offer was too low).

I'm pretty happy with the offer, and the interview process strongly implied that a couple people were already scoping me out for expanded duties or different roles within the company. I am looking to get up to speed and rove myself as rapidly as possible so that I can seize such opportunities.

Been listening to 'The First 90 Days' and did the little LinkedIn Sales Engineering course since I have premium already for job searching. Just saw the link to [https://wethesalesengineers.com](https://wethesalesengineers.com/blogs/) and will be checking it out as well.

I'm a  second year MEng at surrey with a very secure 2:1 and I'm wondering if the unviersity of surrey's modules are lacking in some way. 

When I compare the master's modules to other universities, it seems the choice and structure is quite different to other unis. 

The modules seem to me to be: 

Space (100% exam)

Glue (surface and interface, used to be called adhesive bonding)

Ceramics (used to be there)

Wind 

Sustainability (thermo indiguise?)

FEA (useful?)

Managment (mostly cwk)

Mechatronics (the one that seems the most useful) 

Unknown Design Projects

&amp;#x200B;

No dynamics, thermo or computer stuff that's not FEA? Hopefully that mechtronics module is good right? 

So essentially should I run? It's accredited ofcourse but I'm feeling paranoid that I might not leave uni with enough of the building blocks you'd expect from a mech grad.

We handle engineering prints (electrical). They need to go through three design phases each phase having four departments that must approve prints. So we have about 8 sign offs before prints are sent to the field and then 12 before they're placed as ""masters"" in our drawing database.

Right now we're trying to track all of this internal to each department using things like Excel databases and a form. That form is signed off physically by four groups and we never get a single form that has all the signatures on it.

I need some sort of (likely) web based application that can handle the process flows, electronic sign offs, and so on. For compliance reasons we also need the ability to query past projects etc... the general stuff you'd expect.

*I am not looking for any final answers since I acknowledge that “certainty” and individual circumstances vary extensively*. I am simply trying to be as objective as possible in my understanding. 

I was accepted as a MS student in engineering from a good school in my area with the school offering to pay my tuition for the first year out of the two. The offer is said to be competitive and am very lucky to have been awarded it since MS students typically are not provided support here. I am currently working and have saved enough for the first academic year at a top five aerospace company/ “a prime” for some living expenses. At some point, I plan to continue working part time (maybe take a leave of absence for the first semester since the award has a no working contingency for the first talks or do some random work anywhere - engineering or not) and use my companies educational assistance for the remaining year. 

I am leaning towards this direction since I am very eagerly wanting to leave my job so this would reduce my time here + the amount I would have to pay back + make me look more “appealing” to other companies + the time it takes to complete my MS due to reimbursement caps . (I am aware that a school’s prestige in itself won’t get me a job, but I do see some value in it.)

I guess some topics that have held me back is the value of a MS degree/ paying for it (if I am not able to balance my current job and school). 

\- even at my current job, I think a MS degree is a checkmark for advancing up although there is a large argument that this is the extent of it. I do however think that even more people are applying to schools so this trend will only grow during this period of time. I have been told indirectly by my managers that not having a higher degree will hold me back salary wise and the positions that are open to me.

&amp;#x200B;

* Potentially paying for a degree (even at a ‘reduced’ cost) when I see this being frowned apart I wonder if I am making the right decision 

&amp;#x200B;

* I really enjoyed school and this sole reason is what has led me here alone and the debt alone is what concerns me. I did turn down another program fully funded but it had more strings and I knew I did not want certain things from that, again thankful.

67,The AskEngineers Q2 thru Q4 2020 Salary Survey (Pandemic Edition),1592328315,"# Foreword

This was originally supposed to appear at the beginning of April, but for obvious reasons it didn't get posted on time. Now that some states / countries are beginning to lift restrictions and re-open, this *should* mean some companies are hiring again — but if [**this thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/h9ul4y/anyone_else_having_a_hard_time_finding_a_job_in/) is any indication, I suspect that most companies are still in a ""holding pattern"" for a variety of reasons, most notably due to potential second waves (and in some places, a continuation) of increasing Covid infections.

As with the original, the purpose of this thread is to provide engineering-specific data on salary and compensation / benefits so that others can cross-reference with other data sources like Glassdoor and Indeed. This is probably most useful for people who are weighing out job offers indifferent geographic locations due to the difference in COL.

Due to the pandemic, many of us including myself have been laid off or furloughed. As a bit of an economics nerd, I feel it's important to maintain a set of data that reflects what's really happening out there. Feel free to include any extra info about your situation as it relates to job searching and engineering.

In this edition of the salary thread I encourage everyone who's been laid off to reply with their compensation before going out of work, and if applicable what the compensation is at your new job. I'll be the first one to leave a comment (under the Aerospace category).

69,Safety question on a perhaps unusual application of a threaded rod,1592327464,"Howdy!

I'm not trying to get anyone to do my homework but the amount of time I've spent googling this leads me to believe it's something to which a knowledgeable person could point me in a good direction, at 1/10th the time it would take for me to stumble on it. 


I'm using a 3/8"" zinc plated threaded steel rod as an improvised dumbbell. It's 24"" long. The weights are 10"" long and one is located on each end. Each weight is about 20-25lbs. So the pivot point or area (if you'd call it that) is the 4"" unloaded section in the middle where my hand goes. 

I'm not an engineer so I'm having trouble deciphering which specifications (load, tensile strength?) I need to even utilize for a calculation or lookup I'm likewise not yet able to identify.


As I understand it tensile strength involves both ends being pulled from each other, so I'm not sure that number is all that I would need here, especially considering leverage and momentum is involved.


I doubt it's enough weight to break the rod, but the concerns I have is that it's a fair amount of leverage and nothing on home depot's website indicates any strength specifications of any kind. For what it's worth, it's [Model #: 802167
Sku #: 671118
Internet #: 204274007](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-3-8-in-16-tpi-x-24-in-Zinc-Plated-Threaded-Rod-802167/204274007)


My questions are the following:

- How can I find out if the rod is within a safe margin from failure? What specs and lookups/calculations are relevant for this situation?

- If this weight was enough to fail the rod, would that involve the rod bending, snapping, or both? 


For now, I won't be lifting it over any part of my body.

70,Is Abet Accreditation Critical for Biomedical Engineering and Should I Trust The University About It?,1592327340,"Hello, I'm currently really torn on joining my town's only biomedical engineering undergraduate degree. They have 9 engineering majors and only two of them aren't ABET-accredited, including Biomedical Engineering.

*Situation:*

I called to get more info on their accreditation status, and they said the ABET official came to visit by the end of 2019 (since their first Biomed graduating class was in 2019) and they seemed positive about future accreditation but because of the coronavirus everything has become delayed, still they told me they expect to have the ABET accreditation as soon as this is resolved. That it would VERY likely happen before I graduate, but they can't give me assurances nor a date, I'm inclined to believe them because almost all of their classic engineering degrees are accredited, but I don't know if gambling 4 years of my life and money is wise, but then again the chances of it going positively is high, but then again it's still a gamble. 

*Context:*

I want to get into med school (so pre-med route) but if that doesn't work out (a possibility) then I can at least work in the field of healthcare as an engineer/scientist, I'm interested specifically in working with neural engineering, nanorobotics, and nanofabrication with application in the medical field, maybe with an additional entrepreneurship route. And felt that joining my love of biology, medicine, human physiology, and engineering (through Biomedical Engineering) would be best in a motivational sense rather than going for a purely electrical or chemical route.

*Considerations:*  


* An online degree is not in the cards right now. 
* I have until the end of July to make a decision if I want to attend this fall.
* The school isn't a top school or anything but it's non-profit, generally accredited, polytechnic and very affordable.
* There really isn't any other choice distance-wise, they're the only university offering Biomedical Engineering within my travel limitations.
*  I'm not currently interested in pursuing any of the classical engineering paths (Electrical, Chemical, etc) as the main degree only as minors.
* I'm not in the position to study Biology with a minor in engineering, unfortunately, only Biology (stand-alone) or Biomedical Engineering with a minor in any of the classic engineering disciplines. I really don't want to be stuck with Biology as a major if Med School doesn't work out. Especially because I'd like to work as soon as possible in that case. And I know Biomed doesn't have the best job chances right now, but I feel lt beats out biology for sure.  


*Conclusion*:

I guess what I'm asking here is if the risk is worth it, if maybe pre-grad interships could make it less risky? or if i'm thinking way too much about it considering the recent emergence of the field. If there's another option I haven't thought of with the considerations in mind and If any Biomedical Engineer here can elaborate on their job chances with no accreditation or if it was critical. OR maybe if I should throw in the towel until I find better paths in the future

For context, I've been working with a field team as an RPR/inspector (with some occasional RFI/Submittals related work) for a civil engineering firm for the past year or so. This has been my first job out of college and overall it's been decently enjoyable and I've learned a LOT about construction.

I was recently asked by my manager what my thoughts were in terms of eventually taking the project management path, or the more technical path within our firm (something that will probably occur after this project is over in a year or two, maybe sooner if I'm lucky). I've done some googling and some reading up on the matter and I plan to ask more people within my company, but I would like to hear if you all have any input into what the work is like in each area, what might suit me, etc..   

Here's where I stand at the moment: I think I really like the idea of learning and developing my technical skills and eventually becoming a technical lead or something along those lines. I like the idea of being able to solve problems/make decisions/answer questions based on my knowledge/expertise. I feel like this would be a good way for me to exercise some managerial skills while still being involved in design.  

Bonus tangential question: Should I be pushing to be moved into our office environment sooner than this project's completion?

81,Lunar Rover Waterice Mining,1592318687,"Hi guys!

I have been trying to figure this out for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Please have a look at the image i have attached. [https://imgur.com/a/cv1j77f](https://imgur.com/a/cv1j77f)

The image is a 3d render of a lunar rover by TransAstra Corporation.

The rover heats the ice on the lunar surface turning it into watervapor,

it then cryotraps the watervapor and stores it in the blue tanks.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering how they do this / how you would do this? (cryotrapping and storing the watervapor)

&amp;#x200B;

\- The rover is operating in a vacuum so the water vapor wouldn't rise and i dont think a fan would work.

\- The rover is in a lunar crater without direct sunlight, meaning it would get really cold,

so what prevents the vapor from condensating on other components of the rover.

\- How would they move the waterice from the cryotrap to the storage tanks?

Or do the storage tanks also function as the cryotrap?

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone knows how this would work please let me know. I will try to respond to everyone.

I have a potentially stupid question.  


How does shock loading\* (a large force applied almost instantaneously) and static loading (slowly increasing the load) affect shear strength measurements?  


I'm wondering because climbing gear is most often tested using static loading, the cam or other piece of gear is placed in a machine that slowly pulls the piece apart. I find this slightly odd since In reality the gear is always shock loaded during a fall. Apparently(?) there isn't a huge difference between the strengths as manufacturers use static loading to rate the gear.  


I find the lack of a substantial difference to be slightly odd. I don't know much about material since but it feels like a material would behave differently under static and shock loading, primarily due to heat dissipation, propagation of cracks(?) and my intuition just tells me that materials would behave differently between shock loading and static loading.  


Climbing gear in particular is almost always made from aluminium, nylon or dynema. Is there a huge difference in how various materials behave under different loads?

offset from the geometric centre of the body by d = 0.15 m. The radius of gyration of the body about
its centre of mass is 0.18 m. The radius of the wheel is 0.25 m. In the initial position shown, the centre
of mass of the body is on the same horizontal level as the geometric centre of the original disk. The
body is released from rest, rotates through 90o

(a) Determine how long after impact it takes for the sphere to start to roll without slipping (the
coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the sphere and the surface are 0.25 and 0.2,
respectively and the coefficient of restitution between the wheel and the sphere is 0.5).
(b) If these are the same coefficients of friction between the wheel and the surface, is the

12,Debating a Master of Aerospace Engineering program as an Industrial and Systems Engineer undergrad - Looking for guidance,1592276207,"A bit of background on myself: I'm a rising senior at a Big Ten school studying Industrial and Systems Engineering. My first 3 semesters of college were in a program that was similar to Aerospace Eng. (Eng. Mechanics and Astronautics) because AE wasn't offered. For a few reasons, I decided to switch to IE - reasons listed at end. I have a Supply Chain internship at a large aerospace and defense technology company. This internship, along with the lots of time with my thoughts over the COVID-19 pandemic, has given me the chance to realize that the reasons I had for switching to IE were misguided - I could spend 500 words going on about all of this that but no need. 

So here's my question: **As an IE, which really doesn't have a huge emphasis in Physics and Math** (Intro Statics, Dynamics, E&amp;M, Multi-variable Calc, Linear Algebra)**, what would pursing a Masters in Aerospace Engineering look like? Is it even possible to be admitted into a decent program without being an ME or AE undergrad?** If I decide to pursue it, I would take Thermo, Mechanics of Materials, and maybe Fluids during my senior year. 

Reasons for leaving EMA: (1) It wasn't a true aerospace engineering program - far more theoretical and less hands on. No courses like turbulence, wing theory, boundary layer theory, etc. (2) I have pretty solid social skills (is an engineer allowed to make such a bold claim???) and I didn't want to ""waste"" them in a technical role, so I switched to a form of engineering I could better apply in a business environment - while I am better suited for Supply Chain and Ops roles, I've learned that I really don't want those roles. (3) I didn't feel like I would use the physics and math that I would learn in a more technical degree - misguided but also some level of truth to it. (4) Lastly, I would tell myself that there are people who are much better at the physics/math than me so ""I'll just go learn something I can apply by managing the engineers"" Yep, that was me just over a year ago :) 

""TLDR"" I get it, but please help me - I feel like I made a huge mistake switching majors and don't want to transfer or switch majors.",AskEngineers,False,gsmith212,/r/AskEngineers/comments/h9v42g/debating_a_master_of_aerospace_engineering/

The goals include to inform design, manage manufacturing costs, and provide a basis for a robust design (one where the performance is insensitive to manufacturing and assembly variation).

I don't want a pessimistic 100% tolerance stack since it will drive costs and be difficult to achieve amd may tell us incorrectly that we can't get the performance we need. 

I've done linear stack ups. But a complication is that the tolerance chain is 3D and will have various GD&amp;T feature controls, and includes a couple of tolerance loops rather than a simple linear stack. I expect to link features together either with vectors (a nominal part and an uncertainty part) or with 4x4 homogeneous matrix transformations, and if I had lots of time to set up a monte carlo to predict the variance in a component position and orientation. The difficulty at the moment is in establishing all the matrices that correspond to various GD&amp;T.

I am hoping for some software to aid in analysis. I found a pair of research papers called ""A computer aided tolerancing tool"" by Salomans, Poerink, Haalboom, Slooten, van Houten &amp; Kals (1996).

31,[Career] Please help me find a career path (EE Major),1592256744,"I recently graduated college and got my first ""engineering job"". It's at a government facility, which is important to say because during the interview process, I was given almost no information under the guise that they couldn't tell me until I got security clearance. Based on the facility, I assumed it would be a very hands-on, experiment-focused job- that almost couldn't be further from the truth.

Instead, I've found that it's almost entirely paperwork and documentation creation, with incredibly strict guidelines that we have to use and ridiculously tight verbiage that we can use in documentation.   Now, documentation might not sound that bad, but when you realize that most of these manuals are around 200 pages each, it definitely changes your perspective. 

Besides documentation, we're tasked with going through technical drawings dating back to the 60s, most of which reference half a dozen other drawings, and make sure that there aren't any mistakes in them or the manuals that guide users on them.

Now, to be fair, I should say that there is some lab work to be done. This mostly comes in the form of having to test certain procedures if any of the equipment is upgraded or retrofitted, or if a user finds an issue with our documentation and we need to see the device/wiring to correct the mistake and guide them. However, I've been told that the engineers rarely use the lab, with the more senior ones never going in at all. Even my mentor, who said he tries to get in there as much as he can, says he probably spends only 25% of his time in there, and hasn't spent a day in the last 4 years not working on documentation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get that this may be a good fit for some people, but I've always told myself I didn't want to become another desk/office drone (no offense, it just feels that way to be), and this is like my worst work-related nightmare. Along with this, I've had basically zero supervisor direction, despite me having only started three weeks ago and have no clue that I'm supposed to be working on.

&amp;#x200B;

My only other engineering position was an internship I did two years ago at an engineering consultation firm, which had me working on floorplans and schematics for lighting and electrical systems for building constructions and renovations. That was also a desk job, with the occasional site visit to get information on the existing systems. They also had a very interesting work environment (read: getting drunk and going to strip clubs with vendors), which I really wasn't comfortable with.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides those two jobs, I've worked at a Help Desk as my time as a student, and held a full time position there for a little under a year after graduating, before leaving due to very high tensions between me and my manager and a generally hostile work environment. I actually enjoyed this job a lot, but I knew it couldn't be a career- at least not where I was. It was a bit slow at time, but the lack of direct supervision in my office (it was just me and the other student workers) meant we could goof off or do other activities when there was nothing else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

In my spare time, I really really love trying to repair broken electronics or creating new ones for projects I think of. I don't get to do it too much due to limited funds, but that's what I always thought being an electrical engineer really was. Besides that, I've been getting a lot into server/homelab stuff recently, getting comfortable with Linux GUI/CLI, setting up a Plex server and associated services, and pihole. I've been wanting to dabble in networking, probably following a free CCNA course, and have a few rackmount switches and routers at my disposal to learn with. I know that this end of things would have me doing more ""desk-job"" type stuff, but at least it would save me from the endless paperwork I currently have waiting for me.

40,How would you design a temperature screening process within these limitations?,1592244700,"Hey all, 

I'm an intern at a manufacturing plant, and I was hoping the process engineers / excel wizards among us could give me a hand improving our employee temperature screening system. We're running a bit of a skeleton crew here at the moment, so any advice would be welcome!

**Current State**

When an employee is entering/leaving for the day, they wait in a socially distant line to have their temperature checked.

The employee steps into a booth which uses Seek Thermal's Seek Scan system to detect temperature. The temperature is displayed on the screen.

The employee steps out of the booth, tells the employee working the booth their employee ID#, and leaves.

The employee working the booth records employee ID#, time, and temperature (per the display) manually.

The Seek Scan software logs data (including time and temp) to a log CSV file. An entry is logged every time a temperature is measured, and each day has one CSV with all of its data.

**Desired State**

The employee scans their Employee ID (ours have barcodes and RFID, either could work but RFID would be preferred) at some point before/during/after their temperature is measured, and the Employee ID# is logged *with* the rest of the data for that particular measurement.

*The ideal output would be an excel file which contains the exact information output to the log CSV, with an additional column containing the employee ID of whoever the temperature reading was of.*

**Additional Considerations/Information**

I'm mostly having trouble with two parts of this issue: How to ""combine"" a log CSV with whatever format we log EID#s in, and how to associate the ID scan's timestamp with its automatically logged Seek Scan timestamp.

The nature of the log CSV file and software dictate that the program can not log data if the CSV is currently opened.

I'd expect there are instances where an employee measures their temperature twice by accident, and ID scanners would likely have the same issue.

I've thought about assuming values within, say, 10 seconds ought to be linked, but I'm not confident in the consistency of this option.

46,how to avoid duplicating quality standards?,1592239772,"I've been tasked with updating my company's purchasing quality standards document, and all the interested parties seem a bit at-odds over what this document is supposed to be. I'm trying to figure out how to make a cosmetic standard for our company without simply reproducing industry-accepted standards that we already call out in the document. 

Our quality people would benefit from having a visual reference of what is okay and what isn't, but if I compile a list of examples, they will inevitably be duplicating some external standard, and we'll have to keep up on maintaining our records to not cause any conflicts. 

One thought I had was to make it very clear that external standards are a higher standard than the cosmetic issues I detail in my document, so that if there's a conflict, it's clear which rule to follow. The problem with handling it that way is that the visual reference that I put together won't be technically up to our requirements, since if an inspector says a part is good based on what they see in my document, the part might still be bad according to the external standard, and we should have rejected it. At that point, inspectors need to know the external standards in addition to ours, and there's no point in me making my own standard.

47,Do you think being specialized in a specific area hurts you if you are younger/recent college grad? And wanting to continue in that field or even trying a new field of work.,1592238635,"Background:

I graduated in ME last year. I worked in biotech (specifically, IVD and medical devices) for 7 months after graduating before being laid off recently. During my undergrad, I did a co-op program and gained over 2 years of full-time engineering experience in microfluidics and designing lab-on-a-chip devices. I enjoyed my work and would like to continue to work in any areas of biotech.

Problem:

When I was looking for full-time jobs for post college, I noticed all of the microfluidics/IVD device related engineering positions wanted 5-7+ years of experience and/or higher degrees. And there aren't too many jobs to begin with. How do I even get my foot in the door?

I'm currently looking for jobs, and really in any field. But I feel like recruiters would immediately look at someone else who has more experience in that field, even if its the smallest bit of experience. Or if I do get an interview or in a cover letter and I try to explain why I want to work there; is it too cheesy to say, I just really enjoy engineering and am interested in learning/working with xyz. Which is totally true, and probably like many of you. 

When I apply for jobs where I don't meet the experience requirement, I try to explain how the company could view me as an investment because I am eager to learn either a new skill or expand on my current skill set. Any job search tips?

64,Design Engineers - How do you organize complex and constantly changing designs? Poorly organized drawing office needs help!,1592215954,"For context, I work for a small family engineering company that manufactures machinery for the printing industry. As a small company there are just 4 people that work in the design office, whose responsibilities include all design, drafting and checking. I'm the most junior member of the team, but I am part of the family that runs the company and I really need your help understanding the best management practices for a drawing office.

For a small company, we manufacture quite a large range of printing machinery, as an added layer of difficulty, each machine can be built in multiple different widths (typically 4 different widths). The widths may affect certain parts, for example; a wider machine may require larger motors and gearboxes compared to the smaller width machines. The components between the plates may also be a different thickness/diameter to accommodate for the extended length. (Basically, there is a lot of variability)

It is difficult to create a 'standard' machine template because of all the variability and because each customer wants something different. We tried to get around this by creating lots of different templates for the machines we have, 1 for each different width, with most of the standard equipment on. But this is still a headache as things change very quickly, and its not so easy to keep these templates up to date. This is not only frustrating and slow to work with, but it also means it is easy to forget things - we often end up with wrong parts being made, or some assemblies not on the BOM that should be there.

We use a PDM system and Solidworks as a CAD package. I'm aware of configurations and design tables but these seem to cause horrifically slow assemblies, confused machinists who aren't happy with multiple size parts on 1 drawing and a host of other issues.

I would really appreciate any advice/guidance from some experienced design engineers who work with similar designs and a well-structured system. I'm aware many of the problems we have are self-inflicted with poor management decisions and our small team - Regardless, the number of options is maddening and I want to know if there any any design principles/improvements we can make to make this more manageable.

I decided to return to school for a second Bachelor's degree in Engineering. My undergrad degree was in English 20 years and has done zilch for me aside from overseas teaching experiences in China and Japan. I took it upon myself to try technical writing and freelanced at that for a few years. I actually come to really enjoy that, but my contracts/options were limited to not having a wide amount of scientific/electrical/mechanical knowledge. I definitely have the design skills to create awesome manuals, but I also was over my head in a few areas that required far more technical aptitude than my creative writing background was accustomed to.

So while I am out of work, I decided the time was right to pursue engineering. While offering far more career options, I am also confient I can still utilize my strengths as a writer and work as a full-blown technical writer amongst a vast number of areas in the technical sector.

Because I want the technical writing to complement whatever engineering field I choose, are there any recommendations on which branch to study that works  well with that? My branch of choice is where I am a bit uncertain, and, considering that the first year will be primarily getting my math and science up to speed, I do have a bit of time to decide; however, by year 2, the branches veer off into different directions somewhat, so I don't want to get off track.

I also want to pick a branch that interests me---as a technical writer, I have written computer hardware user guides, ceiling fan  setup instructions, bicycle owner manuals, and online help instructions for software troubleshooting. The work experience is helpful, but in the technical writing field, any decent job requires a technical degree, not an English one.

I've been looking into getting a 3D printer and working on a more involved project at home as a good skill builder and resume addition. The project would ideally:

* Involve mechanical design and some level of electrical design
* Involve coding, w/ either an Arduino or Raspberry Pi
* Involve some level of analysis/engineering behind it (FEA preferred)
* Be something that's interesting to someone reading a resume

The alternative was a 3-axis camera star tracker that tracks a position in the sky for long exposure astronomy photos.

When it is locked and you push on the blade the end where the riving knife is flexes few milimeters which is not great. What do you think about adding trunnions on the bottom(when standing in normal orientation)?
I will be making new case for it so I can do what I want around it.

How do you decide  from which manufacturer to choose  it, since :

When buying do you check the specs sheet, lets pick something easy, the motor power, more is always good, so higher the kW the better, but how do you know is it efficient the same as the competition, or is higher wattage because they loaded it more and runs hotter thus burns up  faster if it were to really ran at that power demand.  
Do you compare casting quality with hopes it reflects overall quality, machining tolerances, or surface finish? Isnt that the same as car guys measuring panel gaps?  
Do you hope to take an internal peek if a name brand bearings are used or some cheapo? (cant do that most of the time)  
Do you compare raw weight to evaluate which machine is more rigid?   


Honestly, i am lost as to what to do.

40,Why are there so few online resources on mechanical engeneering compared to other disciplines?,1592095482,"So here is the thing, I'm interested in learning a bit of mechanical manufacturing and engineering.

Having been a self taught systems administrator and software developer all my (short) life, I have grown used to be perfectly able to learn anything from abstract stuff like math or physics to applied stuff like electronics,Medicine,Biology ,database administration  or computer science just looking up full courses on youtube, udemy, edx or any of the many resources laying around, today they are even more plentiful than ever before.

But when it comes to mechanical engineering, it feels like it's some kind of dark arcane art, there are some disorganized resources and videos laying around but I cant find those elegantly put together , nicely recorded, well scripted courses like I do in any other discipline. For the first time in my life I'm in a position where my best resources on a topic seem to be books! (and pretty old ones, one of the best I got is from the 70s)

Just to put my most recent example, I have found quite a few courses on youtube and udemy on how to model sheet metal objects in solidworks. However finding a nice fat course about sheet metal fabrication and design itself it's a nightmare (k factor? bend allowance? designing enclousures? punching and bending operations? materials?), there are just a few really expensive courses on really specific websites and that's it!.

As an incoming high school senior I have decided that I want to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering.

I’ve been doing research of my own and have a few specific questions I would like to ask as well:

1. Is it difficult for new engineers to get jobs right out of school? 

2. I heard some companies pay for their employees to go back to school to get their masters degrees. Is it better to get your bachelors, get a job, then go back to get your masters or to get your masters before you start a job?

3. Is the work environment stressful?

I can't help but dream about converting our 1978 overbuilt, ""bulletproof"" fiberglass hull to be an electric beastie.  I see that Tesla Model 3 motors can be salvaged for a little over 1k usd now, and wonder... is it insane to try to fit it in our boat? Would some sort of limiters be required? Even with limiters, would the torque just rip through any mounts I could fabricate to be bonded to a fiberglass hull?  Why has no one does this yet?  Cost?  Or is it mathematically impossible?  Or just WILDLY inefficient?

I've only found one or two builds with Tesla batteries, but no one seems to be messing with the motors (and this seems backwards from a marine environment reliability standpoint... to my idiot brain lol).

91,I need advice on how to begin my engineering career.,1592026863,"Hello all!

To give you some background, I am 21 years old and I have an associates industrial technology degree from my local community College which I was told I could use to transfer to a university and use as a true 2+2 degree plan in order to get my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering. My professor that had given me this information was apparently working on that possibility when he left for another job, however he provided us with the misinformation that it was already avaliable for us to use.

 Due to the unfortunate events, worries over money, and not being entirely sure of how I wanted my life to look, I did not continue/restart my education in hopes of getting a bachelors yet. 

Currently I am working a relatively demanding job on 12 hour shifts on nights. My goal (long term) is to start my own company with hopes of eventually (long down the road I'm sure) contracting for the police or military in hopes to make jobs safer for them and civilians. Shorter term, I would like to create preferably mechanical products that can help and satisfy the needs of anybody I can. 

My issue is that going back to school puts me in a sticky situation with money as I would not be able to continue working my demanding full time job while completing a demanding course load and degree. However I have also done a little research and see that its difficult to start out as an engineer without a degree, especially when you live in a small town like mine.

I'm a current highschool student wanting to become an aeronautical engineer, and I have a few questions regarding how I should approach it. Here's my plan at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

* Bachelor's of science (with an additional year of honors) majoring in mechenical systems in Melbourne University
* Internship during and after the degree for some experience in the field and to save up for masters
* Masters degree overseas somewhere (ideally a 1-2 year master, currently considering Imperial, which has a 1 year course).

My questions:

1. Should I go straight from bachelor's to master's or should I have a few years of internship in between?
2. Where should I go for masters? Like I said before I'm aiming for imperial due to its reputation and the 1 year course, but with Brexit I'm not too sure how UK is gonna be in 4 years or so. I'm also not really considering US until Trump is well over and US settles down. So what are some english-teaching unis in the EU that you guys recommend?

7,How is the mechanical engineering outlook compared to staying the military?,1592003291,"I'm currently enlisted as a language analyst. It's a desk-job that is rarely demanding. My work-center is chill (before the pandemic I was honestly working less than 40 hour weeks) and generally people in my career field don't PCS, or even deploy, so I could easily just buy a house and settle here. My salary right now is equivalent to a civilian making around $55k and will likely go up another $15-20k in the next 5-7 years. (I get nearly 5k more than the average enlisted just for speaking Spanish).

However, the whole reason I joined was to finish my degree. That was always the plan. I'm trying my best to attend late afternoon and night classes, but I'm slowly realizing that I won't be able to finish while active duty because most of the upper level classes are only offered in the morning. Additionally, my job, while it has given me an opportunity to lead, has provided no relevant technical experience. Internships are not an option while I'm active duty, so I feel I'll actually be less impressive to an employer than the average recent grad who has more internship experience.

So here's the deal guys. I can separate from the Air Force when my contract is up and finish my degree with the GI bill (I will probably only have two semesters remaining at that point), and maybe squeeze in an internship in the summer and then try to get an entry level job. **If I did this, would I take a significant pay cut or a workload increase? How about job stability/security? Would it really just be better to stay enlisted and make a steady $70k for doing practically nothing?**

I'm currently working to get into one of those enlisted-to-officer degree programs, and of course that would trump both options, but those programs are super selective.

I think I'm answering my own question, but I'd really just like to hear some of your thoughts, advice, and experiences. Thanks.

29,How did our engineer justify the claim that moment does not develop at the base of this post? (detail included),1591983101,"I'm a detailer at a stair manufacturer. All of our engineering is done by outside consultants, so we (detailers) don't have much direct contact with them. 

About half the time, the engineer of record asks us to include reactions at our connection points on the drawings. These are always simple gravity dead and live loads that never include a moment, even when we are doing something like using a knife plate to hang from a beam eccentric to the center line. Well on a recent job, they asked why there would be no moment reaction particularly at the base of our landing posts. Our engineer's response was that it is modeled as a pinned connection and so transfers no moment. 

This is the detail in question: [https://i.imgur.com/3Xx1dUi.png](https://i.imgur.com/3Xx1dUi.png) 

An HSS post is welded to a base plate, which is welded to an embed.

33,Best graduate degrees for working in renewables?,1591980157,"Hi folks, I just graduated with my BS in Civil and Environmental Engineering.  I love this field and I plan to get to work (as soon as COVID lets me...but I digress) on sustainable infrastructure projects, notably green stormwater infrastructure among a few other interests.  

  
However, I have a good dilemma with the field of sustainable engineering - so much of it interests me.  With the job market being immensely more difficult than any engineer would anticipate post-grad where I live (Philly), I've thought a lot more about grad school a lot sooner than I normally would've.  One field I'm curious about is renewable energy (especially hydroelectric and geothermal).  I would love to work on these types of projects, but I feel as though my Civ/Envi BS didn't cover enough of this material for me to get a solid start without more school; I imagine most of you would agree.

  
So, my question:  **what postgrad degree would help me the most to get into this field and working on these kinds of projects, specifically as a supplement to my Civil degree?** (AKA, minding that I haven't taken a lot of key electrical classes most grad students going into these programs would've - I imagine I may have to beforehand.)  Would I need a more broad electrical engineering Master's degree, perhaps mechanical?  Or would a more focused degree like one in Renewable Energy Engineering be best?  Are there certain degrees with a focus in general ""Sustainable Engineering"" that would be *worth* getting, as they tie these two disciplines together in a technical enough way?

  
As I mentioned, I'd ideally like this as a ""supplement"" to my civil degree - as of my current experience, I don't see myself completely pivoting from civil-environmental projects, so I'd like a postgrad degree focused on renewables not to be the nail in my civil-focused career coffin.  Can't imagine that'd ever be the case, but I'm sure some of you know better than me.

34,Buoyancy and pressure at 15g,1591975734,"So I was just trying to think of how simple of a rocket I could construct to launch one large human and minimal life support to about LEO before returning immediately in a controlled descent. Like a human sized version of a model rocket with one small window. Just enough to send up a flat earther, or myself who would otherwise never be able to go. 

Other major technical rocked related considerations aside I was thinking about how it's obviously easiest to launch a human in the vertical orientation. Basically standing in a tube. The problem of dealing with the major G forces when standing seemed obvious and insurmountable. But just as soon as I thought about how some kind of leg compression suit like pilots use would be too technical and insufficient to the task, and some suspension harness to hold the person upright too hard to distribute across multiple points, an equally simple and obvious answer came to me. 

If you can't tell from how I spend my free time, I'm not yet an actual engineer so I need some help trouble shooting this intuition. As a former commercial diver the effect of buoyancy immediately came to mind. Imagine if the person was launched submerged in water. Lots of extra weight, I know, but we'll just strip out more safety equipment to make up for it.  My question is, since a human is mostly water and close to neutral bouyancy, and bouyancy is just the effect of a fluid trying to find equilibrium under what is essentially acceleration, would being submerged in water while under several Gs of acceleration not counteract near perfectly the effect the blood pooling in the legs and hold the person floating upright? Being in water compressed to 6 atmospheres absolute, or what I figure whater at 5 Gs would be, is a regular occurrence in my previous field and more is possible in most cases. Record for repeated momentary pressurization is about 36 atmospheres, does that mean a person could theoretically do 36G if submerged in water?

If not what am I missing? As stated, I am a professional when it comes to earth bound deep water and pressure, so assume I'm correct about what the body can survive there. What, if any, is the difference between deeper water and water in which you are rapidly accelerating?

Found something after all: https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/liquid_ventilation/

They were having trouble with figuring a way around the lungs collapsing, but we do this in the real world with a regulator, which is also a simple device that responds proportionally to surrounding pressure. So up until our limits of mixed gas on a regulator it looks like my idea works. Those limits are 30+ Gs for some individuals.

I realized for myself that no matter what kind of ECE research I’d be getting into, I’ll probably be content with it as long as I’m in a lab with people who care, are structured, and pleasure to work with. It’s what I learned for myself with undergrad lab experiences.

The 3/4"" copper has a higher flow rate and a shorter line.

The 1/2"" copper has slower flow rate, longer line.

My hypothesis is the 3/4"" would be a more circulated but slower rise in temp and the 1/2"" would be slower flow and hotter.

I'm trained as a Aviation Maintenance Technician (A&amp;P cert), put myself through school as a conventional machinist, started doing tooling design and some machine maintenance after school before becoming a proper field service technician. I eventually talked my way into a planning role at a bigger machine shop in my state with my misc. machining and CAD experience. And I currently work as a ""Manufacturing Engineer"" with a small company. I get to design processes to improve production throughput, I do deal with a small amount of statistics, and so far I've made the case to buy one bigger machine that has helped the company, and I'm working on the case for 2 more.

I put the title in air quotes though because I really do have zero classical training for a role like this. I'm no idiot, and I have a really well rounded manufacturing background behind me at this point, but I feel like I'm a fish out of water. I know I do good work for my company and fill weird pockets they need filled, and I'd have a fantastic reference from them if I went somewhere else. But working for a small company, I end up wearing so many hats that I don't feel my work experience is true to the Job title. I want to have a deeper understanding of what I'm doing. That, and looking at Glassdoor, it's really demoralizing seeing I'm off the low end of the scale for what people with this title get paid in my state. I know I have no schooling, but I've met and known a lot of people who came out of university with engineering degrees that are actually useless. I have a hard time believing I'm the worst manufacturing engineer in the state.

21,Is it a mistake to take a technician job?,1591879861,"Hey guys,

Graduated with my EE degree this past winter with a robotics minor. For the past four months I’ve been working at an architectural MEP firm designing electrical systems for buildings, and I’m already very over it. My job mostly consists of quietly toiling away on CAD for a finished project I’ll either never see, or is just adding a new set of classrooms to an elementary school. When not doing that, I’m struggling to keep up with a learning curve because despite my efforts, I’m just so disinterested in the work. I looked for a new job, but where I live is far from being considered an “engineering hotspot” so I’m thinking of moving to Atlanta in the next 2 years. I have experience doing PCB design and robotics work. I love to tinker and make projects from the ground up, so I was thinking of finding a job at a prototyping firm, or somewhere that does product design, and even toyed with the idea of wanting to do technical set design for TV in Atlanta. I wanted to do robotics work when I graduated, but when I look at online job postings, even the more traditional EE roles just sound like my current job with a new field overlaid over it. They all just sound like quiet desk work where I’m forced to learn some new program I don’t give a shit about.

Yesterday I was offered a job as a luxury home automation technician. The owner is an EE, and so is my potential new supervisor. The work sounds fun, social, and physical. Lots of cutting edge tech to play with. I have ideas on bringing new VR/gaming packages to their entertainment system catalogs bc I love pc building and new tech. My only concerns are:

1) it’s hourly pay. He’s calling this week to negotiate the exact rate. I never expected to go back to hourly after college so idk what to think just yet. Very real possibility they offer less than I make now, which I shouldn’t take given student loans about to come up, car payments, etc.
2) my dream is to be a family man w/ 3 kids and a nice home, providing for a family of 5 with the comfort I want requires high earning potential. Still want to move out of my region in the next 2 years regardless. 
3) am I limiting myself for the future? Will I be less likely to get better jobs later on bc I “stepped down” from engineering to technician? I miss out on personal company growth because it’s a small company so idk how much I can climb. 

Thoughts?? 
Thanks in advance

34,Which options do I have for measuring circumferences of big cylindric steel pipes which are not perfectly round?,1591860379,"Hey engineers of reddit,

I need to measure the circumference of cylindric shaped pipes which are not perfectly round. Diameters can vary between 3 meter and 11 meter. It has to be a digital measurement and not by hand. The accuracy should be ±1,5 mm.

I already tried using an incremental and absolute encoder with no luck. I placed the encoder with a wheel on the axis on the steel pipe. It is possible to turn the pipe around its axis and therefore the wheel of the encoder turns swell. With counting the pulses and knowing the circumference of the wheel I can calculate the circumference of the pipe. The outside of the wheel is made of hard rubber so it doesn't slip. The error I get at a pipe of 5 meter in diameter gets factored out by some kind of value to get the ""real"" value, if I don't do this the measured value will be 77 millimeters off. When I use this factor on a bigger diameter the ""real"" value is way off.

If I calculate the percentages which the measured pulses are off of the needed pulses to get the theoretical circumference they vary 0,005% off each other but its enough to create a fault of 10 millimeters.

I red something about a 3 or 5 point measuring method using lasers but in theorie the cylinder has the be perfectly round. The material the cylinder is made of is from a flat steel plate which also vary in thickness by ±2 mm.

-My manager has a passive aggressive way of making me feel guilty for missing any work (sick leave, vacation). I feel a silent expectation that for every 8 hours vacation, I should backfill those 8 hours in the previous or following days surrounding the vacation/illness. On one hand I get it, things need to get done but admittedly any time I am sick or take vacation I feel guilt for not working.

-Manager told me to hire a nanny to take my kids to and from daycare daily, and be on call to watch kids any time they're sick so I wouldn't have to occasionally leave before 5PM or ever work from home to tend to sick kids. This is in response to me using 15 of my 120 sick/dependent care hours so far this year when my kid has been sick. Haven't taken a sick hour since, due to her threat to ""do something about the situation"" if  I used any more leave to tend to sick kids. My wife now does all of that now, even though she works full-time as well. Mind you, this is in peak COVID precaution time. Are sick and dependent care hours not to be used?

-Was told that use of sick and dependent care hours increases chance of being let go in any down turn. Not sure of this was a deterrent to keep me from using hours. If true, it doesn't seem fair, but I guess they have to decide who to let go somehow.

-Im an EE, my manager was a manufacturing engineer who hasn't had a technical engineering position in 20+ years. Finding it hard to relate, communicate, or develop technically. Hard to communicate my professional interests when my manager doesn't know what a diode is.

-Regularly work into wee hours of the morning to get things done.

Yet I get scolded for billing too many hours or taking too long. (I'm not the smartest or the fastest yet, alot of things are still new at this stage in my career, but I work hard, have an MS degree, and am generally competent)

-Department meetings and personal development meetings exclusively cover project status reports. Very little, and really no meaningful development material or mentorship. Meetings are often cancelled so we can have an extra hour of work.

53,Should I continue working in U.S. with unforeseen future?,1591838175,"I'm a transportation engineer working for a private consulting firm. I graduated in March 2019 as an international student.  My current company sponsors work visa, but since it's a lottery system, the chance of me getting it, is only roughly 23%. If I don't get selected by next year, I have to leave U.S. or go to grad school so that I could stay in U.S. 

I had an interview with our state DOT last week, got a conditional job offer today, and they later told me I couldn't even accept the job offer since they don't participate in the federal E-Verify system, which is mandatory for non-U.S. citizens like me. With more and more restrictions on working in U.S. as a non-U.S. citizen, I feel really hopeless right now. I don't know how long can I continue working in this country until I get kicked out. I'm qualified for a position, I applied this job in the middle of pandemic and I'm still managed to get it! But I had to reject the offer because of my immigration status. I will get my P.E. next year after I take the survey and seismic portion (CA requirement), but that doesn't mean shit since companies will turn me away after they realize I need visa sponsorship. I can go to grad school, but based on the current job market, it's not likely that I will find a job after I finish grad school.   Companies will more likely to hire U.S. citizens to save the hassle. 

At this point I don't know if I should stay in U.S. working for my current company until I am no longer able to, or I should prepare to move back to my home country with terrible pay and hostile social environment.

55,Fellow engineers: how do you go about organizing notes and notebooks?,1591836168,"I'm an EE who just joined the career club and after my first week of work I'm pretty much having the reigns over some things myself. Meaning I choose how to approach problems and what I think I need to spend my time doing to build and meet milestones not only efficiently but robustly. And I actually like how laissez fair they are being about it.

In school things were linear for the most part, but the projects I did for fun, or in a group/class setting, my notes were usually so unorganized because I was just putting things together over time. Now, I think it's time I learn how to organize my learning/pursuits better. Ironically, getting through school didn't teach me this.

Lets say, I have the reigns over designing a piece of a larger program. I want to have an entire notebook dedicated to this compartment. There's things I want and need to learn before I get my hands dirty, then there's the mapping out and execution of the project. 

I'd rather not try to reinvent a shittier wheel here so I'd like to see from those much more experienced how they go about organizing their thoughts, notes, roadmaps, and project construction.

**Edit**: great discussion everybody! The cheap solution I'm definitely trying out is the rocket notebook. But I want to emphasize that we don't need to only share our mediums of note taking! (by the way for me it's been notebooks, labeling, and dating)

I also wanted to discuss the physical notes and how you go about beginning a long project/task and organizing: things you want and have to learn for the task, the planning phase of the execution, and the process of getting things done and trial and error. So not only just the medium of doing all that, but kinda your process as well. We can all learn something from each other.

79,"HVAC vents for a single-zone system. Could put ""smart"" vents (e.g. Flair) on 7 of the 13 supply vents in our house. Additionally, 4 bathrooms would not be smart. Will this defeat the airflow/etc needed to be effective at ""zoning""?",1591811905,"Hi folks!

We have a single zone system with a Carrier communicating thermostat.  We're planning to upgrade to a smart version of the thermostat (still planning stages). 

We have been doing a lot of renovation work ourselves, and all of our vent covers are covered in 70 years of uneven paint.  So we'd have to wire brush them clean, prime, and repaint them, and buy new screws for them as well (old screws gunked up with paint, lost, or stripped).  Or we could be wasteful and buy new covers.  Another idea is to get smart vents instead to help make the single-zone home a little more ""zoned"".

&amp;#x200B;

* There are 13 main supply vents to the home across 11 rooms (7 returns). 
* Of those, it looks like 7 supply vents could be upgraded to smart vents (the kitchen, 2 in the living room, 3 in bedrooms, and 1 of the 2 master bath vents).
* The basement vent can't be smart (large, circular) and is usually shut off.  I suppose we could try retrofitting it to work if advisable?
* The dining room has a floor vent that matches the floor, so it can't be smart.  The dining room is contiguous/right next to the kitchen, which is the only non-bathroom that doesn't have a return.
* 4 bathrooms cannot be smart (3 have floor vents that match the floor, and there's a vent behind a cabinet in the powder room).  None of the bathrooms have returns.

&amp;#x200B;

If I did Flair, it looks like the cost would be $1,317 (including 6 pucks for the 6 rooms).  I think this would be cheaper and easier than me trying to zone it by learning how to put in the fans, closing valves, and wiring on the supply end of each branch in the basement (even though most branches are easily accessible from there).  Certainly cheaper than hiring someone to do so!

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

1. If only 7/13 vents are controlled by the system, will that reduce the ability of the system to control the airflow to the point that it would defeat the purpose of trying to ""zone"" it?
2. How big of a deal is it that none of the 4 bathrooms have smart vents (the master bathroom might have 1 out of 2)?  There are no returns in any of the bathrooms.  We did install manual exhaust vents in each for showers, for what it's worth.
3. Will it ""strain"" the system that the dining room (the dining room is between the kitchen and living room/open to both) does not have its own smart vent?  It has a floor vent.  The kitchen is right next to it and has no return, so perhaps they compliment each other?
4. Is it advisable to retrofit a smart vent into the basement so it can also be controlled?  We usually keep the supply off anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I have included this information in case it is helpful:

* It is 1900 sq ft, which I don't think includes the basement.
* Insulation is touch-and-go - we upgraded where we could.

Anyway I have been at my employer for a few years now, and I have built strong relationships and always had very positive feedback from my manager and other key figures in the business. I like the company, my colleagues, and the work. 

For the last couple of months our department has been crazily busy, but I have been working very hard and I feel that I have been performing well. Our department has pretty much always been seen as a bottleneck due to chronic understaffing, but I was feeling that I was really growing into being a key figure in the business. 

In the last couple of weeks a lot of people, pretty much the whole management team outside of my own department, seem to be suddenly hostile towards me. Whereas a year ago or 2 years ago my good relationships often meant that I got the benefit of the doubt (even when I felt that maybe I shouldn't have), it seems like the very few, very small, mistakes that I have made recently are being blown out of proportion. 

One of the things that I did recently that seems to be being treated like a major fuck up was something that I saw as a success. A lot of people thought it was an unsolvable problem that would require a complete redesign and completely screw our delivery schedule, but I got the problem 80% of the way to being solved and one of my colleagues got us over the line with maybe a 1 week delay.

97,Nickel Cadmium Vs. Nickel Metal Hydride for long term storage / emergency preparedness,1591791947,"Hello Engineers of reddit!

I am hoping y'all can help me decide which battery chemistry would be best for a project, or if this plan is even feasible at all. I apologize if I ramble, **TLDR** will be at the bottom.

**Background**: I am an EMT who is very lucky to work in an area that so far has *not* been wiped out by COVID the way some parts of the world have. The company that I currently work for has done an impressive job managing the supply chain issues that are plaguing the medical field right now, but I will not be working for this company forever and the stories in the news and from colleagues at other companies and in other states have been concerning. I do not want to be stuck working without PPE or reusing single use PPE indefinitely during the next pandemic, so when things calm down and they become available again my plan is to purchase a 3M Powered Air Purifying Respirator and several batteries, hoods and filters to keep at home in case I find myself working for an employer who is not able to provide me with appropriate respiratory protection like many others have. The batteries would be bought new and basically stored, rarely if ever used, but would need to be able to enter service with as much of their designed capacity remaining as possible.

I don't mind charging them once or twice a month or replacing them every few years but if we find ourselves in the midst of another pandemic I likely won't be able to order brand new ones right before I need them to enter service, I'll need to be able to grab use the ones I've been storing.

3m sells NiCd or NiMH batteries for the PAPR I'm looking at:

[3M™ Battery Pack BP-17IS, NiCd](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Battery-Pack-BP-17IS-NiCd-Intrinsically-Safe-1-EA-Case/?N=5002385+3294776311&amp;rt=rud)

[3M™ NiMH Battery Pack BP-15](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Breathe-Easy-Turbo-Powered-Air-Purifying-Respirator-PAPR-NiMH-Battery-Pack-BP-15-1-EA-Case/?N=5002385+3294780211&amp;rt=rud)

Lithium batteries, though available, are unfortunately going to be out of my budget. I have also seen some people convert these PAPRs to be powered by a USB battery bank but I'm leaving that as a last resort.... The battery banks would be much cheaper and more availible but I'm still left trying to keep a healthy stock of them.

**The Questions**:

1. Which battery would be better suited for my application? (indefinite storage, rare use)
2. What is the best way to store these so that I can charge them and use them when needed without too much degradation?
3. How often do you think I should replace the batteries if they're basically shuffled back and forth between the charger and a shelf their entire life?

**My answer so far**: I have read about memory effect in NiCd batteries which makes me lean toward NiMH. It sounds like the NiMH would rapidly lose their charge while stored. I know I'm not supposed to store the batteries *on* the charger indefinitely and I will have to come up with some sort of schedule to keep them healthy. I am woefully undereducated in this area and at this point I'm deep enough into the weeds that reading more is just confusing me more. If anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate what you're able to share. Thank you and stay safe out there!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** I need to buy several expensive batteries and store them indefinitely. They will rarely be used but I want to be able to take them out of storage, charge them up and use them to their full capacity when needed. Should I be looking at NiCd or NiMH batteries, how should I store and charge them and how often should I replace them? Thank you!

I have not gone onto a graduate scheme with one of the big companies, instead I joined company X as a tooling design engineer. My company is just under 1000 employees and is subsidiary of a very large Aero company, so the money is there so to speak.

This is my first job after graduating university and I have been employed for about less than half a year and I've got to say it's quite intensive. I'm designing a number of new tools some which are pretty complicated, from the modelling side as well as from coming up with the concept itself.  I'm having to hosting video conference calls with a number of process engineers to get everyones input and make sure we do it right and have everything covered. Apart from speaking to my colleagues, I'm having to of course do research on my own as I have only 3 months of on the job experience and I cannot pull every solution from a filing cabinet inside my head.  I'm on the phone with suppliers and writing emails to brief them on the tooling we want them to design and manufacture as we can't do it all in house, I have to tie in with our process engineers to make sure we're all on the same page there as well. I'm having to shop for quotes and I'm also of course having to some some administrative work on top of that.


It's all quite intensive. Often when I'm presented with a new task I think, ""I have no idea how I'm going to do this nor do I know where to begin"". I am of the mindset that I need to get the job done no matter what and with that I do what needs to be done whether that's talking to the right people, researching ideas or thinking for hours until a light bulb finally goes off and I come up with a design even if its preliminary.

Now I think my starting salary is great for a fresh graduate (It's under 30k) but having said all that I have started to wonder about how my salary progression is going to look like. I have found that being thrown in the deep water is the best way to learn and I'm glad I'm being thrown in the midst of things but I feel like with my current workload and responsibility, I should be getting compensated a little more. ( I know I am lucky to have a job with this whole COVID-19 thing going on, especially since I work in the aerospace sector so I do not want to come off as ungrateful) 

How do salary progression differ from graduate schemes compared to graduate jobs? Can I expect my salary to automatically increase annually without speaking to my boss ? I'm assuming if I want a higher bump that is when I have to engage in conversation with my boss.

I'm excited that it's more complex than what I've done before and that I get a chance to up onmy game, but expectations keep changing and I've had a lot of trouble keeping up. I'm getting inconsistent feedback from people who I go to for guidance, and it seems like my ideas are regularly shot down, just to see the same idea be mandated a month later when it comes out of someone else's mouth (complete with the very same reasoning that I originally used). To clarify, I'm not saying this was plagiarism. The person legit came up with the same idea independently. I don't give a shit about getting credit, it's just frustrating when that happens while it's clear my manager is losing patience with me, and things would have been sped up by weeks if I wasn't dismissed in the first place.

I could go on and on, and maybe it would sound like I've had to navigate several legitimately infuriating hurdles, but I have a feeling that these are things that most people are just better at navigating than I am. Still, I can't identify anything that I could have done different to make things go smoothly. I'm not trying to win the MVP award. I'm just trying to survive and meet my requirements without eroding my manager's trust, but I can't even do that.

32,What type of silicone would be best for a masturbation cup? Porous vs Softness,1591733649,"Hi, kinda of odd but I want to independently create a fleshlight type sex toy. I have a ton of questions, and those “ask an expert” websites seem to be dead so here I am. 

TLDR;;; looking to create or find a non porous, non toxic soft material for a fleshlight. I don’t understand what makes up ‪silicone and how to learn more.



OK so from the information I’ve read, the less porous the material is the softer it is, but non porous means it can be cleaned properly/no bacteria growth.‬ So obviously I’m looking for a material that is low on the shore a hardness scale but is still non porous. Phthalate is apparently bad because that is the cause of chemical burns with sex toys, but this is what would make the silicone soft? 

I don’t know which compounds that make up silicone that influence porosity, softness, heat retention and elasticity, durability etc etc. How does the curing method effect the silicone? I don’t understand what it is I need to create a silicone soft enough for a masturbator cup. Is “medical grade” and “food grade” silicones just that because the structure of them is less porous? Could the same type of silicone that breast implants use work - and how would I even know how to convey the exact type of silicone formula I want to a factory? I assume the harder silicon that holds the liquid of a breast implant could be used as a coat layer in a masturbation cup, over a softer silicone material that would be toxic with direct contact. What’s the formula of breast implants silicone? How would I learn if it would would be durable enough to hold, and not deteriorate when constantly rubbed? How would a know how durable a type of rubber would be if thinly spread?

But then I see there’s other options like TPE/TPR. It has a low durometer, and the lower the durometer the softer the material...how is this different from the shore scale? I read “TPE is generally considered body safe” - generally, so not always? How can I learn what kinds of silicone are “medical grade” or are platinum cured and how do they differ? How would I be able to communicate this to a factory and check if it’s “good quality”?

I have a lot of questions and idk how to find answers to any of this, Google isn’t exactly giving me answers that are referenced from real sources so I’m just ?????

35,Engineering Jobs for Undocumented Immigrants,1591730599,"I hope I do not get judged too hard here, but here it goes.

Hello, I am a second year studying to earn a BS in mechanical engineering in California. I immigrated to the United States with my family at the age of 6 and have continued to live here up to now. While we came here legally with my father coming with an F-1 visa and me as an F-2 dependent, we got extremely screwed when my father unknowingly attended a language school that has been fraudulently accepting several students, not requiring them to do any work, and giving out credits that were not really earned. This was discovered by the government after my father left the school, but we received a mail from USCIS later that our green card application has been revoked due to the situation. Here's an article about it. [https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/owner-schools-illegally-allowed-foreign-nationals-remain-us-students-sentenced-15](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/owner-schools-illegally-allowed-foreign-nationals-remain-us-students-sentenced-15) How he did not know is beyond me, but it happened and here we are. Recently, our family decided to let our visas expire due to the high costs and go to court to contest our revocation because we literally didn't even know this was happening during the time my father was attending the school.

So here I am, studying for a degree that leads to unobtainable jobs because of my status. I have been discriminated countless times whether I did or did not have my visa, so before you answer my questions, please understand that I am a human being, just like you. I lived here for pretty much my entire life, so it's funny to say that I consider myself more of an American than Korean. I love playing video games and have been a huge nerd my entire life. My dad was an engineer back in my home country which inspired me to aspire to be one as well. I'm a hard-working college student with dreams hoping to make my parents proud and repay them for all that they have done for me. 

Now that everything is cleared, I wanted to hear it from you guys. I feel lost at times and am worried that I will be stuck working on jobs completely irrelevant to my major. I thought maybe I can get some guidance from some of you guys who have been engineers for years. 

I still want to add experiences to my resume in the chance that I obtain my green card in the next few years. However, it is extremely difficult to do so as most if not all jobs require a work visa. Is my best course of action to just look for non-paid internships until I receive my green card? Also, if our court appeal gets denied, which is also a possibility, what is there to do as an undocumented engineer in the United States? (if there even is such thing) 

If nothing above works, I plan on going back to Korean to try to get a job there. However, the thing that worries me is that Korean is not my best language. I'm a conversationalist at best, and I pretty much have the language proficiency of an elementary kid. If I do go back to Korea, how are the job prospects for English speaking engineers?

39,Calculating axial load on a compression screw for bearing selection,1591726457,"We've a barrel and screw and barrel can support 10,000PSI before rupture.

The screw rotates, pushing material forward through a nozzle

We operate it at 1000PSI pressure during normal operation, Screw RPM=150

The shaft diameter on the screw is 25mm (0.98inch), we have to select a suitable roller taper bearing for it - we'll be using 2 of them facing each other to support axel on either direction to prevent screw from transmitting axial load to the motor shaft which can potentially destroy the gear drive which is not designed for heavy axial loads.

10,000 PSI = 4.46ton-force per sq inch = 43.73kN per sq inch

Axial load on screw = cross sectional area * max pressure 

= (pi*0.98inch^2) / 4 * 43.73kN 

= 32.99kN

So I need a Roller Taper Bearing with Dynamic Load Rating just under 30kN

Do I:

Overmold the plastic directly on the metal

Create them as separate pieces

Glue the handle in place

Secure it with pins

Secure it with screws

Background:

So I'm 34, married with a kid, and a full-time middle school teacher. I teach math, love math, and am interested in going back to school to get my engineering degree. My wife works full time too. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, this is not my first time exploring the engineering field, so I know the level of rigor expected of students. In college, 15 years ago, I was an engineering major and earned my Associate's degree at a community college before transferring to a 4 year school. My first year at a big university didn't go so well because I partied and didn't go to class, so I dropped out. I returned to school 1 year later, and earned an education degree and have been teaching for about 10 years now. I am looking at mechanical engineering programs because I have high mechanical aptitude according to several online test, and have fixed pretty much everything in my house and cars over the past few years.  I have replace water heaters, fixed household appliances including washers, dryers, dishwashers, and stoves, fixed countless cars for friends and family members, have fixed lawn tractors, and just this last weekend I repaired the compressor for my heat pump after my AC broke on Saturday. I love working with my hands, and I feel like teaching middle school math isn't using my skill sets to the fullest potential. 

Now that the 'why' is out of the way, I need some advise how to pursue my degree. First of all, online programs are very appealing to me because I work full time and have a kid. I do however find it difficult to find an ABET accredited online program. I was wondering how important ABET accreditation is when looking for a job out of school.  

I live in Maryland, and was thinking of doing night classes, but when looking at course offering catalogs, I see only day time options available.  Have any of you done online undergrad degrees? Have any of you done an engineering degree at night? I would love some feedback, and look forward to reading you comments!

51,Winding up spiral torsion spring,1591716483,"So I was trying to fix my chair, in the section that reclines the backrest, but by fixing it, I took everything apart from the reclining mechanism, and I fixed the problem but in doing so I made another problem, when I took everything apart, I took the spiral torsion spring that made it so the seat would go up, when I pulled up in the handle, I took the spring off its holder, because I'm dumb and now I don't know how to get the spring back to its holder.

Here is an image of the spring and how it should be wound, I don't know if wind is the correct term, since winding would probably be from the inside, but I hope you know what I mean
https://imgur.com/a/5oMTvQQ 

The holder can't be moved, it's welded to the piece and the thing that looks like it can be turned is also welded in place (at least it seems like it) and is mostly so you can get the plastic cover on.

The rough dimensions of the spring

The thickness of the metal is 3 mm (≈1/8'')
The spring is 10 mm deep (≈25/64'')
The radius from the middle to the bend at the end is 40 mm (≈ 1 37/64'')
The holder is 20 mm long (≈25/32'')
And the amount it should be moved around is roughly 63 mm (≈ 2 31/64'')
The holder goes about 3 mm (≈1/8'') out from the depth of the spring, so the end has to go out 13 mm (≈33/64''), I can get it out about 5 mm (≈13/64''), with my own force, but the gap to get in is really small

I think my question really is what would be the best way to move the spring over the holder so it can sit there, because getting to the holder is doable, with a vice holding it down and then using the body of it as torque, but getting the spring out enough while holding the force is damn near impossible doing this, because when trying to pull it out, the vice loses its grip on it and it falls out

In addition, many police body-cams are bluetooth enabled which allows syncing.

The ""explained in more detail"" link describes the process:

&gt; After cell signal capture this allows tracker to monitor and trace the location of the target. Currently (at least a year +/- ago) the private sector technology is still proximity specific. Meaning they need to be within a few feet for the capture to work. The signal capture looks like what the dude in the video was attempting to do in person. That's how it relates.

The high-tech capture software part links to a page describing an ""RTL-SDR dongle"" which can be used with an Android phone.

I'm trying to make sense of this characteristic.

I think the right hand side makes sense. The pump can generate a pressure rise of 35 inches Hg at zero flow rate. As the flow rate increases, the pressure rise that the pump can generate drops. Until at a flow rate of \~0.3cfm the pump generates zero pressure rise.

But what is happening on the left hand side? The pump is generating negative pressure rise? Is this for the case where I connect the flow outlet to an evacuated vessel?

The cost of digging a deep well or using existing ones, lining them up with electric motor-generator driven winches that can lower or raise a mass depending on whether there is a surplus or deficit of power from the grid shouldn’t be expensive at all. Rocks or Rubble, which are essentially free, can be used as masses or even garbage waste (which has an effective negative cost) can be used as well. Additionally, towers of wells can be built basically anywhere which means the Total Addressable Market is effectively global. There is no reason to believe these designs couldn’t last forever if the motors and winches are well lubricated and maintained, and could be scaled to any volume or capacity. Cheap to build, inexpensive and efficient to operate (electric motors are super efficient, and there is no waste sound or heat to speak of), potentially profitable, and easy to design how is this not more widely adopted as an energy storage solution?

We spent $10K repairing an assembly fixture- a nest for a part had to be CNC'd out of plastic. The same thing could be printed for far less money. Obviously this printer wouldn't be used to create parts that we injection mold, but being able to prototype could be beneficial.

I've been tinkering with FDM (filament) printers for about a year and a half now, and with my 3 months off of work most of what I did was fine-tune the ones I have at home. The only reason I haven't run the idea by my boss is because I don't have one that runs *perfectly*\- i.e. I can't demonstrate zero tuning needed for multiple perfect prints.

I have a poor understanding of foam (polyurethane?) mechanics. When these types of mattresses fail (sag), is it due to fatigue (like cyclic loading?). Does this material act like metal? Will compressing it far more than normal loading push it into plastic deformation? My instinct is no, because it comes packaged in a much more extreme state of compression. How does the failure mechanism work for this?

Background:  
I graduated with a BS in Materials Science and Engineering in the US back in May of 2018. The reason I got into MS&amp;E, rather than MechE was due to being drawn in towards the innovation and breakthrough Materials Scientist/Engineers made. Fast forward to graduation, while job hunting, I tried applying for R&amp;D positions, but alas, a Masters and/or PhD is (always) the preferred requirement. 5 month of applying, and I settled with a project engineer position. Been in this position for 2 years now, learnt a good amount, but I'm longing for something more. 

Seeing as my US Student Visa  is ending July 2021, and the chances of me getting a US work visa is looking nil, the next phase of my life seems to be gravitating towards a Masters   
\*Disclaimer: I already decided that I wanted a Masters when I graduated, but wanted to get some industrial experience before I commit to a more specified major, so this isn't some ""jump the gun"" decision\*

I need to allow as close to 90 degrees of rotation around a point as possible. 60 degrees of movement is the minimum I need. My problem is that the hinge may not occupy the space through which the rotation acts, nor may it occupy space to the side, nor may it occupy the space inside of where the rotation will occur. This leaves only the exterior angle. 

So I came up with a simple design for this and I would like to know if it is feasible to make or if it can be bought from anywhere as a component. The hinge consists of:

* Curved inner tube, forming a segment of a square toroid, with the center being the center of rotation. The tube also has a ""limiter"" piece attached, that stops it from falling from the sleeve.

* Curved outer sleeve, that accommodates the tube. The sleeve is slotted to allow the limiter to move until the end.

78,"I need career advice from FPGA, Electrical, or computer engineers",1591550220,"I tried posting this over in r/FPGA, but I got no response.

Long post sorry in advanced TL;DR at the bottom 

I need some career advice from FPGA, electrical, or computer engineers. Maybe software if you have worked with FPGAs.

If you work/worked on FPGAs/HDL/digital design for a living I would appreciate your input. I need some advice about my career as an engineer. It’s been mostly unfulfilling, so I thought it might be a good idea to talk to some people who work with FPGAs for a living. I will start with some backstory.

I graduated in 2016 with my degree in electrical engineering. I got an offer from a major defense contractor (won’t name which one) just before graduating and I would be working in their space department on FPGAs. I was excited to learn more about FPGAs. I feel like the classes I took didn’t cover nearly enough digital design and FPGA design aspects imo. I picked up VHDL, but stuff like the timing aspect of FPGAs and proper cross domain clocking were just not covered.

Anyways, I ended up quitting my job around June 2019. After spending over 3 years there I felt like I was neglected as a new grad engineer. There were a lot of issues, but I will list some. 

1. I didn’t get FPGA related work until months after starting enough I was hired for as an FPGA engineer. I want to say it took about a year maybe more after starting before my manager assigned me any FPGA work (looking back I should have quit after the first year). 

2. New grads that got hired after me got FPGA work before me. I remember this guy just stared at the company and he was in my department. He was assigned FPGA work pretty quickly. I had been at the company over 5 months at that point and they had me working on signal integrity simulations (which I hated doing).  

3. Once I got assigned FPGA work, I was put on terrible projects. No Sr. FPGA engineers or any FPGA engineers on the same projects as me. I got almost no mentorship at all. Meanwhile my friends are working on cool stuff and have tons of support. My first project was one that lost funding and got it back about a year later. They lost all their FPGA engineers during that year they had no funding. They put me the new grad who hasen’t done any FPGA design in about a year on the project to fix some bugs. The design was very complex, and I was way out of my depth. None of the software engineers had FPGA experience, so they were no help when I needed advice. I would routinely try to get assistance from the other FPGA engineers in my department, but they were always too busy even though I would schedule meetings in advance. It gets worst and I could go on, but I think you get the idea.

4. Overall leadership was not great. While no one was flat out rude to me they clearly did not care about my career growth even though I would complain pretty regularly and ask for better projects.

I don’t feel like I gained much FPGA skill while working there. After quitting I left the country for a month and I started job hunting as soon as I got back. I feel like my lack of experience especially after 3 years of work as really screwed me over. 

I eventually got an offer for a job in late February 2020. The job is not FPGA related and it’s also not work I’m really interested in doing, but I took the offer. I needed the money and it was in a good location. I figured I could always leave if I found something in the digital design field. Less than a week before I relocate, I get an email from Microsoft saying they want to move me forward for a FPGA role. They originally contacted me around Thanksgiving 2019 for the role and had pretty much left me dangling. 

I pretty much though they had moved on. I accept the interview which ended up taking place online due to coronavirus starting to make place quarantine. I felt like I had nailed the multiple interviews over the course of 2 days. About 2 weeks I find out they picked someone else. I was pretty sad about it, because the project sounded awesome it involved cloud computing and FPGAs. 

I message all the members of the team I interview with. They all said I did I well during the interview. It boiled down to my experience and the fact they had someone with more and probably better experience. The manager of the project added me on LinkedIn and said he wanted to keep in contact, but I don’t expect to hear back from him. Mainly because he said if I have any questions to ask. I reached out twice asking about advice on FPGAs dev board and I never received a response.

That pretty much bring it’s to now. I relocated and have been working at my new job. Due to the coronavirus outbreak pretty much all the engineers are working from home. There has been no one to train me. I have just been working with the company’s shipping team programing and testing devices before shipping them out to customers. It’s very boring and after talking to the sr. engineer about when I would possibly be working with him, he wasn’t sure. Once again, I feel like I am wasting time doing nothing of relevance.

At this point I am considering taking one or two paths and this is where I need advice. 

* Start looking for new job in the digital design/FPGA field. My concern is that I will never receive an offer from anyone. My crap experience along with an almost year gap of no FPGA work puts me in a bad spot. I feel like the only way I will find a position is to pursue a master’s degree which I don’t really have the money for.

or

* Stay at my current job and just deal with how miserable I am and collect pay checks. In my free time I will start working on a video game with a couple of friends. If it works out, we will publish a game and if it’s successful at all I will use the money to move into making games full time.

My career experience has made me disillusioned and jaded toward the engineering industry. I don’t know if it’s worth continuing down this path. Have you found yourself in a position like myself and how did you move forward? A few other questions while I have your attention. How did your career with FPGA start? Did you have good mentorship when you first started out? Do any good resources for learning about FPGAs? What FPGA dev board do you use? I have an [Altera DE0 board](https://bit.ly/3h3BjiL) I used in school, but I wanted to get something using up to date software tools. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading and I sorry for how long this post is. I appreciate any advice thanks!

TL;DR – My first job out of college was an FPGA role at a defense contractor. After 3 year of being neglected by management I quit feeling like I got terrible work experience. About 7 months in the job hunt I find a new engineering role. Thanks to covid-19 the job is not great, and it won’t get better anytime soon. It’s also not FPGA related work. I would like to go back to searching for a FPGA role, but I am considering using my free time to make a video game with some friends. Depending on if it’s successful I would leave engineering behind all together and just make video games.

I am about to enter my second year of college, in which I am pursuing an electrical engineering degree. My first year was primarily filled with prerequisites like math, physics, and computer science, so this fall, I will be taking my first two core engineering classes (a circuits class, and a systems and control class). I am incredibly nervous because my knowledge and experience with engineering is incredibly limited beyond my basic understanding of circuits and coding. I am terrified that I will be behind already (my school is competitive, and I feel like everyone already knows more than me). As a result, I've been using MIT OpenCourseWare to try and get ahead, but I keep getting stuck. I just cannot seem to teach myself these concepts, with no teacher to ask or peers to consult. I have too many questions, and I fear that I lack the mental energy to spend hours on a problem with no headway because I have no one to turn to for help and Google is not much help. This especially does not bode well for the fall, when it is likely that my classes will remain online due to coronavirus. The thing is, I thrive in a classroom. I'm not afraid to ask questions or to make sure I know what is going on. I do well in that environment because I have always been a good student. However, I know that I will not be a student forever, and I know that self-learning is important to engineering. I just find it very hard to internalize all of these new and complicated concepts without the support of a school environment.

Throughout my senior year, I worked with 3 of my friends and a local company who sponsored our work to develop a piece of technology that could help ensure safety in their factories.

I believe a capstone project like this is not uncommon; nevertheless, I am very grateful for the experience. My friends and I had near full control of the entire design process, and I especially enjoyed all the prototyping/iteration and the creative exploration of design ideas that happened before we decided what our final product would look like.

97,Source for food-safe metric to hose barb fittings?,1591514835,"I'm trying to adapt one end of a soda stream CO2 canister valve to something I can connect to my CO2 tank. Right now I think the easiest approach will be to manage to convert the tank end of the valve to a barbed fitting which can attach to the plastic line coming off the regulator attached to my tank.

The thread I am trying to adapt is a male M18x1.5 (So I need an adapter that is female M18x1.5 on one end and barb on the other). Ideally I'd like to adapt it to a barb for 5/16 ID plastic hosing since that's the barbed connector already on my regulator, but I can most likely make 3/8 work as well.

The only thing passing through this connector will be CO2 gas at near room temp. The pressure will be regulated down to 20-30 PSI, so high strength is not critical.

I found [this guy](https://www.mcmaster.com/3093N131) on McMaster, which seems to be the only thing in their catalog with M18x1.5 female threads. My concern is that it mentions that it is not RoHS compliant due to using lead as an alloying element in the steel. Would this be an issue for CO2 gas, particularly since the part is zinc-plated? I know it might be questionable for direct contact with water, but I don't know about CO2 gas that will eventually be dissolved in water.

Alternately - I can't seem to find any source for metric fittings anywhere.

One of the production manager all-stars at our company is leaving due to the stress of this situation, and his next-in-line replacement has legitimate mental breakdowns once a week, partly because he is failing to meet production demands imposed by our CEO, and partly because he believes that engineers/ the engineering department is innately incompetent. Naturally, in the midst of all of this, some of the engineers in our office have taken to pointing the finger and trying to assign blame to other people to cover their own skin, are intentionally over-dramatizing issues, talking about people behind their backs... the whole thing is just one big cliche emotional and organizational mess. There is no end in sight simply because engineering doesn't have the time to sit down and really think through how lean initiatives will impact all of the departments at the company, but the CEO's demands are becoming ever more aggressive (for example, he wants monthly metrics showing how our initiatives are progressing despite the fact that the information he wants requires a sample size of many years of production to indicate anything useful).

As more I am into engineering, I realized most supervisors will give you tasks and expect you to have some level of personal understandings and will give you a brief explanation or none at all. They expect that you do your own research and have a engineering level of understanding.

For me, when I am given a task that I am not sure. I would sit there look over example and research and look at it again but it take me hours and hours to complete my task. I can sense disapproval how long it took me to finish my work. It also has consume my personal time, where I have to place in long hours and weekend to complete my tasks whereas other people don't.

The kettle part is a typical stainless steel kettle that seems food safe, but I don't know anything about vacuum pumps that use oil, and how it might taint the coffee while the pump is vacuuming the chamber. If anyone who works with those kinds of vacuum chambers could chime in, that would be awesome. Because if it is safe, I might just buy one of those and call it a day.

30,Question about rotational design to avoid metal to metal friction,1591465301,"Im trying to design a rotating drum for coffee roasting, it will sit in a BBQ grill and rotate for about 15-20 minutes. After the roast the drum will be removed by hand (with gloves) to dump the coffee into a cooling mechanism. My question is on the right side of the structure I'm welding a pipe on so that I can insert a probe during roast to look at the color of the beans then return them, opening the lid of the grill isnt a good idea becuase too much heat will be lost. The pipe will need to lay onto something that will allow the drum to rotate with little to zero friction to the pipe. I figure maybe a gear welded onto the pipe that lays on some others but maybe theres an easier way. Since I have no formal engineering education outside of a metallurgical lab I once worked at I feel like there may be other ways to possibly resolve this that I don't know about or i'm not thinking of.

51,The would be commandments of engineering success:,1591450064,"1. Have humility don't grandstand

It's impossible to know every aspect of engineering. Admit what you don't know and seek advice from those who do.

2. Strive for wisdom

Knowledge is indeed power, but that power is not to be wielded over others. So have humility with what you know, and strive to know more. With what you know apply good judgement.

3. Be pragmatic but don't cut corners.

It's easy to get ahead of ourselves with all the ideas we have in our head, but be pragmatic. What cost, how long, what's needed, who's needed? But in being pragmatic don't fall into the trap of cutting corners. This may create future problems. 

4. Foresight should be the default mindset in every task you undertake.

We can't predict the future, but we can use past knowledge to to have as good an idea of what may happen. Hindsight after all is 20/20 but most things happen in cycles so learn from the past as much as possible and use it to drive your foresight to avoid future problems.

5. Don't try do everything. You can't.

It's easy to bite off more than you can chew. If you are in a senior role learn to delegate. And if your ego, makes you feel that no one can do it better than you see commandment 1.

6. Nepotism is to be avoided at all cost.

Yes, we all like to work with people that we get on with. It's even understandable to want to see them do well and thus provide them more opportunities than others as you would a family member. But engineering requires people that are skilled at the craft for projects to succeed. Promote the best people. After all commandment 3 is to be pragmatic.

7. Agree to disagree unless the outcome may be severe.

Nothing good comes of always trying to be right. Learn to let things go. If someone challenges your ideas, you don't have to try and prove them wrong. For starters it's annoying, but also from the outside even if you are right you may still come off as wrong.

8. Question your wisdom.

Most engineers, especially experienced ones have a hard time adapting to knew ideas. But if wisdom is about how well you use your knowledge, always ask yourself if you can use it better. Hence question your wisdom and learn to accept new ideas.

9. Have integrity (don't be a wank)

We all want to be the best at our craft, but don't resort to the dark arts of being condescending or undermining of your co-workers. It lacks integrity. Another aspect of this is try your best. Don't seek to do the bare minimum, it's understandable if there are time and cost constraints. But where possible always do the best.

10. Learn to enjoy it

The Artemis team at my company offered me a spot on the program to help lead conceptual design of their contribution. I don't know if I should take it.

I feel really honored for having been offered the spot, especially considering that I didn't look for this opportunity, the Artemis team at my company found me and emailed me about it. I know it's a fantastic opportunity and I know I will regret it in the future if I don't take it. But I feel apprehensive about taking it because of several reasons.

First, I admitted to the team that I have never worked on a program where it was still in the conceptual design phase and the ten appreciated the honesty. I'm not sure what kind of working environment I would be walking into if I accepted and if I could handle it since I'm a newlywed (wanting to spend time with my wife) and actually give it my all if that made any sense.

Second, I'm not exactly confident in my own engineering abilities and if I could really do or contribute anything worthwhile to this program. I don't really know if I would be able to handle the kind of stress I'm anticipating that would come with this new program.

Third, if the National Team were to lose the bid to one of the other two companies, then what would happen to my job? My current position is stable. Taking this offer would mean taking a risk, probably an unnecessary risk too.

Fourth, I'm not sure if it's the right thing for me to do. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to become an engineer because of watching Apollo 13 when I was a kid and wanting to be like those brilliant engineers. But lately I've been feeling disenchanted with being an engineer. I've found myself wanting to do more managment.

In the [attached example](https://imgur.com/ozaLdx3) (which I’ve simplified), you’ll notice that the datum reference frame for the y-dimension references datums A-B-C, but for the x-dimension it references A-C-B. I understand the tolerance zone this creates, but are the changing datum references correct? In my limited understanding, I interpret this as requiring one setup for the measurement of the x-dimension and another for the y-dimension.

I’ve seen similar features called out two other ways:

1. Both dimensions share the same datum references in the same order. I’ve interpreted this as the part will be setup and constrained in one manner and then both measurements will be taken.
2. Each dimension only has 2 datum references. In this case, Datum A and either Datum B or C depending on which dimension is being measured.

The evaporator takes in liquid xenon at some cryogenic temperature and heats it up to evaporate it. The pressure change across the evaporator is roughly 0, because internally, the liquid and gas are at equilibrium, so the pressure at the outlet should be equal to the inlet, and the temperature should be the liquid-vapor equilibrium temperature for that specific pressure. If the temperature is higher, the pressure then increases and vice versa along that equilibrium curve.

The heater model does not allow for outlet pressure calculations unless the pressure drop across the heater is greater than some certain positive minimum pressure, which is at odds with what I'm trying to model.

This weight is concentrated upon two 3 foot rails on the outer sides of the rack holding the unit. We hired an architectural engineer to insure the weight could be handled by the 4"" concrete slab that the building expansion where this will be located rests upon. His response was that the slab would only support 200lbs per square foot and the most we could load into the rack was 2400lbs of batteries.

This does not sound right. Everything I am seeing suggests that concrete has a 3000+ psi strength and these numbers don't agree with other things I have read. Am I completely off base or is this guy correct? I don't really know what his angle would be to not be up front with the facts.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a PhD researcher and recently my research lab has jumped on the band wagon on creating mechanical ventilators and not just the open source quick type, but a more robust commercial scale portable ventilator. Now i am a biomedical engineer and I comprehensively understand the medical dynamics behind the respiratory system and how CPAP and BiPAP ventilation alongside high flow therapy is used for respiratory problems. The software part of for different ventilator modes is something i can manage as well once i start using the sensors and the valves, the only thing eluding me thus far is the principle of air supply to the patient circuit.

Like open source vents are using ambu bags with a mechanical system to compress the bag at a certain rate, however i am sure the commercial ventilators are using air compressors and air pumps rather than bag valves (ambu bags) for the air delivery, I just cannot understand the physical system behind it how do the compressor push the air into the circuit, is there and in between chamber where oxygen and air is first stored and then fed to the compressor or compressor directly pushed air into the patient circuit , and how exactly the BiPaP mode works physically. I am really stuck in understanding something really basic which is eluding me.

this part from how the air and oxygen enters into the machine to how it reaches the patient circuit. If anyone can help me understand the mechanics I would really really appreciate the support.

I’m a mechanical engineer who’s been working in the field for under a decade. For the past several months I’ve been working in a team on a specific project leading up to some semi-major testing. At this point we are in the home stretch for prep work and are dealing with the working from home conditions and challenges, but still meeting schedule and doing well. 

Recently, my boss communicated to my team that due to budget cuts from COVID, we have to limit our time spent on preparation by half. They have also been asking about measures being taken in the project and in the testing that cut down on charge time. This throws up a ton of red flags for me, because not doing this right becomes potentially 100x more costly. It compromises the safety and integrity of the test and shorts the prep work quality and extent.

I have expressed to my boss my concern with the scope of the budget cuts with regards to maintaining the safety of the test but only received a paraphrased explanation of the situation they had already explained and why we need to stay under budget. I absolutely want to do the right thing here and I don’t want my colleagues to to suffer for it either.

What if it is only 1 aluminum atom thick? Does it even make sense to talk about the ""acoustic impedance"" of a single atom layer? Does it depend on the sound frequency that it's reflecting?

Irrelevant note: I've been interested in sound/wave propagation for awhile, but I got to thinking about this because thunder makes my dog very nervous.

48,Should I email my boss and COO requesting more money?,1591304812,"I am currently interning for a company where I’m under appreciated and my workload keeps increasing. A couple of months ago my boss gave me a dollar raise which is only two dollars above minimum wage. I have a pretty good relationship with the COO and he’s mentioned that he doesn’t want me to leave the company and if I receive any offers I should go talk to him. A few weeks ago I decided to meet with him to talk about my pay. He said he would speak to the CFO and try to get me a bonus after I finished a project I’m working on. Two weeks passed and we had a follow up where he said that he thought the meeting was more about wanting guidance and better learning opportunities but it was clearly about pay. He told me to give him a week to see what he could come up with. It is now pretty much the end of the week and I am very frustrated and annoyed with my workload.

A bit about my background. I graduated with a **Mechanical Engineering** degree and now work in the oil and gas industry's midstream sector (a little bit of downstream too). I'm from a developing country.

I'm not trying to flex or anything but this information is necessary for what's to come. I've been a high merit student throughout my academic journey. I had straight As in high school which followed the Cambridge International Examination system, and even got into prestigious universities like UCLA, UT Austin, Manchester University etc. but couldn't attend due to the high living expenses and tuition fees (the aid received was not enough and I'm from a middle class family). I instead attended a public university, best known locally for its engineering education. This option was extremely cheap (total 5000$ for the whole degree) and held a local prestige too.

So far, I've been losing motivation to do anything engineering related. I think the main reason is because, after I graduated 2 years ago, I had already been applying to jobs a year earlier and still had no offer at my disposal. Even when I used to pass the employment tests of several companies, I would never get a call back. I had 6 months of internship experience fresh out of college.  I got an offer **8 months after graduating**, that too after applying a reference. This result was highly disappointing because I was hired not because of my skills, but because I knew a person working in that company. I had no choice as my bank balance was going negative.

I quickly realized that the employment space in my country is bereft with references, and you can't climb the corporate ladder without kissing the asses of the right people, regardless of how qualified you are. This culture has severely impacted me because I've been working extremely hard since childhood to have a career based on my skills rather than exalting any manager I meet.

My country is a net importer, and is not heavily industrialized. The limited mechanical engineering jobs that do exist, are not really related to 'mechanical engineering' but are management jobs disguised as an engineering job, so it doesn't really matter if you have the right 'skills'. Two years have passed and I have already forgot much of the technical knowledge I had when I graduated. 

Enough of the rant! I've been thinking of making a career change. Due to personal family problems, I cannot leave my country. I need career suggestions where my mathematical background can prove as a major asset and I'm paid for results rather than doing politics camouflaged as an engineering job.

So doing a design review, I found an interesting system. It was a typical 4 pipe chilled water and hot water system. All lines are separated, except for the fan coil units which have 6-way valves serving a single coil. Because of this, the engineer then hydronically joined the CHW and HW systems at the expansion tanks (imagine typical scenario two floor mounted expansion tanks, however a common line connects the two tanks with a single make up water assembly joining on this common line). When questioning the engineer, they stated both systems must operate at the same pressure, even if one system is operating a higher pressure than required.

I understand which similar pressures are needed, however even a slight pressure imbalance at the expansion tanks could result in flow between systems and I'm worried about possible thermal shock to the chiller. Also, if the expansion tanks are not connected at equal pressure points, equal pressure may never be realized. Why not just isolate the two systems, and set the pressures to be equal?

69,Help with engineering micromanager,1591277164,"Hi all,

I hope this is the right sub for this if not, apologies.

Mech eng, automotive sector.

Since WFH started, I've begun to notice the new level of micro management with my manager.

I researched the topic and found its either due to fear of failure and/or distrust in me as a professional to be able to solve problems.

Now I have been assigned a project that is very challenging and has a lot of new issues for the company. I understand my manager may be under pressure to solve issues for fear of upper management pressure but I feel its more than that.

I find any email he is copied in that has a new issue he is on to me about nearly straight away giving me no chance either to digest it, find any missing info and proposing my own solution based on my experience. He even did this in the daily morning team meeting and showed the email to my whole team and asked had I seen it yet, which it had only come through 30mins prior to that and I had been on another call during that time. I didn't know what to say other than I'll check it out after this call (which made me feel stupid and incompetent).

Whenever he requests a meeting to go over all the issues so he can ""catch up"", its basically him asking me 100 questions about the issues and giving no help with any of the work. Bearing in mind, all testing is done in China and its not so easy to get all or the right info from my Chinese colleagues as there is a natural language barrier. Plus, this project is very challenging and timelines are tight so everybody is under pressure and under resourced. I can ask the question to my colleagues but I may not get an answer and when that happens I feel like he holds me responsible for it.

I feel like a secretary rather an engineer at the moment and I want my manager to trust me more to let me at least try and solve the problem myself. The type of questions he is asking are not priority or integral in solving the issues, they are just so he can understand the problem better incase he gets asked a question from upper management. He is essentially doubling my workload at the moment with all these questions and slowing me down.

How do I convey to him that not every question needs to be answered because we either will never get that correct info or it won't solve the problem and is just wasting engineering time that could be spent on solving the issue.

There are not enough hours in the day for what he is asking me to do and I don't know how to say ""hey let me do my job the way I think it should be done and then you can assess on how I go about my day based on the results"" I'm not learning a thing by doing everything exactly the way he thinks it should be done. I'm getting very stressed and things are getting tense between us now in meetings and I feel like he thinks I'm not doing my job correctly and I don't think he appreciates how much is on my plates and that there are only so many hours in the day.

Any and all advice welcome.

I've always been really bad at group projects as I find it really hard to communicate with other people and get them to be on the same page with me. Whenever I work on group projects at school, the outcome is usually either:
 1) I do all the work

 2) I do nothing because my teammates never ask for my help and I don't have the courage to speak up for myself.

98,I need help rekindling lost flame for my major after a difficult degree,1591237085,"***cross posted***

Hi I have been hoping for some career advice, and things are only made worse by the pandemic. I'll try to explain below. This is honestly difficult for me to type out but I need the help.

I recently graduated in December with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering after a long stretch at university. I started university in 2013 and had always been actively engaged in engineering even since primary school. However my university experience was terrible. A few years into my degree I was assaulted by another student. This incident caused me to lose most of my friend group. I continued to push through schoolwork for several years, which made my grades suffer and I failed and retook several classes.  Although I approached my school about help several times I was never actually assisted, mentally or academically, except for an academic concession early on. 

Basically, my mental health severely impacted my confidence in team work and my ability for several years and that only changed in the last year of my degree where my mental health improved to the point of being able to function somewhat normally. Unfortunately, by the end of my degree, I was so frustrated at my useless school and my classmates that really my only objective was to finish the degree to get my diploma and get out as soon as I can. 

I always planned on taking a break after graduation, as my university was far from home, and I never got to spend much time with my family for years. Then the pandemic hit. Since I'm high risk, this has also been a very stressful and uncertain time under lockdown with no clear resolution in sight. Half a year has gone by and I'm still feeling totally uncertain, but my family has made it clear I need to get a job soon. 

I know that engineering is a somewhat less impacted industry than most right now, but I'm still finding it difficult to imagine onboarding at a company where I've never formally met any other staff, and I wont be able to work in their office. I have several years of work experience under my belt, but I have had to deal with sexist coworkers at every place I've worked. This is an environment I was not able to handle well, as it is extremely triggering to me and reminds me how widespread gender issues are in my program and the many bad experiences I went through before. 

My social anxiety progressed to the point that I felt like I would only ever be able to work in small or independently run engineering companies where I would be able to have control over who I interacted with. Although my mental health has improved significantly in the last few years, I've still felt that my work is impacted heavily when I'm in an uncomfortable work environment. I feel I cannot communicate as effectively with people who dont have the empathy to understand my experiences and needs, thus I find it difficult to collaborate with people I do not trust and who do not share the same respect and trust with me. I've never had many close female friends in my classes, so I'm kind of in the dark about how to build allyship and make connections with my peers.

I have some experience with independent business, but obviously this isn't a super viable option for someone just graduated with thousands of dollars of debt to begin with. And smaller female-run engineering companies are probably in short supply.

I still love my degree and I've always wanted to do something meaningful with it. But every time I try to work on job apps, I am honestly just reminded of the awful experiences I had while studying. I don't want to be stuck in this rut. I have an advanced degree and I should be able to easily find a job and start paying off bills and supporting myself, but I honestly feel retraumatized and terrified when I think about joining the job market. 

If anyone is out there with advice or experience about how to navigate job hunting and overcoming gendered violence in science and technology, please reach out.",AskEngineers,False,AggravatingVehicle3,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gw87ti/i_need_help_rekindling_lost_flame_for_my_major/
99,Got a rejection email a few hours after interview...should I email back?,1591236601,"I just graduated college last month and am on the job hunt. Earlier today, I finished a second interview with a company I applied for. It was with the hiring manager and head of the engineering team. I overall felt it went pretty well with me explaining my past experiences and projects and how they are relevant to the job as well as answering all the technical questions correctly. The hiring manager told me the next steps would be an onsite interview with a few more engineers (which would probably end up being a Skype interview because of all the COVID-19 stuff). He also mentioned that they are looking to hire a lot of new engineers as they are starting a new project soon. He ended saying he would most likely contact me again for a followup soon.

A few hours later I got an automated email from their HR that said that the position had been filled and I was not chosen for the job. This made me really discouraged I thought the interview went really well. Also, I don't really understand how they could've filled the position so fast since my interview, especially since the hiring manager mentioned that they are looking for multiple new grads for this position.

8,Feels like I am losing the game - how to bounce?,1591226651,"Hey guys,

Looking for advice with a bit of venting. I feel like I'm piling up mistakes in my career and failing to adapt.

Background:

After my engineering degree (and a bit of experience in startups) I did a PhD program.

Field: Lasers and optoelectronics (plus a bit of material engineering).

Strong research and R&amp;D profile.

Joined a big (10K+ employees) company 2 years ago as an R&amp;D engineer/researcher.

The problem is, most of the company staff has either a marketing background or sales background.

Even though the company has a research centre (where I'm part of) I feel like science and technical stuff isn't very valued, even among engineers here, and what makes people interested in are: how to organize meetings, how knows who, how to come up with a new rule or regulation, meetings, how to establish partnerships and basically outsource most of scientific work to another (usually smaller) company.

At first in the first year or so, I tried to build an experimental lab/bench related to company's activity as I thought it could be of value to the company. I noticed many of the outsourced stuff could be easily be done by, for example, me or some other member of the team at a much lesser cost and higher speed, thus increasing research rate, and increase company's know-how a bit. For that I was frowned upon as they see that below my qualifications and 'executive' status, as this kind of work should supposedly be done by a technician.

Everybody strives to be a project manager, just manager, or some kind of project lead. So I tried to adapt and help with ongoing projects (meetings, emails and sitting on my chair). Problem is - I'm bored, and getting overshadowed by my ""teammates"" (which frankly are just competitors). I see lots of ""engineers"" (which have low training nor interest in a specific field) beating me up as they know how to speak, especially about money, cost, markets, and schedules. I see people get promoted despite HUGE technical mistakes and flaws (which resulted in some terrible products with negative margins). I feel like loudspeaking, one-upping, stealing ideas, interrupting and trying to look important/dominating is what works to advance in ones career.

Then I tried to adapt and outsource my scientific ideas and pilot my own projects. Problem is: for this to get successful, I need budget and funding, which is usually given by - guess who? The marketing. And, as they hate everything technical or truly innovative - most of my projects are torn apart. 

So I'm stuck here, powerless and like a cockroach on his back trying to get on his feet.

They want to ""clarify my role in the design of the product.""  We went over all this when I was working there.  

I played a *major* role in the reduction to practice.  I was there from the start, when marketing said they wanted a product that could do ""X"". I was part of the laborious brainstorming meetings to generate ideas for how to do X. I worked with marketing to develop the requirements for the product and defined what ""doing X"" really means, in a measurable way.  
I designed and built prototypes to do X.  I tested and evaluated those prototypes.  

The project was done with a cross-functional team, but the majority of the work was done by me (mechanical) and another engineer (materials).  

We produced a pilot-run of the product and supplied it to beta testers under NDA.  

Along the way, I submitted an invention disclosure within the company.  
I worked with the company legal department on the patent application. I helped them in evaluating their search for prior art.  I produced the drawings to be used in the patent.  

The project had just cleared a major gate and was green-lit for production as they laid-off my department and moved our functions to an office overseas.

15,Is foam formed when seawater is pumped into pipes?,1591220419,"Hi, fellow humans!

What is the nature of foam formation when a fluid pumped into pipes? And specifically when we are talking about seawater?. Just in case, I'm not referring to foam formation like in the fire protection systems.

I know seawater contains surfactants that, in turbulent conditions, trap air forming bubbles that maintain adhesion by surface tension. But when using piping systems to transport seawater (or any other fluid that contains surfactants) from a storage tank or the actual sea, I'm not so sure about how it actually works.

Let's see if I can let you know my thought process and questions:

Almost all industrial piping system have developed turbulent flow profile or disturbed flow profile (I use this term just trying to oversimplify the pipe accesories) which, in theory, will provide good conditions for the formation of bubbles.

Pipe systems will maintain certain condition of positive gauge static pressure (unless it were neccesary otherwise, but those are other cases) which I think is going to have the opposite effect on foam formation.

I also know that there is dissolved air in water and, under proper pressure conditions, it can form bubbles.

It is obvious that pressure will have an effect on the foam formation, but:

1. Is actually foam formed when a fluid with the amount of surfactants (or foaming agents) as seawater is pumped into pipes?
2. If so, What are the effects of pressure and velocity on concentration, diameter and mean life?
3. And If the right answer to the first question is no, why?

I hope this finds you in a really good mood and have great days!

Take care.

35,Can I use moments to calculate equivalent load in a telescoping drawer design?,1591204538,"Forgive me if this is an inappropriate question for this forum - I'm struggling to find an answer! I am a non-practicing Civil engineer and haven't needed to do any static calculations in over 12 years.

I'm working on a project and I have the need to build a telescoping drawer like this: [https://imgur.com/a/ALf89D5](https://imgur.com/a/ALf89D5)

The drawer is going to be wide (60"") and have a heavy load (45-50 pounds).

My question is, since drawer slides just have a pound load rating, would it be appropriate to use equivalent moments to determine the proper load rating for my first (outermost) slide?

**Example:**

&gt;The outermost slide is 14 inches long and rated for 100 pounds. Let's assume the  drawer is fully loaded and is evenly distributed. I think we can simplify this to be a point load, located 7 inches away from the first screw in the static/receiving slide. This means I've got 100lb \* 7in or a 700in-lb moment on that first screw.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If I then add a second drawer, which extends another 14 inches past the first drawer, I've moved my load from 7 inches, another 7 inches to be 14 inches away from the first slides. This doubles my moment arm, meaning to maintain the same moment, my load would have to decrease by half, to 50 pounds.

Does this seem like a reasonable way to ensure I am buying appropriately rated drawer slides? There's obviously a component of shear strength of the fasteners I use to attach the slides, but if I have issues with that, I can use a through bolt to get additional strength.",AskEngineers,False,huskrfreak88,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gvy13v/can_i_use_moments_to_calculate_equivalent_load_in/

I joined the military fresh out of college, and I’ve got a little under two years left on my contract.

I either have trouble explaining this, or people have trouble understanding it, but my office in the military does not have me doing anything.  It’s my opinion the office has no use for an engineer, but the higher ups love using the “engineer” buzzword.  I made the decision rather quickly to get out so I could actually use my degree, and I started working on a master’s in computer engineering focusing on high performance computing.  Ultimately, my goal is to go into research and get a PhD, but I want some actual real world experience first.

40,Bad crisis after graduation and help to keep a positive attitude,1591202171," Good afternoon everyone,

I’m  having a bad crisis lately. I’ve recently graduated as an Aerospace  Engineer, maximum grades. The Covid crisis hit just before my  graduation. Since february everything went downhill. After years of  fairly well being, some of my chronic health problems worsened, the job  market entered a crisis, I had to cancel my graduation travel in asia  that I planned a year ago and saved money for for years. I lost also  some money since few airlines didn’t want to refund. In summary, this  2020 didn’t start good at all. Since I cannot enjoy my vacations, I  tried to start looking for a job. At least I can start earning some  money instead of just spending them.

It’s  been a few months and I have got absolutely no luck. I’ve started  thinking and reasoning on brought me to this situation and I figured  that, even if it’s not completely my fault, I have done many mistakes. I  wanted then to share my thoughts with you, to ask for help, for tips,  for opinions. This will be more like a flux of thoughts. It will be long  and probably not written too well. I hope you can forgive me.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  The  Covid-19 crisis hit the aerospace market really hard, and I graduated  exacly when the crisis hit harder. Friends of mine that graduated in  december already have a job, they could work during the quarantine, get  some money, pass probably flew faster for them.While  I’m looking for a job, I just keep thinking of how many opportunities I  could have found if I graduated earlier, how many opportunities are not  here anymore, how many companies are not hiring anymore, and how many  don’t want to spend money and invest in a freshly graduated engineers  with no experience. At the moment I really feel like stopping applying,  because no one answers me. Moreover, I’m scared that even if I can find a  job, this will be about stuff and duties that I’m not interested in, in  a company/industry/sector that I’m not interested in. The chances of  getting a job I like have shrinked a lot in the last months.

2.  I like aerodynamics and propulsion. My dream would be working on  aircraft aerodynamics, or even better aircraft engines. Alternatevely,  I’d like to work in the motorsport industry, or as a propulsion engineer  in the space industry. Unfortunately, most of the jobs I’ve found are  about structure/mechanical analysis, a mix of engineering and I.T.  (softwares, firmwares, sensors and avionics), or CAD modeling. I’m  worried that it will be impossible to land the job I want at the moment,  with no experience. I’ll need to accept a job that it’s not about my  interests. That would be ok at the beginning, right? It’s still some  work experience in the industry. The biggest worry is that I’d be  starting to get experience on the “wrong” subject. After 3 years as a  structural analisys or software development, who would hire me as a CFD  analyst. And why I should even try to search for a job as a CFD analyst?  It would be much easier just to search for a job as a structural  engineer. I’m sure I’d get paid even more since I’d have 3 years of  experience. In summary, I’m worried about starting my career in the  wrong sector, and to be bound in that path forever

3.  I’m having an hard time trying to get a job about aerodynamics and  fluid dynamics also because I don’t have experience, not even from uni.  My thesis was about experimental aerodynamics, I’ve worked a little in a  wind tunnel. Other than that, nothing. My uni didn’t even had a course  about CFD. I’ve only done courses about theoretical fluid dynamics and  aero. All the stuff of CFD I’ve learned, I’ve learned by myself. My  knowledge of Fluent is still pretty basic, even less with OpenFOAM. I’m  working on it, trying to follow some Udemy courses, youtube videos,  online resources etc. I’m proceeding really slow, and my knowledge is  still basic. I’m sad, because my uni haven’t thought me the thing I was  most interested in. I never had the money to go to another uni in  another city, so this was the only way to become an aerospace engineer.  To work on aerodynamics, tho, I’d really need to find a company that is  willing to invest on me, knowing that I won’t be productive for the  company for months, while I learn.

4.  One of the biggest mistake I’ve done during uni is that I’ve never done  extra curricular activities. In my country internships are not  mandatory, and are really not common. I just studied and I passed my  exams, and that’s it. I did have some opportunities: I could join the  formula student team for example. I didn’t. I didn’t joined the team,  nor I partecipated to other extracurricular activities like students  projects and labs etc. I studied and passed my exams. That’s it. But  it’s not enough for the job market. My accademic knowledge is not worth  much. I really feel the weight of this wrong choice. Joining the formula  student team, for example, and graduate later or with lower grades,  would have been much better to prepare myself for the actual job marked.  And indeed, while I was serching for a job, I figured that most if not  all the motorsport teams wanted some formula student experience. Moreover, I have no useful certifications on my CV, something useful for the real world indutry.

5.  As a proof for this, I saw that a few student collegues, that had lower  grades, didn’t study that much, sometimes even copied the exams or  projects but they did join some uni team or done some extensive extra  curricular activities. They’ve found a good job, or at least an  internship in a related field. Pretty sad that all my hardwork is worth  nothing, but also I feel stupid not to have thought about this before,  and I understand why a company is not interested too much in the  academic results.

6. In my  country, the aerospace industry is small, and most companies do software  development, avionics, sensors and similar stuff I’m not interested in.  I’m in the EU, so it should be easy to find a job abroad, but: I only  know english as a second language, and I have no experience. Most of the  best countries for aerospace jobs in EU requires to know German,  French, Dutch languages. Also seems like is super hard to get a job  without experience. Seems like I’m stuck in the crappy aerospace market  of my country.

7. Showing that I’m  willing and able to work abroad and easily adapt, I’ve done a 6 months  erasmus in UK, where I wrote my master thesis. I thought having an  Erasmus experience in the CV, work alone abroad, write a thesis in a  non-native language, all of this was a big plus and a huge boost to get a  job. Turns out seems like no one cares, that’s nothing special and  pretty average or that people think you do erasmus just to have fun.

8.  There’s a feeling that’s been haunting me since forever: that I know  many things, but not deeply enough. And I know that it’s not just a  feeling, it’s the truth. There’s really nothing I know deeply. I’ve done  and studied many things in my life, but there nothing I’ve been  actually good at. I’ve been crap, or decent at most, with maybe few  moments of good or great, but that’s it. I know nothing really well, I’m  not good a nothing. I just have a broad but superficial knowledge of  many things. This is one of the things that really haunts me and make me  feel sad. I also saw some jobs interview that my friends had to do, and  I have to say that I woul’ve completely unprepared for them. I am  willing to study and learn stuff more deeply to be better at my job, but  I need to find one first. And then, will I be able to actually learn  and become a good engineer? Will I become productive and useful for the  company? Will I be able to work alone and make choices alone? I don’t  feel that good nor that smart. I don’t have a brilliant mind, nor a good  immagination and open mind. I’m not stupid, but I’m average. Not  brilliant. Probably good enough for a standard office job, but not to be  a good, innovative, smart engineer. I’m also not good to handle stress,  even more when I’m left alone. I usually need support at the beginning  of a project, research of whatever. Not doing good in stressfull  situations is bad for an engineers. I’d never write this on a CV, but  it’s the truth.

9. I’m facing now  the truth that probably I won’t be able to have my dream career, and  probably that I’ll be an average worker. I don’t want to be rich, or  famous or powerful, but I wanted to have a good life, with a job with a  good salary where I worked in a field I liked and that would let  partecipate in some good and important projects. I have this feeling,  though, that I’ll need to accept that I’ll have a normal office job,  with an average salary, probably in a field related to engineering but I  won’t work on the stuff I really want to.

10.  Sometimes, I think that it’s not worth to work as an engineer,  especially if you don’t like what you are doing. Too much brain power  wasted, too much head aches stress for something you don’t like. I’m  worried that if I’ll find a job I don’t like, I’ll suffer a lot for it  while not gaining anything back.

11.  In my last months before graduation, when I started  looking for a job,  I started having some regrets on my choices. This became even worse  when I found out that a year prior, in my country, an aircraft engineers  academies opened. After finding this out, I’ve been even more haunted  by the feeling that I’ve choosen the wrong career path. When I joined  the uni, I was young, and I didn’t know about all the possibilities of  the job marked. Now I know what I want, and I feel like I’d prefer to  work as a aircraft engineer instead of a aerospace engineer, meaning  that I’d much prefer to actually work on the aircraft and the engines,  phisically, than studying and developing them. I also saw that in my  country these aircraft engineers get paid really well and even more than  the average aerospace engineer. I’ve been evaluating, now, after 5  years of uni, to switch my carrer and join the academy. This would mean  to waste 2 to 4 more years of my life. Also I do not have the money to  pay for it.

12. About the money,  it’s incredible how sad the salaries are in my country, particularly for  new engineers. An average engineer gets paid a little more than a  office worker (1500-2000€ pm after years of experience, if you work for a  good company). New engineers get much less. A company asked me to move  in another city and do a 3 years apprendiceship for 400€ pm. How the  hell can I live alone in another city for 3 years with 400€ pm? Also it  seems unfair that after 5 years of uni and hardwork, I get paid this  much. Even with no experience, I’ve still studied hard to work an higher  level job. Seems like uni was a bad investment, since my friends that  started working after highschools have been living alone for a while,  and with 5 years experience now they have a good salary. How can I live  with my parents for 3 more years now, while I get underpaid to do a long  apprendiceship. This way, at 30 years all I’ll be still stuck in my  home town, in my parents house.

This  are most of the thoughts that have been hunting me lately. This 2020 is  really going downhill for me as for most of the people. Bad things are  happening everywhere. I know that my problems are nothing compared to  the issues that are emerging in the world lately. But I really wanted to  write all of this somewhere, and I’d really like to have your opinions.  Suggestions and tips are also welcomed.

Thank you very very much.

Purpose built rubber bullet guns have the same angle. However everything I have read about rubber bullets indicates that they are intended to be fired at a lower angle, below the target, towards the ground between the shooter and the target. I would assume that it would be easier to fire this kind of gun correctly if the barrel were angled downward relative to their hand grips.

43,"Computer engineering job? (more hardware, less programming)",1591199452,"I am currently in the first year at computer engineering. I didn't do much programming in highschool, so I didn't really develop a passion for it. Now I am doing some programming courses at university, but I'm still not very interested in those. I just think programming is not for me. On the other hand, I had a course ""Logical Design"" (with logic gates, secvential systems etc) and I really enjoyed that. I know that I have 3 more years to finish my bachelors (and maybe 2 years of masters after that), but I want to have an idea of what I would want to do in the future (as a job), so that I can focus on certain subjects and gain knowledge of those in my free time. So here are a few questions:

* 1) What computer engineering jobs would involve more hardware and less software(programming). Something around 75% hardware and 25% software?
* 2) Is it true that hardware engineering jobs are  a lot harder to get than software engineering ones? From what I've heard, there is a lot of competition from electrical engineers in the hardware area.
* 3) Is embedded systems development a good choice for my preferences or it is mainly based on software development (programming). I know i will have some courses of embedded systems and microcontrollers in the third year, but I'm curious right now about them. If you are working with them, will you mostly do programming or other hardware-ish stuff? 
* 4) What non-intensive programming jobs could i get in the automotive industry with a background of computer engineering?

I find it difficult to set a target of what I want to do in the future, because a lot of other computer engineering students want to go into software development, but i don't fancy it. I don't hear much about other possibilities and I want to know what could i do that involves more hardware and maybe a little software.

59,Need help sizing the bore diameter on an orifice plate to achieve an low flow in an high flow system,1591189056,"Morning everyone, So I got tasked with figuring what size diameter we need on two orifice plates in a small system were making. It's a system that will allow a high flow and a low flow, the high flow not needing an orifice plate with it's flow rate going up to 50gpm, but we have a line that branches off for the low flow that will be working from 0-10gpm due to the VFD not being able to control the the pump accurately at such low flow, so we will be using an orifice plate to achieve. 

I mainly need help with figuring out the sizing... Or which formulas to use. Since it's been a few years since I've done some math/physics like this lol. I will try and post a picture of the low flow branch. 

Essentially for the low flow, the main flow will be coming in at 0-60gpm at no more than 50psi. It will then tee, one branch going back to the tank with an orifice plate that we want 0-50gpm while the other branch that will go to the unit under test, will be the orifice plate we require to achieve 0-10 gpm at a pressure of 0-25psi. So we want to be able to have the pump running at say, 30hz(30gpm) and between the two branches, want to see 25 gpm one way, and 5 gpm the other.

I encountered the Vortex shedding concept looking for an experimental way of creating an instrument. 

I got the concept more or less clear, but my studies are in the ultrasound department. Fluid dynamics is something new for me and I have the feeling I'm missing something basic. 

For a plan traveling at 800km/h, and an d= 1m, the Vortex shedding frequency would be around 160Hz, which makes sense and is something that I understand you want to avoid since the wavelength is close to the wingspan. 
Some resonance and we've a problem Houston. 

Based on my calculations, I should be able to create an vortex shedding frequency of 100Hz, using an object with an diameter of 1 mm. This is for an St around 0,2, and an estimated air velocity of  5m/s. 

Fv = St*v/d

Now, on paper this is amazing, but I don't think this held up in real life. I just realized that if this was true, swinging anything close to 1 mm of diameter at a medium velocity, should create low frequency sound.

87,"New grad EE, feeling lost at work, need some guidance / advice.",1591131483,"Hi guys,

I joined this company with a year of experience under my belt in a different industry of EE. When I joined my current company, their motto was all ""Engineering First"" and ""We take the time to train you"" and ""If you're not sure, just ask, don't sit there pulling your hair out"". 

It's been about 5 months since I joined, the first 3 I did nothing but create a training manual based on my previous experience. I only started working on design projects recently.

Whenever I'm given a task, I ask clarifying questions to make sure I know exactly what to do. There are often a couple of ways to reach the final conclusion and so I typically will ask my more experienced colleagues for advice on the BEST approach. I will lay out what I've come up with and the pros and cons, but I really don't have experience to say which one is the best and look to them for some mentoring / guidance. 

Today my manager gave me a task I've never done before, then 2 hours later told me that he needed it for a meeting in 15 minutes. I typically ask how soon he needs a task but didn't today and was kind of blind sided by this. Apart from that, he asked asked me why we did something a specific way when I finally submitted it. I told him that I had applied the same solution that someone else had done on the same task a while back and his answer was ""You can't just say that"". So I told him that he's right, which he is, and that I'll find out why by referring to whoever came up with the solution and get back to him ASAP because I really didn't know why. He wouldn't budge though and said ""No, you need to understand what you are drawing without people always telling you otherwise you will never learn."" 

I'm confused, how can I ever learn something that I've never seen before in my life without asking? On top of that, they specifically told me to ASK and not to sit there twisting my hair. It feels like I'm being flamed for asking, but when I don't ask, I get flamed for not asking sooner? 

There's a lot that I don't know, and sitting there trying to figure everything out on my own means that I'm not productive. I can't meet the strict deadlines and stay billable if I'm supposed to figure it out on my own.",AskEngineers,False,eenewgrad123,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gvfoh3/new_grad_ee_feeling_lost_at_work_need_some/
88,Question regarding Manufacturing engineering Intern responsibilities and Pay,1591129048,"Okay so I’ve just joined this subreddit and would like some advice or guidance. I have been working as the “manufacturing engineering intern” for a transformer company for about 5 months now. When I first started I was not told how long the internship was for but since I’ve already finished school and would like experience in the field I didn’t mind. When I first started I didn’t really have much to do but I went ahead and spoke to all the operators and technicians to look for problems I could dabble in and try to fix. I later learned that no one here is actually trying to make any improvements. They are content with the products going and and the money coming in so the plant manager doesn’t care about anything else and also doesn’t seem to have any knowledge of the industry or the manufacturing and he’s been here for 15 years. So my main responsibilities were to make sure people came into work, schedule the jobs coming in i.e. when engineering should have everything done, when the material has to get here and when it should be ready and prepped to ship. On my own I went ahead and started to work on fixture improvements to reduce set up times and little stuff here and there. I am also part of the 5S meetings and have made some improvements with organization and space. Again that was just because I wanted to be involved but wasn’t necessary. Three months into this I had an evaluation meeting with the plant manager where he told me he was happy with my work but could only give me a dollar raise which is 2 dollars above minimum wage. I didn’t mind because we spoke about a mechanical design position opening up in the engineering building which I would have “first dibs on”. He then asked if I wanted him to extend my internship because apparently someone told him I was looking for a job. Now because of COVID the person that was suppose to retire is delaying his retirement and the position won’t be available for a few more months. I did not mind very much but my workload has been increasing and they aren’t doing their best to keep us safe. I am currently working on a procedure that they want to move elsewhere to save on money plus my usual work of scheduling jobs, tending the supervisors making sure we get the correct information when we find errors with drawings. I also have to help with all the forms HR/Payroll needs. What has pushed me over the top is the fact that now they want me to schedule covid appointments for 50 people weekly and track the results on top of everything else and I’m still just getting paid 15 dollars an hour. I don’t know what to do because quite frankly I can probably find a job driving for amazon and I’d be getting more with less responsibility and I’d work alone.

98,Draining liquid in a flat plane.,1591121451,"Greetings! I work in the agricultural field and was looking for help with an engineering problem I'm having with drainage. Terribly sorry if the 'mechanical' flair was the wrong one to use. Didn't know which one was applicable.   


I've got rectangular irrigation tables that are essentially OSB sheets with metal roofing attached on the top side, and caster wheels installed on the bottom side. The dimensions are 8ft 'long' by 4ft 'wide'. The caster wheels are a couple of inches taller on the 'back side' than the ones in the 'front side' to create a slope, letting the water drain to the 'front side'. There's a gutter attached to the front side that collects the water.  


Now the problem. Where does the water go from the gutter? Context;  


\- There are floor drains within 10 meters of the beds.  
\- The cement floor isn't sloped properly towards drains.  
\- Water cannot spill onto the floor, it needs to be contained in tubing/piping.  
\- The beds are much too close to the ground for condensate pumps (roughly 6 inches off the ground).  
\- If a pump will be involved, keeping it to a single pump would be ideal for energy consumption, but if more need to be involved that's ok.  
\- The beds must be able to move a foot or so in any direction (hence the caster wheels) for workers to access plants.  
\- We cannot drill into the concrete to create basins/drainage networks, etc. All work must be done above ground.
