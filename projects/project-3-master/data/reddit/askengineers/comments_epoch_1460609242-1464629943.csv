0,Modeling muscles and tendons in the spine - how would I scale them to match body characteristics such as height and weight?,1464627758,"Hey all,

I'm working on a model of the spine and I need to incorporate tendons and muscles.  This information is not known well as far as I can tell.  I can find some data on stiffnesses but I'm dealing with young girls instead of adults, so I'm guessing their values will be less stiff than data found in literature.  I'm not expecting perfect accuracy so I'm looking for a simple logical relationship to modify the values.

I'm thinking it might correlate with height, weight or a vertebral dimension.  Simply scaling forces proportional to weight makes basic sense to me but I'm wondering if anyone's got better insight.

Any ideas?

Edit: I just found out that intervertebral disc loads scale linearly with weight so I imagine the other resistive structures work the same.  Best guess so far.",AskEngineers,AOEUD,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4lqgxg/modeling_muscles_and_tendons_in_the_spine_how/

2,Why aren't cars powder coated instead of painted?,1464615016,"So I've been watching some How-It's-Made type of programs this weekend, and they've been all automotive based.  

Each of the cars that were documented, the painting process was incredibly complicated and seemingly expensive and time consuming.  It looked like the primer was potentially power coat for at least one of the cars - they would spray dry primer with the body sheet metal taking an electrical charge and then that would be baked on at which point the powder would melt to a smooth finish.

So why not just powder coat the paint itself?  Powder coating typically gives a *much* harder finish than a regular paint job can offer, and it sounds like most of these car factories already have the equipment and process to bake on powders.

Is it simply a cost issue or more of an aesthetic problem?  I might be wrong, but I believe powder coating can't give you quite the same gorgeous finish that a paint can.  ",AskEngineers,Szos,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4lpipm/why_arent_cars_powder_coated_instead_of_painted/

4,Civil engineer in need of career guidance!,1464612758,"First, my background story: I earned a BS in civil engineering on an ROTC scholarship in 2010. I originally planned on making the Army my career, but feeling disillusioned with the military I got out after just five years. I then went to work for a small architectural engineering firm in Missouri as a lowly EIT making a modest salary. A few months later, I discovered that the Missouri Board counts military service as professional engineering experience, and applied to take the PE Exam.  After receiving the green light to take the test and get the license, I shared the news with my boss and mentioned how I hoped the new credential would get me a managerial spot further down the road (he’s the only PE in the company.) 

Turns out that wasn’t a good idea: a few days later, I was abruptly laid off. I suppose he realized that me becoming a PE would increase my personal human capital without increasing my value to the company. I can’t say I blame him: why invest more resources training a guy who might leave you for a better-paying job somewhere else?

Now I have a dilemma: should I dedicate the next few months to studying for the PE exam, or should I actively look for a job? Would it be to my advantage to wait until I have the PE to start applying, so I won’t be viewed as some upstart? Would a six-month gap in employment look bad on a resume? I have no debt, vast savings, and live very frugally so money is not an issue. I’m also doing an online master’s program on the GI Bill, so that also keeps me busy.

Any advice from seasoned professional engineers will be greatly appreciated.

20,economical or diy method to balance an exhaust fan impeller?,1464488385,"tl;dr Im looking for advice on balancing an exhaust fan impeller to get a smoother running fan at a higher speed than originally designed.

The issue is a 12"" diameter, 2 inch deep impeller exhaust fan that is in the heated exhaust of a coffee roaster. It is pressed onto the shaft of a 1hp single phase  flange mounted 1700 rpm motor and life is good but I want to get adjustability of the flow to both below and above original design, so I replaced the motor with a 3400 rpm 3 phase motor and use a teco 3 phase converter to run the motor at 30hz to achieve the equivalent speed of the previous 1700 rpm motor. 

But alas my goal is to get higher flow than that and when increasing the speed to the 2000-2500 rpm it has every indication of an out of balance impeller, so noise increases considerably, but the issue is actually vibrations that cant be dampened easily, and it will eventually eat the bearings. at around 50hz, it hits a very pronounced resonance then decreases some at 60 hz (3400 rpm). 

The motor without the impeller is smooth and vibration free.

The impeller is 1/8"" plate steel with 12 curved ribs, it looks similar to this 

&lt;blockquote class=""imgur-embed-pub"" lang=""en"" data-id=""jceBbGm""&gt;&lt;a href=""//imgur.com/jceBbGm""&gt;View post on imgur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=""//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js"" charset=""utf-8""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

but it is welded and of turkish origin of 15-20 years ago so while functional it is not a precision piece, and it met its original design need of 1700 rpm relatively vibration free. Not perfect but fine at 1700 rpm.

Im not aware if there is a reasonably priced ($100-150) service that can be performed, or better yet is there a DIY method that someone can suggest that  would be able to better balance the problem impeller? I have access to metal working tools, but since it is pressed onto the shaft removing and pressing on repeatably is a pain so I want to have a better understanding before I proceed. Or maybe there is a service that you can suggest that could do this?

26,Is Transferring Schools Worth the Costs (Computer Science to Electrical Engineering)?,1464474093,"I'm a 20-year-old, still living with my parents, and pursuing a BA in Computer Science from a decently-regarded state university. Since my family is fairly poor, Financial Aid covers about 85% of my school expenses, and will continue to do so for another 4-5 semesters (which should be enough time for me to finish my degree, if I hurry up). If finishing my degree takes any longer, I will be forced to pay the full amount: $8K/semester. If necessary, my parents are prepared to hep me - though we're not wealthy, as I've said.
I have already transferred twice before. The first college I've attended proved to be a for-profit (I was too immature to do proper research back then), so I transferred to a state school, but couldn't afford off-campus housing long term (and commuting 1.5 hours wasn't an option), so I transferred again. The current state school I'm attending is good in all regards, except for one: it does not offer an Electrical Engineering program. I'm interested in both, EE as well as CS, and I guess that from an employability point of view it doesn't really matter which one I pursue since both are in high-demand and well-paying. However, I figure that with an EE degree, I will have broader opportunities, since I'd get exposure to close-to-the-metal concepts of computers in addition to programming, data structures and algorithms. Effectively, as an EE applicant, I could work within software as well as hardware, whereas as a CS applicant, I would for the most part be limited to software. Furthermore, I find it easier to self-teach software than hardware. Because of the benefits of EE, I'm considering transferring to a different state school, which offers a degree in EE.
The school that's on my mind is roughly the same price, and within the same commuting distance. Unfortunately, though, very few of my CS credits would transfer into their engineering program, and the transfer would delay my graduation by 3 semesters or likely more. In addition, I'd also lose Financial Aid for those last semesters, each costing the full price of about $8K (3 * 8 = 24K total or more if takes me more than 3 semesters).
As a side note, I'd like to add that my main career-oriented goal is to create my own business or startup. I'm prepared to work a 9-5 for a few years first, but it's not my ultimate goal. Because I'd be more versatile after completing the EE degree - knowing both hardware and software - I think it would broaden my possibilities in starting my own venture.
I'd like to get a second opinion on whether the advantages of the engineering degree are worth the costs of transferring. Right now, I'm leaning towards ""no"", since I'm in a poor financial state, but I don't trust myself on this, since I've already transferred 2 times before.

38,Enviro or Mechanical Engineering?,1464394227,"I'm having trouble deciding which to go into. I've wanted to be a mechanical engineer since before I knew what it was.

But now that im in school I find the math is quite challenging, and I don't want an office job doing equations all day.

As far as environmental Engineering, I enjoy being outside and going to new places. I've recently found water very interesting. There is a lot of things that are in it and a lot of things it's involved in. Chemistry is the most difficult class I've taken yet. It is cool to understand how Chem works but it's like a set of exceptions with a few rules, rather than the normal set of rules with exceptions. 

I like seeing what I'm doing actually accomplish something, and not like building a house or taking water samples. A better way to do something. I want to make a better house or get the water clean.

Right now I'm in the middle. M.E. fits what I like doing more, but I like to work on my feet and I don't want to spend hours on excel every day. Enviro lets me be outside and help people(im a nice person) but I really don't care too much about the environment. Like the engineer who invented the tampon.

50,Torque and Motor Requirement,1464343706,"Hello all,

First let me start by giving a basic idea about my system. I have a motor and gearbox (details below) connected to a shaft which has two sets of gears on it. These gears have 48 teeth and 30 teeth respectively. The 48 teeth gear is connected to another shaft which has 12 teeth and the 30 teeth one is connected to another gear of 30 teeth whose shaft is hollow. So I get a 1:4 and a 1:1 ratio in my system. 
Two solid SS discs are attached via couplers to the two output shafts. I have an 18 inch diameter disc connected to the hollow shaft (which rotates at the 1:1 ratio) and another slightly smaller disc connected to the 12 gear shaft. 
The motor we used was a Panasonic Motor (Model Number - M91Z90GV4L) max speed of 1400 RPM and the gearbox used had a 36:1 reduction ratio (Model number - MZ9G36B). 

According to my calculations, I need a torque of approximately 0.36 Nm.
I obtained this by first calculating the masses of the two discs, and their couplers. My total mass was around 8.72 Kgs. I then calculated the Moment of Inertia (I) by using the formula: I = (1/2)*M*(R^2) = (0.5 * 8.72 * 0.4572 m) = 0.91 kg.m^2
If I need a speed of 15 RPM, I calculated the Angular Velocity 'w' = (RPM*2*pi)/60 = 1.57 rad/s. 
This would be my final angular velocity. Then calculated Angular acceleration 'a' = w/t.
Now I'm confused with 't' here. i'm guessing t is the time required for me to achieve my speed. I took this as 4 seconds. So basically I want to achieve my angular speed in 4 seconds. 
Therefore 'a' = w/t = 1.57/4 = 0.393 rad/s^2

And therefore torque = I*a = 0.91 * 0.393 = 0.358 Nm. 
Obviously I haven't taken friction into consideration. The discs rest on thin 3mm circular acyrlic sheets oiled which drastically reduces my friction. It's not perfect but it works. Now with this torque requirement, and a 90 W power motor, what kind of gearbox do I use? The data sheet says the motor has a starting torque of 0.56 Nm. So this is higher than my minimum requirement. A 36:1 reduction gives me a torque rating of 13.1 Nm (data sheet). Yet my system struggles to get the discs moving. What am I missing and any suggestions would be welcome.

My company has been having issues with a specific molded polycarbonate part made by our vendor. Sometimes the part is cloudy and does not meet our drop test standards and shatters. When the part is properly made it is clear and tough enough to withstand any fracturing when dropped. My company's solution is to place the Charpy Impact Test result (J/cm^2) for the polycarbonate material's toughness on their drawings to the vendor. If we do that, I figure we should also include the flexural strength or modulus for stiffness. (Which would be more helpful to the vendor?). 

I am new to this and we don't have a more experienced mechanical engineer to ask about this.

56,Designing a crank rocker ratchet mechanism,1464293738,"I'd like to build a metal shaper similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/806PN7D.jpg) one. The mechanism on the right side of the picture is a crank rocker mechanism that is attached to a ratchet and pawl to turn the screw. The head is connected to the screw, and the head is advanced along the bed as it cuts by that screw. A common feature on the crank rocker system is the ability to change the rotational angle of the ratchet so that the feed per stroke of the head is increased or decreased. This feature is what I have been having trouble with. 

Ideally, I'd like to have 3 settings on the crank so that the angle of the rocker advances by x teeth, 2x teeth, and 3x teeth. Am I wrong in thinking that to advance the rocker by x, 2x, and 3x teeth that the arc of the rocker needs to be x°, 2x°, and 3x°?

I have the formula for a crank rocker system entered into an excel sheet, but I don't have any hard numbers to base my entries on, so I have just been plugging in random figures, focusing on changing the length of the shortest segment to vary the arc. Invariably, I end up with some random angles for the rocker like 45.6°, 55.3°, and 67.1°. 

The formula I copied from a public domain textbook uses the lengths as inputs and the angle as the output. The simple solution to my problem appears to be to change the angle to an input and the length of the shortest segment to the output, but I don't know how to do that correctly and I haven't found any discussion of doing so online. Is that the right method to find the proper length, or am I missing something?

I need a vacuum chamber that's about 18X18X18"" inside dimensions (the outside dimensions would be design driven). I need it for a research project in my lab. Commercial vacuum chamber of this size costs around $5000, which is 10 times my budget. Therefore, I was hoping to build my own. I could work with at least one side being acrylic, or all sides made of acrylic or polycarbonate. I do need to pass current through one of its face, probably using feed-throughs? (suggestions welcomed). So, I have couple of major concerns that I was hoping you guys could help me with or point me in the right direction.

A) I know with increasing area of the chamber, the load on the walls increase, and therefore need to be taken care of. However, I am not sure, what exact physical parameter for load, I need to take care of.
So, for example, for a 18X18 sq.in. acrylic sheet that's 1"" thick, the load on that face would be 14.69X18X18 ~ 4760 lbs. However, for 1"" thick acrylic, I am not sure what and how to compare the 4760 lbs to. Young's Modulus? Tensile Strength? Ultimate Tensile Strength? What am I supposed to take care of here?

B) How do I figure out the loads on the side face? Does it change with height? Or is it the same?

C) What would be the best way to glue the sides if I am using acrylic? Does anyone know of glue/adhesive/silicon-based-adhesive, anything, that would work best for vacuum work?

D) Would I be better off finding a thick stainless steel cylindrical drum of that size (~18"" diameter and 18"" height) and using 1"" acrylic sheet for the top and bottom section with rubber/silicone gasket?

3)Add my own alloying. What are some good starter metals to add to aluminium to make it tougher (with no regards to hardness; anything above 20RHC is ok)

83,I need an educated opinion from professionals working the field about potential career stepping stone. Any advice appreciated.,1464204438,"To start I want to major in Computer Engineering once I finish my studies. I kind of slacked in high school and wasn't able to go to the school of my choice and was unable to get any sort of scholarship aid. After graduating high school I was advised to go to community college and get my associates degree and then transfer over to a four year school. I've been doing that for some years now and have gotten a good chunk of credits out of the way. Now for my dilema. This involves degree advice but isn't really too much of my main focus.

I've been trying to complete my Associates for quite a while but I feel like it's taking far longer than I had anticipated and to be honest I'm starting to feel burned out from my current job, which is a secure job but doesn't pay well at all and is hard to really make ends meet with my current salary. The closest thing my community college offered as a precursor to a B.S. in Computer Engineering was a A.A.S. in Electronic Engineering Technology. I was taking that until I was recently advised that the AAS in EET wouldn't transfer to a BS in CoE. I was instructed to switch to a A.S. in Engineering which I could then use for the computer engineering degree which I'm currently doing.

My questions:

1. I know these two associate programs are loosely related with CoE. That being said, what are the prospects for getting a job with one associates program versus the other? What kind of jobs? The A.A.S is accredited, the A.S. is not. I do not mind doing the EET first to get a better job and then going back and finishing the AS and going from there of that's what's needed. 

2. Is there long term stability for jobs related to either program? My plan would be to finish the associates, get a better paying job, and use the surplus money to help pay for the graduate program.

If any other info is required, let me know.

The area does not have a great industry for my line of work and my present company knows that; they have a reputation for not-so-great salaries. I like what I do but I am certainly not being paid enough for it.

Here's the catch- our company pushed off global raises due to poorer performance by the company by almost 2 quarters. In theory this could mean I might only get 1 raise in 3 years.

11,Flow rate question for project. Compressed air tank capacity as function of time.,1464119752,"I am trying to estimate how quickly I would use a compressed air tank during an experiment, in other words, how long I could run the experiment. I have a compressed air tank, that is attached to a system with one outlet through a de laval nozzle; I know all of the dimensions of the nozzle. The 100 liter tank is filled to 400 bar and the system is run at 80 bar. I also know the ambient pressure into which the nozzle will exit. I imagine there is also a minimum pressure that the tank is not allowed to surpass but I don't know that figure off the top of my head. 

With such a system, how can I calculate the remaining tank pressure as a function of time if the system is running at the aforementioned rate. I have tried several different approaches ranging from a simple Bernoulli approach as a first estimate (but this case is compressible) to a Boyle's law approach. Also an eq. of state approach for how much volume the filled tank would occupy at the ambient pressure, but no luck. Any help to point me in the right direction is appreciated.",AskEngineers,x4b,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4kvpb0/flow_rate_question_for_project_compressed_air/
12,Could you go over the specified Watt for an Dc motor to get more torque?,1464116364,"Hello!
I am looking on how much I can take out of a Dc motor in torque.
This is the motor and gear: motor (48 Volt) http://www.maxonmotor.com/medias/sys_master/root/8817905565726/15-31-EN.pdf Gear (66:1) http://www.maxonmotor.com/medias/sys_master/root/8817914707998/15-78-EN.pdf
So the motor is nominal 48 V , 2.08A but 120 Watt, so it would be possible for shorter times to go up to 2.5 A -&gt; 48*2.5 = 120 W
The torque i can get with this is 68.3 *2.5 *66 *0.72 ( motor efficiency) = 8100 Nm.
But the Gear allow for an max torque on 22 Nm as you can see on the sheet.
So is it possible to increase the current to lets say 6 A for a short time ( maybe 20 sec) : 68.3 * 66 *6 * 0.72 = 19500 Nm
Then the motor would give 6*48=288 Watt.

Looking for resources for a farm project I'm working on for my dad. https://imgur.com/a/bEGC5 This is an engine on a 1970 Pug produced by bruce manufacturing. It had no brakes when I started and that was my main goal. I've been able to put a go kart brake on the center differential and replaced the 16hp engine with a gx670 clone predator witb 22hp.


So... We are building fences and my dad is an older guy in his 60's. I didn't like to think of him leaning down and trying to drive fencing nails. So I told him to get an air nailer Freeman Fencing Stapler  PFS9 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VVFD93I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_jK9qxbJKWNY5Q and he LOVES it! Problem is that he has a small harbor freight air compressor. So, my idea is to find a belt driven air compressor to mount to the engine. I'm expecting to use a pulley kind of like the last picture in the first album; just not a pto. At idle I can get pretty high rpm...


Where is the best place to size a belt driven air compressor? Is there a way to 'free wheel' the air compressor? I can fabricate the brackets, but am more concerned about the load on the engine as when the pug is moving. Is there a type of disengagement clutch? So it engages the compressor at low rpm?",AskEngineers,PandaCasserole,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4ks5by/side_project_22hp_engine_need_belt_driven_air/

24,Industrial Engineering - Tracking Personnel for Safety,1464058481,"A few weeks ago my site suffered an accident that forced a building evacuation... In the parking lot we conducted a roll call, but I'm embarrassed to admit that it was filled with some guess work. Thankfully no one was injured but I'm taking this as a very near miss. 

What I'm hoping for is to hear how other industrial sites manage track people for site safety. The solution could be as simple as a clipboard with a time in and out column... We're a combined refrigerant/boiler plant contained within one building and controlled entry. 

I'm the IT solutions guy at my site and I've shot down a lot of bad ideas over the last few days. This is a surprisingly tough problem as while we do have access controls, it's not everywhere, people allow others in, and there are no controls for exiting the building. Further we have a lot of outside contractors, the majority of which will not be in our security system. 

One idea that keeps getting kicked around are rfid/WiFi trackers that are carried by each employee... I'm still skeptical though as 1) signal reflection and interference will be very problematic, and 2) it's creepy as fuck. I also don't want to risk a fireman's life just to check on a transponder because Jim wanted an unauthorized smoke break. 

Another idea is to have a short range rfid reader at each entrance where employees wave a token (like a keychain) to ""sign in/out"". A server could keep track so we at least know who's inside. I don't like having another layer on top of security, but it's simple and somewhat fast and easy.

25,Some Questions about Step-Up Conversions (moving my desktop to a new country),1464045930,"Hi everyone!

I'm moving a desktop I built myself from the US to Norway and I just had a few questions about power.

First, I have one of those travel adapters. I know that most adapters don't actually convert the voltage (I've learned the hard way!), but the one I have seems to be different. This one says AC input/output 100-240V, ~50/60Hz 3A. I know I will need a converter that takes me from 110V to 220V and 60Hz to 50Hz, but will this work as a temporary solution? When it gives those ranges, does this mean it provides protection for those voltages, or will it actually do the conversion for me? From what I've seen, converters are a lot bulkier and aren't typically this portable.

Secondly, I'm assuming that a power strip with 5 converters sticking out of it is not exactly safe, so this will have to be a temporary solution. Is the fix as simple as getting another power supply for my desktop, or will it depend more heavily on the actual hardware I have in my personal computer? It's possible there is a setting on my power supply that I have overlooked (something that will change from 110V to 220V), but I haven't seen it. If that's the case, will it be as simple as getting another power cord, or will I have to contend with the frequency as well?

Last, and this is not really related, but if anyone has any advice on moving something like this overseas in some kind of compromise between safely and cheaply (but not necessarily quickly), please drop it below!

26,"3D Printing: 3D printing with subsurface laser over a vat of uv-curing (or other em) resin or other chemicals (like uv-curing silicone rubber, etc.)?",1464041991,"I am most definitely not an engineer, so go easy on me. I've been using some of the 3d printers lately (different technologies) and they all seem to be either slow or unprecise or they don't offer large volumes, and I haven't seen anything that would print out directly a silicone rubber (you can do a hard negative mask, then cast silicone...). 

So, my question / stupid idea is why can't we have a vat filled with UV (or any other EM, but let's presume UV for arbitrary reasons) curing liquid and have a laser trace XY planes inside of it and then moving towards the laser in Z space? 

It seems we do have the technology, but it requires combining and tuning. 

**Laser** 

- can be moved in XY via mirrors (galvo motors)
- can be focused - there are fast varifocal lenses you can control with sound (!)
- there are lasers of all strengths, wavelengths and whatevers

**Materials**

- Numerous uv-curing (and other) materials to choose from (semicosil silicone rubber from wacker for example)

Since I'm not an engineer or even close, I tried to reason what would be the potential issues. None of which seem unsolvable (to a non-engineer at least).

**Issues**^(potential)

1. Lasers used in subsurface engraving operate on discrete dots in Euclidean space. Hardening dots wouldn't be enough, no matter how small they are?
 - I don't see why laser couldn't move at a constant rate and energy output on an imaginary XY plane.

2. Once laser introduces energy at a discrete point in a liquid it also introduces turbulence via heat and chemical process hardening the material might do the same. This could lead to a displacement of hardened dot/line. It would be imperative for hardened material to stay where it's at once it sets. 
 - I'm not sure if this is even a problem and if it's solvable at all. Might be the biggest issue? Maybe one could start building/hardening from the bottom of the vat with first building support structures and relying on that to hold the spatial integrity?

3. Focusing lens for the laser would have to be large in order to cover a bigger distance in Z space
 - not sure about that (it's just a hunch), but it wouldn't matter in some cases at least. It could be a problem for focusing speed though?

4. Vat/container surface would have to be extremely clean and not introduce any unpredictable refractions
 - There's optical glass like K7 which I think would be good enough, at least for most purposes/precision?

5. Liquid material has to be transparent for the laser beam to its focus point and has to have predictable waveguide properties (been awhile since I've gone through optics 101, so pardon me).

6. Liquid material that hardens fast enough. 
- I haven't gone through much of materials available out there, but this could be an issue.

7. Cleaning/recycling liquid from the hardened material. 
 - Depends on viscosity I presume.

8. Forgot this one (and I wanted to write that one first!). Dispersion and reflection of laser light in the liquid as well as transfer of heat in the immediate vicinity of focus. Controlling exact place of hardening in participating medium vs these undesired properties might be the key?

What am I missing? Why isn't this practical?

50,I've been presented another power conditioner 'black box' that claims power savings. I've been out of engineering a little too long to debunk this myself.,1463919084,"Ok, as the title states, I've been presented with the [Basic Power Unit](https://basicpower.co/) by one of my manufacturing facilities that is excited to install it.  They are smart and have tested it first, but they don't have the engineering to really understand it.  The vendor is claiming a 10-20% kWh reduction with that device, and 6 total areas of power quality improvement, all which lead to savings.  The vendor admits it's a capacitor, but claims it can reduce real power as well by ""smoothing"" it out, and acts like a generator by capturing reactive power and using it to reduce real power.  They claim they can put a kWh meter on it and show the difference immediately after they turn it on.

My issue is that the facility isn't billed for reactive power and power factor isn't calculated either.  I don't believe there will be any on-bill savings, or anything else we can quantify, but the vendor is adamant that they've proven dozens of skeptics like me wrong and that the inventor is one of those science genius, but can't market the device himself. 

This is sounding more ridiculous as I write it, but the problem is political.

The vendor is an experience civil engineering design firm and have a long history with our company.  They've recently added energy efficiency into the mix, don't have much experience with it, and have become distributors for the Basic Power Unit.

I don't know how to address the claims that reactive power can be ""stored"" to be used as real power.  He said he'll put me in touch with his engineers, and honestly, I'm too rusty on this subject to adequately evaluate the claims.  Shit, I'm an ME and never liked the power quality aspect of energy efficiency and I'd have to bust out my physics book to properly diagram a circuit and calculate it's behavior.

53,Can I take the PE Exam in a different state?,1463910696,"So the Missouri Board approved my application to take the PE Exam in October. Right after I got the green light from the board, I was abruptly laid off. I have since moved out of state and will sign up to take the test as soon as NCEES lets me (one month from now.) Only question is, will I have to go back to Missouri to sit for the test? I know the test will count towards licensure in the state of Missouri regardless of where I take it, but will NCEES accommodate so I don't have to drive 1100 miles? 

*update*

I just got off the phone with the Virginia board and they informed me that I'd have to go back to Missouri to take the test. It's the state that gives the test, NCEES only proctors it. Once I have the license in Missouri, then I can apply for one in Virginia (or whatever state I'm in by then) by comity, which isn't the same thing as reciprocity. If states have reciprocity, it means the license is granted automatically. Comity means I'll have to pay a fee and turn in another packet (though I won't have to retake the exam.) He said excluding the cost of travel back to Missouri, it'd be a wash. I don't know where I'll even be living by October, so I'll just plan on Missouri for now.

They claim to have improved the Bluetooth connectivity by using something they are calling [Beacon Signal Technology](http://www.jlabaudio.com/blogs/news/162362183-beacon-signal-technology-for-improved-bluetooth-connectivity).  This puts a small ceramic antenna in the mic/volume control unit on the cable between the ear pieces that will hang a bit below your right ear.  Give the issues The Dash has with how effectively the body blocks bluetooth signals, I'm guessing while not as bad, these will have similar issues, especially when your phone is on the left side of your body. I would have thought an antenna that extended throughout the cable between the ear pieces would allow for the best connection.  When I asked them why they didn't do that, this was their response:

    Hey Dustin, awesome question! Our industrial designer said this, ""Actually, the module works best when the antenna is as short as possible because the longer length of the antenna will deplete the overall signal as a whole due to the small power consumption it takes up."" Hope this cleared it up.

65,How to attach two ends of a ribbon?,1463862830,"I'm trying to figure out the best way to attach or fasten two ends of a ribbon which surrounds another object of roughly circular cross section. A belt that goes around your waist is a good analogue, but I don't think a belt buckle mechanism is appropriate for a delicate piece of fabric.

A few items I'm considering in the design:

1) The attachment should be sturdy and adjustable to accommodate surrounded objects of different circumferences within a small/moderate range.

2) It would be nice if the adjustment mechanism also allows for the manual tightening of the ribbon around the surrounded object. This is another reason why the belt buckle mechanism may not work, since that does not allow for a continuously varying ribbon circumference and limits the ability to fully tighten around all potential objects.

3) The attachment should be aesthetically pleasing. For example, simply tying the ribbon in a knot is one option, but I would prefer something that looks more permanent. I would also like the ribbon to remain flat against the surrounded object (no twists or bunching up), although it can and will probably need to be folded over.

4) Gluing or sewing parts of the ribbon together may be essential, but I would like to avoid this if possible.  The ribbon is light in color and I've read that most glues will seep through and discolor the other side. Sewing will also be obvious.

5) Using velcro by itself may not be strong enough, but using velcro as part of a hooping mechanism may be a good option.  However, attaching velcro to the ribbon will likely require glue or sewing, which I would like to avoid.

The best design I can come up with at this point is a hooping mechanism like you see on backpack straps with metal crimps used on the ribbon ends to avoid fraying. I'd like to know if that type of ""hooping mechanism"" has a technical name so I can try to find the right components.",AskEngineers,trp780,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4kfc0t/how_to_attach_two_ends_of_a_ribbon/

The wall I'm penetrating is approximately 14 foot to the bottom of 24"" open web steel joists, with a flat roof.  The penetration is planned to start around 8 feet up, and will be 22x16 (WxH). 

I plan to place the penetrations between (and below) two joists. One of the locations is on an expansion joint that's slightly offset from center between 2 joists. 

The wall is standard 8x8x16 CMU with filled columns at an unknown interval but I believe to be one in four. 

So my questions: 

1. Does the expansion joint require any special considerations as far as this project goes or can I just cut through it?

2. Would these penetrations require a header of any type? If so would a pair of 2x5/16 angle iron header suffice placed inside and out? (I have plenty of it on hand, but can get whatever I'd need) 

3. In case I can't perfectly center the penetration between 2 joists, are there any other issues I'd been to consider for this project?

I appreciate any help you all can provide, and will post pictures of the wall in question as soon as I can get back out to the site. We're in unincorporated county land, in a non-residential structure, so no one really cares much about permits or engineering on owner-performed renovation. My dad is a retired EE, and has limited experience with structural and seems to think I'd be fine just popping a hole that size in the wall just about anywhere with out a header, but I'd still rather run it by someone who's a bit more familiar and current with structural stuff.

90,Just starting my new internship and feeling very inept compared to the other intern on my team...advice?,1463712305,"Hey there!

So I just started a summer internship at a large defense contractor, and my major at my university is computer engineering. I was moved last minute from a firmware position to a software engineering position to fulfill a need within the department and I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed. The other intern on my team is a CS major and knows a lot more than I do and it's obvious, especially when we're having these meetings with our team leads and he asks all of these specific questions and I just sit there dumbfounded. We're coding in C# and using Windows Forms to put some finishing touches on a fairly simple application and using version control (which I've never worked with.) While I'm proficient in C, I'm now spending time outside of work trying to catch up with Object Oriented Programming since this codebase we're working on is 200,000 lines and I'm totally lost. I told my leads and my manager that I have a pretty steep learning curve considering my background is only in C and on lower level projects but that I'm a fast learner. I'm trying to focus on my little accomplishments and working my way up from there, but it's hard to stay positive when my team member is operating at a much higher level than I am and making it very obvious to the team leads and our manager.

I just got off of the phone with the DEQ here. He said I can add up to 6 inches. He said any more than that and they won't do a soil test. (He made it sound like there was some lee-way.) I'm wondering what issue this causes? Will it give a false percolation read? I didn't want to push to much in asking because I didn't want to irritate the people who will be inspecting later on with repetitive questions.

I'm wondering what it would hurt to add say 8 inches instead of the 6. What negative affects would that have on having a septic system put in later?

There is an old system in the ground which is on file with the DEQ. So they know how deep that is buried and can use it to guage how much soil I've added. (I'm replacing the system.)

The depth on the documentation the DEQ has is estimated though. It says buried btween 14 and 18 inches. (Which according to the guy at the DEQ I spoke with is 4 inches too shallow. Eighteen is the avergae he mentioned.) So If I add 8 they wouldn't really know, and I don't need a permit or anything. I'm free to just add it. So no one will be watching over my shoulder if you know what I mean. But I don't want to add the 8 and it end up causing problems with my new septic system later on. Plus I'm also curious.

I am teaching a one-week class to middle school students where they are expected to learn and apply engineering concepts.

My projects rely mostly on mechanical engineering, but any tie-ins would be fantastic. I am not an engineer by trade, and I'm a little lost. I would love some guidance from you experts. I don't want the class to be **just** about building cool things, so I want them to have some concepts they can take away from this experience.  
&amp;nbsp;

Questions:

- In your experience, what concepts of engineering/physics do you think the kiddos should really focus on learning? This can include things like stress/strain, friction, or broader things like testing or design.

- What kind of documentation should there be as they work? I want them to justify their decisions about the design choice.

- What kind of building tips might you suggest?

- What fun challenges/projects do you know of that can be completed in about 2 hours?

&amp;nbsp;

By the way, here are some of the projects that I'm thinking of trying, but I'd love some new ideas!

* Tower of Power: tallest tower that can hold a tennis ball the longest

* Bridge of Straws: longest (or lightest) bridge that can hold a mass the longest

* Hurricane stopper: Building a structure that can withstand the force from a high-powered fan

* Mini-catapult: self explanatory

* Bottle car racing: building a car to roll the furthest down a ramp

Apparently electric cars are supposed to be a big deal in the future, and all types of engineers will be required for the construction process. [This interesting article](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4k0zer/what_do_different_types_of_engineers_do/) that I found on the US Bureau of Labor Statics provides a break down of the roles that different engineers would fulfil during the construction of electric cars. I found it interesting and clarifying, I hope you guys enjoy it too. 

**Chemical engineers**

 Apply the principles of chemistry to design or improve equipment or to devise processes for manufacturing chemicals and products. Because the batteries of electric vehicles store power through chemical processes, chemical engineers are responsible for developing new battery designs and improving current battery technologies. They are also vital in designing equipment and processes for large-scale manufacturing and in planning and testing the methods of battery manufacturing.

**Electrical engineers** 

Design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical components. They are responsible for designing the electrical circuitry that  allows a gas engine to charge the battery and distribute the electricity from the battery to the electric motor. Electrical engineers also might work on the heating and air-conditioning systems, vehicle lighting, and visual 
displays.

**Electronics engineers**

 Design, develop, and test electronic components and systems for vehicles. These engineers are primarily focused on the control systems and additional electronic components for the vehicle. They are different from electrical engineers in that they do not focus on the generation and distribution of electricity. 

**Industrial engineers**

 Determine the most effective ways to use the basic factors of production—people, machines, materials, information, and energy—to manufacture vehicles. They are concerned primarily with increasing productivity through the management of people, use of technology, and improvement of production methods. Because many electric vehicles require original manufacturing plans, industrial engineers design innovative manufacturing processes and retool plants that formerly made different models of cars.

**Materials engineers** 

Involved in the development, processing, and testing of materials used in electric vehicles. Many electric vehicles are made of newer materials that are lighter and stronger than those in traditional cars. Materials engineers may also incorporate environmentally friendly materials that are derived from plant-based materials or recycled materials.  

**Mechanical engineers**

 Design, develop, and test the tools, engines, machines, and other mechanical devices in electric vehicles. These devices may be components of electric vehicles, or machines that are used in the manufacture or repair of these vehicles. These engineers may focus on engines, electric motors, or other mechanical devices,such as transmissions,drive trains, or steering systems.

**Mechanical engineering technicians** 

Assist engineers with solving technical problems in research, development, 
manufacturing, construction, inspection, and maintenance. Their work is more narrowly focused and is more oriented toward applications than that of engineers or scientists. Engineering technicians will build or set up equipment, prepare and conduct experiments, collect data, and calculate or record results. They may also help engineers or scientists to make prototypes of newly designed equipment or assist with computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) equipment.

33,High shear mixer,1463544275,"Hi!

I was wondering if anyone had insights into designing a high shear mixer. At our plant we use one to mix spice powders (imagine chili, pepper etc..), water and oil into a marinade or sauce. We used to have a simple 4 blade agitator but it made a really poor job in mixing in the solids and the consistency was poor too... 

Recently we installed a high shear mixer head into our existing mixer (googled for one and then drafted and manufactured our own). This new mixer gives us a pretty solid quality but frankly when doing thicker sauces/marinades we run into performance issues. 

It seems like when the viscosity gets high enough the mixer ""stalls"" and stops mixing the ingredients properly. So far we have increased our engine power (1,5kw, 1500rpm motor now) and added a VFD (running 40-65hz right now) and it did help but the same problem still persists with thick sauces...

Using my google-fu I managed to find one pdf that outlined some design considerations for such a mixer and came across one value that seemed fitting, tip speed, which according to pdf is about 10m/s too slow in our mixer (about 15m/s currently, article recommended 23m/s to 27m/s for open head mixer)...

So, what I'm really trying to ask is   
a) would increasing tip speed improve our results  
b) how much more power do I need (if any)  

Here is a link to a picture of our mixer head ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/iejpqmymg3t9xv9/2016-01-26%2011.01.42.jpg?dl=0 ), 200mm diameter and about 30mm tall ""teeth""...",AskEngineers,Bliswas,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4juvp9/high_shear_mixer/

They said (the seniors engineers) that I was putting the company on shame and that what I did was pretty serious.

Honestly, I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I never noticed the errors. They slip right through me when I was working on the project. But this isn't the first time that I have f* up. Almost every project Ive worked on have had errors or/and has taken more time that initially thought. I honestly feel like I don't have the right mindset for being a good engineer...

So, I just wanted to know how to deal with this. How to turn this situation around-

35,Will past drug use prevent me from becoming a nuclear engineer?,1463534651,"Hello,

I am a second year undergraduate studying nuclear engineering in the US. My understanding is that getting hired on at nuclear power plants (and possibly scoring internships at them) depends on passing a background check similar to the US government's secret clearances. While I cannot find any specific information of these background checks themselves, the government secret clearances are apparently very thorough, requiring a polygraph along with extensive interviews with both friends and family.

I am worried that I will not be able to pass these background checks because of past drug use. During my first year of college, I used Marijuana many times (~40), and used LSD and shrooms twice each. This was really irresponsible of me, and I don't know why it didn't occur to me that working at a nuclear plant would require extensive background checks. I'm legitimately passionate about nuclear engineering and physics in general, and I would be very disappointed if I had to change my major because I wouldn't be able to score internships or get jobs upon graduation. Obviously, I will not continue this behavior moving forwards.

So I guess, the question is, how screwed am I? I don't want to have to lie on any potential background checks. Will companies care about my history if I'm honest and do not use beyond freshman year?

As the pulleys open up, I imagine lots of stress is put on the outer rungs of the chain.  Unless the pulleys are always closed (which I imagine will be rare) there will always be a lot of force being put on the outer rungs of the chain and it's likely a breaking point for the CVT.  

Wouldn't a CVT of this design be more likely to break than a normal automatic transmission?

58,Professional way to deal with family member (or fiance) applying to a job in my team,1463454374,"Hello All!

I just started an awesome job about 5 months ago. I love my job, team, and new city (had to relocated). This is the job I always wanted and am really excited to be in it. Over the course of the past few months, my team has talked about their families and asked me about my personal situation. I told them about my fiance, how we are in the same field but he graduated a few years ahead of me, and asked them if they were away of anywhere near by that he could work. 

My senior mentor/team member has worked here for close to 40 years and is very familiar with the near by companies that do this type pf work. He also knows people that used to work at my company but have since moved on. At the time, he gave me a few suggestions and offered to contact a few of his old friends that worked at smaller companies that would not normally consider an out of state candidate to see if they were looking for anyone. He delved more into what my fiance does, where he works now. He said he thought he would be a great asset to our company. 

A few weeks went by, he didn't contact anyone and I didn't push or ask about it. Next thing I know, there are rumors floating around the there will be a new posting in our team under on of the other senior engineers. Our team is 12 people, comprised of groups of about 4 people. My senior team member did a resume keyword search and pulled my fiance's resume from the data base and told my manager how he would be a great fit for this position. I'm not sure if he knows if it's my fiance's resume or not. I didn't mention names or anything, and... I'm doing so eves dropping. I'm assuming he hasn't pieced it together or doesn't want to get my hopes up because after news of the posting became official he stopped by and said ""the buddy system doesn't work here. My fiance has to meet the basic requirements."" And told me of another employee that's son didn't get hired. Then, he said he would see what he could do. To which I responded, ""My fiance is on his own. I expect him to be treated like any other candidate."" 

Personally, every time I have tried to use the buddy system it normally backfires in my face. I want to play this as the least conflict of interest as possible and leave my fiance on his own merits. But....The mid-level member of my group is un-aware that my fiance will be applying to this position. Today, he informed me that a senior member of the larger team division wants his son to be considered for this position even though he is severely under qualified. I also over heard a conversation about how to ""flex"" this position for this individual.

TD;LR

Being that I'm new, I don't want to get caught up in company politics. My fiance can get a job somewhere else, but it would suck. For my professional development, should I tell my manager and other members of my team that my fiance is going to apply? Or should I let if unfold naturally? How to I ask questions about the process and participate in discussions (because this position will be someone I interface with) without being conflicted? Or, should I remove myself from all conversations and talk to HR? And, if they hire the under-qualified son of the other senior person, what's the best way (or a professional way) to respond?

Electrical: http://www.niagaracollege.ca/technology-studies/programs/electrical-engineering-technology-co-op/

Electronics: http://www.niagaracollege.ca/technology-studies/programs/electronics-engineering-technology/

I'm currently in the second semester of an Advanced diploma(3 years) in electrical engineering technology, however the program shares a common first year with electronics(I was actually originally in electronics but changed before the year even started). I previously took a year in the mechanical engineering technology program but changed my mind because we focused on machining parts and manufacturing, which I have no interest in.

So I have absolutely no idea which one I'd enjoy more. I've already talked to several professors and they're just as stumped as I am. The reason is that I absolutely love working with computer hardware. There's not a whole lot I like more then the once or twice a year I get to crack open my PC case and make some changes. I've been doing it basically my whole life, because I grew up with a significantly older brother who built gaming pc's.  Also though I've never done it before programming is something I think I might enjoy. This seems like I should go Electronics. 

However, I have always been a strong math student,I pick up new concepts pretty easily,  and I legitimately enjoy working with calculus and AC power.  I think I have a weird perception that Electrical will give me a better ""job"". Not in the sense of money, But a work boots, hard hat, and lunch box job. My entire life I've been perceived as lazy, as a slacker and generally not hard working person. In the past year I've lost over 100lbs and started taking school seriously, and I feel like I want to do something that's physically demanding as a job. not behind a desk, but up a pole or constantly on the move in some way. So I think that, then 10 minutes later I think working at a desk on a computer would be just as great. I'm extremely in decisive.

This cycle offers me tremendous insight into the realm of assistive aids for mobility impaired individuals, so I've taken to designing and prototyping in my woodshop.  I bought a CNC table, started learning gcode when I struck down and lost what I'd learned.  So,  no more servo motors, nema motors, stepper: nope.

I'm looking for simple manually operated machine design.  Bevel gears, helical, spurs, worms, roller ball bearings/pulleys.   I thought about wood gears, but the cost of a scroll saw and the expertise required for precision are difficult to justify on my anemic budget.

So, I'm turning to you for advice on strategies for sourcing simple machine parts. I thought a non-running dirtbike/motorcross bike on CL would give me a transmission gearbox to rip down. If I can see it and move it with my hands, I can work even when my higher order thinking begins to fade.

Where can I *cheaply* source/scavange simple machine parts to build actuators, linear rails, or even simple gearboxes? Parts should be large enough to support moving parts of wooden furniture.

So, I'm looking at broken household items I could find for free/cheap that I could open disassemble/reassemble then repurpose after I understand their relationship.

I could go to the junkyard, but i don't know what I want. Small plastic gears are manually difficult to manage, so I *think* I'm asking for ways to get expensive parts cheap/free.

97,Designing with many independent tolerance variables - how to stack tolerance without over designing?,1463258129,"Hypothetical situation - I want to design a gizmo that has a bunch of components. These components each have a tolerance associated with their function which affects how well my gizmo performs. For the sake of simplicity, let's say that each tolerance is a normal distribution, with the +/-3 sigma values provided as the tolerance values. 

Now, if I want to design my gizmo so that I expect 1 in a million of them to fail due to these tolerances, how do I stack these tolerances up in my design to do that? 

My question is really one of regression toward the mean. The more indepdendent tolerances (independent variables) I have in my gizmo, the  less likely it will be that I have all worst-case tolerances in a single gizmo. So, if I were to design my gizmo so that every single tolerance could accept a 3-sigma deviation from the norm, then I am probably over-designing when I have many independent tolerances contributing. 

If I have one tolerance affecting my gizmo, I need to make sure that it is within tolerance of about 4.9 sigma, since I'm only allowed 1 failure per million. But if I have 2 indepdendent tolerances, or 5, or 25, how do I make sure I'm not being overly-conservative to hit my 1/1Mil target?",AskEngineers,Seventytvvo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4jd0pz/designing_with_many_independent_tolerance/

I can use a user subroutine in ABAQUS to introduce a maximum stress or strain based failure criteria, and it has 3 parameters listed below:

* The component of the strength (Stress or Strain) tensor (11, 22, 33, 12, 23, and 13)
* The tensile strength (Stress or Strain)
* The compressive strength (Stress or Strain)

My questions are -

1. Should I use stress based or strain based failure criteria?
2. I have uniaxial stress-strain data from experiment, which means it is 11 component of the strength tensor. Should I assign the maximum strength to 11 component or instead Tensor's principal axes should be used as the axis system?
3. If I use strain based failure, then the tensile failure strain is not going to be the same as uni-axial test data, because of transverse shrinkage effect. Does the same true for stress based failure as well?
4. Void formation, nucleation and void growth happens in tension, whereas the opposite happens in compression. Should I avoid the compressive strength parameter, forcing failure to occur only due to tension?
5. Is the failure influenced by strain-rate? Say, failure happens at 0.1 strain at quasi-static strain-rate but it jumps to 0.15 at high strain-rate?

24,What surprising material would cause the most problems if it suddenly became unavailable?,1463140627,"Obviously necessities like water, petroleum, steel, concrete or fertilizer would cause major upheaval if the supply was greatly reduced.

25,Equipment calibration periods. What is standard practice or period for calibration?,1463138207,"Is there a standard or limit that defines calibration periods or procedures for different types of equipment?  

So I'm overhauling the equipment in a lab and I'm looking over the calibration procedures.  All along I inherited a schedule of calibration from my predecessor which I've continued for my years here.  It's worked well and when I've been audited or had customers ask me about my procedure they've been satisfied with how it works.

Broadly speaking I calibrate most equipment annually.  This is partly because of manufacturers recommendations, partly because of the convenience and simplicity but most because the 3rd party calibration companies we send our equipment too work on annual notice.  If I send a piece of kit to them, they send it back with a next calibration due date.  I take that date as my gospel.  So I'm actually letting a calibration company set my schedule.  And I'll assume they'll go for as often as possible.

Maybe it doesn't need to be every single year for every single thing.  This can get expensive.  Some things I don't even use that often.  Yes I know that even without being used they'll drift from what measurements were set but if I'm using something twice or three times a year and another thing every day, how can they have the same calibration period?  Surely I could calibrate the lesser used thing less often?

So then so far it seems to me as if it's purely up to me to decide the period of different analysers or meters or monitors and this doesn't seem right.  So I'm seeing a lot of 'recommended practice' or 'best practice' or suggestions. 

TL;DR Do any of you guys know of a legal standard for calibration of lab equipment that I'm missing out on?  British, European or International standards; anything?",AskEngineers,Lost_Afropick,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4j5uiw/equipment_calibration_periods_what_is_standard/

27,Residential Retaining Wall Design,1463133781,"I'm planning a retaining wall for my property (residential) and I have a bunch of questions about hiring an engineer that I was hoping folks here could help with. The wall is going to be two tiers, one about 10 feet high and one 8 feet high, though they'll be set apart nearly 20' so they're really two different walls. 

First, for an engineer to design this and draw up plans, do they need to do a full-blown subsurface soil sample or is it reasonable to rely on common conditions for the area? Also, will they need to actually visit the site and do surveying or can they rely on the topographical map produced by the county? That map has countours at every 2 feet of elevation and is pretty accurate as far as I've been able to eyeball. 

Second, and I guess more generally, what should I expect an engineer to do for this and what is a reasonable amount to charge? Are they going to want to inspect the construction as it progresses or when it's done? Does this depend on anything specific about the wall? (For what it's worth the lower wall is the more difficult as it'll be about 50' long with a 90-degree return, 10 feet high at max (at the return) and 2 feet at the other end of the long face, with a toe slope of about 30 degrees, flat grade above. I'm hoping to make the lower a gabion wall but that's flexible. Upper will be about 40', no return, probably versa-lok or something like it.)

Finally, is there anything I should know or can you give me any advice about finding and hiring an engineer for this job? What kind of place is likely to do this without treating it like a heavy-duty commercial job? (Also, if anyone happens to be a geotechnical engineer practicing in OH and is interested, feel free to PM me.)

I try to make these filters into modules, so they can be used as filters before a homebrew reciever, SDR receivers, or maybe output filters for extremely low power (QRPP) transmitters. I used [this site](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/lcfilter/) to generate Butterworth filters, and after that I rounded component values and run simulations with Oregano. 

I designed a 5th order bandpass for the 20 m band (14 MHz - 14.35 MHz). It seems that the slightest change in component values messes up the transfer function real bad, either shifitng the center frequency out of the supposed band, or adding extra peaks.

 How should I choose the components to realize the filters I designed? Should I maybe use a different type of filter?

Using a filter with passband ripples would probably not be a huge problem since ham radio signals are really narrowband.

The problem we have is that some operators that drives the machine is goin into the dirt but the motor cant handle it, so it reach over max torque. Instead of reverse the machine and start over they just keeps goin and the motor eventually breaks after some time. 

So we would probably set some max current that the motor can draw, maybe a fuse or fix it with the plc or motordrive, what is best?

13,How can I differentiate harmonics from actual signal content in an FFT? Example provided.,1462821299,"This has been troubling me for some time. Luckily in my graduate work I didn't have to pay too much attention to this issue, but now that I'm applying it in the working world I really want to understand this.

If I'm seeing what looks like peaks at (approximately) integer multiples of my dominant frequency in an FFT, how can I confirm that it is simply a harmonic? Build band-passes around the suspect frequencies and look at the results? I'm not sure what I'd be looking for.

As an example, I'm looking at accelerometer data from two different bodies (""A"" and ""B"") under the same loading. During operation, both bodies show peaks at 100 and 300 Hz. The Body A FFT shows a higher magnitude at 100 Hz, and Body B shows a higher magnitude at 300 Hz.. During another test, I looked at acceleration while the input is increasing, at steady state, and while decreasing. While increasing, the 100-Hz peak is more dominant. At steady state, the energy is concentrated around 300 Hz. While decreasing, the 100-Hz component returns though at 300 Hz the magnitude is still higher.

Does this sound more like two separate input components or is there behavior of harmonics that I don't understand? How does one investigate peaks in an FFT and whether or not they are real or artifacts from the FFT process?

Now where I get messed up is how would I go about calculating the deflection that would cause this table to lift off the base. Would I treat it like a beam and have the weight uniformly distributed across the top with the base reaction pushing up, and then some arbitrary force added to the edge. 

This album shows a rough ISO view and then what I've started as the force and moment equation. If that appears right I know I can then form my shear force diagram along with my bending moment diagram and determine my deflection from that.

15,High Helix Angles &amp; Resistance: Determining how high a gear's angle can get before it cannot meaningfully perform work?,1462819541,"**Background:** I am **not** an engineer. I'm just a schmuck that after a lot of research taught himself how to design and hob helical gears. One thing that I haven't found is how to understand is exactly when a helix angle will be too steep to turn smoothly.

**The Goal:** I am attempting to reduce the number of parts we use in my family's business and simplify our inventory. We produce a right angle gearbox that increases the input revolutions from 1 to 2 outputs. This uses a larger case. **I am trying to reduce the size of the gears to fit inside our normal case so that we only need one universal case style.**

I am using two gears set at right angles to each other. These gears will be pressed onto shafts and placed inside the gearbox. The combined Outer Diameter of the two must be 1.10"" or thereabouts.

**Gear A:** 6 Teeth, 28 Normal Diametral Pitch, 62 Degree Helix Angle, .52786"" Outer Diameter
**Gear B:** 12 Teeth, 28 Normal Diametral Pitch, 28 Degree helix Angle, .556816 Outer Diamter

I have already cut both gears. They mesh perfectly. Obviously, the 6 tooth gear WILL drive the 12 tooth gear to reduce the input ratio from 1 to .5. However, I want to increase from 1 input to 2 outputs, so the 12 tooth MUST drive the 6 tooth. However, the helix angle is too steep, and instead of turning the 6 tooth gear, it locks up and kicks it upwards refusing to turn.

I have cutters ranging from 20 to 40 Normal Diametral Pitch. However, I have done a bunch of random calculations and the above designs are the only ones I've thus far stumbled across that fit inside the case. I have tried to keep the angle of the 6 tooth gear as low as possible. I have gear blanks ranging from .52"" to .58"". I might be able to machine some larger or smaller ones.

**QUESTION: How do I work out when the driven gear's angle is low enough so that the driving gear will meaningfully drive it and not lock up?**

Do I need more teeth, say, 7 &amp; 14, or 10 &amp; 20? or should I drop to fewer, say, 5 &amp; 10 or 4 &amp; 8?

Our test is a 16lb bowling ball dropped 2 feet.
Their test is a 10lb cylinder (3in diameter) dropped 10 feet.

The results indicate my test is causing more damage to the product than the 10 cylinder, I am guessing this is due to the surface area at contact.  The part is an HDPE enclosure so there is a fair amount of penetration and bounce back with the bowling ball compared to the cylinder.  

Without the use of high speed cameras I am assuming the bowling ball is penetrating about 1/4"" into the enclosure (actually deflecting the surface of the enclosure) and then bouncing up about 10"".  The cylinder on the other hand is penetrating less than 1/8"" and bouncing back about 6"".

The running idea is to continue a project we had going a few years ago, building a car to enter the Shell Eco marathon. The big thing that's left to do is the outer shell, so this is mainly a fluids project. 

The rough outline is design a shell, that fits our current frame and adheres to the competition rules, test it in CFD, validate in PIV, and then finally build it. 

The head of department suggested that we have ""Fiber Grating Interogrator"" (fiber bragg grating?) that can be used to measure the actual drag of the real body. I've never heard of this! From a Google I did I found that they are fiber optic cables that can measure strain. From that we can calculate the load in the body and the drag? Does anyone have experience with them? 

Ideally we'd be able to actually integrate them into the final body. Can the fibers be integrated into a fiberglass or carbon fiber sheet? 

Any experience or suggestions you have for this would be hugely appreciated! I've never written a research proposal before so I'm trying to be as detailed as possible before hand. Also we only came up with the idea for it on Friday and the applications close on Thursday, so I'm kinda of crash courseing here. 

TL;DR
Writing my first research proposal. 
Wondering if you have any experience with fiber grating interrogator/ fiber bragg grating? 
Can I integrate it with fiber glass and then measure the strain on a cars body in real time/real world use? 
Any general research proposal advice?

The situation I have is that there are 4 supporting columns. These columns support support a wire and this wire is then used to hang wires which support festive lights. (see diagram in link below)

What I'm looking for as an end point is to be able to say what are the forces going onto the columns

I'm not looking for a numerical answer as such, hence i haven't provided any figures, I'm just looking for the right way to think about it and then I can put numbers to it later.

The way I'm thinking of it initially is the middle wires are effectively catenary systems (as the lights are placed at regular and relatively close intervals and I can therefore approximate it as the wire having a self weight that includes the lights) and therefore I can specify a vertical and horizontal force at each point where these inner wires connect to the outer wires.

However I'm hitting a bit of a mental block when it comes to thinking about the outer wires which connect to the columns and how I would go about it. I remember doing the simpler tension problems (weight hung between two wires) when I did mechanics and was wondering whether this would be the path to take... but like i've said I'm in abit of a muddle thinking about it and could use some guidance.

37,High school senior in need of advice about what college to attend and what degree options to pursue,1462676111,"For my entire life, I've had an interest in science and engineering, and recently its been difficult to try and narrow down which field I'd prefer to seek a career in. Since my biggest passion has always been outer space and space travel, I think that I'd like to either end up in astrophysics/astronomy research or aerospace engineering. 

After getting all of my college acceptances and rejections over the last month and a half, I decided that it'd probably be best to just get my undergraduate education done as cheaply as possible since I'm probably going to go to grad school. So on May 1st I committed to a very average (but very affordable) state school in my state with the intention of majoring in either physics or mechanical engineering (I didn't get accepted to anywhere with an aerospace engineering program that wouldn't put me over 100K in debt). 

I also have so much AP credit that if I go to this state school I'll be starting as a sophomore, meaning that I can finish the typical curriculum in 3 years. Alternatively, I could take an extra semester or two and double major in physics and mechanical engineering and graduate in four years. If I wanted to take classes over the summer I could finish in even less.

So I figured that option gives me a little bit of time to narrow down what's best to do and if I work hard I'll be able to go wherever I want for grad school (hopefully at one of the places that I got rejected from in this undergraduate admissions cycle, like Caltech, MIT, or Stanford). At the state school I'd also be in the university honors college, which I've been told definitely helps grease the wheels for grad school applications.

Yesterday I got a phone call and I've been offered admission off the wait list at a relatively elite liberal arts college (this LAC has a 25% acceptance rate and a very, very strong reputation in academia) along with a sizable scholarship. This college offers a BA in physics and does not accept all of my AP credit, so it'd take me four years to finish. However, they have a 3-2 articulation program with Columbia University that guarantees transfer after 3 years so that one can study there for 2 years and graduate with a BA in physics from the LAC and a BS in an engineering field from Columbia. It's also possible to transfer to Caltech, but admissions are very competitive and not guaranteed. This program seems very appealing since it gets me into an ivy league university to finish my undergrad along with a degree from an LAC that's very well respected. Presumably, this would make it quite a bit easier to get into a prestigious graduate program. The drawback is that it takes more time to complete.

I'm looking for advice as to where I should go (I need to accept or reject my offer to attend the LAC within 7 days), what degree path is optimal, does having a BA vs a BS in physics make a difference, should I pursue a major in ME, physics, or both (I've read that half of physics majors end up working in engineering rather than research), how valuable would it be to finish in less than four years vs having more than one degree, etc. 

**In summary, my options are basically this:**

BS in mechanical engineering from state school, finish in ~3 years

BS in physics from state school, finish in ~3 years

BS in mechanical engineering and BS in Physics from state school, finish in ~4 years

BA in physics from elite LAC, finish in 4 years

BA in physics from elite LAC and BS in mechanical engineering from Columbia University, finish in 5 years

48,Post Bachelor Options for Engineering Physicists with emphasis on bio-engineering?,1462592467,"I am 20 credit hours away from graduating with my Bachelors in Engineering Physics with my focus being bioengineering. I've taken classes in most aspects of Engineering, control system, Electronics, statics/dynamics, thermo, fluid mechanics and have done well in these. My GPA is 3.3 something. I started my senior project and am creating a bio-molecule to act as an inhibitor, etc and running simulations of the created molecule with the selected enzyme. I am currently working closely with Faculty that have their PhD in Biophysics. My university focused on bio-molecular analysis and engineering for my track but will be taking these classes my last couple semesters.
I am asking to see if there is anyone here that followed a similar track or if anyone has any ideas where to go post Bachelors. There hasn't been much to catch my attention or a specific topic I can sit in and purely enjoy. My thoughts are maybe going for a masters in biomedical engineering, pursuing law as a patent lawyer or med school. I have also thought of working right after; however, I am unsure of what kind of jobs I would even be qualified for as my degree literally spans over most of the fields but with little specificity. I guess it scares me of not knowing what I want or where to go next. Anyhow, if anyone has any thoughts or advice to maybe able to direct me or give me another option I haven't thought otherwise. In the words of my Faculty adviser, ""Here lives a brilliant mind with no direction."" Help direct me to something that will give me purpose. Also, I will be spreading my last hours over two semesters so to be able to take additional classes that might interest me and/or focus on post bachelor exams that I might need to take based on my decision. Honestly, help pls. Sorry if this is an inappropriate post for this sub but I am asking for advice from Engineers that might have followed similar paths since my university is phasing the program out and I am one of 5 students left graduating with this degree with the other 4 being international students planning on going back to their respective countries.

I have a basic knowledge of how refrigerators work by having a cooling coil with fluid inside which absorbs the heat from the inside with perhaps a fan to distribute it but is there also a reason cooling coils are a helix versus a different shape? (More surface area to touch the air maybe?) and can you cool it faster by filtering the smoke through water? Assuming you had cold water to filter it through would that be most effective? But cooling water takes way more energy than air so which would be faster/more effective? Assume you work under the constraints of the device being any shape but it has to be under 1 m^3 and you have a 200 dollar budget but you can use it as you see fit (I.e. Going to a junkyard and ripping cooling coils off of a refrigerator etc.) aesthetics don't matter, just functionality.

57,Typically how much are relocation bonuses from big oil companies?,1462556847,"My roommate is an engineer for one of the big oil companies (Shell, Exxon, Chevron, etc.). Hes been working there for about two years. He is a chemical engineer. His job transferred him to my city three months ago and and they payed him a relocation bonus. Now after three months, and with three months remaining on our lease, his job offered to transfer him back to where he was working before. They gave him the option of finishing his lease, or moving him immediately. He chose to move immediately and was given a second relocation bonus. That much I know. What I dont know is how much they paid him.

He is trying to get out of paying the rest of his rent saying he can't afford it. I have friends that work for other oil companies and I've been told relocation bonuses are typically a couple thousand dollars. Well he has gotten two. I dont believe his company would transfer him without compensating him enough to cover his rent. Theres no way they would expect him to either default or just cover the rest of the money on his own would they? Even if they did hes an engineer at a major oil company. I don't know his salary, but hes been working their two years and just got promoted so I know he makes enough to be able to cover his rent. I have a feeling hes bullshitting me about not being able to cover it, and just wants to pocket as much of his bonuses as possible. But if I don't know what typical bonuses are, theres no way I can call him out on it with confidence. If my friends are correct, then just one bonus would be enough to cover his remaining rent, and two definitely would. It'd be hard to convince him by saying ""Hey I know you make enough money with your salary, just cover your half"" but if I can say ""Hey I know your two relocation bonuses were around this much $$$ so I know you've been given enough to cover your rent, just do it"" then at that point if he refuses it'll be out in the open that hes just being a greedy asshole and he'll have no excuse not to cover it. He still might refuse, but at least I'll know its just cause hes a dick and can pursue him legally.

So does anyone know how much they generally give you? Are their standard amounts, or do they negotiate a bonus with you depending on what expenses you expect the relocation to cost you?

This ""floating ground"" has the potential to be charged by paint at &gt;70kv under operation, and to discharge/arc across MEK or MEK vapor when it opens during an automatic dump recycle procedure.

Im an engineering student and i am currently having a hobby project, details of which i will not mention since that would be out of scope of this post. I feel I have hit a dead end. Here is my question. 

Basically, i have a closed torus that is hole withing ( empty ). As part of my ""device"" , the torus contains a magnet within that i wish to move within the torus by using coils spun around the torus at several places. Although I have solved most problems regarding acceleration of the magnet itself and coil/control circuitry, i am clueless about friction. 

What I mean is that from time to time, the magnet within will move around at 100-150 m/s. At such speeds, friction is obviously a problem. I have thought of putting the magnet in a ""casing"" with small wheels on it which are in contact with the inside of the torus, but i am afraid such an approach is too fragile and the wheels will rapture because of the forces that push the casing towards the inside of the torus. 

(here is a simple paint drwaing to illustrate what i mean ) 

http://postimg.org/image/p7178h7ep/

Does anyone know about similar mechanisms that have solved that problem?

So recently I've been feeling the need to make some money and gain work experience for my field/Engineering in general. 

I am a second year robotics and mechatronics student that typically has a workload of 5 hours a day 4 days a week. This would be great if it was limited to that as I could arrange work to be after or before my uni, however as there are laboratories I have to attend every second week it limits my timetable. It also doesn't help that usually the tutorials and labs are smack in the middle of the day. 

So my question is, is there any workplace that would accept me as an apprentice or should I give up?

So, I, a high school student who really wants to do some engineering, want to make a wind turbine (i plan to start around june/july, so I'n doing research now). I have already made one with a CD player motor for a club with group members, but the thing is i don't know how to change the motor to a generator (my partners in the project did that, I made the blades out of paper). Also, i would probably like to use a better motor/generator, so I can generate, say, 7 volts of electricity. most of my family is in the medical/finance field, so I don't have a lot of connections for this so i came here. Here is what I would like to accomplish:


- Generate 7 volts (I want to be able to charge my phone, plus a little extra)

The ideal here is that I would be able to charge/use a laptop or any other small appliance or something if I plug it into this universal converter i have that I want to attach and be able to use. Though i realize its a bit dangerous so i will settle for 5-7 volts produced.

-Uses really effective blades that are not paper

I would like the blades to be waterproof, so I was thinking about cutting a PVC pipe or something. I would prefer to use a more home accessible material but whatever works i suppose.

Here is what I have access to/skills i know:

-Soldering iron &amp; soldering

- wire stuff

-General tools (I do need to see exactly what I have)

-I do know some basic wood shop skills like sawing, and using those big machines and stuff

I realize it isn't much, but I think my family might have a hammer and maybe a saw or something. I would need to ask. I don't want to spend a whole lot of money, as it is my parents' money (they are fully supportive and we have the means to spend a decent amount of money, but id feel bad if i spent too much).

I looked up guides online but I have no idea what kind of motor i should get, how to change it to a generator, how to regulate voltage so my phone does not blow up or my laptop actually charges.

85,Can anyone explain why my contact stress FEA plot is coming out unintuitively?,1462485285,"Other than my intuition is wrong hopefully.

I am modeling a simple system--a roller follower (cylinder) on a camshaft (cylinder).  For those of you that may not know, a roller follower is in actual fact  not just a cylinder, it is crowned to avoid edge loading when load is applied (a barrel).  The crowning is described as a 'crown drop.'  That is to say--using the barrel as an example--what is the height difference radially from the widest point on the barrel to the radius of the barrel at one end.  The crown drop I am looking at is 20 µm over a barrel length of 9.2 mm.  This is a radius of 625 mm.

The camshaft is modeled as an actual cylinder, whose radius is 17.5 mm and is 12 mm wide.

This gives a point contact.  In all the literature and intuitively as well, if you press those two cylinders together along their centerlines, an ellipse of contact stress is formed with the peak load occurring at the center.

I am getting a ring about the center and I cannot figure out why--it must be setup somehow.

I am using SolidWorks Simulation (Professional) and have it set up as a static study.  I have the FEA solver set to Automatic.  I have two SAE papers from MAHLE and other folks that show what local mesh size they used to perform a successful study (60 µm) and I am using the same mesh size in the region of contact.  Both cylinders are steel (210 GPa Modulus, 0.3 Poisson Ratio). 

When I look at the study, the load being applied (3000 N) seems like it being applied correctly, acting only in the direction indicated.  Physically, the model seems to be behaving, but the result is odd.

I don't think it's a discretization error, but it certainly looks like it--I'd say don't be fooled, something else is wrong, I shouldn't be getting a ring of stress.

I am worried that a SolidWorks static analysis is not up to the task.  Any thoughts are appreciated.

So if I selected 50kg, it feels like I'm lifting only 25kg. If I pull on both it actually feels like lifting 50kg. In both cases the exact same stack of weights moves.

I would like to use LabVIEW for the HMI, since it's a programming language I understand and I think it would work well in this application.

I want to make something that can replicate a drawing (for example), after I manipulate the robot to draw it first. So... human input and manipulation creates the 'program', and the software tells the robot to duplicate those 'programmed' movements. The system I'm envisioning involves 3 belt-driven linear actuators... 2 longer tracks that are parallel (x-axis), and 1 shorter track spanning the distance (y-axis).

I have no idea what companies or programmers to reach out to for making this thing do all the stuff I envision. I can build it no problem, but getting it to do stuff is a whole different ballgame that I have no experience in. I really don't even know what kinds of components this would involve. There are a ton of linear motion companies out there like item North America, Parker Motion, Macro Dynamics, and some others that I found with a google search. But, how do the actuators know where they are in space? Potentiometer? Some kind of optical system that reads ticks on a reflective surface?

97,How can I reduce the vibration in my bed so I can sleep at night?,1462433873,"I'm not sure what the source is.

Maintenance checked the compressors on the roof and said they felt no vibration from them so it's not that. It could be the downstairs neighbours ceiling fan, road traffic, a/c units or some combination of all of the above, or something else entirely. I don't know. Maintenance is no longer interested in continuing to diagnose the problem as my follow up maintenance request has been completely ignored. I know that reducing the vibration at the source is the most effective method, but that isn't an option for me.

I have barely slept the last month and it's started to have noticeable effects of my physical and mental health. I need to find a way to reduce the transmission of the vibration from the floor into my bed. I have a platform bed, this one: http://www.cymax.com/Tvilum-Scottsdale-Platform-Bed-in-Black-Woodgrain-7620X61.htm. The mattress is gel foam.

I welcome all suggestions for what I can do to reduce the vibration in my bed so that I can actually sleep at night.

Thank you!

Edit: My GP, two neurologists, a psychiatrist, an audiologist, and an Ears, Nose, Throat doctor could not find anything physically or mentally wrong. Further, I don't feel it when I'm walking around outside, I only very occasionally feel it at work and the vibration there is always accompanied by an acute change in noise from the parkway, I don't feel it  standing in the bathtub, the intensity changes depending on where in the apartment I am, and I don't feel it on my balcony. Further, placing vibration isolation risers under the feet of my couch reduced about 70% of the vibration in the couch (so that is where I have started sleeping). I just can't do that with my bed because it doesn't have feet. As well, I have been struggling with anxiety my entire life, but I am 30 years old and only started feeling vibration a month ago. Anxiety symptoms don't abruptly change in mid-life. The anxiety also always follows feeling the vibration it doesn't precede it and when I first felt it I wasn't at all anxious or under any stress. And if the vibration were biological it would have a biological pattern to it. It would be steady or pulsate at the rate of my heartbeat. It doesn't. You can see ripples in a glass of water placed in some locations in the apartment and an app on my phone detects a small, but steady vibration.

Im in the process of buying a house and one of the concerns I have is the integrity of the cast-iron drain lines. One of the solutions I came across to test was hydrostatic pressure testing The gist of the test :


""With a hydrostatic test, the main sewer line is blocked and water is filled in to the parts of the drain system. If the water level falls, that is a clear sign that there is a break in the line.""

The selling became very peeved at the idea of this test because he was in the opinion of  ""[it] causes pipes to leak that normally wouldn’t because they aren't usually filled""  and that they ""damage"" the pipes and cause more problems. 

The only way I see it being an issue is if the pressure of the wall causing  excess tension, but if its supposed to be pipe for water and the water in the inspection isnt flowing generating any additional shear stress so shouldn't be an issue for the inspection. 

Am I wrong for thinking the test wouldn't ""cause more problems"". As far as i know there are no plumbing codes that have acceptable number of breaks or leaks along the line

Thanks!

I've always felt queasy about this, it leaves a taste of following protocol over rationale. I guess my question has the following components: 

1) Was there absolute certainty that none of the three hot reactors could be used to generate electricity, due to the damage done by quake and/or tsunami? 

2) Was there any kind of uncertainty that leaving the situation as-is, with or without seawater, would lead to three meltdowns?

3) If the answer to (1) und (2) is ""no"", why didn't Tepco simply order to restart one reactor so they'd have at least a chance at getting power for the cooling?

22,I'm trying to create a mathematical model of a drivetrain and I'm left with few questions.,1462347769,"This is for a discrete-time physics simulation. I have a pretty firm understanding of the drivetrain from a macroscopic perspective but I run into some weird issues when I try to put it into code. More generally when taking into account the effect of the time-step and the fact that the operations have to be done sequentially instead of instantaneously and simultaneously.

I'm making a lot of simplifications and assumptions; mainly ignoring heat,assuming all of the parts are perfectly rigid, and simplifying the moment of inertia to a single value for every part.

1. The effect of the weight of the body of the vehicle on the load of the engine. Can I reduce this to a moment of inertia equal to a point mass at the radius of the wheels?

2. For some reason I can't figure out whether friction should be applied as work or an impulse. Kinetic friction is applied in such a way that the work done is proportional to the distance traveled, right? Which would then mean that the angular impulse on a rotating axle over a given timestep is proportional to it's angular velocity? And tangentially to that, a car tire that has lost traction, and is spinning, the impulse would be proportional to the speed it's tread is traveling relative to the ground?

3. The torque output by a differential is equal on both wheels, regardless of their speed? When one wheel slows relative to the other, it's speed is lower, effectively decreasing the gear ratio. So when one wheel is stopped, the other wheel is spinning at twice the speed it normally would, which means the gear ratio is 2:1, meaning the torque delivered is 1/2, the other half going to the other wheel?

4. What is going on when a vehicle is moving and the wheels are turned,[ is it simply a friction force parallel to the axis of rotation which cancels out the momentum of the car, relative to the that axis?](http://puu.sh/oFIye/5baf0f0592.png) Is any of that momentum being 'converted' into forward momentum, or is it simply lost to friction?

23,Public transit: small suspend pods feasible?,1462336003,"so, I live in Baltimore, which has pretty terrible public transit.  with elections coming, different groups are proposing different solutions.  some want more buses, some want to remove car lanes and build a trolley system, and some want a suspended pod system.  
.  
I've been thinking about, and crunching numbers on, different public transit system for moving around the city, and I think the optimal solution is for a system like Skytran or ""Metrino"" where you basically have a roller coaster type rail system with a bunch of small vehicles that move along the track, branching off from the main line into each stop.  
.  
advantages over other systems:  
- less expensive to build than light rail, trolley, or monorail  
- above traffic, so no additional congestion   
- individual.  you wouldn't have to ride with other people  
- only stops and rider's destination, instead of many stops  
the only disadvantage I see is that it's unproven.  
.  
[here is one system  ](http://trak.in/tags/business/2015/02/19/driverless-metrino-pods-delhi-manesar-transportation/)  
[and here is another example](https://youtu.be/Tqx2gLl_8pM?t=447)

what do you guys think?

24,A question about draft angles and plastic design,1462330589,"At university, I have always been told to include draft angles in the design of plastic parts for the benefit of easily removing the part from moulds and extending tool life. I have never actually had a plastic part manufactured until recently and it did not have a draft angle. The part did not come out as expected and draft angle might be a factor. 

My question is, why do some plastic parts I find all around me (lamps, printers boxes etc) look like they do not have any draft (has straight vertical walls)? Just going off basic trigonometry, the longer the adjacent side gets, the greater opposite side becomes. Even with a 1 degree angle, lengths greater than 1mm are noticeable and affect the design.

I guess on a related note, how do manufacturers achieve seemingly vertical walls in plastic design?

EDIT:

This is a simple illustration to give some context of what I am talking about

http://imgur.com/D4s7lfz

Currently the CAD model of the green part has no draft. Adding draft to make it manufacturable adds flaring to the walls losing its vertical walls. This would cause problems in the CAD assembly. At 1 degree draft, the flaring reaches 3.28mm which is quite big. When I look at other plastic products, they seem to have straight vertical walls.

26,Do these CFD results look resonable? Also possible critique for my CDR presentation.,1462326538,"Hello,

I will be having my CDR presentation for an aircraft we designed tomorrow, and I was wondering if anyone could look at my aerodynamic slides and point out any obvious flaws or ask questions that could be asked during presentation? 

Some quick background on our plane and design:

We were tasked with creating an LSA aircraft for recreational pilots and decided to go with a safe, stable and versatile configuration. We are an amphibious aircraft with tandem wings for this reason.

As far as my slides go, we used hand calculations and XFLR5 to validate our values from STAR-CCM+ which we used to obtain our final L/D values and images of down wash. We needed optimal back wing placement to ensure that the front wing's down wash does not affect the back wing.

The thing I have a concern of is our L/D estimates, while the tandem wing configuration gives us great efficiency, our bulky amphibious fuselage should be producing large amounts of drag. I feel like my CFD analysis could have been performed incorrectly, which results in a higher L/D than expected. How would I go about defending this point?

Also could I say that in future iterations we will focus on tapering the fuselage to further reduce drag?

Are there any glaring flaws or errors that anyone in industry could point out?

27,Want to build a wireless switch,1462322640,"Hi everyone,

First, a disclaimer: I am completely out of my element. I was hoping to get pointed to some references from here if nothing else. 

I have a backdoor to my apartment that can only be locked from the inside. I'd like to enter and leave through the back, but there is no way to lock the door from outside. I was thinking that I could build a little machine that could move the lock up and down when activated by some wireless signal (something small that I could carry on my keychain). The idea I had was to have a little linear actuator or something of the sort that can move the locking switch up and down.

Ideally I'd like to have the wireless activator, but also a button activator that I could use when I'm just inside the apartment. 

Any ideas of how I could get started on this? What sort of things should I look up? Any good references?

Thanks!

32,How much do you/should you rely on your machinists and technicians for input on a design?,1462309200,"I ask this to people who are in the working world.  I'm still a student, working on my senior design project.  As I've have started designing parts and taking them to potential vendors to place an order, I'll sit and talk with them about the component.

In particular, I was talking with a guy whose whole life revolved around compression springs, and I brought him some specs on two.  One of them he immediately pointed out that if it was fit in to an empty tube it needs to have an outer diameter close to the interior of the tube.  I don't recall learning that in any of my physics, statics, or dynamics classes - and that seems important.  I am now going to go back and *vastly* alter the spring, as its outer diameter is less than half of the diameter of the interior of the tube.

Now I suspect every time I take another component to a vendor, the helpful ones who are ok with talking to me will also give similarly valuable feedback.  But where is the line?  At what point can you conclude that what they said is either wrong or not optimal or doesn't work?  How often are your designs changed because you brought it to someone who works on that part and identified a seemingly obvious flaw?

I feel like part of this is expected - I'm still not yet a paid professional.  I have only an internship dealing with the thermodynamic and fluid mechanic concepts from mechanical engineering discipline, and don't deal hardly at all with the physical and dynamic concepts.

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

Is the dotted line area all one 'tank' that the siphon will keep the overflow box (purple) + first chamber water level the same height as the display tank? Or will gravity be forcing water over the wall of the first sump chamber into the second chamber causing more water to drain from the display than returned by the pump?

46,"How can I calculate the amount of force needed to launch a canvas painting 2x its actual height with a heavy duty push solenoid, and where could I find such a part?",1462249292,"Every once in a while I watch TV, but when I'm not watching it I hate having a blank TV in the room. So I got the idea to cover the TV with a picture—not weighing in at more than 5 pounds, but lets say 5 pounds for example sake—that was on tracks mounted to the wall. The picture would have rollers that ran in the tracks, much like a cabinet drawer but, yknow, vertical. 

The idea is thus:

* The picture's natural resting state is in front of the TV. At the bottom of the picture on either side are two vertically-mounted, push-solenoid valves

* A remote control triggers a sensor located on the picture

* The sensor activates a low voltage power relay, which sends power to the electromagnet in the push-solenoid

* The push-solenoid plungers smack the bottom of the picture frame (maybe with some sort of rubber strike plates to soften the noise) and launch the picture up, double the height of the picture (3 feet), where at the apex of their ascent they lock in place via solenoid cabinet locks. This reveals the TV and leaves the painting resting above until it needs to be covered again

* When the TV needs to be covered again, a separate button on the remote activates the cabinet solenoids, thereby dropping the painting back into its original state

SO: How do I calculate the force needed to launch a 5 pound canvas 64"" into the air, and where can I find such a solenoid?

Hinge opens upward like pac mans mouth

my thoughts -

Sum of Moments at D = 0 

A is a the center of mass of the lid (lid is 14"" diameter)

B is where the screws attach the lid to the hinge

Hinge has 90° angle then attaches to other end of hinge mounted to surface



I was thinking at first that sum of moments at B = 0 so i wanted to get the force that the screws attaching the lid would see

So -F(a)*D(a) + F(b)*D(b) = 0 then solve for F(b)



But then it occurred to me that because the Lid and Mass are not in line w/ each other the mass may be putting an addition moment onto the screw joint



And then had the same thought about the mass putting a moment on the hinge at C because they're not inline / on the same plane.

54,eddy current braking,1462230000,"I'm working on a homemade ergometer (rowing machine) which uses a bicycle wheel as a flywheel and to provide resistance (see [this video](https://youtu.be/BcEFyDg7qEk?t=13) as an example).

The trick is, I am not keen on adding fan blades to the bicycle wheel (for air resistance) for a number of reasons, but one being that adding blades to the wheel reliably is difficult, and another being that I would rather not have to build an enclosure to adjust airflow (ie, resistance).

Instead I'd like to use some magnets to create an [eddy current brake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake). The bicycle wheel is aluminum and from an old road bike. Ideally I'd mount the magnets together on a bracket which can be adjusted to vary the resistance on the wheel's spinning.

My questions: in order to produce the maximum resistance to the wheel, what would be the best configuration of magnets? For example, Should I have several magnets placed all around the circumference, or stack them together at a single point? Should I place them all on one side over a longer distance, or have them on both sides of the wheel? 

Is there going to be an issue of heat buildup if the magnets are constantly braking for, say, an hour? Granted, the bicycle wheel is pretty light, so there's not a lot of load.

On a side note more for my curiosity, is there any physical difference between a linear brake and a disc brake? On the wikipedia page (linked above) they show a linear brake with one magnet on one side, and the disc brake with two magnets on opposing sides. My intuition would be that both configurations would work in either scenario, but maybe I'm missing something?

55,How can power plants increase output without desynchronization?,1462223615,"During one of my journey's through the YouTube galaxy I somehow got interested in power system synchronization. I understood that a generator needs to be in sync with the grid before it can be connected to it. So the operators will try to slow down or speed up the generator until it's output frequency (and phase?) matches that of the grid.

But then, how can they increase or decrease the power output later depending on the demand without loosing sync? To me, the only way of changing power output is by changing RPM, but this would influence the frequency and destroy the synchronization.",AskEngineers,MrPozor,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4hju2j/how_can_power_plants_increase_output_without/

59,Searching for resources on maximal use of data,1462213134,"This specifically relates to a problem in physics, but I'm trying to keep this general, and I hope to get a sense of where I should be looking for information and resources on this type of problem.


Simple version:


Suppose I have a set of 6 measurement of a single function, i.e. f(x1), f(x2),..., f(x6), but I don't know anything else about the function. I want to say as much as I can about f with the available data. My understanding is that, because I only have six data points, I can only say six ""things"" about f, perhaps its average value and some 5 ""derivatives"". I can only independently fit 6 parameters, and any other number I can calculate is dependent on those 6. Is this true, or is there someway to do better?


More complicated version:


Now I have some set of measurements of a single function of two variables, let's say space and time. The set of measurements can be broken down into two subsets: one with good spatial resolution (small delta x) but bad time resolution (high delta t), and the other with bad spatial resolution but good time resolution. Supposed I have 5 measurements of each subset, so I'd like to say 10 ""things"" about my function. The most intuitive way to me would be to say 5 things about the function per subset, and then combine those things into 10 things about the function. My problem here is that I don't know what this sort of procedure would be called, or where to look for information on it. I'm sure this is a much considered problem in literature, and I'm looking for a pointer on where to begin.


Any pointers to resources or to a more appropriate subreddit would be much appreciated. I've got a very strong background in math and science, but less so in statistics, CS, and engineering.


Just so people know where I'm coming from, the problem is to fit a field in a volume as a function of time. I have one set of measurements with delta x ~ mm and delta t ~ day, and one with delta x ~ m and delta t ~ sec. I can fit the high spatial resolution data, but I want to use the high time resolution data to more effectively bridge the time gap between the first type of measurements. My current method uses the second type to smoothly interpolate the average of the first type, and then changes the other parameters proportionally. This is an ok method for the field I have, but systematic errors are the killers of this measurement, and I'm not using a lot of data that way.",AskEngineers,BigOwlStudios,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4hizae/searching_for_resources_on_maximal_use_of_data/
60,Beam deflection analysis via successive integration method: seeking pointers on how to further analysis using linear algebra.,1462211620,"In my Strength of Materials class, I have been learning the successive integration method for developing deflection equations for a loaded beam system. Once the integrations are completed and the deflection and deflection curve slope equations are developed, the beam-specific boundary equations can be used in order to solve for the leftover integration constants (# boundary conds must = # of integration constants). This yields a system of equations that can be placed in an n x n matrix. My question is what kinds of things can you do linear-algebra wise, with this matrix? Basically I’m wanting to know if anything interesting can be done with this matrix to further the analysis of the system. It has been a couple semesters since I took linear algebra so I'm slightly rusty, but I’m sure I can re-learn/remember any necessary operations. Our professor places special emphasis on these beam deflection problems and since he did not cover anything further than creating the system of equations, I’d like to really blow him out of the water on the final with a unique depth of analysis he likely won’t see.

62,Is the Taguchi method right for my application? Should I consider an alternative?,1462204073,"The application here is actually a computer simulation of vehicle performance with specific track conditions and monitoring a particular wheel-track interaction parameter resulting from the simulation. We'll call it L. For the case here, larger is ""better"", or the result I want to achieve. Seven vehicle components are being studied, each with two levels: nominal or degraded (good condition vs. worn). Given two levels for each of 7 components, the possible combinations to test are 2^7 =128. This is what prompted my partner here to look into Taguchi to try to go about this efficiently.

With all degraded components, L is largest. However, this is clearly not realistic. By simply making one component nominal, L drops dramatically, so I'd like to find the combination(s) that give me the highest L while representing a realistic good/worn configuration. There are no noise factors involved that I can think of without purposely creating them (e.g. different track profiles). So, with each test combination only one L is obtained.

Taking an example straight from a Taguchi document we have here, I did a trial of 8 test runs of 4/7 worn combinations and looked at how much each component contributed to the variation of the results. I got results but I'm not 100% sure how to interpret them or if Taguchi was the best method to use. So here are a few questions,

1. If there is a possible interaction between two variables, e.g. AxB, which needs to be added to the control factor array, am I correct in that the AxB column doesn't have to immediately follow columns A and B? A coworker said order is important but I don't see matrix operations that require this.

2. I feel like the analysis isn't complete. I only tested 8 4/7 combinations which was presented in our resource but what about all the rest? Is the point of Taguchi to take a limited size grouping and let the math point to the top candidates?

3. My application fortunately requires only a simplified Taguchi analysis, but is this the best way to go about my investigation? Do you have other methods to recommend?

Since 2011, I am working as  as a PVT Lab technician and now as a Reservoir Fluids Analyst in service companies. I enjoyed what I was doing and learning new things and concepts. Most of my learning was on the job, asking experienced managers and technicians. The rest was Google.

84,"Engineers who ended up pursuing a role/career other than their field of study, why did you veer in that direction and how do you feel about it? Are you happy with where you are?",1462051760,"Hi, first time poster. I just wanted to share of where my career/life has headed since graduating from Chemical Engineering.

Following graduation, I didn't really have a specific direction of where I wanted to go to, but I had nice preference to working either in oil and gas or food engineering. However, I had a really hard time find a job in those fields and within chemical engineering in general. I searched EVERYWHERE (within Canada) to find at least something. I've tried job boards, job agencies, job fairs, conferences (to make connections), etc. You name it. After digging for 2 years (more or less) and working on summer contract/part-time positions to stay afloat, I eventually found a small environmental consulting firm, which offered a decent salary with a 6-month probationary period and no real benefits besides a 2-week vacation with pay. Without going into too much detail, the job consisted of drilling boreholes and assessing groundwater/soil quality. Nevertheless, I thought this would be my dream job considering I'm pretty passionate about protecting the environment and this job would be a way to contribute to that area. 

However, the job wasn't what I thought it was. After two weeks of training, I was expected to manage borehole drilling projects on my own without supervision, which I felt super uncomfortable especially for a newbie. ""It would be easy, they said. You will be fine, they said"". 

From my first project until my very last, I ended up making a mistake somewhere in the project, whether it was drilling in the wrong location or dropping a bailer down a borehole because I didn't tie it properly or sampling the wrong soil/groundwater due to mislabeling/clumsiness/insufficient training. Some days, I would end up guessing what to do because either I couldn't reach anyone over the phone when I needed them most or I was too afraid to ask in fear of being ""stupid for asking"". In addition, I couldn't meet project deadlines sometimes because of how unrealistic they were when I actually carry out the tasks in the field. 

I ended working overtime on nearly every project (without pay/extra lieu time), had sleepless nights worrying about the projects I was working on, and was tired all the time physically and mentally. The job started affecting my relationship with my friends/family, and lost touch with activities I love to do like yoga, baking, and even catching up on TV shows/movies. All I wanted to do was sleep, which was even difficult to do on weekends. I became so depressed to the point of thinking of suicide. I thought I was a failure and incompetent to be an engineer and was not worthy of the Iron ring. I thought that if this was what my life after engineering would be like, I would have picked a different field of study to pursue.

Closing towards my 6-month probationary period, the owner calls me in to discuss my performance and decides to lay me off in two weeks time. It took everything in my power not to ball my eyes out, but I eventually pulled through. I left for the day pretending like nothing happened, saying by my co-workers and finishing my duties as usual. When I got home and went into my bedroom though, I balled my eyes out for what felt like for an eternity. The thing was I wasn't crying because I was upset I lost my job. In fact, I was balling out tears of joy, happy that I no longer need to torture myself of sleepless nights and stress. I slept like a baby for the first time in months. 

Currently, I'm working at a call centre at a bank supporting business clients and have never been happier. I started getting back into yoga, baked cookies for my fellow colleagues on occasion, and was able to catch up on all of my TV shows/movies I missed. I've even began learning another language for my trip to Cuba in July (which I can't wait!). It's also the first time I've been able to keep a job more than 6 months, which has never been the case in the past as the positions were either summer contracts/part time. I've been thinking of pursuing a career somewhere in the bank. However, my parents haven't been fond of my career choice. Just this afternoon, my mom calls me and starts rambling on her wild requests like ""You should study to become a lawyer or a teacher"" and even degrading my job by saying my salary was close to the poverty line (which it isn't, I get paid $20/h). My dad even got on the phone saying that he will pay for my tuition fees to study for my law degree (which I call bullshit; both of my parents can barely even support themselves unless they have offshore accounts, but that's a different story for another day). I know that parents want the best for me, but their negative energy is really starting to annoy me to the point of just thinking to cut them out of my life. My mom wants me at the very least find another job in engineering, but I haven't really touched on that since I've started working at the bank. I still can't bring myself to wear the Iron Ring because there's always that thought in the back of my head convincing me that I'm not competent/ready to be an engineer, and maybe being an engineer wasn't meant for me. 

Despite having lost my old job, my former boss did have a lot of insight and empathy with me and told me something at that probationary meeting that really made me reflect myself and where I wanted to go in my life (paraphrased): ""It's OK to be stressed a little bit on the job, every job has a different degree of stress, but you shouldn't be stressed to the point that it's unhealthy"". 

I guess enough about my story. Are there others out there who have switched careers from engineering? How has it turned out for you?

TL;DR 

Had an engineering job, but it didn't work out. 

Found another job and turned my life around. 

My parents don't like my career choice, 

And want to stop my money voice. 

Should I take their advice and find engineering jobs, 

or pursue my own destiny and be my own boss?

What factors must I keep in mind? 
What equations will I need, and how should I test for the variables?

To clarify on that vague title, I'm building a solar retropie/phone charging station for a camping trip, and I'm planning on having lead acid battery backups. In my cursory plan for that section, I was going to use a buck converter to drop an ~18v bus (boosted from whatever the solar panels put out) down to a float voltage, with an atmega sampling voltages and switching mosfets for charge/discharge, but I just realized that a float voltage won't necessarily charge the batteries to capacity, or quickly if it can. Would it be practical to set the buck converter to mimic the voltage output of a car alternator, and turn it on temporarily if the battery voltage is under a limit? If I understand right, that is how an alternator behaves, only supplying current when the battery/system voltage is below a limit. And, aside from this, how long can a surface charge last on lead acid?

I've come across a situation that no one seems to be able to give an answer to...

When solving Q = m*cp*deltaT integration of the expression for Cp(assuming it was avaialble) with respect to temperature would give the most accurate value of Q.

In the past when there's been a small change in Cp I've approximated it by using an average of the value at T2 and T1. Recently I came across the expression Q = m(T2Cp2-T1Cp1) used instead.

23,How do I select the proper compression spring?,1461898261,"Hello everyone! You'll have to excuse me, I barely know what I'm talking about but I just need some help! Please go easy on me... 

So I've come up with an idea and I need a compression spring that can compress under stress, but not completely. It needs to support a payload that would be carried by a handle and absorb the weight as a person is moving with it. 

Imagine a vertical handle that's holding a payload of 15lbs below it. I'm looking for a spring that would essentially be rigged on top of that handle and be able to absorb the weight and shock of walking with the payload (the handle being able to slide and compress the spring above it). So after each step, the spring would compensate the vertical motion of moving and keep the payload steady, though it doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to absorb the initial shock of walking or running.

I've done some research and I found this formula: Force(F)=k(Dstanding - Ddeflected) 
and I've got a couple questions. What does k mean? It says, ""spring constant"" but I'm not sure how that's calculated. Also, is this formula stringent on the type of material the spring is made out of? How about the wire diameter and total amount of coils or space between each coil? 

So the spring I'm hoping will work for me would fit these dimensions (in inches), and be able to hold a force of 15lbs:
Length(standing): 1.88"", 
Wire Diameter: 0.25"", 
Inside Diameter: 0.88"", 
Outside Diameter: 1.38"", 

If there's any other information necessary please let me know!

I've been looking at this website that makes custom springs, but I'm not sure which type of material to select for this or even the total amount of coils.  [Custom Spring Website](http://www.asbg.com/products/springs-overview/compression-springs.aspx)

36,"In 1990 a superflu kills 99.4% of the population in five days. What happens to the Boulder Canyon Hydroelectric plant, and two months later, could layman fix it and restart it? (link to the plant inside)",1461873332,"Many science fiction stories take place in a world where society has collapsed. A recent sample includes:

+ The Stand (1990)
+ Planet of the Apes
+ The Walking Dead
+ The 100
+ The Last Ship

In The Stand, in 1990, survivors of the plague gather in Las Vegas and Boulder and are put to work fixing the power plant.

Boulder has about 700 people in it, drawn randomly across the 0.6% of survivors. 

&gt; According to Ralph, there wasn't that much wrong at the power plant, at least
not that much visible. The crews who ran it had shut some of the machinery down; 
other machinery had shut itself down. Two or three of the big turbine engines
had blown, perhaps as the result of some final power surge. Ralph said that some
of the wiring would have to be replaced, but he thought that he and Brad
Kitchner and a crew of a dozen warm bodies could do that. ***A much bigger work
crew was needed to remove fused and blackened copper wire from the blown turbine
generators and then install new copper wire by the yard.*** There was plenty of
copper wire in the Denver supply houses for the taking; Ralph and Brad had gone
one day last week to check for themselves. With the manpower, they thought they
could have the lights on again by Labor Day.

&gt; ""And then we'll throw the biggest fucking party this town ever saw,"" Brad
said.

Assuming these guys are at the Boulder Canyon Hydroelectric plant, and I don't know if they are, but that's a reasonable assumption

https://www-static.bouldercolorado.gov/docs/boulder-canyon-hydro-historical-report-historical-narrative-1-201303281341.pdf

&gt; The Boulder Canyon Hydroelectric (BCH) is a power-generating system located between
Boulder and Nederland, Colorado along Colorado Highway 119 and Boulder and Middle
Boulder Creeks. BCH, which consists of Barker Dam and Reservoir, the Barker gravity line,
Kossler Dams and Reservoir, the Boulder Canyon Penstock, and the Boulder Canyon power
plant, is recorded as Site 5BL752. The Boulder Canyon power plant and associated structures,
which are the focus of t study, have been recorded as Site 5BL754. The power plant site is
surrounded by steep, forested hills and includes a hydroelectric generating power plant (built
1909-1910), two transformer yards (Feature 5 completed in 1909 and Feature 6 completed in the
late 1940s), a seven-bay vehicle garage (1937), four storage buildings (circa 1940 to 1950), and a
contemporary switching building (1992). Detailed construction plans were found for the sevenbay
garage, dated 1937, but a similar structure appears on a 1932 sketch map of the site. The
majority of the power generating and switching equipment inside the power plant was installed
during the 1930s when the plant was substantially rebuilt. The piping, gates, and other fixtures
used to direct the flow of the water used for power generation are almost all original, dating to
1909-1910. 

&gt; The City is currently undertaking replacement of one of two turbine/generators that are located in
the 1909-1910 hydroelectric generating building. Two turbines/generators, each capable of
producing 5 megawatts (MW) of power, were originally installed in the building. In the mid-
1930s, upgrades to the generators increased the capacities to 10 MW each, for a total plant
capacity of 20 MW. One generator (Unit A) failed in 2000 and was not repaired. The other unit
(Unit B) has continued to supply power and will be replaced by a new 5-MW unit, which is the
appropriate capacity for the water now available for generation at BCH. The City will leave the
existing Unit A turbine/generator in place, but it will be inoperable. The City is also planning to
replace transformers (c. 1940), install enhanced lightning protection, upgrade the wiring, remove
and replace an old storage tank, and install a state-of-the-art turbine isolation valve and remote
monitoring and operation equipment

+ What happens to a plant when its operators die?
  + graceful shutdown
  + catastrophic failure
  + something else
+ What is the physical size of a 5 - 20MW generator?
+ How much does it weigh?
+ Is it reasonable to think a crew of laymen could rewind its windings on site?
+ Is it reasonable to think this crew could get the plant and the territory it serves back online?

I think this comes up again in The 100, when the protagonists blow up the turbines at a small hydro plant. Not a problem according to the writers of that show, they figured our 100 (or 80 or 60) survivors, mostly space station teens, should be able to repair blowed up turbines. *[Raven is a dangerous moron, she could just have easily blown up the single tower carrying the power out of the power plant and then been left with rewiring that single tower, but no, she blowed up four turbines.]*

The Last Stand will presumably face it at some point, as perhaps the Walking Dead

I honestly enjoy shows that take place in these scenarios, wondering about what it would take to rebuild society, and where in the Industrial Revolution we would land after some massive calamity.

49,Automotive Electrical Diagram Generation Advice [Crosspost from r/engineering],1461840124,"Hi All!

I'm an undergrad aerospace controls engineering student currently working on a project of some significance for my university. As the person primarily responsible for the avionics and electronics throughout the vehicle we're building, it's my job to design and map out our wiring, control modules, and other electronic devices.

Most of my experience in this field comes from several years of research experience with automotive CAN Bus systems, of which I've dissected, designed, and built my fair share of. Because of this, I have a fairly good grasp on the standard ways of laying out vehicle electronic networks, and, working with a team of more ECE-oriented engineers, we've designed a complete system that we're ready to physically implement.

The issue is that I very much dislike working with most types of electrical system layout diagrams, which I find very messy and tedious to design and interpret. The one form of diagram I have the most experience with, and prefer above all others when putting together manufacturing procedures, is a ""current track diagram"" (not sure if that's an official name or not), which I see mostly in foreign cars (the lab I work with uses a lot of Volkswagens). These are those diagrams which show each current path in a different column, show the connections between each path and relevant modules, and can even show things like wire color and connector type. **The major feature of these diagrams is that each current path in the vehicle is numbered, placed into its own column, and easily interpret-able as a specific wiring run.**

I am wondering if anybody knows any software capable of generating the types of diagrams I am looking for. I am not sure exactly what the industry name or practice regarding the types of diagrams I'm interested in are, but any help would be great. I'd really love to be able to lay out our electrical systems with these diagrams, since they're very easy to build and read on my end and easy to interpret for anyone reading them. I may even resort to drawing it out by hand, but it would obviously be fantastic if anybody knows of **software capable of generating these diagrams**. 

Examples:

[Chevy Diagram](http://amotmx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wpid-Chevrolet-Captiva-Wiring-Diagramthumb.png)
(not what I want, but what all software I can find is focused on making)

If anybody knows of software that can help me generate these diagrams, or has any other advice when dealing with this issue, I'd love to hear it.

    E(1789) * B(2:1) * Fc(6) = 9000 CFM

E is the electric motor with an actual RPM of 1789
B is a pulley and belt setup with a 2:1 reduction
Fc(6) is a centrifugal fan with 6 blades that's putting out 9000 CFM (full disclosure: I have no idea how much volume these things are actually moving).

So, looking at the equation I could know exactly what kind of setup is in question without ever seeing a picture. Further, a well structured language could be machine readable, allowing a computer to make a rendering of the setup without additional input from a human.

There's a lot of dimensions that could be added to my example, but I figured I'd ask around before I go reinventing the wheel.",AskEngineers,rmkreeg,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4grmyi/is_there_a_standardized_language_equationlike_to/

Right now I have a few, but I need more. I can't just get more of the ones I have, because the ones I have right now are actually kind of overkill and as a result pretty expensive. For example, I have the [Keithley 236](https://www.hofstragroup.com/media/product_images/productimage-picture-keithley-236-source-measure-unit-2307.jpg), which is great, but it can do about a million things I don't need, and as a result, it's about $1500 used.

I don't actually need anything that complicated -- I definitely don't need any sort of sensing/measuring/triggering/etc, and for most of the applications I just want to be able to turn a +12VDC source on or off. Also, I don't really need an incredible amount of precision (the Keithley can go down to like, nV precision I don't need).

So, basically, I'd like some relatively cheap piece of equipment I could control with a GPIB connection, to either set a voltage with relatively low precision, or at the very least turn a set voltage on and off.

So the idea is to put a variety of visual markers on some dancers and have them demonstrate the movements, then track the positions of the markers in relation to each other to figure out things like hip and shoulder rotation, weight distribution, spine curvature, ideal body contact and position between dance partners, and so forth. Eventually we hope to be able to make use of a motion capture stage, but we are starting  with video.

Today a project manager asked for some help concerning some communication with the client regarding AWS D1.1 (American Structural Welding Code for Steel). I told him while I am not an expert I'm more than happy to do what I can to help. Long story short, it became apparent that ""we"" are representing a component of a welded product as something it is not. Specifically ""we"" are telling our client that the entire product is made of 70ksi steel when a part of it is actually 36ksi steel.   
  
The first thing I did was check the expected loads and confirmed that the 36ksi steel is more than adequate for the expected loads on that component, I can confidently say that it presents no danger of failure to the end user. Next I checked that the weld procedure was appropriate for the dissimilar materials. In short, there is no Engineering reason NOT to do what we are doing (that I could find). In fact I would even consider suggesting this very replacement as a method of cost savings.    
  
My hang up comes in the Business Ethics. We are representing to our client that a material is something that it is not. Additionally, while he didn't say it right out, the project manager strongly hinted that they are manipulating MTRs and other documentation to perpetuate the lie.

I presume that the motor will act as a generator and give *some* resistance however can't seem to be able to find any information.

I am thinking that the resistive torque will depend on what the motor is electrically connected to as it will begin to produce emf, maybe there is scope for a regenerative breaking mechanism..?

97,Question regarding structural computation on composite structures,1461681194,"Hey guys!

I have a few questions regarding composite structural calculation, more specifically, FEA.
In my line of work we mainly use metallic and plastic materials, so Ansys Workbench works perfectly for our needs, without much manipulation of the program itself.

But myself and some friends of mine were interested in trying to calculate an all-composite (carbon fiber) chassis for a project we are working on. We are talking not only static, but also dynamic simulations.

What type of software best suits our needs? What type of mindset do we need to adapt, from what we are usually accustomed to (metallic materials)?

2,Testing the tensile strength of a sheet material? Eg Cardboard / Cloth,1461663317,"Hello,

This enquiry came up when I was in my engineering class, sadly the class syllabus didn't cover this kind of question thus my instructor couldn't quite answer it. Hence why I'm coming to you.

The issue I have is with the apparatus which I was thinking of using (http://imgur.com/EbEMPc0 Drawn in very rough 3rd angle orthographic) and how to interpret the forces. The lightly hatched area would be the material being tested; which would be held by four bars and rods as seen to create a closely uniform load across the sheet. Held by one side to a solid foundation while the other would be used to add a load by a rope/cord attached from the two bottom rods until failure.

How ever since the bars aren't permanently attached to the sheet, shear forces would be an issue around the rods. Is there a better way of attaching the sheet to the apparatus or using a completely different apparatus to achieve the best results? Also would the shear forces be exerted in a radial sense or on tangents in line with the load?

4,Oil lip seal tolerances ?,1461651365,"Hi,

I have an single lip oil seal running on a shaft journal (crank pulley, altima 2002 2.5L).


The seal has made a small groove into the shaft (after about 300 million revolutions). This causes the seal to have a reduced lifespan of about 6 months.

I'd like to replace this seal with a double lip seal. I'm hoping at least one of the sealing surface will not fall into the groove.  

I cannot find the right oil seal online (on ebay mostly) but I have found close. 

My question is this, how far off can I be from the original seal dimensions and still get a good seal ?


First some dimensions.

--------------------------------

Old seal thickness 0.269""

Old seal outer diameter 2.290""

Old seal inner diameter 1.790""

New seal inner diameter 1.730""

Shaft journal thickness 1.811""

---------------------------------

I think a 1.790"" ID from the old oil seal would not leak if it weren't for the groove in the shaft, that's 0.020"" interference fit with the shaft. I don't know at all what kind of interference fit I'm looking for though. Obviously the ID of a new seal could be down to 1.730 and still not be an issue.

Outer diameter of 2.290"" was a light snug fit, I feel it could be tighter and not be too hard to push in but it probably can't be too much looser (but how much is that dimensionaly !?)

I can't find seals with imperial measurements (because search engines don't likes terms like '13/16', at least ebay doesn't)


--------------------

So closest metric values are as follows.

seal OD 2.290"" -&gt; 58.166 mm

seal ID 1.790"" to 1.730"" -&gt; 45.466 to 43.942 mm

seal thickness 0.269"" -&gt; 6.8326 mm

Shaft OD 1.811"" -&gt; 45.974 mm

-------------------------

Seems to be the closest fit 44x58x8, my seal OD will be undersized by 0.166mm / 0.0065. Enough to make it too loose ?

Alternatively I could go with 45x59x7 but the larger ID of the seal leaves me half way between worn seal ID and fresh seal ID.



I think by asking the question I sort of answered it. I would like to know what kind of min / max interference fits I should try to maintain with oil lip seals for future reference ?

I could also machine my shaft OD down to exactly 45mm and then choose a seal with a 1mm smaller ID than the previous ""fresh seal"", namely 43x58x8.

Are lip seal dimensions quote in actual seal dimension or in dimension of the mating part ?

For example a lip seal with a 58mm ID, is it for a 58mm shaft or is the 58mm the ""unconstrained"" ID dimension of the shaft ?

5,Help with a Design Project,1461645973,"Hey, I'm an engineer in training! I'm a Mechanical Engineering Major and I just had a friend ask me to help assist them in a project.

They are building a unique table and wanted my advice/input on the specs and design of it. They wanted to pay me but I choose just to volunteer for the project since I didn't feel comfortable getting payed as I have no design/engineering experience but wanted to be apart of the project and learn something new.

So this table he wants to build is going to have one leg, and from my understanding he wants the leg to be outside of the table and to sort of come off a corner on the left side. Its a little bit trippy but its a super cool project I think.

So heres the specs:

-The top of the table will be 3x7 ft, and need to hold a 500lb point load anywhere on the table. The top of the table will be a wood top made of purple heart wood and will be 3/18 inches thick.

-Their needs to be 4-6 inches between the edge of the table and the edge of the leg.

-The base of the table needs to be some sort of steel or metal that can support of the weight of the table top and any weight loaded onto it.
The two constraints he gave me were that it could not be bolted to the ground or hung with wires from the ceiling for support.

I know its a bit of a ridiculous project but he's a really eccentric guy, he's hired a structural engineer as well as a wood worker to assist in this project. I'm only here as a volunteer but I would love to contribute to the project.

I am curious if one could modify the starting control for one of these pumps, to either shut off the auxiliary winding or switch in a different capacitor value in order to slow down the pump as it approaches the shut-off pressure.

The idea would be to reduce pump wear by having it cycle between ""fast"" and ""slow"" instead having to do a hard start on every cycle. And you could get a narrower range of pressure regulation while using smaller rates of flow.

13,"What are the best methods of power generation by duty type (base, peak, following) and can green (non-dispatchable) power ever replace these?",1461615951,"Thanks for reading. I'm very curious about the actual state of power generation in the world today i.e. that which cannot be easily gleaned from the media or from (typically biased) common knowledge.

I'm aware that there are four basic ""duty"" types of power plant: 1. Base-load (always-on predictable power) 2. Peaking (basically ad-hoc power) 3. Following (power needed before a base-power plant is running at full capacity) and 4. Non-dispatchable power (basically most green power which must be used when available).

From what I understand currently (very basically summarized):

* Only nuclear, coal, and hydro / geothermal (where available) can be used for base load power because output is predictable.
* Solar and wind is not suitable for base-load power because you can never be 100% certain of how much power you will get in any given hour or day - therefore you always need a backup (such as nuclear or fossil fuels) to guarantee power is always available.
* Gas power (in its various forms like fossil or bio) is most commonly used in Peaking / Following plants because these reactors can be quickly started / stopped as needed - which is not possible with nuclear, and more difficult (or expensive) with coal.
* Geothermal is quite possible the best form of power available (predictable, clean, cheap, and abundant) but is only viable in very few locations (like Iceland).

Am I out of date on any of these ? Am I missing something or incorrect about something? Is it possible for green energy (solar / wind) to replace any of these duty types, or will they always be limited to non-dispatchable duties?

I have performed FEA, assuming perfect bonds between the different sections of the brackets. Now I just need to prove that the bolts holding the different parts of the bracket together are strong enough to withstand the loads.

Using this website (http://www.tech.plymouth.ac.uk/sme/desnotes/boltb.htm) I found that the UTS of my m6 bolts (grade 8.8) which hold the brackets together is 16098N.

The total mass of the brackets and camera is 4.75kg.

The maximum acceleration the bracket will experience is 20g vertical. 

My question is, how do I calculate whether the bolts will be able to withstand the load? I assume the best way is to see whether one bolt can hold the entire load.

I'm guessing that these requests and packets of information have to be turned into bits somehow.  Is it like a signal for a processor where there's a threshold, like 3.3V (just an example) that causes a gate to close?

Here are some questions that I have:

* Do ISPs have stations that basically decide when to send a certain signal out, at a fraction of a moment?  

* How can that work if there are thousands of ""active"" connections over a cable at any moment?  

* How can certain modems pick out *their* signal?

29,Conventional MS or specialized Masters for BME,1461554625,"I am in a dilemma. Tomorrow, I have to choose between going to Georgia Tech for its Masters in BioID (Biomedical Innovation and Development) program, or continue at my current State School for my MS in BME. In your experience, would it be better to get my MS, or take the plunge for the specialized Masters? For reference, I am interested in manufacturing / QA / regulatory affairs as it relates to biomedical engineering (BME). 

The pros and cons I have right now are as follows:

*GTech:*

**Pros:**

* Higher ranked school

* Better networking connections / career fairs

* Program has 100% job placement (it's only been around two years, however)

* No thesis

* Industry Focus

* 1 year


**Cons:**

* Very expensive (&gt;60k total)

* Requires full relocation (expensive)

* Not a true ""Master of Science"" degree

* May not be technical enough degree

* I do not have prior industry experience

* Program is VERY new

* Programs like these known to be used as revenue generators 



*State University*:

**Pros:**

* In-state tuition (&lt;30k for whole degree)

* Close to home, no relocation

* Traditional MS, courses build on technical hard science

* Can get PhD in future if necessary (job growth)

* No need to rebuild entire new network base, just build on existing

* Familiar, friends, girlfriend is here :)

Additionally, I am nearly guaranteed (knock on wood) an internship that pays right above $20/hr during the school year if I stay and do my MS at my current state University. 

**Cons**:

* Program not as high ranked (although still above average)

* Thesis-based, need to find advisor and conduct research (I do not enjoy academia)

* 2 years

* Research may not be relevant to industry

* Job not guaranteed

30,Reaction turbine working principle,1461552050,"Let me start this question with a quote: 

""In the reaction turbine, the rotor blades themselves are arranged to form convergent nozzles. This type of turbine makes use of the reaction force produced as the steam accelerates through the nozzles formed by the rotor. Steam is directed onto the rotor by the fixed vanes of the stator. It leaves the stator as a jet that fills the entire circumference of the rotor. The steam then changes direction and increases its speed relative to the speed of the blades. A pressure drop occurs across both the stator and the rotor, with steam accelerating through the stator and decelerating through the rotor.""

So:
""... reaction force produced as the steam accelerates through the nozzles formed by the rotor,""
but...
""with steam decelerating through the rotor.""

What? As i understand it, increasing the velocity of the fluid requires a force to be acted on a fluid, therefore, fluid exerts an equal force and opposite force to drive the rotor.

Therefore, If the reaction turbine acts as a lawn sprinkler, shouldn't velocity in the rotor increase? But somehow, viewing the diagrams I noticed the velocity drops across the rotor blades.
If the rotors acts as a converging nozzle then yes, i understand why pressure drops, but i can't understand why velocity drops.

So I am a senior in high school and about to start college at a top 10 engineering school, and I am struggling to decide between mechanical and chemical engineering.

I then turned to mechanical engineering as I heard that it is the other big major in energy but it has a lesser focus on things like polymers and more of a focus on mechanics and building things hands on, and I have never really been a person who liked constructing cars, robots, etc. Yet MechE websites like MIT's show MechE people researching solar/wind energy and biofuels, and national labs have plenty of energy positions for mechanical engineers.

2. NFC - I've seen NFC flex antennas around (even stickers), but can they be used without an NFC transceiver (also expensive). I've ordered two and will stack them and lab test to see how well they transmit when they arrive.
3. Custom inductive coupling - Two coupled resonators would do the trick but I can't find anything detailing this. I assume there's a good reason it hasn't been explored. The distance is around 2mm max.

Does anyone know of an IC solution? Is capacitive coupling an option?",AskEngineers,gigadigital,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4g0idk/coupling_two_adjacent_physically_touching_boards/
70,Orifice Plate in a Wastewater System,1461358797,"I'm a new project engineer (7 months post-bachelors) working on a large (180 MGD) wastewater treatment plant expansion.  Among the systems I'm responsible for is a nutrient analyzer.  This system uses loops of influent and effluent to compare water qualities pre- and post-process and adjusts injection of chemical reagents accordingly.

The schematic calls for an orifice plate in each of these loops.  The loops are made of 1"" PVC.  From googling around I understand how the device works for detecting flow rate through pressure differential, but it seems to make more sense in larger diameter piping.  None of our typical process pipe vendors carry orifice plates, and since I'm new to this I'm completely stumped.  Any suggestions?

71,Need Help Find a Pump for a Methanol/Glycerol mixture.,1461356448,"Background: So I'm designing a 50 gal batch still for refining crude glycerol.  We're taking in crude that's about 1/3 glycerol, 1/3 methanol, and 1/3 water. Hopefully in the future we'll get a much better product from the supplier as they develop their process. Our end product would be an 80 wt% glycerol solution with ~&lt;0.2 wt% methanol. 

A rough PFD would be [this.](https://imgur.com/6DrQeCb)

Now my question: I'm trying to spec out a recirc pump (also being used as a drain/raffinate pump, but the whole system has some weird parameters. The glycerol would introduce viscosities of up to 90 cp, the still would introduce temperatures of 120C (i think, I'm going to run a lab sample of our 40 vol% glycerol and find out where the bottom still temp would be at 80 wt%), and the methanol would introduce extremely low flash points (11-12C). 

Is there a type of pump that anyone knows of that would handle high viscosity, high(ish) temps, and be Class I Group D Div 1? 

Also if any sees any large safety concerns that are evident in the PFD, please tell me. We've been working with pure glycerol up until now so my boss and I aren't really experienced in large scale distillation. I'd like to make this system as safe as possible, especially since our building has a lot of fuel stored in it.

75,Going back for Grad degree in Environmental. Advice for Career Goals?,1461343975,"After one year of working as a process engineer for a small consulting firm designing water/wastewater treatment systems, I will be returning to graduate school for a graduate degree. I always intended to get a graduate degree, but I wanted to get some professional experience in my field of interest before committing myself to the additional focused schooling (I was unable to secure any engineering internships during my undergraduate years). 

I like the projects that I’m working on, but I’m also hoping that obtaining a grad degree will allow me to tackle more interesting and engaging projects and tasks earlier (I’m mostly just sizing pumps, pipes and other equipment, which is a good skill to have, but I’d like to work on more process engineering tasks and be at the front end of a project at the conception stage). That being said, I’d also like to use this time at Grad school to explore other opportunities in the water/wastewater industry. 

I’m definitely leaning towards returning to consulting (perhaps for a larger, international firm), with the hope of eventually being a project manager for projects that embrace cutting edge technology (I’m all about wastewater resource recovery and smart infrastructure). I’m also interested in working for a water technology company that implements biotech principles, working on one specific technology and helping consulting firms implement this one technology in various projects, but I have little knowledge of working for such companies. Basically, I’d like to be the one who implements the new technologies into the “real world.”

I’m looking for advice on how to best utilize my time in graduate school. What courses should I take? What should I be doing outside of courses? What should I be on the lookout for? Any suggestions on career paths? I studied Enviornmental Engineering in undergrad so I had very little exposure to biotechnology (synthetic biology interests me) - is this something worth pursuing in grad school or will this just be a waste of time? The program I applied to is a 1-year course-based MS program in Civil and Environmental Engineering with a focus on Water Quality. I have the option to continue the program with a PhD if I so desire, but I’m not too interested in research. I did research in undergrad and found that if I don’t have a clear understanding of how my work fits into the bigger picture, I won’t be motivated. Also, I'd need to find a research topic that I can really get behind. I find little interest in spending four years figuring out how “Chemical X” reacts in “Environment Y.”

Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

83,Not Interested in School Anymore/Disillusioned,1461300379,"I'm a 3rd year computer engineering student at a top 10 engineering program. I've done well academically and have enjoyed a good portion of my classes. Of course, there have been the ones that I didn't really like all that much. I really enjoyed circuits, signal processing, and computer architecture. 

I haven't really enjoyed my CS classes all that much, but I like programming for my own projects (when there is a goal created by me that needs to be accomplished.)

I have a 3.7/4.0 GPA, internship experience at JPL, Tesla, and Apple. I've worked in power electronics design, embedded systems, and more general analog design. 

This quarter I can't bring myself to be interested in anything I'm studying. I'm taking a feedback control class (normally this kind of stuff is interesting to me) but it's just not doing it for me. In fact, nothing about school at the moment is appealing. I can't concentrate on my schoolwork and I have no desire to do it. I sleep through my early classes and don't bother to attend my later ones. This is the first quarter that this is happening. I've never thought that I was ""above"" the system, but now it feels like I'm learning nothing useful. This is interesting because I have industry experience, so I know what it's all being taught for.

I'm upset because I want to leave the opportunity for grad school open (with my GPA my school will just let me do grad school as an extra year, no GRE or application) but I don't know if this (lack of drive in academics) is a temporary thing or not. A lot of engineers have told me it means that it's my time to get out of school and jump into industry. 

At the same time, I'm working on proof of concept for a personal software project (not a mobile app..lol) that is looking to be very promising...so much so that I've thought about dropping a couple of my classes to work on it since I don't want to wholly drop out of school. I actually think that my partners and I can turn this into a lucrative product. However, it's my first venture and I've never taken a risk like this. So my thoughts are oscillating between concentrating on enjoying school and some activities on the side, or doing OK in school, very few activities, and going all in for my startup. I've been trying to do everything but I realize for my venture to succeed I need to put in more quality work, which naturally means more time. I understand that probability of failure is extremely high so I'm prepared for that.

All I want to do is read books that sound interesting to me, go explore new places in nature, and travel. I'm just really bored with the school routine. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? What should I do about my startup? 

I'm thinking that if I'm sick of school as a 3rd year, grad school is probably a dumb idea...but then in my head I tell myself ""it's only one more year..""

First, a little background. I'm currently a sophomore in high school taking chemistry. Our current unit is about hydrogen fuel cells, and we have been assigned a project to go along with it. One major component of the project is a research idea for a new use of hydrogen fuel cells, specifically a PEM cell. In the class there are three groups that will compete and try to win over a ""grant"" from my teachers ""corporation."" My group has two major ideas that we are researching to see if they will work: Hydrogen-powered Ionic Thrusters or Hydrogen-powered submarines that will replace nuclear-powered submarines

Here is the research I have done so far. One of the active nuclear submarines in the U.S. fleet uses a S6W reactor. This reactor produces 34,000 kW. Now if I am correct, 1 kg of Hydrogen has the potential for 34 kW. That means 1000 kg of hydrogen is required to equal the same amount of energy. The issue is being able to produce that much hydrogen while using hydroelectric power to power electrolysis. The water source would be split from the distillation system. 

My question is, is this idea simply too complex? Is it even worth attempting to develop such a system or should we go back to the Ionic Thrusters? 

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks everyone! My group and I have decided to go towards Ionic Thrusters instead of the Sub simply because of the deadline we have. Thanks for the help though!",AskEngineers,morriscode__,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4fq5vj/hydrogen_replacement/
7,Building a Robot. Need Help,1461194197,"Hello, I am a junior Mechanical Engineering student looking to build a robot. I already have some experience with designing robots, but im a bit fuzzy on the electrical side and definitely will need help with keeping things cheap. Ill start off by stating the objective.

I am interested in photography and found a really cool device made by Syrp called the genie. It basically utilizes a motor to provide precise movement to a camera. You can see more about what it does here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHpPz7zW_gw.

It looks amazing, and all for the cheap price of $699.99. I feel like i could easily make something similar for much cheaper, but im having some trouble choosing my components. I currently want to use a stepper motor connected to a pulley to pull it across a string or rope using an arduino uno for speed and/or location control. My main questions are as follow:

What are some good reliable forms of power supply that could handle a system such as this even out on the go?

What size stepper should i be looking at? I currently am considering this one: https://www.pololu.com/product/1208

How should i go about making a chassis?

Are there any good tutorial videos or articles that i should read?

I'm also considering using a bluetooth shield and writing an app for my phone to control the robot instead of creating a screen, but im not sure how much power that would eat up.

There are a number of tracking system available currently with varying features. Im particularly interested in two main categories.

Firstly, gps systems which are easily available with any,pay as you go, sim card systems. In this particular case the individual can get a device fit it into their vehicle and receive an SMS based alert. However, no service is provided. By service Im referring to a manufacture providing extra service in terms of attending the alert or potentially notifying the police.

 - How do these systems work?
 - Where is the GPS data stored?
 - Is it possible to access the GPS data by digging around in the software for the provided device?

I would imagine so because its only a product that is sold and not the service.

Here is an example device im referring to: http://www.amazon.com/Coban-Real-time-tracker-TK103A-anti-theft/dp/B00KNR2YZ4/ref=zg_bs_5811986011_4

Secondly, GPS systems where along with the device a service is also provided. Following an alert message the company may provide security service in the form of patrol vehicles or may even alert the police.

 - How do these systems work?
 - Is the GPS data stored on an external server provided by the company?
 - Is it possible to access the software for the GPS data or would that be restricted by the service provider?

Here is an example of what sort of service Im referring to: http://www.biketrac.co.uk/

50,in this monostable multivibrator does the current consumed depend on the drive current?,1461076557,"I'm trying to use it in a low power design with multiple gpio wake sources.  Not sure why in datasheet it lists only a ""max"" current draw, not a typical, and it's in the 100's of microamps.  In active operating mode it will be holding a reset line high, and will drive only a tiny current, and therefore the package itself will draw very little current?  Is that correct?

54,Calibrating instrument,1461067404,"I'm trying to calibrate an angle measurement device.

I've taken measurements at fixed intervals over the desired range and now I'm trying to figure out how to predict the Actual (K(i)) value from the Measured (L(i)) value.  The relationship is linear so I thought I'd do a linear regression on Measured and Actual to get a calibration curve.

To test this, I applied the linear regression to the Measured values to get Measured' (M(i)=a*L(i)+b).  I then subtracted Actual from Measured' to get Error E(i)=M(i)-K(i).  I believe my best choice here is minimizing the highest Error on the range.

Am I on the correct track?

Assuming that I am, here's the problem: least squares (L2 norm) linear regression does not yield the best result.  I can tinker with the coefficients a bit and get better results.  Least maximum residual (L_infinity norm) linear regression seems like it should be the ideal fit but the script I got for MATLAB (using LINPROG) yielded much worse results.  I don't know how the script was supposed to work so it might be the script and not the norm.

So: 

*Is a linear regression what I should be doing to predict the actual values from the measured values?

*How do I define best results?  I've been going with the smallest maximum error (want to minimize the maximum E).

*How can I get the best results?  Least squares linear regression is not yielding the best linear regression with that definition in mind.

56,"Complete noob here, I have a few engineering questions about a prototyping and exotic metals",1461056482,"I currently have an online business. It's small (tiny really), but it's profitable and it's mine. =P  I'm planning to open a second, completely different online business (barring any massive problems I may not have considered). This business is related to a hobby of mine that I am **extremely** passionate about -- it's a very niche industry. Anyways, there are a few laser cutting places nearby where I live (3 or 4 of them within 25 miles I think) and I need to get roughly a dozen prototype pieces laser cut out of metal. These will be my ""test"" units that I will use for a few months to ensure they work the way I hope they will. The pieces need to be cut will be no bigger than a small spoon (5 inches long, 0.025"" thick, with width that can vary from a centimeter down to 3mm at the thinnest).

- **This leads to my first question**: I need a metal material that is incredibly, *incredibly* strong and corrosion/rust resistant. It needs to be able to take daily abuse. What would be the most exotic (yet still accessible) metal for this purpose? I think the current industry leader in my hobby uses something like 301 brushed stainless steel. I want something better. Something more exotic (I'm aware this will jack up the price, I'm looking to be the best, not the cheapest). I was reading about HSLA steel, as well as titanium, Inconel and hastelloy. Would any of those be direct upgrade to 301 stainless? Also, looking eye-catching could also be a big bonus, if anyone knows of any metals that look unique and have those same strength properties. 


- **Which now leads to my second question**: How much should I expect to pay for the entire shabang? I just need a super rough estimate. I just need to know if this is going to cost me $100, $1,000 or $100,000 (obviously not 100k, heh, but again, I'm a complete noob so I have no experience with prototyping or getting anything machined/fabricated. I'm a virgin, as it were).

Any and all help is appreciated and if/when I do succeed, I will be sure to post my success to the engineering subreddit if anyone is interested in what I am making. Maybe I can get others interested in my unique hobby (I'm keeping that part quiet for now until I can get my prototypes built -- my hobby can be quite competitive when it comes to manufacturers).

I want basically a box I can plug my tool into, then that box plugs into the wall AC, and then a simple input where I can apply a voltage, and it will power the tool while that voltage is applied (so, I'd leave the tool in the 'on' position at all times).

My take from reading papers is that an ABR is a smaller alternative to a septic tank and can denitrify wastewater via recirculation.

My thinking is that the relatively short HRT and the colder temperatures means methanogenesis is inhibited to where small amounts of methane are created.

64,Simulation of heatexchanger process in matlab/simulink,1461013583,"I am trying to simulate a part of a process.

Its like this:
[Drawing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7IOavQsGdsfMzlndnBRWkgwTDg/view?usp=sharing)

All gases have the same heat capacity 34 J/mol*k

One inlet with a fixed flow of cold gas at a fixed temperature, this gets seperated into two seperate flows.
Fixed flow:
355.15k
363.65 mol/s

Flow 1 - Passes trough heatexchanger 1 and gets warmed up. 
Flow 2 - Bypasses heatexchanger 1.

The amount bypassing  heatexchanger 1 is controlled by a valve fitted at the bypass pipe. There are no valves on the heatexchanger inlet.

After heatexchanger 1 is either passed or bypassed these two gasflows joins again to form 1 flow, which then passes trough heatexchanger 2 and gets even more warmed up.

I want to build a simulator that controls the temperature output after heatexchanger 2 by controlling the valved fitted at the bypass on heatexchanger 1.

For heatexchanger 1:
Cold flow in may vary depending on how much is sent trough the bypass, but the temperature is fixed at 355.15k.
Hot flowrate in is fixed at 402.13mol/s , but hot temperature may vary a few degrees.

Heatexchanger data:
A=2095m2 
U=20W/(m2*k)

For heatexchanger 2:
Cold inlet has a fixed flow at 363.65mol/s but temperature varies depending on:(cold out from heatexchanger 1 mixed with the bypass at heatexchanger 1).
Hot flow may vary and hot gas temperature in may vary.

Heatexchanger data:
A = 269m2
U = 20W/(m2*k)


How do I proceed to do this ? Do I need any more information?
I tried to build a script for the heatexchanger calculations (temperatures out) but ive understood that these might interfere with my finished model and I had to remove them and start over.

To get the final temperature the method I used was to sum up all the energy from each of the flows out of heatexchanger 1 and then calculate the new temperature after the two flows had been combined (input on heatexchanger 2).
From there I simply added the energy accumulated to the cold gas in heatexchanger 2, and divided it on flow and heat capacity to get the gas temperature after heatexchanger 2. 

I really hope somone can help me with this as ive been stuck for a while and its been kinda hard to get the help needed.
I know a little linear systems and process controlling but not much.

Find the best design to discourage water from splashing up. 


Spray streams of water horizontally at the right time so that when the water splashes up, the water sticks to the horizontal stream of water. 


The toilet water goes down the tube as sensors detect an object coming down in order to lower peak splash levels. Once the object hits the little bit of water, then the water can come up to its original state.

2 rails SBR12-200 6.58/100mm)

However I have a lot of trouble figuring out what kind of loads I can put on these things and expect them to last ?

I can get bigger rails but the price goes up fast so I'd rather not get bigger than I need.

I think the most important characteristics are  max side load force , max downward force and max ""pull out"" force probably in that order.


-------------------
I did some calculation and if I put on them using RM1605 ballscrews with 640oz-in stepper (appears to be as big as I can get), I'll be putting 632 lbs of side load on the rails. 

I think deflection isn't much of an issue as that can be detected and compensated for by a quill dro. What I'm worried about if the wear this will cause in the bearing blocks. (probably the bearings will wear out before the rail does, could be wrong...)

87,I'm a junior engineer and I'm facing an ethical dilemma,1460952335,"Sorry for the book here, but I really need help if possible.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I have been working at my company for 10 months now after getting a BS in mechanical engineering. I develop products for the commercial construction industry, most of which are safety critical, load bearing, and human life affecting.

I've already seen some pretty shady things going on at my company and I've done my best to mitigate them. It's pretty evident I work for a sales company, and not an engineering company.

I could talk forever on everything leading up to this, but here is the gist:

Two months ago we purchased product X (6061-T6 load bearing vertical compression member) from an outside vendor in China to sell as our own product. We have had different suppliers in the past for different sizes. Using a sample size of one (out of ~5000 pieces), we determined the safe working load. This also happened to be based off of the ultimate load of X, as the welds at one end failed catastrophically. Upon further inspection, the weld looks like swiss cheese and with zero penetration. JB Weld essentially.

Weld like this should never fail before the member heavily deforms or buckles, and clearly they were not even done to specification. Unfortunately, the decision to purchase $3M of this had already been made, and the supplier had not been checked out, nor samples tested beforehand.

Days after the testing it seemed nobody was concerned about the welds except for me and my colleague who did the testing. Statistically there was no was of knowing when the welds would fail, if they all had bad welds, or anything else.

I went to my boss and asked about the welds and what our next steps were and he didn't seem to care. I did some analysis of my own and came to him once again, only to be blown off once more.

Also, the testing had been done with product X and Y attached to it, which gave a slightly bigger moment arm, but not by much. This is the real world application. Our applications engineers up to that point had been assuming product X+Y behaves like product X on its own (we did testing on that months before and made SWLs based once again on a small sample size).

For a couple weeks the lead engineer nor director on the project had updated our app engineers about the new (lower) SWLs of X+Y from just X. No one seemed alarmed when I told my boss about it, so I took it on myself to let them know and make sure things got communicated properly. A couple job sites had to be reworked in the process, but in the end things got fixed.

The welds still go unmentioned.

Fast forward to this past week and we have a failure of a weld on a job site. The member was apparently not under much load either. I talked with my coworker and we both went out in the lab and took extra samples to see how easy the welds could pry off. Product X is roughly 11' long, and one person at 10' away could quite easily apply enough moment to pop the welds. It was like cracking the lid off of a tennis ball can.

We tested several and even got a scale out to get an estimate of the force. At this point it is evident that likely all the welds are bad. To clarify, the welds are the sole connection from the vertical member to the end plate where addition products (like Y) are connected.

We got video and photos and even had my boss witness one of the tests. He seemed shocked but immediately was making excuses for how this probably isn't an issue (without looking into it further). He tells me to email the regional engineering manager, application engineering manager for the job site the failure was at, and the VP of engineering. I also knew the application engineering manager for this product on that specific job site so I included her too. The email had a link to the photos and videos.

Fast forward a few hours and I get called into my bosses office where he immediately accuses me of leaking information, specifically to the applications engineer (would have been notified by her boss who sat right next to her - the app engineering manager) who then went and told our customer on the job site, and that their CEO called our CEO and now there's a serious issue.

I first told him I thought it was well within meaning to add her to the email, and that her going to the customer was an unforeseen outcome out of my control. He then goes on to say I'm too young to understand, but I need to learn when to just let things go and not try to be the hero. He says he is smarter than me, and says one day I'll learn that the business comes first.

At this point I'm about to quit right then and there. He lost all respect I had left for him, and clearly he isn't the ethical engineer I thought he was. He says that, ""any reasonable person after the welds failed in testing would have not worried about it and thought it probably wasn't an issue."" I said, ""then call me an unreasonable person because there was no way you could know for sure."" I told him that he completely blew me off the first time and that we are not treating the situation with the diligence it deserve as people's lives are on the line. He admits he ""maybe wasn't as involved as he should have been.""

My boss then goes on to describe how he thinks a load bearing member with a single welded connection isn't a safety risk if it fails. ""If it fails, the board on top will just rest on it and the load will transfer correctly."" Except for the fast that life isn't perfect, and construction sites are volatile and imperfect. Product X bends and if the weld broke there is ZERO guarantee that things will line up. To me it sounds like he's just making up excuses so his arrogant self can be correct. In testing when the weld broke, product X fell over if that clears things up.

I go on to mention that these welds would never pass any standard here in the US (where we are selling them). I also mentioned that welded joints in compression assume that the weld takes all the load, and you can't rely on it to fail but still perfectly sit still. He agreed but didn't care.

I told him even statistically we have no reason to believe things are going to behave like how he thinks. Eventually I get him to agree to let me do more testing on the welds and have more samples shipped in. He was being an ass hole the entire time and seemed to be making the money decision versus making sure people were safe.

I should mention that product X+Y is not connected at either end in the full setup, and relies on friction to keep them in place. Usually many are used to distribute the load. Product X+Y fails around 30 kip to give some perspective.

I call the application engineer and she says she never said anything to the customer at all. In fact, the only interaction she can even have with the customer is through their structural engineer. It turns out the real culprit is the original person who *purchased* product X from China. He apparently found out about the welds and freaked out and started this mess before we had all the information.

So at this point my reputation is tainted because I am concerned about the safety of product X, and because I am accused of an event that never took place. If the customer had never been involved, I *guarantee* that it would not have been a problem to notify the engineer directly. We have no real chain of command around here or any written and formalized operational security procedures, so I was going off of what I thought was right.

Later in the day we find out the job site failure is actually of some 13' version of product X, from another supplier we go to, but their welds were just as bad. So now the problem could be even more wide spread, but we now know the failure wasn't specifically the 11' version we tested that morning.

I talk to the app engineer again and she says the purchaser apologized for blowing up on her, but (as he's been known to do) immediately puts all the blame on me for giving him information (which I didn't do) without knowing the full story (whatever that means). I'm accused of ""going rogue"" and not doing what's best for the business. These are the same people who thanked me earlier for getting them the updated SWLs. The app engineer is on my side though, and says this guy always does this and she hates working with him.

The next day I put in a request for more samples and get denied by the VP of engineering, saying we are done testing this product, and that is that. My boss is rude to me all day and refuses to talk to me or answer emails. When I did get ahold of him about an unrelated project, and was the most condescending prick he's ever been. He's a child.

So basically at this point we are about to let this issue slide without further investigation, my boss is against me, and I'm not being called a rogue engineer.

This week has been the most stressful yet, and I've lost a lot more faith in this company. I don't care what money is on the line, a human life is never worth that. We do things so ass-backwards here, so the least I can do is make sure people won't die. The attitude and ethic coming from my boss and other employees here is downright terrifying.

Does anyone have any advice? It seems like I'm sort of becoming the scape goat. But at the same time, these people genuinely don't see this as an issue, and the decision makers in this scenario have no actual idea what's going on or the potential for disaster.

Thanks everyone!

89,Slipstream drafting for spacecraft?,1460946678,"NASCAR drivers use a technique called ""drafting"" where several cars will line up behind a leader and piggyback off the slipstream from the one in front so that the air resistance for each following vehicle is decreased. If they follow close enough, the following vehicles can decrease the low-pressure area behind the leading craft, which reduces drag. Overall, the effect is to decrease the energy necessary to get the entire pack/train to a given point. This works for straightaways, but on tight corners is detrimental because the air that comes off the lead vehicle is ""dirty"" (turbulent). [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_%28aerodynamics%29)

I feel like the same principle should be applicable to launching spacecraft. Now, intuitively, this would be useless or suboptimal for a single mission, because the overall air resistance for a given mass should be greater (I think) when split into multiple payloads as compared to a single rocket, given that there will be turbulent interactions which would not be present for a single entity. However, space missions have launch windows. Say the planets happen to be aligned in a nice configuration for a series of gravity assists/powered flybys, and you have a set of missions that would all benefit from being able to slingshot with this config. Those sorts of incidents only come around every X number of years, and it makes sense to maximize them while you have the chance. So if you have a bunch of craft going to a bunch of different places, this would be a good idea to minimize fuel costs, right? Am I missing any key variables that would make this a bad idea?

EDIT: Semi-related question, on the subject of cheapening space flight - would it be feasible to use atmospheric exit and re-entry heat to either catalyze a reaction that provides excess thrust for additional attitude control, or maybe use [thermoelectric generators](https://www.alphabetenergy.com/how-thermoelectrics-work/) to at least charge some big batteries which could be used for instrumentation or the next launch? Generators of this type require a significant temperature differential to create any useful voltage, but atmospheric re-entry seems like it would be an adequate source of said temperature differential.The Law of Conservation of Energy leads me to believe that this might have the additional benefit of reducing the overall thermic load on the craft; if nothing else, though, it would be an additional power source. Since we have all that nice re-entry heat it seems like a shame to let it go to waste.",AskEngineers,pyroshinobi,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4f9s4k/slipstream_drafting_for_spacecraft/
90,"How can the Tesla's ultrasonic sensors enable safe, automatic lane changes?",1460942313,"&gt;The Model D hardware package comes, says Tesla, with “a forward radar, 12 long-range ultrasonic sensors positioned to sense 16 feet around the car in every direction at all speeds, and a forward-looking camera.” Sorry. For a safe lane change, we must look sideways (any car there?) and behind (any car coming down the lane at high speed?) Even an aspiring geek knows: Radar and camera look forward, they are blind in other directions. Those puny ultrasonic sensors (think 1978 vintage Polaroid SX-70, if you were already alive) are barely enough to be helpful in a parking lot. If an automatic lane-changer relies on ultrasonics that develop range anxiety after 4 meters, it will turn into a serial killer of cars in the other lane.

His argument seems pretty convincing ... how can 16 feet range sensors be sufficient? What if the speed differential is too great when the driver of a Telsa is initiating a lane change? Wouldn't that just be an accident waiting to happen? 

http://dailykanban.com/2014/12/teslas-game-changing-lane-changing-autopilot-currently-no-radar-market-can-achieve-toyota-engineer-says/

Let's say we have a Tesla in the right-hand lane and a regular car in the left hand lane. The Tesla driver initiates a lane change. The speed differential between the two cars is 20 mph while the LH car is 20 feet behind the Tesla. 20 mph is about 30 feet per second. The Tesla doesn't see the LH car because it's out of range. But in 5 feet / (30 ft/s) time, there's about to be an unholy matrimony of cars. That's 0.166 seconds. Human reaction time toward a visual stimulus is 0.25 seconds. 0.166 &lt; 0.25. That's not counting the time needed to slow down the car either. 0.166 seconds can kill someone. How can the Tesla's lane changing function work if its range is so limited?

Glasgow seems to be the most well rounded, ranking #4 in EE in the entire UK. 

Edinburgh is a bit further down and has lower student satisfaction rates, but is also consistently higher on overall university scoring sites and has a bigger rep.

Strathclyde is #5 right after Glasgow, and people say it's the more focused of the two. Don't really know much about it other than the fact that they have a pretty diverse selection of subjects and the nicest website UI.

HW is a bit of an odd one. It creeps up high in specific rankings, especially department spending, and is in the top 10 for a couple subjects.

4,Snow loading - abutting shallow pitch roofs - drifted cases?,1460907222,"Afternoon guys, hope everyone is having a nice Sunday.

I've got a little problem and this is usually one of the first place in my spare time that I turn to when I'm after some good advice - I'm looking at a new build where the new building is built next to an existing structure. (see image). I've been getting a little wound up about the snow loading on this new build that the company is designing because the boss, who was meant to be looking over a fellow graduates calculations, breezed over the calcs of this guy and neither of us are convinced he actually looked properly at the values or method. - and now the boss is on holiday (again)... so I've stepped in to try and help the graduate go back over it to make sure that the boss hasn't dropped this graduate in shit creek (the poor guy is getting hopelessly wound up in it)... until mind until the boss comes back and we can get him to look over them again properly. 

http://i.imgur.com/WBABS2F.png

The slope on the new structure is shallow (about 2 degrees). I don't have much details for the existing building, but as it's an industrial unit I'm inclined to think its going to be in the region of 4-12 degrees as this is pretty standard. 
edit:: The build is in the UK, with ground level snow load stated at about 0.6kn/m2 in the Eurocode, so it's not alot compared to other places.  

..My question is with regard to the snow loading and in particular the drift condition..... - If the slopes are relatively shallow is there a likelihood that snow from the higher roof could slide or be blown etc onto the new lower roof. Or is there going to be much impact if the snow is blown up the lower roof and gets caught on the shallow ledge - or somewhere in the middle?

My gut says because the roofs are relatively shallow there isn't going to be a sliding scenario, and if there is the snow moved onto the lower roof isn't going to be a lot - and from looking in the Eurocode it seems to suggest this also, but I'd like some advice from my fellow redditors if anyone has any to give :).

Any other advice that I may find useful on stuff I may not have considered would be appreciate as always

11,How can I build a small battery powered heater to bring small amounts of water to relatively low temperatures?,1460868472,"I'm thinking of building a small, self-contained, battery-powered, submersible heating unit designed to bring small amounts of water to relatively low temperatures.

I'm a little confused as to where to start.  but here is my thinking so far:

* Li-ion battery  
* micro heating unit.  
* temp sensor
* vacuum sealed
* inductive charging

I'm thinking that if the unit is made with negative buoyancy than the heat loss will be hopefully minimal as the unit would be submersed. (i'm hoping that means nowhere for the heat to go but to the medium itself)  

The goal is to have enough energy to get a 40 degree C change in about 300 grams of water (about 10 oz)

I worry about 3 big things here.

1. fluid circulation
    * A stagnant fluid would take longer to heat, heat less evenly, and be prone to hot spots. However, I am not sure if I'll have left over KWh to drive a mechanism designed to circulate the fluid.
2. battery capacity
    * water takes a lot of power to heat.  I don't know if there are cells that are high enough capacity without being themselves to large
3. Size
    * I want this small enough to hold in one hand.

My first calculations, by which I mean Wolfram's first calculations, show that I would need about 53 kJ with no energy loss (source: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Heat+300+grams+of+water+from+10%C2%B0C+to+50%C2%B0C) to effect a 40 degree change in 10 degree water.

13,Tempered Glass Spontaneous Failure,1460857507,"Hi everyone, 

I'm an engineering student and I know a bit about failure analysis, but I specialize in polymers and not ceramics. Today, my roommate and I left our apartment in the morning and came home at around 6 pm to find that our apartment's sliding (tempered glass) door  had shattered. We took pictures of the door as soon as we noticed it and I have [uploaded these pictures](http://imgur.com/a/mqMJ9) (sorry for the poor quality). 

Today happened to be colder in the morning (low 40's F) and hotter in the afternoon (73 F with direct sunlight). Only the inside pane fractured, and the outer pane doesn't have any visible damage. Also, this window faces due north, meaning that the afternoon sunlight shines on the right side of our door while the left side is in the shade (the left-side of the door is shaded by brick due to the building architecture). 

In my opinion, I think our door fractured due to thermal loads based on the fracture pattern of the glass. Specifically, there's no particular crack origin that I can see except for two in the bottom right corner of the door. I've been doing a little internet research and I've found that other people have had similar problems ([Dale McKibben's quote here](http://chicagowindowexpert.com/2009/06/20/diagnosing-glass-breakage/)) . I also looked up fracture patterns of tempered glass [\(pages 39 &amp; 40 here\)](http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/pvrw2010_barry.pdf) and found images similar to what we found.

The reason I'm asking for help is because our landlord wants us to pay $300 to replace the window. To be honest, I would suck it up and pay if the crew who came to take the shattered pane away hadn't told us that ""[he'd] been doing this for 12 years and knows that it is scientifically impossible for the inside pane of the door to shatter unless [we] had broken it"". 

If anyone could offer advice, that would be immensely appreciated. Thank you.",AskEngineers,rula94,/r/AskEngineers/comments/4f4pzx/tempered_glass_spontaneous_failure/

It's an Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1500. I know it has a permanent battery that they say to never remove, and when it gets low you have to put in a backup battery.. Could this permanent battery have also gotten drained? But if this were the case, would it be a cause for the PLC to not even power on? There are also three fuses installed to the right of the PLC that I need to check. So if the fuses aren't the issue, any ideas to what could be causing this problem?

16,2 separately spinning entities on varying planes. How does one affect the other? Paint artwork picture provided.,1460850551,"Hello all,
Any help analyzing this situation would be much appreciated. A couple schematics from paint (banana for scale) are provided. Problem Details:

- (Black) spinning arm at 2000 RPM (clockwise)
- (Red) spinning cup at 2000 RPM (counter clockwise)
- Angle of spinning red cup can be adjusted from 0 degrees to 90 degrees

Q: How does the spinning red circular cup effect the rotation, if any, of the entire rotating black spinning arm?
Q: Since the red portion is circular will the centrifugal/centripetal forces be assumed to cancel each other out (i.e. leaving only the rotating black top to be considered)?

By background, I mean a degree or some form of post-highschool education. By successful maker hobbyist, I mean having the capability of designing/understanding systems as complex as propulsion systems.

I've always loved to tinker (hell i designed a semi-functioning piano out of a cereal box and some glass milk bottles in grade 2 when everyone else was making kleenex box guitars), but when it came to choosing my career path after highschool, the engineering route scared the shit out of me because I barely scraped by in algebra (trig was a breeze, everything else was a bust, and didnt even take calculus), despite having high 90s in physics and chem. Basically I never had an issue understanding concepts that were applicable to the real world.

EDIT: I should mention, I'm not asking whether it's possible to design a propulsion system with nothing more than a highschool background. But rather would an average joe who has a basic understanding/interest in physics and such, be able to pick up a text book, read some articles, learn some formulas, and be able to tackle complex projects on their own?

45,Knowingly making bad parts,1460754658,"I work as an engineer in a department where we make 2 types of parts for a customer. Part A is included in their current product, and Part B is part of their next generation of product. Since we started producing part B, our customer has been complaining about only 1 out of 3 parts being good. When I took a look at the process (I lead a very similar process, but that one wasn't mine.), I noticed that one of the setting was wrong. Let's say it was a 6 when it should be a 5. Customer has been told from the start that the setting was 5. The setting has a direct scientific link to the bad yield (a higher setting increases Y, and a high Y leads to failure), and I tested a modified process with the fixed setting and the yield dramatically improved.

I presented that to the lead engineer in charge of that customer and to middle management. The response was that they do believe that is a problem, but that we can't ever tell the customer about it. Because Part A is made with a very similar process with the same mistake in it, but Part A isn't sensitive to Y, so the problem was never noticed. Telling the customer the problem would be admitting we have been screwing up for the past 6 years.

That response makes me very unhappy. But it was decided to propose a development contract to our customer, where we'd try a few things. Except the actual solution, because we can't mention that to the customer. In the mean time, we are to keep producing more and more parts B for the customer, because they are desperate for more and 1/3 is better than 0. And they've asked me to make those extra parts, with the wrong settings.

I can't go to the customer with my results, because their relationship with middle management is rock solid. Can't go to upper management for the same reason. I'm also a young engineer, so they wouldn't listen to me. And both would obviously get me fired too.

_____________________
IV: Angle (Pipe bend)

DV: See below...

Controls: Pipe diameter, Pipe flow rate (will I be able to control this?), Velocity of water, Relative height, Type of flow (turbulent), Shape of outlet pipe.

**RQ1. How does the angle of a pipe bend affect pressure in a pipe?**

In a pipe bend the water is affected by centripetal forces, and therefore is subject to cavitation. I would like to investigate the pressure differential. 
Basically a consideration of the minor losses -&gt; any feedback on this would be greatly appreciated

Q: I am considering 3D printing the pipes to get more flexibility over the angle of bend. However, will I still be able to use the Moody diagram to determine the friction factor?

* Is there anything I can do in my free time now to make myself a better candidate when I graduate?
* Will going to school in an area that has almost no jobs in the field be a hindrance? Also, should I consider finishing my undergrad in a better area for recruitment?
* My program also earns me a ME technician diploma at the end of second year, could I get an internship with that next summer?

93,Structural calculations or just over-engineer it?,1460635303,"I'm going to retire soon and am planning a 4x4 'Camper on a Lorry' like [this](http://www.zen202900.zen.co.uk/CamperMk2/shell.jpg) with a subframe like [this](http://www.zen202900.zen.co.uk/CamperMk2/subframe.jpg).  The subframe is fixed at three points to the vehicle chassis, two fixed near the rear axle and a [pivot](http://www.zen202900.zen.co.uk/CamperMk2/chassis%201.jpg) at the front.  This enables the chassis to twist without putting stresses on the body.  The camper body is expected to weigh about 2000kg.  I'm imagining the subframe will be made of 100x50x3 steel channel and the pivot from 6mm sheet.   Am I in the right ballpark?

97,Heat Exchanger Tube Leak,1460620726,"Hi /r/!

Please find the attached (http://imgur.com/WrE2Q6u) for my simple drawing of my shell and tube heat exchanger. (Relevant information is shown in the attachment).

Right,

Recently our exchanger (HX) tubes are leaking, and we have recently purchased some tubes for retubing of the HX; the fabrication work would take some 4-6 months and not all of the tubes will be retubed. 

The tubes which would be retubed shall consists of tubes that has more than 30% wall loss.

In order to preserve the other tubes which has negligible wall loss, we have drained all the waters inside the shell and tubes and isolated it from the system. 

As all of the valves are butterfly and pipe inlets and outlets can't be spaded, there's a probability that oxygen and a little bit of water could seep through.

We decided that to preserve the tubes, we should do dry storage in which dry instrument air shall be purged into the tubes, but the problem is that our instrument air header is usually at 6-8 bars.

If we decided that we purge the tubes with instrument air at 6-8 bars, could the tubes inside the HX withstand it? (We can't do continuous instrument air purging).

The HX does not have a pressure gauge installed and there's no possibility of installing it. (The HX was made in 1981 btw).

98,No variation in capacitance with body load in comsol,1460616528,"Hi,
I am trying to find variation in capacitance between two plates with applied body load. I defined an air box around the plates. Now I'm trying with electromechanics physics for applying body load and finding capacitance. I defined the two plates as linear elastic material. Applied body load to the moving plate. I applied 1V to moving plate and fixed plate is grounded. I also gave parametric sweep for body load. But capacitance is not varying with body load.
What changes should I make to get a varying capacitance? Please Help.
Thank You,
