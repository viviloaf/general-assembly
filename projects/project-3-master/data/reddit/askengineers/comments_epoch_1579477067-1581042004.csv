0,Would like some more info on how a company hires employees through other employees.,1581039513,"Hello everyone. I‚Äôm in my final year at my university studying mechanical engineering. It‚Äôs been 6 years. A journey to say the least. I don‚Äôt have much knowledge of the corporate world and need some info.


Anyway here are my ‚Äúemployable stats‚Äù-

-I have decent experience with popular programs (CAD/MATLab etc...)

-worked on a few projects utilizing a lot of programs and research

-senior design project

-hard skills-3-D printing/milling

-Working on the FE exam at the moment 

 I have no internship experience üò´ and my GPA is 2.7



I have a cousin who‚Äôs also a friend of mine that works for a BIG defense/space contractor, you can probably guess haha. Anyway he‚Äôs been working there for 3 years, he‚Äôs actually in really good standing with the company (based on the awards/projects I seen).

He told me a year ago he can get me a job with his company when I graduate but I should aim for above a 3.0 GPA. Life happens and currently I‚Äôm at 2.7 GPA not the best I know.


My question is how the process works when you‚Äôre referred by a current employee. Will they not put a lot of emphasis on my GPA? Will I just be guaranteed an interview at the least? How likely will I even get the job? 

Basically how far can an employee go to get a friend/family member etc... hired. How does this work? I‚Äôd like to hear some stories or some advice on this. I‚Äôd appreciate it!",AskEngineers,False,-levivel-,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f0329v/would_like_some_more_info_on_how_a_company_hires/
1,Should university students list their citizenship on their resumes?,1581038836,"Apologies for the resume question, I know the rules say that ""Asking for feedback on your r√©sum√©, CV, or cover letter"" is not allowed. But I'm seeing so many conflicting opinions on this topic that I have to ask.

I'm a Canadian citizen with a foreign name, in a Canadian university. I'm fluent in English, I was born here, and don't have an accent. My first name is an uncommon south asian name. I'm in the process of applying for summer internships. I'm in mechanical engineering if that changes anything. Right now I have the words ""Canadian Citizen"" at the top of my resume, along with my contact info. 

I've heard that employers, especially in the government, prefer hiring citizens. I don't want a hiring manager to see my name and assume I need them to sponsor me or something. I've ALSO heard that it opens them up to a discrimination lawsuit(?) and that they'll throw your resume out immediately if they see it. [This guy in /r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bgxgu6/im_22_i_havent_applied_to_more_than_20_companies/) says US citizens with asian names should state it. I've also heard that you should do it one way in the US, but another way in Canada... I don't know what's correct.

13,Mechanical Engineering Burnout after 2 years,1581020033,"Hi,  I graduated from college with my bachelors of science in Mechanical Engineering and right away worked for the company my Dad worked for. It was around 300 people and the engineering dept. was probably around 30. I really liked my coworkers but that didn't matter because I came in and stood (standing desk) at my desk by myself for 8 hours a day, looking over CAD building layouts, and trying to finish jobs in the allotted time to not be constantly questioned ""what took so long?"" After 10 months, I literally felt like trash and had a headache every day and drug my feet to and from work every day. Some days I would walk over to the window and stare outside and feel so depressed. I was jealous of basically any other job because being in my office all day made me feel like CRAP. 

I quit and found a job with a really small company locally in an industry that is more interesting to me, I am the only other engineer under my boss who owns the company. Every once in a while, I get involved in a really really cool project and get to work on many different parts of it. My boss is super unorganized though and many many days, I find myself staring at my computer screen/twiddling my thumbs. I've recently been feeling more and more depressed and it's really hard to stay motivated when I feel like I am not working for the greater good in any way. I feel like I have gotten as far as I can with this job and its only been a year. My boss doesn't have much interest in personal relationships or in his employees having healthy personal lives. And raises/PTO is basically nonexistent.

 I want to look back on my life and be proud of a life well lived and that is not the direction that I feel like I am heading. I feel like a cold part of a societal machine and I have felt such a strong draw to do something completely different like start a business building tiny houses. I would love that but I am still in a ton of debt and feel VERY imprisoned to my career. I am a very outdoorsy person but also very mechanical and interested in that sort of thing which is what brought me to engineering with the promise of a ""rewarding career and eternal happiness""

Anyways, anyone else go through something like this? I feel like I am being driven to insanity and my mind is losing its sharpness and ability to problem solve the longer I sit in a hell hole of an office and stare at an LCD screen.

Firepower vs Airpower¬†(self.AskEngineers)

submitted¬†just now¬†by¬†Sparkmane

This post is not about a bomb but it IS about a bullet, full disclosure. Technically it's about a¬†cartridge.

I'm trying to figure out a formula to convert a known energy release from a cartridge to an unknown energy release from bursting a container of gas. The goal of the formula(s) is to determine the mass and pressure of gas needed for the same potential energy as the powder in a cartridge.

The literal goal here is to figure out how big a .44 magnum cartridge that provides 450 joules of energy would be if it was full of compressed air instead of explosive powder.

There seems to be a push for improving old processes to streamline and catch mistakes because the last few years there have been a lot of mistakes. Unfortunately, with lack of overall experience and mentorship, it seems like every little task to improve is met with a great deal of time spent trying to scrape up the correct solution online (and no one is there to check to see if it's even the standard way of doing it for the industry). I am just wondering if I should tell management that unless I can receive some official training on, let's say, AutoCAD electrical, then the best I can do is keep up the standard of how things have always been done.

30,Not sure what to do with my life. Upcoming Mech E grad,1581003043,"So, long story short I am about to graduate with a mechanical engineering degree from a solid school (ranked 30-40 on us news). My graduating GPA will be around 3.1. I have done two 6-month co-ops and an internship. My last co-op, I worked mostly designing and prototyping, got proficient in SolidWorks and have my CSWP. I also worked in the aerospace industry and the medical device industry on my other co-op and internship. I do not have a lot of machining/hands-on experience and did not participate in any engineering clubs. I do believe I have a strong knack for learning new tools and skills, but did not apply myself to the best of my ability throughout college.

I have been quite stressed lately thinking about my future, been getting very poor sleep. Looking for mechanical engineering jobs, I feel quite under qualified for most of them. I know it's a bad habit, but I have been comparing myself to others from my school (probably competing for the same jobs) just perusing LinkedIn, and I feel a lot of people have done more than me. I am not super anti-social (through a bit depressed) and can do okay in interviews, but I do not have much experience with them. 

I am looking for advice on my future.  I feel I have a knack for programming and could become quite skilled at it (both my father and brother work as software engineers), especially if I was getting paid to learn it. I have not done much beyond basic C++, MATLAB, and Arduino in course work, and some basic VBA on co-op. I feel like any job looking for programming workers related to mechanical engineering expect a lot more experience than this. I am also somewhat interested in pursuing a  masters with a focus in mechatronics, although I have a weak GPA so I am not sure if that's an option. I wish mechanical engineers had more exposure to software in course work and I regret not pursuing a minor in electrical or computer engineering. 

Sorry if this is a rambling/incoherent post. I just do not want to be stuck doing something I don't enjoy. The jobs that interest me I feel under qualified for, while many of the jobs, like manufacturing/process engineers do not seem interesting to me. I want to gain valuable, life-long skills immediately upon beginning work, and I feel I have the mental capacity to really apply myself if I am doing something that interests me. 

I am also thinking about studying for the FE exam upon graduation as I am searching for work.

The table is rectangular, 45"" x 28"", and has a max load of 150 lb including the platform. The motor will be connected to the central pivot point and supported by caster wheels at the edges.

The decision to drive the table from the center instead of the edge might have been where i went wrong. I do have the opportunity to gear down the motor by 1:2 with a chain and sprocket. even with that in the calculation, it is suggesting the forces are beyond what they offer on the site (1000 ft-lb).

For our prototype, I was tempted to pick up a wheelchair motor from ebay. The sizing of this type of motor seems perfect. [https://www.electrocraft.com/products/gearmotors/MPP36/](https://www.electrocraft.com/products/gearmotors/MPP36/)

physically work on the projects I do, being a Frontline troubleshooter. However, I recognize that the trade life is hard, and the logical part of my mind (and my parents, my dad and Grandpa are engineers) are pushing me more to do the traditional 4yr college to engineering job route.

I have good grades, got SAT scores and could likely get into most of the colleges I want to go to. As of right now Texas A&amp;M is my first choice. However, my school district recently opened up a new technical education center that I am considering applying for.  

I recognize the engineer path has more stability, better pay, and likely a better work environment. My question is, do any of you engineers wish you were more trade oriented?

81,How to determine K-Factors of PID pressure control,1580926391," 

Hello, everybody,

at work we have a leakage test rig.

The test stand is filled with 200 bar air.

Let's say I want to test a part at 5 bar inlet pressure, then an inlet pressure of 5 bar is first regulated via an outlet valve and passed through a mass flow sensor.

And then the pressure is controlled by a second valve so that 5 bar inlet pressure is always maintained within a defined tolerance. As soon as a stationary state is reached, a measured value is written into an Excel spreadsheet after a defined time.

Now the values for Kp, Ki, Kd were simply determined by trial and error. Kp is about 5, Ki about 0.03 and Kd always = 0, because nobody knows how to determine it.

In most cases the whole thing works. Sometimes the measurement oscillates, then you adjust the values live. Sometimes it oscillates relatively far over, then you decrease the Kp value and so on.

But I would be interested in how to determine the optimal values. Because if the test bench adjusts faster, then you save a lot of time with several million measuring points per year.

Since two pressures are adjusted, I thought at first that it would probably not be so trivial. On the other hand, you can probably also consider both controllers independently of each other at first?

Does anyone have an idea how I could determine the control parameters in the easiest practical way?

Thank you in Advance",AskEngineers,False,sawsalitos,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ezdpdh/how_to_determine_kfactors_of_pid_pressure_control/

90,"I work in the space sector after my BsC in CS but want to continue studying Astrophysics or Aerospace Engineering, any experiences about this?",1580913395,"21, not US. Last July I finished my Bachelor's in Computer Science. My dream is to participate in space research and exploration. I expected I would have to go through a lot of experience in companies doing web development and stuff like that and get a masters before getting my foot in the industry but I'm happy to say that I am working in a public research institute that collaborates with some international and ESA missions, great stuff, I love it here.

The thing is, despite the fact that I love Comptuer Science and I love what I do here, I can't but feel that I want to study more, something more specific regarding space. Whenever I hear about the ""results"" of the projects I work in or read the presentations of my colleagues about their papers on black holes, neutron stars, exoplanets, etc, etc I just wish I had studied physics as well so that I could understand all that, and not only understand it but participate in that part as well, not just in the computer science below it.

This isn't part of the topic but I really want to leave my country and study somewhere else, so I have already considered some unis and done a lot of paperwork to study a masters in the future, but when looking at it I'm assuming it will be an MsC in Computer Science, and I constantly wonder, should I try to get into a graduate program that's more ""space"" oriented, like astrophysics or aerospace engineering (quite different these two I know).

This is why I come here seeking advice, or experiences, I would say, about people that have taken similar paths and what do they think about it. From what I have read around the internet and heard from colleagues, I think I have a general picture of how the reality is, but again, I can't feel but thinking that I wan't to know more, if not for my career, just out of curiosity.

That is why one of the things I've been considering is studying this on my own, the problem is that obviously that's easier said than done but what worries me the most is that unlike CS, a field in which you could therotically walk up to a company without a degree and proof them that you know what you're doing (and I've met lots of people like this), I don't think anyone would consider me without a degree/PhD in Physics.

I guess if you have papers and research to back you up it can help but doing that on your own...sounds quite difficult. I should also mention that I have co-authored of a paper I wrote with my Bachelor's thesis supervisor about the results of the thesis, in the field of space reseach, although I am very proud of this it was a very ""special/specific"" case. What I mean by this is that if I continue the way I am now (CS guy), I won't probably write any more papers; my work is not research oriented, I am involved in developing the tools so that the physicists at my institution can perform their research.

Furthermore, if I were to try to get accepted into a non-CS graduate program I guess I would have trouble getting in, I don't know to which extend would I be able to deal with this problem by studying the ""fundamentals"" on my own, but I hope this is the case.

As I have mentioned one of the two majors that I am interested in is Aerospace Engineering, while I think I would love to study this I'm afraid I would end up the same way, wanting to know more about how the Astrophysics work at the end, and I'm not sure about which ""combination"" (CS+Astro or CS+Aerospace) would open more doors to participate in big space research and exploration projects.

So, to sum it up a little bit. I want to continue studying, I am not sure if I will love the ""research"" world and to begin with, I'm not even sure about whether I prefer going for something like Astrophysics or Aerospace Engineering, I mean I'd love to do both, but time is limited :( I'm afraid. What is your opinion on this? I was basically wondering what are the experiences of people who have decided (or not) to take similar paths to what I'm considering. Do you think is it even possible for me to pursue a graduate degree in any of these two fields with just a CS background and if so which one would you recommend?

Long story short I am a millenial who's struggling to get a job that's not retail with FT hours (lol), I've been given an opportunity at a friend's company to learn to be a draughtsperson, doing Auto CAD drawings (mostly for civil engineering, from what I know), and they are willing to train me from scratch. (Reason being because they know I won't be an employee with unfavourable personality/qualities). 

I have absolutely no engineering background and this would be a completely new field for me if I wished to try and enter it.

I went to observe for a day and the existing draughtsperson at the company is a family friend and they showed me what they do as a company (it seemed to involve a lot of retaining walls), and showed me an easy example of doing a CAD drawing from scratch (pond on a slope, cross section, etc).

From what I saw it seems like learning to use the Auto CAD programme would be the first big learning hurdle that I would probably feel frustrated in because I don't know how to get it to do what I want. There seems to be a lot of features (like Photoshop) that will take some getting used to and to get your head around....

So I wanted to know about...

1) what is it like being a (civil) draughtsperson?

2) what sort of career paths are available?

3) I want to know if this is a job that will suit me/would I get bored of CAD drawing? - I know that being sedentary isn't my best suit, I think I prefer a job where it's more practical/involved being on my feet at times. However the day did go very fast watching the draughtsperson do the simple drawing and it seems like at the very least I would lose track of time once drawing on a project or something. I know this will depend large on the person so if you have seen any examples or experiences, please share!

4) what are the more techincal aspects you need to know that is involved in the job? What sort of projects do you usually receive to do drawings for?

5) typically for your company do you have ""busy seasons"" where you get so much work you have to work overtime/what's the work life balance like?

6) anything else that you wished someone had told you when you were entering the field that may have affected your decision then?

I'm hoping to get some insight into what the job is like and since if I do decide to try go into this field, I will be giving up being in the dental field (I currently work as an dental assistant and with a supervising dentist I can be put forwards for a course to be a hygienist, however I'm not too sure how much I would like being one as of yet) and struggling again for a couple of years to get a footing/adequate knowledge and skill to be able to advance further.

I am not looking to get into the details of my plans, just trying to strategize based on what I know so far.

At the moment:  
\- Graduated BS Biomedical Engineering with magna cum laude, minored in Electrical (if I specialized, I would prefer the EE exams)  
\- Extensive research experiences  
\- Experienced at software development (in various languages)  
\- Strong basic science course background in chemistry, biology, biochem  
\- I can provide additional lists of skills on request as well as specific co-op/internship experiences I've had  
Future:  
\- 1.5 years free and available to do work between now and graduate school, based on my plan,  
\- Approximately 1 year following graduate school, available to do work prior to further specific experiences  
\- Post those experiences, I should be able to have part time availability for enough time to fulfill the requirements  


My main question is what sort of positions I should be looking for on that basis.

My original plan was to use computer cooling fans. I've tried 30x30x7, 30x30x15, 40x40x28 mm fans. The latter is the most powerful and advertised as 9,200 RPM and 17 CFM. [Cooling Fan on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075V3BYR7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

He figures out everything along the way by asking other people and doing his own research, never once asking the President himself for details and logistics.

62,Small form factor on/off resistor,1580824564,"Hello.  

I am trying to find ways to limit the top speed of my electric scooter, as it is illegal to do any more than 20 km/h where I live. In the slowest mode, I have full power but top speed is limited by software. This works great and is the only mode I use, but if I am stopped and they see the scooter is capable of doing more, like by switching modes, I will lose it and receive a hefty fine. I get that the line has to be drawn somewhere, but it's frustrating for those of us who need power for hills, and never drive faster than the limit.  

My thought now is finding some way to install a small switch on the wiring, so that if I am ever stopped and checked, I can easily switch it over to reduce the voltage from the accelerator, and thus reducing the top speed enough to make it legal. It needs to be small and easily accessible, without catching attention. As in, full throttle would send the same voltage to the controller as X% throttle when closed.  

I could do it easily with a resistor in series, but then the scooter would be under powered and unable to get me home all the time.  
Right now I am looking at a small potmeter with just two terminals connected, so as a variable resistor.  
This could work, but if the potmeter resistance is not perfect, I would struggle finding the ""correct"" and ""convinceable"" adjustment in a jiffy when pulled over. Overdo it and they wonder why it doesn't work. Not enough, and it's still over the limit.  

Anyone have any experience or input to share? I would greatly appreciate it, so I can go back to using the scooter for work without worrying about the consequences.

i can write stuff to 0x40 and that changes things in 0x42 in what i assume to be unsealed and full acces mode. this affects at least the manufacturer name, with one value it shows Compal and with another it shows Sanyo when plugged into the laptop.

but doing anything else seems to kick me out of full access mode. also reading things before 0x40, which also kicks me out of unsealed mode.

i also tried the last step of the blog post, to enter boot rom mode, but then i did something and the memory changed to something strange, plugging it into the laptop would make the laptop shut down after a few seconds. So i read the comments of that blog post and in fact, writing 0x0001 to 0x17 brought me back to a ""normal"" operation mode.

so, when i'm in that boot rom mode, there would be another set of commands?

and as far as i understood from the blog post, there is more memory, and the interesting things, like the permanent failure flag i want to reset is in there? or, is it on 0x53 as the data sheet of the bq20z90 suggests? and if so, how could i change it? 

or do i need to get a dump of that eeprom, modify that dump and then reflash it?

any hints on how to do that, tools i could use on a debian based linux, or how to learn more about this stuff in general without having a phd in computer science, like, smbus for dummies? ;P

Basically I‚Äôm curious about the fluid dynamics and drop formation in something like an eye dropper or a pipette dropper where the fluid starts in a larger cross sectional area, is pushed into a smaller area and then exits through another larger area as a drop rather than a continuing stream.

Why/how do drops form in this case?  I assume it has something to do with the surface tension involved when going through a sudden pressure drop, but I‚Äôm hoping for a more quantitative reasoning.

Is there anyway to determine what the change in dimensions has to be (and how quickly it changes) in order for drops to form if you know the pressure and viscosity of the fluid?   

Or vice versa, if you know the dimensions of the system and fluid viscosity, can you determine what the pressure has to be in order for drops to form?

Is the initial large-to-small transition important (relative sizes, or how quickly the channel tapers), or is that only required to build up pressure/velocity before the fluid experiences a sudden drop in pressure?

For example, the kid talks a big game about being so deep into engineering, and knows how to do this or that - it's good that he's enthusiastic, so when he suggests things that won't work, I wanna try not to crush his spirit when I tell him so (keeping in mind that he doesn't know any engineering physics, so he most likely won't understand if I try to explain fully).",AskEngineers,False,OldHellaGnarGnar,/r/AskEngineers/comments/eyj540/advice_for_being_the_mentor_to_a_coop/

84,How do you document your work in Engineering?,1580780346,"Hi everyone,

I am a student currently and am taking a design course where the instructor mentioned the importance of documentation in engineering work. By this he meant taking notes on your thoughts, calculations, problem solving methodologies/solutions, etc. as you move through your projects.

I also am an intern at an engineering company working part-time during the school year. My documentation strategy has been something of a daily log, simply marking with single bullet points what I do each day. For example, I'll write down ""(1) Solved XX problem, (2) Emailed this person to ask YY question, (3) Began working on ZZ project.""

After hearing the instructor mention the importance of good documentation in engineering, I was wondering what ways you all have found to best document your work? Do you have a word document and write something like a journal entry each day to describe your work and thoughts? Do you use a bound notebook to keep track of your thoughts and projects? How do you organize the documentation you have (i.e. a different notebook/Word document for each project, or just a table of contents and fill up the notebook as you go). Also, how important have you found documentation in your job and career?

85,Quit My First Real Engineering Job?,1580780132,"Hello everyone, this is my first post, so please bear with me. I am thinking about quitting my first real engineering job. It is a 1-2 year contract through a staffing agency, working for a large consumer appliance company. I am about a month in and am hating my life. To get a full grasp on my situation, you must know the events that lead up to me accepting the job. 

I graduated in May 2019 with a BS in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering from a decent school. I was talking to a Navy recruiter about their officer candidate school (OCS) program. I eventually got accepted into the program and left for OCS in November to follow my childhood dream of being a fighter pilot. When I got there I quickly realized that lifestyle was not for me. I wasn't comfortable with the thought of my decisions directly affecting whether someone lives or dies. Being away from home for extended periods of time was not boding well for me either. I also have a girlfriend that I plan on proposing to in a year or two which didn't make it any easier. So inevitably, I gave up on that career path and started frantically applying to jobs. I had wasted my grace period on my student loans waiting on the Navy and needed something quick that would pay the bills.

I started getting interviews pretty quickly but I wasn't really interested in any of the jobs. I eventually got an offer from my current employer and accepted the position. It is an Instrumentation Engineering position which I don't truly care for but I needed something quick. The position is a \~1.5-hour drive away from my parent's house so I figured I could live from home and save a little money. However, I did not plan on the commute being as rough as it is. I'm driving over 3 hours a day and have less than 2 hours of free time when I get home. That's about enough time to shower, eat, and get ready for bed. The pay isn't great either ($25/hr, loan payments take half of that). The position is also in the midwest which I am desperately trying to get out of. I have lived here my whole life except for leaving for college. My girlfriend and I plan on getting a place when she graduates this coming May, in Boston. I also hoped I would get a position related to my major because that is what I'm truly passionate about. 

I'm worried that quitting this job early could potentially cause serious damage to my reputation. The employment is ""at-will"" so there would be no legal ramifications of quitting. I want to stop working as soon as possible because this job is taking a serious toll on my relationship and mental health. The two options I am considering most are: start applying now and quit in a month, then work odd jobs until I find something better in the location and field I want. Option 2: quit in May and move to Boston (more time to find something better but 3 more months of hating my life). Lastly, option 3: stay for a year and gain the experience and leave on a better note (one year of hell). 

Please let me know what you think about these options or if you come up with something I didn't consider. Any input is greatly appreciated. If you want to know any more about my story feel free to DM me.

90,What field should I pursue to find what I am looking for?,1580776348,"So, for reference, I am currently in my 2nd year of Automotive Engineering (would finish with a degree in Mechanical Engineering) and I am wondering if what I got into really suits me.

I always liked cars, I chose this field as a plan B because my plan A failed miserably, so I figured ""Eh, I'll make cars at least"" which was a really shitty way to think about it all but you live and you learn. Now I have no idea if this field will get me what I really enjoy doing after thinking about it for a while.

I figured out that I really like design, like, not in the way that stuff looks particularly, but in the way of ""ease of use"" so to say. The small stuff that you don't think about it that make your life easier. Think about pull-push doors with the handle on the pull side and nothing on the push side, that way it's really intuitive on what to do when you see the door. Think of ergonomics while inside a car, like all the buttons, their layout, their size and function, where everything is. Think of designing anything that it's easy to work on later on (i.e cable management). Designing a system so it's easy to operate, like a car's infotainment system (which in all due honesty suck mostly). I also enjoy game design, in the way of balance, making a game fun, knowing what makes a game fun, guiding the player without a prompt due to good level design. On top of this I also enjoy making stuff look good, to either interior design, or simple design of random items (like I have this fork which has a handle made out of a rectangular polished iron steel bar which balances the fork insanely well and it's very comfortable to eat with), or the exterior/interior of cars, trucks, etc.

Where can I find stuff like this? Am I even the right area? If so, what jobs should I look for in the future? I want to specialize as soon as I can so I know on what subjects to actually spend more time on and on what else I can slack on and do the bare minimum ( because honestly some courses suck majorly i.e dynamics I ). Plus, my country doesn't have a huge amount of interesting engineering jobs, so if I have to leave I at least want to know what other language should I learn other than English (and preferably not French because I despise French). The course that I enjoyed so far is 3D Modeling in CATIA, got the easiest max grade of my life because I just liked making parts in it. Structural Analysis seems the 2nd most fun one out of them all, so far at least, will probably hate it when I fail it, but I digress.

$3300 demagnetizer. 

Let's not talk about how one could easily make something a lot cheaper. 

I'd like to talk about the engineering aspect of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

According to the article, the product works like this: 

"" With your target item resting on the top of the platform, engaging the DeMagŒ± causes the unit to generate intense, high frequency AC magnetic fields, with individual domains that rapidly and randomly alternate and realign, with diminishing power over the programmed cycle time, effectively canceling or nearly canceling, any magnetic fields, eliminating (or *substantially* reducing) any residual magnetism in the item placed on its surface. ""

and the reason for this product is quite long, but TLDR version of it is because of the carbon colorant. The manufacturer argues that its ferromagnetic characteristics makes the vinyl magnetic, and thus affects the record player's magnetic stylus. 

The manufacturer claims that it reduces the magnetic field strength (using IHI Gauss meter) from 620nT to 572nT, which is roughly 10%. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. do you think their way of demagnetizing is more effective than a commercial tool demagnetizer? 
2. considering the natural magnetic fields around the house, do you think that 10% difference (60nT) is a meaningful change?

4,Waking up a Raspberry Pi 100m Away? Detecting Cars,1580755462,"Hi, I've been racking my brain and searching the net for a while today to try and find the best solution to my problem.

I am making a project that:
*Needs to have low power consumption due to being powered by battery bank + renewable energy.
*Will detect an approaching car
*Wake up the Raspberry Pi
*Will take a photo of an approaching car  
*Then send the photo over the internet

The RPi can be optimised to boot and take a picture in 4 seconds. So in a case of a car going ~60mph that would be ~100m distance needed for the detector to boot the Pi. That would be worst case, so 50m could be ok.

I think I have an idea for the detector, either PIR, microwave, pressure hose across the road, maybe a magnetometer. Whichever is the lowest power consumption. I am thinking the detector will need its own power supply / battery.

My problem is, how do I send a signal from the detector to wake the RPi + camera over 50/100m but also keep things low power / sleep mode. 

I could:
*Using wires, I don't think 5v will work, I could up the voltage to 12v and step it down where needed?
*Using wires, something like RS-422? Low Voltage Differential Signalling? - waking up an arduous or MCU via an interrupt? 
*Use wireless, 433Mhz? But the receiver uses constant power?  I don't think wifi would be suitable either.

Is there a better way to use wires just to send an ""on"" signal, over 100m to a relay? Maybe a latching relay? That the Pi could turn off after it turns off...

Is there a long range sensor that I'm missing?

I am currently working for an automotive company as an production engineer. I have been tasked with stabilising the production line as my job requires me to ""firefight"" the scenario since downtime would lead to OE losses etc. 

One thing which i have pinpointed to OE loss is due to the changeover time required whenever we were to change models. The changeover requires almost an complete overhaul of the jigs and fixtures for every model change and that would take up to 2 hours of downtime. Due to this, i am planning to commonize most parts as far as possible.

20,Apologies for another school or military question.,1580722968,"I am currently a 19yo second year Mechanical Engineering student. I have been struggling with my GPA (around 2.6-2.8) and finding a co-op position is tough being surrounded by achieving students, so I have considered joining the Air Force for a 4-year enlistment and then completing my degree (I already have 92.5 credits).

My thinking is this, getting engineering experience in avionics maintenance (turbines and engines and all that) and related positions will likely distinguish me from other co-op applicants and having military experience will definitely better my studying habits. I looked at examples of the ASVAB and I can confidently say that any engineering student (except environmental) would ace every aspect of it. I also learned that they will pay for a chunk of my tuition post-service, and I can potentially come out with $80k in my bank account if I save my paychecks. However, I want to know if having 4 years of Air Force on my resume will actually distinguish me from others in the civilian undergrad job market. I really want to work in Lockheed Martin someday and I know I‚Äôll never get there if I continue college.

Yes, I know this type of question has been asked a million times, but I want to know if I am making the right choice. Is working on airplanes or loading missiles into them actually transferable to mechanical engineering related civilian careers? Someone said that you should not enlist if your main goal is a civilian career, while others believe that it‚Äôs a good character builder and a place to acquire practical skills.

21,[mechanical] Is an axial annular turbo-ramjet feasible?,1580722715,"Might be no more than a thought exercise, but was thinking that in the compressor and power sections of an axial jet engine, it's the outer tips of the blades that may be doing the majority of the work. So would it be possible (in regards to the frontal profile) to eliminate the center 2/3 or so of an axial engine and still have it work? Essentially instead of the usual center shaft, replace it with relatively large diameter hollow tube that would perform the same function of mechanical energy transfer between the sections. Because if that could work, it might be interesting to fit a ram-jet inside the now hollowed out part. Essentially gaining an extra functioning mode with less of a space requirement than other designs with side-by side engines or whatever.

Of course you would need a fairly lengthy rail so that the acceleration rate doesn't turn them into jelly. And the pod would probably need to be mag-lev instead of making direct contact with the track so that friction doesn't burn out the rail, etc.

Hello, 

I am a freshman at RIT in upstate New York studying mechanical engineering. I'm almost a month into my second semester and I am starting to question whether this path is right for me. I have a couple reasons that make me unsure of if it's a good fit. 

Primarily, I choose mechanical engineering because I was good at math/science/problem solving/etc in highschool and all my teachers agreed that something in the STEM field would be a good idea for me. Like most highschool seniors, I wasn't sure what college or engineering was really about. All I knew was that I got into a decent school, and I had the aptitudes for a career that is respected, stable, and provides a good income. 

Since beginning college and going headfirst into engineering, I've discovered that although I am good at it, it's not something I love or even like doing. My first semester was fun as I was new to the college life and enjoying the social aspect, but now that the newance of it has worn of I find it's not as great as I thought initially. I dread my mechanics, design, cad, and calc classes. I get though them academically just fine but I hate going to and doing the work for them. 

As well, I am starting to think about life beyond college in the career would and honestly I am really scared. I could never, ever work a desk job and the thought of a 9-5 makes me cringe. It's just how I am, I don't do well with routine or repetitiveness. 

Just for kicks, I was considering getting into photography, creative writing, and commerical aviation when choosing a major, so that illustrates what I am also interested in. 

So my question for current engineers is this, have you ever felt a similar way to this? And what did you do about it if so? As well, if you currently work an engineering job what is it like? Do you find yourself doing different things each day? And how much of your work is computer/desk based?

37,Very unusual question: which RD might detect aerial mapping radar from an aircraft ?,1580691157,"I live in the area stretching through Kansas/Colorado/Wyoming/Nebraska  where many people have reported seeing large drones of unknown origin and purpose, sometimes in  large groups. flying a scanning pattern.

I have recently heard that they are emitting a   signal which can be picked up by a radar detector (RD), and this may help us in sleuthing out their purpose. I am asking for suggestions of what (if any) RD could pick up the widest range of possible frequencies used in mapping, at the greatest possible range.

I suspect I want something that has NO noise filter, because the freq I'm looking for may very well be different from a traffic radar. In other words, I want to pick up as much radio noise as possible, if it covers the freqs likely to be used for mapping.

So: I want highest range, no filtering of noise 


I suspect the RD I want was state of the art like 20 or 10 years ago. Great range, no need for modern bells and whistles.

 If I buy one with great range but has noise filtering, can I turn off noise filtering?

I can download an Android app if it will help me run the system, I do NOT want to share info because my data  would just screw up the database for everyone else.


 My plan is to turn the unit on and if I get no return until an aircraft appears, it's more likely a mapping drone as long as this does not pick up normal aircraft radios. I suspect that RDs do not pick up normal aircraft radio signals? Do they ever go off if you drive under the approach pattern to an airport in bad weather, for example?  IN that situation an airliner would be using a radar approach.

I need to build a sensor that is made of sticks and stones (not literally) where the sensor must have repeatable measurements and must have some kind of an output (resistance, current, voltage) anything actually i can measure in a lab, even better, something i can measure with my cheap multimeter at home (ideally but not necessarily) and the sensor cannot be pre-build, for example a thermistor for measuring temperature, or a capacitor for measuring water level (but i can build a capacitor one of my colleagues are building a capacitor for measuring water level)
Ideas that have been denied so far:
- temperature sensor that is made of a transistor, resistor and a 10k thermistor (it got denied because of the thermistor it was the first idea i did not know).
- pressure sensor that is made of two metal plates and a balloon (got denied because of the balloon that deforms with temperature and because of that it cant be used for repeatable and reliable measurements).
- a coiled copper wire  wired to the multimeter ac voltage to detect radio waves (got denied because it acts as an indicator).
- pressure sensor that is made of static foam (foam never returns to its original state so no accurate measurements from it).

I asked our maintenance crew to fill up the replacement reducer before they mounted it in place. Line needs to be ready for production on Monday morning. In the long run, we might need to redesign the drive unit, but are there any risks with running more oil than spec'ed? In my opinion, it would take more torque and consume more energy, therefore run less efficiently, but it would not pose any threat to production causing down time. So if torque readings are below rated torque values of the reducer and the servo motor, we should be good. What else should I consider?

53,What sort of aplifier do I need to power two old speakers?,1580665768,"I have two great sounding speakers from a broken stereo and want to build an aplifier to make use of them again.

To juice the amplifier I would be plugging it to the wall. Since I'm in Mexico, the power outlet is AC 127V 60Hz. Then I would connect to the amplifier by bluetooth and let the music flow. I might also add a potentiometer to manage the volume...

Here is the thing: I don't know what kind of amplifier could properly power the speakers, so here I give you the speakers' specs so I can get your advice.

So, in hopes of getting an employable degree and studying more chemistry  (albeit not as much as I‚Äôd like to) job, I applied to the science and engineering double degree program.

0,Current or former SpaceX employees: What do/did you enjoy about it?,1580586396,"tl;dr I know the rumors: crazy hours, relatively lower pay, high turnover rate, etc.  But I'm sure there are some employees who stick around longer than a year or two.  What keeps you there?  I fear I'm pigeon-holing myself as a project manager and want to be a better engineer.

Some background:

I got my Bachelors in ME back in 2015 and have been working in the public sector (aerospace &amp; defense) ever since.  My role is sort of a hodge-podge of project management, product development, and test engineering.  Development timelines are often incredibly short (weeks to months) so a lot of my job is (1) being creative with the resources I have to deliver a product I can stand behind, and (2) identifying enabling technologies and separating those out into strategic developments.  I also handle my division's relationship with one of our primary customers who is known in the community to be exceptionally demanding.  I've worked my ass off and ended up with a reputation as someone who can dig through ambiguity with the big egos to find a middle ground and get shit done on super tight timelines.  (Reputations are a little too important where I work, in my opinion).  I've been promoted 4 times in 3 years (80k --&gt; 120k), and I think I've primarily been successful because I'm willing to put in the hours and I've learned how to be super direct with my management and customers in a way that builds trust, even if I have to deliver bad news.

All of that is great, but I am really pigeon-holing myself into a relationship-building/project management role, which is NOT what I want only 4 years into my career.  I enjoy the technical parts of my role best, but I am recognized and rewarded for my project management &amp; soft skills. Advancement for me looks like management, not bigger technical challenges.  There are very few resources dedicated to increasing technical depth in general.

I'm looking for a new job because I want to be a better engineer.

I am in the interview process at SpaceX right now, and so far its going okay.  I know the rumors about the lack of work-life balance at SpaceX, but I want to understand why someone might be willing to work there.  I've been willing to put in long hours at my current job for a few reasons:

* I'm motivated by the end results.  I know that my work is important and I am very passionate about it.
* My management knows how to handle burn out.  They cycle people in and out of big projects as appropriate and do a good job demonstrating that they care about our well-being.
* I get paid overtime.
* I am trusted to use my own discretion when taking leave.  2 - 3 week vacations scheduled well in advance are totally normal and acceptable.
* We have a very close knit division and I consider some of my coworkers as very close friends.

So I would be willing to put in the hours as long as I am respected, valued, and end up with a stronger skill set.

So SpaceX employees, what keeps you around?  Is the burnout problem understood at all, or is the culture really as toxic as the rumors allege?  What is the leave policy?  Do you consider your co-workers friends, competitors, or just co-workers?

3,Did the design of 3.5mm headphone jacks change since the 80's?,1580579300,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit but my 12 year old cousin likes to collect vintage Teddy Ruxpin bears.

4,Can I add a second stage compressor to my freeze dryer?,1580578098,"I recently purchased a consumer grade freeze dryer which uses a single R-404a compressor for the cold trap. Unfortunately, I have found out my climate is simply unsuitable for this unit. Having already invested nearly $4000 in purchasing, shipping and import duties, I can't simply return it and get something else.

The absolute lowest temperature I seem to be able to get out of this unit is -33¬∞C. I also wind up with considerable condensation on the cold gasket around the freeze dryer door, which just adds to the heat load the compressor must deal with.  -33¬∞C  is so high that it is basically useless as a cold trap, as at 20 Pa pressure, the cold trap is still in the vapor section of the water phase diagram. I need to get down to -45¬∞C  if this is going to work.

My question is, using a minimal level of effort, is it possible to insert a second compressor stage? And if so, would it be easier to add the heat exchanger on the hot side or the cold side of the cap tube? 

As I understand the functioning a refrifgeration system, the advantage of simply adding a heat exchanger to the hot side is that I might be able to increase the cooling capacity without changing the R-404a refrigerant. Just replacing the condensor which cools to ambient, with a heat exchanger coupled to an actively cooled R-134 refrigerant, it would be as if the ambient temperature dropped.

On the other hand, if I try to attach a second compressor to the cold side of the cap tube, I would need to find a new, exotic refrigerant that operated at colder temperatures, and I would have to do a lot more piping work to get the tubing around the cold trap to flow through the second compressor. The advantage is I could engineer it to drop significantly below -45¬∞C  (the limit of the R-404a compressor) if I wanted to.

I will admit to having no experience in refrigeration systems however, so I may not even understand the theory behind what I am attempting. Can anyone suggest the absolute easiest way to make this work without spending a lot of money?  Someone suggested put the whole system inside a walk in freezer, which would probably work, but is economically impractical.

20,Should I Be Concerned with Getting an Entry-Level Position?,1580562430,"Hi Redditors,

I have been getting very mixed responses in regards to whether I should be concerned or not for getting an Engineering (or related field) job based on my experiences and GPA.  

As a little background, I am a senior graduating in the fall with my bachelors in Engineering Management Technology with a double minor in Mathematics and General Business Management.  I have an overall GPA of 2.54 and a departmental GPA of 2.92.  To note, my lower GPA is contributed to originally majoring in EE and not enjoying it; hence, my GPA suffered due to engagement level in those courses.  I refuse to retake them, as I am sure I will do no better in them since I have no interest in them.  Trying to compensate, I have been doing fairly well in the courses once I switched majors.  

In addition to this, I have had two ""relevant"" experiences within the field of engineering.  One was an internship at a medium-sized firm that lasted over double the amount of time that it was supposed to (was supposed to be 3 months, but turned into 8 due to engagement and work ethic).  Within this position, I was responsible for working along with the surface mount technology (SMT) team in creating work instructions for printed circuit boards that were to be used in military defense and aerospace applications (really was an AWESOME gig).  From there, I moved on to one of the largest engineering firms in the world (Fortune 200) company in which I work in the marketing department as an engineering researcher (Co-Op), essentially. I create product cross references to our competitors, perform market analyses/research, lead the on-boarding and data collection of new product lines (10 different products, 1500 part numbers to be approximate).  I have been in this position for a year, and have absolutely LOVED it.  

Through the university, I was able to gain a proficiency in using CAD programs including NX 12, Catia V5-6 and AutoCAD.  In my free time, I have a patent pending that is in relation to automotive safety technology that was done by pure interest and has no affiliation with the university. To ""round"" myself off as an undergraduate student, I was a Resident Assistant for four consecutive semesters, pledged a business fraternity, participated in a start-up incubator program and performed paid market research/feasibility study for a third-party start up (also unrelated to the university).

After speaking with my mentor at my current Co-Op, I was told that I can confidently profess that I have close to two years of relevant work experience, and upon graduation, I will have just short of three years of relevant engineering experience.  Furthermore, this engineering experience will not be just strictly technical, but also somewhat business oriented.  

I inquired about the type of positions in which I can take on, and my mentor told me that I can apply for anything from product management, marketing analyst, data analyst, program manager, marketing manager.  He even mentioned that I can apply for normal technical engineering roles, if I am interested in that.  

I would LOVE to continue on within the company I am currently at and become a product manager, and it is likely it will happen; however, I am never one to put all of my eggs into one basket.  Therefore, I want to apply at some top-dollar firms (if my credentials seem befitting to do so) such as Google, IBM, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Rolls Royce, Land Rover, etc.

With the aforementioned, what do you believe would be my chances of landing positions in companies of this sort considering my GPA compared to my overall experience?

To note: I am GREAT at interviewing!  I am lively, energetic, very well prepared and polished, and possess multifaceted effective communication.   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; have some great engineering-related experience, involved in undergrad and have proficiencies in quite a few technical areas.  My GPA is roughly 2.5 overall and 2.92 departmentally.

33,Why does water freeze in a heated vacuum oven?,1580519216,"We have vacuum ovens which have a bunch of shelves that steam (I think it's steam, it may be hot water) runs through them to cook product. The product is in trays that are placed on the shelves. 

We need to kosherize the ovens, so one idea was to put a couple trays of water on the shelves and boil the water, create steam under vacuum, and that would satisfy the kosherization.

When we tried it, the water boiled for about 4 minutes before stopping, then after being left in there for a couple hours, turned into a solid block of ice, despite the shelves still being about 185F when we opened the doors. 

I'm told this is due to evaporative cooling. So, is it that under vacuum, the evaporative cooling is releasing molecules with high kinetic energy so fast that it's leaving behind the molecules with less average kinetic energy, eventually creative the water to become ice because the water is lowering and lowering the kinetic energy?

If that's not the case, please correct me, I'm not very strong in thermodynamics. Would we be able to achieve a boiling point is we pulled very little vacuum, or maybe no vacuum? Now that I'm typing this out, it seems like we shouldn't pull any vacuum and just allow the water to boil.... assuming we're running steam and can get the trays to get the water to 212F+.

Also, why would it cook product and freeze water? The product is thicker and harder to boil?

Doesn't something like an instant pot work in a similar way? Why doesn't my instant pot freeze water?

Hope everyone is having a good start of a weekend. Please excuse my English as I am not an English speaker. I am looking for advice as I don‚Äôt know what job to choose and any feedback would be extremely helpful. I am a recent graduate (December 2019) in Computer Engineering with a focus in Electronics. 

I‚Äôve been able to obtain 4 jobs offer thus far and have turned down 2 of them. I am now between 2 offers. 

- Lockheed Martin - RF Engineer Associate in Littleton, CO ($78K salary + $3K relocation package) 

- Textron Systems - Test Engineer Baltimore, MD ($74K salary) 

I happen to reside in Maryland so although Textron Systems salary is lower I would still end up saving more at the end. 

I am torn between what to choose as in one I would have to sacrifice spending time with parents since I would have to move 25 hours away from home and I‚Äôm not sure if it would be worth it. 

I believe with Lockheed Martin I will be able to accelerate my career path much more than with Textron Systems. But, is really worth it? Salary wise I would still save less with LM as I would spend way more living by myself, but I do believe that in the long run it could benefit the most starting as a recent graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

My small company is working on transitioning over from soft molded to injection molded for a particular part (approximately 10"" x 8"" x 2""). When the mold was initially created for this part, it was designed for a light bead blast surface finish. We have now realized that is insufficient and we instead need a medium bead blast (my tests have resulted successful with Walnut 3560). However, the mold is already created, so assume it is out of our budget to create a new mold. 

The goal is to achieve a surface finish equivalent to a medium bead blast. I had one sandblasting company give good results using walnut 3560, however it was extremely difficult and time consuming to remove all the residue from the plastic part after the bead blast (I'm also open to ideas on how to best clean a part like this) and now this has led me to searching for shops that have specialized cleaning procedures. 

To give you an idea of how difficult the residue is to remove: after bead blast, the parts were sprayed with pressurized air, rinsed with water, and wiped with a wet paper towel (would likely move to microfiber) and their was still residual dust. I also tried using a power washer at a local car wash, but this just damaged the part.

Can someone with a little more experience than me please tell me if I am going down the right path here? Is there a better way to do this?

40,Discouraged Env. Engineering Graduate Overwhelmed by Occupation Research,1580511535,"Hello everyone! I hope that this is the correct place to post my question. I've of course read the side bar material, but my apologies if I've missed something! I'll get right into things:  


I graduated with a bachelor's degree in environmental engineering just under two years ago from an ABET accredited school. I live in a somewhat rural area of the southeast, but was still hoping to be able to find a decent starting position within driving distance of my aging parents. After spending over 6 months sending out literally hundreds of applications for anything even slightly related to my degree, I became extremely discouraged with the field and felt like my degree simply wasn't valued in the area at all. In this area there seem to be *very few* actual starting environmental engineer positions available, and the few positions I was offered were all technician work of some sort that seemed to place an emphasis on physical labor and didn't require an engineering degree to perform.   


My university has a highly-rated career services center, and I've sought advice from them on multiple occasions and received positive feedback my resume, interview skills, and job searching advice. After speaking with locals in the field and performing research through a few avenues (primarily the BLS), I came to the conclusion that there's simply a huge lack of opportunities in my field in this area due to various economic factors.   


In the midst of my search I taught myself how to program and what started out as consulting work developing automated Excel projects has turned into a bit of a small business where I independently work with a few of my own clients on medium-size consulting projects, with the larger projects being upwards of $5,000. I had intended the programming to be a side-gig while I continued my main job search, but I found myself so discouraged by my original search that I'd become completely disillusioned with the entire field. In the past few months, though, it's become clear to me that if I wish to renew my path towards a career within the environmental engineering umbrella I'll need to relocate, and I'm finally prepared to do so.  


Since I'm now casting a much wider net than in my original search, it seems that I can actually take another look at the field and take an approach that targets occupations within the field that actually interest me instead of taking whatever starting position happens to be available to me. I've been performing research using resources like My Next Move, O\*Net, BLS etc. but the amount of potential occupations within the field has be feeling pretty overwhelmed. I've already began to compile a list of occupations/job titles that I feel actually interested in, but it's been a bit of a battle thus far.  


With the backstory aside, I have a few questions:  


1. Does anyone have any advice for how to best go about exploring my options in the field, or even at what stage I should put general research aside and start actually trying to search for jobs and submitting applications? With such a wide array of options becoming available since I've decided on a relocation, I find myself struggling how to best move forward without getting bogged down by analysis paralysis.   

2. I'm also concerned that I might be less employable because I've been out of the field since graduation. I feel that I've gained excellent experience through the consulting and eventual small business work I've done, but I'm not sure how those might translate on engineering job applications. I feel that I can make a strong case for the use of my engineering skill set and strong communication used in these positions, but I haven't been able to speak with anyone else who started out their career in such a different field.  

3. Finally, any general advice about starting a nation-wide job search with a 2-year old degree that I haven't held a job *directly pertaining to* would be very much appreciated.

  
I've reached out to my alumni services center and gotten their take on some of these things, but I'm still left feeling pretty uncomfortable with the entire situation. Any and all advice would be very much appreciated!!

60,HVAC/MEP Engineers: Questions about the industry from a prospective young engineer,1580494906,"Skip to the bottom for the questions if you don't want to read my background info.

Right now I'm a senior mechanical engineering student at a state school in California and I've recently been thinking about what I want to do with my life after I graduate. During my four years here, I've worked on a variety of what I'd call ""sexy"" engineering projects - Formula SAE, mechatronics research, etc. - as I thought that was what I wanted to do for a career. However, I've recently realized that as much as I love these subjects, I'm primarily interested in them for personal projects. In other words, I like cars because I want to restore my own 240Z or 2002, and not because I want to be working on cutting edge electric vehicles or safety technology. I always looked down on the HVAC concentration, as it always seemed boring. 

However, I recently had the realization that many HVAC/MEP jobs are located in urban areas. At this point in my life, I hate the suburbs and I don't want anything to do with them. I'm the kind of person that likes to go for a city walk on a free Tuesday evening, rather than stay in and play Borderlands. I've been struggling to find a company I want to work for because a lot of the ""interesting"" jobs are located far from the city centers, meaning I'd have to have a long driving commute to get to work. Take LA, for example. I'd like to live somewhere like Koreatown, where there's always something to do for a young twenty-something delinquent. If I were to get a cool defense job, I'd probably have to commute to Redondo/El Segundo area, and without any public transit options, I'm basically signing away two hours of my life every day, unless I live in a quieter area. However, if I were to go into HVAC, I could find a job in DTLA and work would just be a 15 minute subway ride away. 

With my life story out of the way, here are my questions to engineers in the field:

1. Are the jobs actually easy or boring? I think it would be nice to have a job that I didn't have to stress about, but I'm concerned that I might lose my mind if the job is too soul-sucking. That being said, an easy job would leave me with the mental capacity to do fun things on my own time, which sounds nice. 

2. What are your hours like in this industry? Are most jobs a hard 40 hr/week or are they typically 50-60 hr/week gigs? I don't mind the occasional overtime, but I don't want that to be my life.

Summarized version because I know you don't like reading novels: 

1. Fish tank is 5f x 2f x 2ft. Tank + stand + accessories should be well over 2 tons when filled. I have a few more tanks on the floor in different spots and everything should have a combination of around ~300 gallon total. 

2. This is a condo and I live above the building garage. Thus I can't really do floor reinforcing easily. However, that also means in the event the tank breaks, no angry downstair neighbors to complain.

3. Tank will be placed next to a load bearing wall (red line) and on top of that purple beam (see attached pics below) 

4. Pics: [photo of garage ceiling below my apt](https://i.imgur.com/sNy2CNa.jpg), [blue print of garage](https://i.imgur.com/HHnW3qX.png), [blue print of my floor](https://i.imgur.com/REbIA9A.png) (red square is my condo, purple rectangle is the beam and lighter rectangle is fish tank) 
5. Additional info: Building HOA has no rules regarding fish tanks (at least from what I saw in bylaws). I have 150k insurance coverage for water damage (double checked with agent). Floor is not concrete. I asked building manager and he said floor joists were 16'' on center with 2 sheets of plywood subfloor.

68,Gearing Reduction - Does placement matter?,1580488405,"I'm designing my own RC helicopter project running off a small petrol engine. Its power band that I would use in flight is between 3000-5500rpm 

I need to do some testing with the rotor head speed to ensure it'll remain within around a 500 RPM range within that powerband to achieve a head speed of around 1500\~2000 RPM but the setup may be as low 800-1300 RPM depending on several factors of weight, lift etc. I have 4 places I can change gearing ratios: The engine output pulley, the driven pulley, the pinion bevel gear and the main ring bevel gear. 

Ignoring the max RPM of the pulley belt for a moment, does it matter where the reduction takes place? My main aim is efficiency and power transfer while keeping weight as low as possible. If use a different arrangement to achieve the reduction, I thought it may have efficiency effects e.g. having to spin the mass of a larger crown gear or drag from needing more belt tension etc. Or if I could get more of the reduction done initially, I may be able to reduce the load on the bevel gears and use reinforced plastic instead of metal to reduce weight.

*For these reasons,* ***would it be more beneficial to have the entire reduction done at the bevel gears while keeping the belt pulleys at 1:1, or have the entire reduction done at the start with the pulleys at say 2:1 , or spread the reduction across all 4 areas to progressively reduce the RPM?*** 

I'm not an engineer, I'm a hobbyist with some moderate understanding of engineering concepts so I apologise if the question seems highly novice but I wasn't able to find a clear answer from a reputable source online.

72,"Question about high speed gas flow around corners? Full disclosure, gun tech related so if you're not into that, that's cool...serious gun modding discussion here :).",1580486965,"Hi, my name is Jim and I hotrod guns.

:)

Seriously.  I'm the lunatic that built a magazine fed revolver which uses tapped muzzle gasses to force empty shells out the back of the cylinder.

https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/03/03/maurice-frankenruger-magazine-fed-revolver/

My next similar build will involve a bigger but similar gun in a bigger caliber so I can tap muzzle gasses for three purposes:

1) Empty shell ejection cycle.  (Might not be needed, recoil alone will probably be good enough!)

2) Live round INJECTION cycle stripping rounds from the top of a conventional magazine into the back of the cylinder.  This will take serious gas pressure.  A gas line will wrap around to the rear of the magazine well and blast gas literally right at the back of the live shell, pushing it forward into the back of the cylinder.  There will be a spring loaded catch to prevent shells from bouncing backwards once in!

3) Any leftover gas will be used as a compensator, sprayed straight up at the muzzle to reduce recoil-derived ""flip"" of the gun backwards.  Likely caliber will be 50AE using Desert Eagle magazines built on either a Freedom Arms 83 or Magnum Research BFR short cylinder base gun.

So to do all this I need a highly efficient gas trap at the end of the barrel, extending the barrel length roughly 3/4"" or so.  I could go as long as 1"".

The bullet will come out of the barrel, fly through a chamber, then exit through a hole barely big enough for the bullet.  Most of the gas tapped for working energy will be from behind the bullet in the form of hot, still-expanding burning gas that was pushing the bullet until it cleared the barrel.  Gas will be tapped in holes in the wall of that chamber.  The front wall of the chamber will be bolted in from the front so it's removable to allow cleaning the insides of the gas expansion chamber area.

I can vary the shape of the front of the barrel itself, the width and length of the expansion chamber and the shape of the inner surface of the forward plate with the final bullet exit hole.

Bullet size is almost certainly going to be 50cal - exactly half an inch.

What width, length and interior shapes of that chamber is going to give me maximum working pressure that can be tapped for use?

So I graduated last may from a well regarded industrial engineering program with a 3.3 GPA and two semesters of co-op experience in manufacturing process improvement. So I really enjoyed working in process improvement and got good reviews, but unfortunately the company unexpectedly had a hiring freeze so I couldn't go to work for them after graduation. This lead to me applying for jobs all senior year but the only offer I got was a software engineer position from an ERP software company which I accepted. 

The job description was basically a complete lie. Basically they told me I would be getting all this good experience designing ERP functionality and that I would have the opportunity to learn programming so I took the job. In reality literally all I've been given is menial documentation and user training course work. There's absolutely no room for learning anything relevant (ERP functionality wise or programming). Its a really small company who makes us fill out time sheets to the 15 minute mark on what we did, and I've asked to be given more challenging things and they said no. I expected to be doing menial work as a recent grad, but I'm scared because the company is too small to promote people and the other people in my position who've been here 15+ years are still doing the same menial documentation I'm doing. 

I want to move back into process improvement but I'm really worried that I won't be able to interview well because in the seven months I've been here, literally all I've done is learn our software then do menial documentation and I have no real projects under my belt to talk about. I'm currently sending out applications for entry level process improvement positions, but what do I do if interviews don't work out? I feel like with every passing day I become a worse candidate for process improvement positions because I'm farther out from being a relevant candidate and more pigeonholed into my current role. 

Also, if I get to a year in my current role and I still haven't found anything else, how poorly would it reflect on me if I were to quit with nothing lined up so I can devote myself full time to finding a better position?

1,"Specced Gearbox Torque Decreasing As Ratio Increases, Explaination Required",1580432341,"Hi guys,

Just wondering if someone could explain the nominal torque numbers tied to the different stage/ratio gearboxes in the picture below.

https://imgur.com/65pOGYK

My understanding of the relationship was that you could multiply the torque supplied at the motor shaft (the input) by the gear ratio to find the output torque, therefore the torque increases as the ratio increases. The output torque for these gearboxes jumps all over the shop though and on the whole mostly decreases as the gearbox ratio increases. Is this something to do with the fragility of the gearbox teeth as the ratio increases? But that doesn't explain why a 5:1 gearbox has the same nominal output torque as a 50:1 gearbox. Assume there's something obvious I'm missing but I haven't been able to find anything that explains it.

68,PC problems related to EMI on signal cables or ground loop. Any Engineers able to offer advice?,1580348261,"I am hoping to get some advice here to track down a potential ground loop, or serious source of EMI/RFI (not sure if conducted or radiated). I figured audio folks have dealt with some of these issues the most so may be able to provide advice. I have a host of non destructive computer and peripherals related problems. The issue manifest as input lag (mouse, keyboard), degraded sound quality (muddied, and shallow sound), degraded wireless (throughout the house) and wired internet performance, screen artifacts (noise), and degraded display (hitching, tearing).

I have confirmed that it is not hardware related * 4 different PC's (Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and 1 laptop (Windows 7) * 3 Monitors * Multiple Keyboards, Mice, Headphones, Speakers * Multiple Modems, Routers, and all new cables (shielded and non- shielded Ethernet and Display port cables do help slightly I believe.

Observations 
* Using different circuits and configurations (power strips, or conditioners) around the house which changes the input delays and performance.

* Moving cables away from each other helps even data cables are messing with each other. 

* Placing a phone on PC makes the mouse sensitivity feel two times as fast.

* Placed ferrite cores and toroids onto data, and power cables changes mouse tracking, sound and display quality, and internet performance.

* Different power strips, Gold and Platinum rated PSUs, a Furman power conditioner, and a Tripp Lite double conversion UPS. UPS does something makes the input latency better, and the power conditioner helped for a few days. The power conditioner helped the most with the sound and display issues. 

* Seems to be better at night but only slightly. 

* When an appliance in the home is switched on the amount of data latency, input lag and display issues amplifies.

* Any setting in Windows or BIOS changes how the mouse preforms (power settings, and fans speeds do the most), however after some time it seems to degrade back to the same point. 

* Wifi in the home continually cuts out and some weird stuff like if my modem and router are one the same power strip the Wifi will not work. Desktop PCs connected to Wifi even two feet away from router makes the input latency lower however there is full one second stutters in games, browsers and video streams.

* Used my PC at a friends house in another city and it works perfectly fine, night and day from my setup at home. I am actually shocked at how much deeper sound, colors and consistency of mouse tracking is compared to at my house.

I have had the power company out twice, and had two electricians check my grounding, neutrals, and outlets. All come clean. I poked around with an AM radio and while there are some sources of noise around the house, nothing stands out. My laptop on battery works better at random times yet still has the same issues.

Found several posts relating to the issue and it seems they all observe the same symptoms.

* http://www.jonnyguru.com/forums/showthread.php?16546-Major-input-lag-caused-by-Power-issues-in-House

After reading several posts about this very issue and seeing first hand how ferrite cores, moving cables, and power conditioners etc affect it I have concluded that it is indeed an electrical noise issue in my home or from the power pole/utility. In the thread on r/buildapc some of the comments stated it is likely an issue with grounding. I am wondering if maybe an Isolation Transformer, or just lifting the ground would solve it.

If there is anyone that is knowledgeable in these areas of either breaking groundloops, or at least finding them, or dealing with finding sources of EMI and finding out what frequencies I need to filter please let me know.

As interns in instrumentation, we are obliged to use PPE. We are in the field for 21 days (continuosly) and were given only a pair of boots, a shirt... we send them to wash regulary, but boots are non negotiable. She decided to go to the field with non industrial boots. I do understand that, but if anyone of security would notice she could be fired from the plant. The same with her prescribed glasses. She said that someone told her that her prescribed glasses are OK to use in the field. i know they are not (I'm switching back and forth with the protection glasses and my prescribed glasses)...  


She states that she wants to be in ""planning and logistic"" departament. So, even if I try she does not much to learn the technical aspects more than the just barely expected.   


Now we are in a shift, she's in the field and I'm home... and got a message because she forgot her laptop in her home. This is now a bit extreme and don't know if is something important or to worry... Everybody here is cool with her, but this is an special case; in other places she could be in a bad position with that attitude.  


I like her, and maybe this is a reason why I'd like to help her to get  the right attitude, but don't know how.

90,Why does my stepper motor screech and stop?,1580327621,"
Hi everyone, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I‚Äôm working on a PID controller using arduino that actuates a NEMA 17 stepper motor with speed and direction. I am using half step and have constrained then mapped my speed between 0 and 1000rpm.

The commands I am using are myStepper.step(steps) and myStepper.setSpeed(stepper_speed)

However when I run this it works briefly then screeches and stops. The motor won‚Äôt turn and the speed/step calculations stop. I think this may be due to the speed spiking at a very large negative number but I am unsure why it does this (I notice it on serial monitor).

Could be something else though, I‚Äôm really not sure. Does anyone have any theories or advice on this? Any help is much appreciated

93,Did I make a mistake?,1580326628,"Hi everyone, I apologize for the wall of text ahead, but it‚Äôs hard to explain the situation without providing a background. 

I‚Äôve been in an ‚Äúequipment support specialist‚Äù role for the about the last two years in a global bio-medical corporation. I came from an R&amp;D role working in novel ceramic materials, working on both public and private contracts for aerospace, defense, nuclear, and energy sectors. I also spent approximately two years in that role. My educational background includes a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Penn State. I also worked as a Researcher at the Materials Research Institute, as a direct report to the Director of the institute while completing my undergrad.

I had to move across states to live and help my family as both of my parents were fighting cancer (thankfully they are both in remission now). I was unemployed for about 8 months, while looking for roles such as materials engineer/product development/process engineering/manufacturing engineering. I had several interviews, but for all of the roles I‚Äôd had on-site interviews for, the response came back that I was too junior for those positions. By the 7 month mark, desperation was rearing it‚Äôs ugly head and my savings were depleted. With both of my parents on medical leave, and a younger sibling to take care of, the urgency to be employed was kicking me in the ass. I ended up scoring an interview with my current company for the ‚ÄúEquipment Support Specialist‚Äù role, as a contractor. The pay and responsibilities were far below what I considered to be adequate for my experience, but I reluctantly accepted the job due to my financial situation. 

In my time here, I‚Äôve made a large effort to get involved in operations engineering and engineering project management tasks. Approximately half of my work load comes from projects I‚Äôve initiated and am leading, that have wide ranging impacts (hundreds to potentially thousands of end users). Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt reflected in my pay or title. I‚Äôm also stuck as a contingent employee because the department only has a select number of permanent positions that are all currently full. 

The entire time I‚Äôve been in this role, I have been applying and interviewing for a huge variety of positions. Most recruiters contact me with Computer Science/IT related jobs due to my title, however that is not really the career field I wish to pursue. All of my applications for engineering project management/manufacturing engineering roles generally do not get past the automated checks. To combat this, I work hard to customize my resume for each position and include any potential ATS keywords that are in the job descriptions. It‚Äôs becoming monotonous and it feels like there‚Äôs no end in sight for my search for an applicable role. The two in person interviews I‚Äôve had have questioned my acceptance of the position I am in now, and why I am looking to get back into my previous field. Based on the lack of contact after the interviews, I assume my honest answer was not what they were looking for. 

So, to tie this back to the title. I am wondering, did I make a mistake accepting my current role?

Basically what I want to say, I have learned math well enough (comparing to other students I know), mqybe even better than some of those students have.

Why if I differentiate velocity I get acceleration (best linear approximation of that function) and why does area under that function give me displacement? 

Also, all problems we have are: velocity is a function v=a/b*t^2+something (example) ; I don't remember seeing anything like that in real life.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering and I'm currently on my 1st year and a half in my company as a Mechanical Design Engineer. My company is offering a scholarship for its employees who are already a year old to go to school and get degrees from Bachelor's to Master's. Right now, I'm currently on the fence on what to take. My career path isn't solid yet considering I'm still an entry-level employee, there's still so much to discover and I'll probably won't be hard set on my aspired career path.

Currently I am working on interior systems of aircrafts, specifically galleys. I would like to someday diverge from this with my choices to follow are:

**-Stay as a Design Engineer and try to work in aerostructures such as fuselage, nacelles, wings, and eventually try to design new and/or efficient engines.**

**-Try to work in RnDs working on composite materials or anything STREMA related.**

On the back of my head are either M.S. in Material Sciences or M.Eng/M.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I chose the latter as an option due to the degree being flexible in the industry, atleast that's what I think. **Also if I wanted to improve my technical writing, will MS be a better option?**

**As of now I don't know if I wanna stay in aerospace in the long term,** as this is a tough industry to may even switch companies with. If it gets hard, I might switch to another field with a similar setting like automotive if I ever wanna leave the company for another.

I just interviewed for a position with a company that distributes HVACR equipment. The position is for an estimator and I should mention that I got the reference through my neighbour (who is in their HR department).

So far I've interviewed effectively with my neighbour and the team lead that I will be working for. They called to book an appointment with me for a second round interview and since they (HR person) are my neighbour, they told me on phone that the team lead's only concern for hiring me was that since I can't get my professional engineer designation at their company that I would leave after a few years. 

I am an Engineer in Training (EIT) which means, in my state, I have to have a certain amount of hours and be working under a professional engineer that can sign off on my hours worked. 

I really like the position as it will be a good learning experience and the organization isn't tied to the energy sector which has been dry (and generally bad for job security) for the last decade.
The only problem is convincing them that I want to stay with their company. If I decide later in to pursue my PEng designation, it would  potentially sour the relationship between me and my neighbor and their team lead, however I would like to be honest about it or perhaps avoid the topic if I can.

I'm wondering if anyone interested in providing feedback could pose a behavioral question here, and then give feedback on my response. If this isn't allowed here, please remove it.

I'll start with a simple one: Tell about a time you failed and how did you handle it?

Answer: When I was working as a mechanical designer, I had to lead an intern to assemble a product for testing. It was meant to be a learning experience for him, so I provided our assembly instructions and remained present to answer questions and lend a hand as needed. At the end of the day, the test unit was assembled and I gave it the okay to be taken for testing without giving it a detailed inspection. Our test engineer took it to the test facility, but it wasn't powering on and the tests failed, pushing us behind on schedule. When the unit came back, I disassembled it and found that the main power connection was not screwed in. I met with my manager to discuss the mistake, and made a plan to get the project back on track. I worked with our intern to assemble a new unit for testing, and ensured that it was all okay. Additionally, I looked deeper into why this was missed, and discovered that this assembly step wasn't listed in our drawings, and only shown as hardware in an exploded view. I chose to add an additional drawing view with a specific call-out for installing these screws, which likely prevented issues down the road in manufacturing and with customer installations.

Considering a fuselage which only needs to hold a single pilot's station, is it more drag-efficient to have a streamlined body of revolution with an aspect ratio of 2.7 (ref. Hoerner) eg. a revolved NACA 0019, or a spline-fit cross section around the pilot's station?  Let's ignore interference drag for the moment.

Put another way: is a circular cross-section which is large enough to accommodate a rectangular object more efficient than a spline fit around that object?

This is for a homebuilt aircraft btw.  I am using Raymer's Aircraft Design as my primary source at the moment, but since I am *very* frustrated with the quality of the math (and the complete absence of derivations), I've ordered Gudmundsson's General Aviation Aircraft Design to replace it.

With Enlarge/Reduce, this character becomes **twice** his original size, and **eight times as heavy**.

The question is, at what velocity would he need to be travelling to compromise the structural integrity of a sailing ship he landed upon?

I am currently in a position where I feel like I am steering well off my career path and will not be able to get back on the right track.

Short Summary: I graduated with an EE degree in Dec 2016, got my first job May 2017 in Honeywell, MO, but left after 6 months because the job was manufacturing (Extremely boring and not related to my degree, plus Kansas City was boring). From October 2017 - October 2018 I was actively looking for a position, applied to thousands of jobs and only a couple of interviews. I took my EIT and passed in the meantime.

October 2018, I applied for an Electrical Engineering position at Tenaris, I had two interviews and passed, they ended up offering me a job with pretty good salary and I took it, the catch was the starting role was a supply chain one and they told me after a year or even less I could rotate into an EE role.

It is now almost Feb 2020, 16 months into this job and I am stuck doing supply chain. I am losing my mind everyday working with business majors and working on mundane boring tasks. I constantly bug HR to find me an EE role but they keep coming back with saying nothing is available.

Tenaris is a big company and they have plenty of engineers here in Houston as well. Not sure why they can't find me a spot.

My dilemma now is, I want to find an EE role and am actively applying to other companies, the problem is my resume has supply chain as my current position which instantly turns off recruiters and they discard my resume, the other problem is that I don't qualify for entry level positions anymore because I am at 3 years past graduation, they instantly reject me. For intermediate positions I again don't qualify because I don't have experience in EE related jobs.

My question now is what steps should I take to find an EE position? I have worked on some EE projects to put on my resume and picked up programming (Python, C, etc) but it hasn't seem to help... It's this supply chain role that I feel like is putting a big red X on my resume...

So I've been working on a new project w my company doing some flat springs and as I was doing some analysis I had to brush up on stress/strain and all those classic examples that you always wonder if you'll ever use, yet here I am.  

So I have a small flat spring, 301 Stainless steel, it has a cross section of 5mm wide (b) x 0.5mm thick (h) and its 25 mm long. I am trying to find the max deflection before it becomes permanently deformed (theoretically).  

My area moment of inertia would be 1/12 bh\^3 

So I have a youngs modulus (E) of [212 GPa](http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheet.aspx?matguid=0cf4755fe3094810963eaa74fe812895&amp;ckck=1) (one end, from what I've seen it in various ranges).  

Max Yield Strenght (Y.S.) = 205 MPa  

so I have 2 questions here that dont click in my mind or maybe I forgot:  

&amp;#x200B;

0,Lots of uncertainty at first job: Should I stay or should I go?,1580157042,"Looking for some career advice here. I'm currently in my first job out of grad school, and I'm in a mechanical design engineer role in my chosen industry (which was my goal for a very long time). I live in a great area for this industry, with lots of other companies nearby. The company I work for does contract design and manufacturing.

I like the job a lot, and I'm very grateful to be here. The company has paid for me to attend some very valuable training classes, and I can tell that the design engineers here are highly skilled. That being said, it's been a very slow start. I'm currently ~7 months in. I'm finished with all the training, and I'm at the point where I'm designing fixtures with no supervision and doing DfM on parts with mentor supervision. The issue isn't the work itself, it's the lack of work for me and every other designer here.

When I started in July, things were very slow and many design engineers had very low workloads. Managers and senior engineers kept telling me that this was normal, that we go through ebbs and flows in work every year, and sometimes it's boring and sometimes it's crazy busy. Being a contract company, this made sense to me. They said it would probably pick up in Q1 2020.

Well, it's the end of January now and things are the same. I asked my manager about upcoming projects and he said that basically there is only one big one, which will only require two design engineers. In addition, some other sketchy stuff has been happening. Since I started, 3 of the senior design engineers have left (out of 7), as well as the site manager, two other managers, AND the CEO. We also just closed one of our manufacturing sites, however we also just built one, so maybe that's not a bad sign. When asking management about all these departures, they chalk it up to coincidence or people just being late in their careers and wanting a change. A lot of those people had worked here for 15-20+ years .

Should I be worried? This is my first engineering job, and I'm worried I'm not developing fast enough with not having any projects coming in. I'm usually the type of person to try and suggest side projects proactively, but everything we do is more or less tied up with funding from customers and there are very few internal projects. I've kept myself sharp by requesting fixture design work, which has been fruitful, but that is starting to dry up as well. Meanwhile, another company in my city (one of my dream companies) has some job reqs up now that fit my grad school background really well and are relevant to my current role too. Should I be looking for a way out now and try to explain the short tenure (7 months) at my current job? Or should I wait and see how things go?

TL;DR 
As a ME Senior with an upcoming accepted internship, should I try to get more offers at the upcoming career fair at the possibility of running into the other company and giving myself a negative image or be happy with the accepted offer I have?


A little background, Im a senior ME student in the Carolinas. I graduate in this upcoming December, I currently have a tentative internship with a well known DoD contractor this summer. I‚Äôm super excited for it because this is going to be my first actual internship and experience with ‚Äúclose‚Äù to actual engineering worthy pay. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to the organization for giving me the opportunity however, I understand that the introductory level pay if they offer me a job is right around 60K and is based on GPA which I‚Äôm just slightly over a 3.0 which I know isn‚Äôt the best. I also would get great benefits. I have a contract with the ARNG(I already have a secret security clearance) so I would get benefits there as well so I‚Äôm not incredibly worried about benefits. I also know there‚Äôs a really good chance I could get another internship offer that pays more or for even just rubbing elbows for potential future jobs that pay higher. Should I take the risk and attend the career fair and potentially insult the organization I currently have accepted an offer for and be happy with what I have? Or should I push for private industry where the pay is probably higher and possibly benefits be lower?

Edit 1:
Job is also in a higher COL area so it would be more expensive but the surrounding area is extremely desirable to live in as well. Job security is super high at the company and I‚Äôm not super paranoid about job security but I would like to ensure I can remain at the company for at least a few years if i do accept a job after the internship. Job is also related more to R&amp;D than manufacturing, should I stay away? Might this hurt potential future positions?

Edit 2: 
The only other ‚ÄúEngineering experience‚Äù I have besides the upcoming internship is as an undergraduate research assistant in aerospace composites which I‚Äôve been told is basically worthless.

I'll start. I am a senior staff scientist at my current employer, and a subject matter expert in a couple of specific areas in my field. A few years ago I got an email from the owner of another local company, who said they saw my resume online and they had an opening they thought would be a great fit, and would I be interested in talking? I visited their website and saw that several of their business areas indeed lined up with my particular skills. I wrote back and said sure, and an interview was set up for a week later. I showed up on time, expecting that I would be meeting with the owner and their chief engineer to discuss their business areas, my background, and the position. Instead, I was met by a middle manager, who took me to a small conference room. We sat down, and he said ""ok, so this is the position"" and described a job where I would sit in a shared space with 6 other people taking data outputted from some simulation and making powerpoint slides. I asked that there might have been some mistake, maybe HR had mixed me up with a junior candidate,  and I said I had been contacted by the owner to discuss a position that was a good fit for my skill set. He said no, and reached into a folder and handed me a copy of my resume. I realized immediately that this was some sort of body shop, they just wanted seats filled to charge contract dollars.

Currently I work in manufacturing. Chemical machine operation. My company makes supplement's/OTC meds. I've been with them for 2 years. I went to college for medical education, couldn't pass exams ended up throwing it away, unfortunately. But that's in the past. My current job I make decent money for where I live. I'm also the #1 employee across all departments. I work 3rd shift 11-p7a but I get unlimited over time because I actually get work done. It's both a physically demanding job as well as mental. There are tons of things to consider every day on the job. I work in the department where the blends for the pills are actually made. Following formulas is extremely important. This is my first long term job too.

I pick up on things very quickly. Very efficiency and problem solving oriented mindset. Have lots of experience with various software (from Adobe suite to Windows, Linux, programing, MS Office suite). Had some very light CAD experience in highschool and middle school. Took those engineering related electives every chance I got. Loved it.

My friend is working for a civil engineering firm in my area. He recommended me to his manager for a drafting position. I have no idea what it is, how it works, and what is required. I am slated for an interview this week. I will be asking a healthy amount of questions to the manager interviewing me of course. But would like some knowledge ahead of time.

Apparently drafting is all I will be doing. Nothing more. The pay is higher than my current pay maybe by 20%. It's also working during the day in a safe, quiet by comparison, and definitely cleaner environment. There are so many great perks to taking this job. Company says there will be a 3-4 month review to see how I do and then decide if they want to keep me or not. I could always go back to my old job, my management would love to have me back because we are short staffed by about 40% of max capacity. Job security at my current job is a non issue. I clock in, do my work, clock out. Zero stress, just the environment is meh. If it wasn't for the great team I work with I would have quit on day one.

Questions:

Is it possible for someone off the street to pick up this job within 2-3 months?

Is this a viable long term field?

My biggest concern is that I won't be able to learn the job due to a lack of college knowledge base. My friend is a civil engineer straight out of college and I'm sure for him it's a piece of cake at this point. He knows the ins and outs. He's interned with this firm before working for it.

That being said, I would love anything pro-environment from, as said, renewable energy to reducing pollution to whatever else might be out there (throw me some ideas that I might not know). 

I am super into nature and the outdoors, especially when it comes to rock climbing. I currently live in Michigan where there isn‚Äôt much rock climbing, so I would love to work somewhere out west where the sport is known (Colorado, Utah, California, etc.). I would totally love to work for a climbing company too as an engineer, though I‚Äôm pretty sure you wouldn‚Äôt find chemical engineering positions at those places. That‚Äôs just a side dream, though, I‚Äôd rather focus on what I said in the first paragraph. But having a job out west would give me more time to pursue climbing on the side. 

I have thought about environmental engineering and others, and I‚Äôm not against switching majors or pursing my PhD in a different field, but I really am looking for inputs from anyone who might know something that I don‚Äôt. Anything helps. I enjoy chemical engineering at the moment, but when I think about the future I feel like I‚Äôm heading the wrong way. 

I really want to take care of nature and be outdoors as much as possible, and having a job that goes along with this is my dream. If I confused anyone in anyway let me know because I feel I‚Äôm all over the place with this post.

I can imagine that anything of value is stripped down before the actual demolishing / imploding / big steel ball hitting the walls: metal pipping, old appliances, electrical cables, etc. I can also imagine that this also happens for nice marbles, nice wooden flooring, nice bricks, nice wooden doors, etc. 

**Question 1:** does this happen for every building size? If I demolish a small family home, will a guy with a van come and do all that work for a bit of salvageable material?

There's also a lot of ""ordinary"" materials in a building, like cement, concrete, insulation (fiber glass or foam panels), glass, structural bricks, etc.

**Question 2:** what happens in this case? Are the steel rebars somehow ripped out of the concrete slabs and columns? How do you separate the different materials out of the rubble piles?

The small size of the company also means that I gets involved in all kinds of non-R&amp;D projects too; like quality assurance, trying to convince architects to use our products, supporting electricians and on-site inspections.

I feel like all these things strengthen my profile for future jobs - but my big fear is that i'm running myself into a corner. The lighting-industry is somewhat small and while i really enjoy it now i don't know how i'll be seeing things in 10 years.

I graduated in Spring 2018 with a double major in Chemical Engineering and General Chemistry and a minor in Math. I've been working for a year and a half (plus a summer internship) as a Materials RnD Engineer for a semiconductor company.

Last week, a month after I found out we were expecting, I got the news that my position was eliminated for cost saving purposes. They offered me another position as a Yield Engineer, which was a very rare case among all the ones that were laid off. I accepted this, even though it hit me pretty hard.

Right before we found out about our pregnancy, my husband learned he'd be held back a year due to some error in the degree audit, and he can't start working as a teacher until the 2021-2022 school year. This is relevant because given the uncertainty in his career, I need to find ways to better secure mine for the sake of our family's financial being.

I already planned to take my FE this year. Now I'm thinking of applying for an online Master's program in Applied Math. It closely aligns with my new position, so I could get some reimbursement from my company. Plus, a Master's would help me find another job more easily if we were to relocate or if I got laid off again.

I don't know which specific branch of ChemE I want to devote the majority of my career to, but I know I like using math to solve problems. I'm looking for advice on if this is the right path for job security, if Applied Math is the way to go or something else is better, if online program is just as respectable by employers as physically going to school, if there's a school anyone would recommend.

I‚Äôm currently working on a project and requiring a way of opening a small valve to allow water to flow through only when its reached a certain temperature. The issue is I‚Äôm looking for something that can achieve this without any external power input. The general method I‚Äôve been considering is something operating off thermal expansion. 

I‚Äôve been considering hydraulic, pneumatic or wax actuators, but I‚Äôve never used any of them before and don‚Äôt know a tonne about them. From what I‚Äôve seen online, they can be quite expensive, and the cheaper miniature ones only seem to be available in orders of 100 or more.  

I‚Äôve also looked for some sort of all-in-one thermal valve, but haven‚Äôt had any luck finding something affordable that doesn‚Äôt require electricity. I‚Äôve considered potentially using a thermostatic expansion valve and seeing if I can reduce the pressure enough that the water allowed through isn‚Äôt vaporised, but I‚Äôve also heard that they can‚Äôt close fully, so that may not be a solution.  

Ultimately, I‚Äôm thinking putting something together using some sort of thermal actuator that somehow controls the flow of water is the most realistic idea, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows of anywhere online that sells small thermal actuators individually. Alternatively, if anyone knows of an all-in-one valve solution, that would be fantastic.

¬∑ Building Services Engineering Site Management

I suspect some coworkers are on here so I'm going to keep it as plain as possible to keep from being identified if at all possible.
I'd also ask that you bear with me.

Since graduating as a Mech E, and I've had 3 jobs in about 4 years give or take.
My first job I enjoyed but the company was going down hill and I left after about 1.5 years.
Sure enough I learned that my department was down sized about 3 months later, and disbanded about 6 months after I left.
My second job was not what was advertised, and I didn't enjoy it.  
I'm very much a doer, I like a challenge and I always like to learn.  This second job did not supply this, they basically decided I was going to copy data all day long.  It was very much not what was advertised, and not a good fit for me.  If I could go back and not leave that first company I wouldn't.  
I left after about a year to the position I'm holding now.  
The position I'm in now I've enjoyed, but for the last several months my boss has been getting more and more critical of my work and has been micromanaging me.  About two weeks ago I had my performance review.  In the lead up to it I had a knot in my stomach, I just had a bad feeling about it. . . I nearly threw up in my bosses office when he told me the CEO was going to be sitting in on this interview.  I've been through enough experiences to know that's not a good thing.  Sure enough they tore into me.  Apparently I have a good work ethic, am hard working, take the initiative, etc.  But I'm not finding as many CI projects as they would like, and am asking for my bosses take too often.  Yet I can go to my boss to ask him for help according to the CEO.  I was also asked if I liked working there, and about my interactions with some of the production staff.  Some are really good, and other people I've approached to ask a professional question to get the F-bomb dropped in my face.  Combine that with, from what I've observed, is a culture of keeping with the status quo and it feels like my job is having to completely change the company.  I should add my boss seemed to be interviewing someone else for the engineering department immediately after my review, and had the door open.  I also didn't receive a raise, and was told in 2-6 months a decision would be made on that.  
I'm not sure what to make of this, but it seems like job is not on a secure footing.  Since that review my boss has been putting out a significant number of hoops for projects I'm just starting, or have been running.  So what do I do here, because I'm honestly not certain?  I'd really rather not go looking again if I don't have to, but it seems like being let go at this point in my career it would be career-ending.  Would it be career ending?
If I was to be let go what should I tell prospective employer?  I'm very cognizant of what looking for a 4th job in 4-5 years looks like.

To summarize, I decided to accept the position, because I felt the role is was too big of a career boost to pass on. Now that I have accepted the role, I am dealing with my company‚Äôs relocation policy, which is sorely lacking in my opinion. I will be fronting all of the money (though they are giving me a stipend) and handling all of the logistics of the move, on top of finishing work in my soon to be old job. Anecdotally, I know several peers who have moved for work and never had to do anything like this. On top of this, I am getting no time off between positions, and am being expected to finish in one role Friday and start in the next the following Monday, with no time to apartment hunt or take care of any other moving items. For reference, this is an 18 hour, 900 mile move, so it will be challenging to even drive this much in a weekend.

38,[NSFW] What motion properties could be expected from a linear actuator constructed with steppers and v slot extrusion?,1579882993,"Hi all. I am posting this year's sex machine question as in the past this sub has been very informative!

Reading through the old posts it is a regular suggestion that people use a linear actuator to gain precise control over the motion of their machine. (Not to mention it being smaller) But it is often shot down as being expensive, complex or lacking in capability etc.

However with the ever increasing popularity of 3d printing and the maker movement stepper motors and motion systems like v slot are becoming cheaper and more accessible. Not to mention the control that a system like this offers justifies a slightly higher price.

The question remains however about the physical plausibility. I have a couple of approaches in mind:

One is a belt driven plate sliding on c beam. (Beam is mounted stationary, plate is attached to the ""effective end"")

Second is a belt and pinion approach where the motors are mounted and a single 20*20 V slot extrusion is moved relative to them with the relevant tooling attached to the end of that.

My question is if using either of these approaches, along with a NEMA 17/NEMA 23/pair of 17s or 23s you could achieve the speed and torque required for the application? As an example spec, it may be asked to achieve a 20cm stroke at 4hz with 25N or force (plus the force required to accelerate and decelerate) (top end of what anyone could want I know but who does not like to overbuild their machines?) Could the belts and pulleys even handle this? Would the noise be ridiculous? If this is not feasible then what would have to change in the specs to make it so?

50,Is it difficult to completely change industries?,1579849442,"To start off, I have an electrical engineering degree.

My first job was at an automotive supplier. It was on the process side of things, handling release process to the factory with some testing work, so no design work. I didn't have much reason to stay since the location wasn't great and I didn't have long term prospects there. I did that for two years.

My current job is as doing electrical design work for hardware in the loop stuff in aerospace. People enjoy working with me, the company process can be a little tedious but it's not hard to do or anything, and I have a clear path to be here to climb the ladder. I don't have any major professional complaints, but I'm not interested in being here. Part of my desire is personal since I moved cross country away from family, and I realize I don't want to be this far away. I'm not interested in moving back to my hometown, I want to be closer but not too close if you know what I mean. Part of my desire is the nature of the work with this company and within this sector, so I'm not interested in jumping to a direct competitor.

My current view is that the worst case is that I could just stay here since I know I have job security. Or rather, at least as much job security I think someone can have these days. I was assigned a mentor since the company seems to view me as someone who can develop into a SME or REA. I've not made any hard commitments to stay, nor would I think it mattered if I did since companies don't commit to workers anyway (and even here, older coworkers who are lifers say company loyalty is dead). 

I'd like to get into either railway systems or medical devices, so I'm already making a list of where to apply. But I wasn't able to get into these industries earlier, so my actual work experience isn't as directly relevant, and these may not be in ideal locations. If I have to relocate anyway I'd rather live in a city and work in a city, but most engineering jobs are in suburban office parks.

I've also been looking into the construction/architecture/building engineering side of EE as well, these also seem to have simply better geographical locations in terms of where I'd like to be. These jobs tend to be in actual cities. However, I don't have an EIT, and a lot of places list that as eventually required. 

What experiences have people on here had making leaps into new industries or lines of work? How did you parlay your existing (but not necessarily directly relevant) experience into getting those new lines of work? Did they consider you ""entry level"" for lack of direct experience or did lack of direct experience not matter as much?

He said that the fact that I had presented to a client twice was a big accomplishment that not many interns can say they did.

Now, being a rising senior at the time he and I knew that there was a big elephant in the room: a job offer. Most, if not all, seniors usually expect a job offer with the company they interned with in their final summer (at least by what I'm told). Here is the part where I begin to worry. He told me that he was not in the position to offer me a full-time position at the time. At this point my brain sorta panicked. I'm not entitled enough to think that a position is owed to me, but at the time I was really hoping to leave with an offer. He DID tell me, though, that I should contact him in the Spring to see if he has any openings in his group.

At first I thought this was an ok result. I just had to talk to him come springtime. But as all of my intern friends began to receive full-time job offers from the same company, I started to worry. Even my girlfriend at the time got a job offer from her company. And now as I see that my peers that have had internships are receiving full time offers from their respective companies I'm starting to think that my boss was letting me down easy. In an email (the topic of which is hard to explain) he mentioned that he had a position open that was about to be filled. I'm assuming that he was looking for someone with experience but, again, I can't be sure. It sucks because I really loved what I did in his group and the people there were really helpful as I learned the ropes.

Am I overthinking this? What do you think?

I'm planning on contacting him when the Spring semester starts to ask about jobs. If he meant spring as in the season, then I will ask him when it would be best to ask.

52,Should I Switch to Engineering if I Have No Interest in Mainstream Engineering Jobs?,1579842693,"

I‚Äôm currently a first-year physics major. Over time, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that my general interests lie in applied science rather than in pure theory, One area I‚Äôm particularly interested in is materials research in photovoltaics. I also greatly enjoyed my general chemistry class last semester. Looking at the chemical engineering curriculum, the theory behind the discipline sounds very interesting, and I would be able to get a concentration in a field relevant to my interests: materials.

The thing is, I have no interest in mainstream chemical engineering jobs. That is, anything that is directly involved the production of goods (process engineering, distillation, safety, maintenance, management, etc.). The jobs I am interested in would be in research and development at national laboratories, universities, and possibly at certain companies depending on the nature of the research. I am aware that this would require a Master‚Äôs at a minimum, or even a PhD.

That being said, would it make any sense for me to make the switch if I have no interest in most of the jobs related to the field? Or should I stick with physics instead and get a broader education before specializing in graduate school? Before you try to suggest anything outside those two options, please consider that my university does not have a minor in physics, does not have a minor in engineering, and does not have a department of material science.

I was told that its a good practice to give your boss (director in my case) a heads up about long vacations. I walked into my bosses‚Äô office and said

 ‚Äúhey *boss*, I am planning on taking a family trip in August to Europe which will be 10 consecutive PTO days. Would you approve the 2 week request since I would like to buy tickets now at their cheapest?‚Äù

My boss says ‚ÄúIf you took two weeks i would have to deny it because two weeks is too much and you would putting too much workload on your other co-workers. I mean your a project engineer and not a Project manager yet and they don‚Äôt ever get 2 weeks. Having someone gone for that long would delay the project schedule making their lives harder. It is an unspoken rule in constructing management to only take a week.‚Äù

I then said ‚Äúalright thank you, I understand is there anyway i can get 7‚Äù

He said ‚Äú thats a stretch, why do you even want to go to Europe anyway? I would understand if you needed to take family leave or go on a honeymoon... i mean you not being here wont make the company go out if business‚Äù he then starts telling me stories of how he took company absence to go on a 5 week vacation to brazil when he was my age.

At which point (i wanted to lose my shit) I just got up thanked him for his time and went back to my desk and went back to work. I wanted to yell at him because I feel its hypocritical to say I am not critical to the project but then tell me not to go because i would be needed. It also doesn‚Äôt help how he gloated about being able to travel at my age which is my dream. Keep in mind this my first year in my career and fresh out of college. 

Do you guys think he trying to convince me (which is a huge red flag) in not taking all my PTO at once because I am so naive and unexperienced? How would you phrase it to your boss to take your two weeks. I work 60 hour work weeks and go the extra mile by staying late and balancing 5 active projects for this company but feel betrayed that i cannot have some time to myself all at once.

69,How do you calculate the holding strength of a rigid ball detent?,1579822884,"So the reason for this question is that my car has a trailer hitch receiver on it that's removable. The only thing holding it on is a two ball detents, but instead of a traditional spring holding the ball out there's something rigid that drops down in place behind it once the receiver is in place. [Here's a video of it in action](https://youtu.be/Rw-GPJ7I5d0?t=231), you can see there's an upper ball on there which is actually acting as the switch to drop whatever mechanism down into the locked position so that the ball on bottom (and the one on the reverse side) are held rigidly. The tow rating is 5,000 lbs with a 500 lb tongue weight which obviously has to (at times) hold considerably more as you go over hills or rough and bouncy terrain.

So I suppose my main question is, how would one figure out how much load something like this is good for? I imaging the downward weight is just pinning the steel ball between the two parts so you'd just have to figure out how much force it would take to crush the ball, but I have no idea.

70,My company has been paused for a long time.

I‚Äôve been here for several months, but I haven‚Äôt been able to do any significant engineering work because of the company‚Äôs funding issues. The entire product development cycle has been paused due to lack of money. Software licenses for CAD and other tools haven‚Äôt been renewed, parts sellers haven‚Äôt been paid, and test labs have stopped working with us. Management has been searching for new investors for a long time but still have no leads. They don‚Äôt answer questions about financial runway, saying that it‚Äôs too complex to be explained in terms of months, but only say that our salaries are confirmed for a ‚Äúvery long time.‚Äù

I‚Äôve repeatedly brought up how I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been learning anything with my manager, and he‚Äôs always said that once funding is secured and engineering work is restarted, then I will be able to work on engaging projects. I spend most of my time just combing through whatever files I can find and try to learn from them.

I‚Äôm starting to get a little tired of waiting for funding, and there‚Äôs a steady stream of engineers quitting. My manager has not so subtly urged me to stay with the company because he would greatly need my help with projects: but only when the company secures funding and restarts development.

What can I do to salvage this experience? Should I tough it out and wait another few months to see if funding succeeds?

75,"[Mechanical] Advice on process quality: flow chart, PFMEA, control plan",1579816999,"We have a contract order with a customer who is requiring that we submit process quality documents (process flow, process FMEA, process control plan). Our quality function is... immature... and we don't currently implement such formal process quality controls. It's assumed that we will not be actually doing SPC but our vendor might. I am putting together this process quality implementation for this contract; hoping that someone can help me out with a few questions...


The actual process is simpler than most processes I've seen in examples. I work with industrial sensors. We are not doing manufacturing so much as assembling COTS items and calibrating them. The general idea is that we have an incoming inspection on COTS parts, they get stored in inventory and retrieved at a later date, they get screwed together, they get put onto a fixture and attached to a test instrument, we move some stuff around, we take some data, and we pack/ship. The vendor has provided a fairly informal SOW that has a few requirements such as: product must be clean and free of damage, we must implement ESD controls, measurement 'X' has to be &gt; 'Y'... 

I have gotten a directive from my management to keep things as simple as possible: I have seen process flows as detailed as ""retrieve washers from bin; retrieve fasteners from bin; assemble 4 fasteners with washers"" but my direction is to stay at the scope of ""fasten piece A to piece B"". I actually prefer the more detailed method as it is less ambiguous and captures the spirit of the quality activity more. So I'm having trouble feeling out what I can leave out of this scope and what should stay in.


* Should I include process steps upstream of actual production (eg, inventory storage/retrieval, incoming inspection)?

* I assume I should identify anything from the SOW that is clearly a requirement as a key product characteristic? Can I omit process KCs that MAY affect the product KC if the process KC is not identified as a requirement?

* Many PFMEA formats include as columns ""step #"", ""step requirement"", ""potential failure mode"" etc... For some steps (""fasten piece A to B"") there is not a KC identified but there is clearly a potential failure mode. Should I leave ""step requirement"" blank? Can I get away with omitting that failure mode altogether (it does not affect a KC)? Obviously it is more earnest to NOT omit...
* What is the difference between ""preventive control"" and ""recommended action""?
* Should i identify ""handling damage"" as a failure mode? We will bin components in transit during storage/retrieval, but of course handling damage is possible at any step.
* Why do I usually see ""control method"" in the process flow chart? This seems redundant to the FMEA and control plan?
* Is there necessarily a 1:1 relationship between ROWS of each document? EG, do I necessarily need to include EVERY item from each document on the other documents? Should there be some omission?

So basically, I just want to make sure that if I get this job, then it'll be a good choice to build my career.

So I moved to France to attend a high ranked engineering school (top 15here) and last year I graduated with a Master's degree in Energy Systems and associated Market.  I had only few months to find a job or go back and it felt really weird being treated that way during the interviews,  but I kept trying and accepted an offer from a company that wasn't really clear about what I am going to do ; they told me it's gonna be PLC programming for a nuclear plant, and I said yeah why not (it was recruitment on profile) but now I regret it all.  

 What I do is not an engineering job at all, even though the title of an engineer.  I don't use my brain at all. I have inputs, they ask me to edit a logic that exists or change the value of a threshold. This is the role of my company in this project, to do the manual modification that nobody wants to do, it's like an office monkey job or whatever and it didn't reflect all the hard work  I've put in the last 5 years (I've had a very good gpa but they don't care much about it here...).

  
I accepted the offer only to stay here, my country is so courrupted but after I saw the work tasks, environment, how other companies look at us.. I started to have interviews and got an offer from our client but the immigration service told them I should stick with my actual company for 2 years before any change. I think this is just unfair. I honestly have no reason to be happy about my job.  I am only paid around 2000‚Ç¨ in this big city, but I kept giving my best everyday and I was the one with the highest mark (we've got a rating system), and while having my annual meeting I asked my manager for a raise but he told me I should wait, I mean I am paid below the average income and they get 500‚Ç¨/day for my services. what the hell is the wrong with these people.

The problem in all this is that I should stay one more year with them. And it hurts to see people with no education earn way more than me, while I am stick with them.

7,Thinking of abandoning engineering / hate working at a desk.,1579787476,"Throwaway because i dont want this associated with my main.

I am a Mechanical/Plumbing EIT working in the MEP field. Basically, I hang out at a computer and design HVAC and plumbing for commercial buildings while fielding emails and phone calls. 90% of my weeks are spent 40 hours at my desk and in my chair. Lately, Ive been feeling like a caged animal.

The conclusion Ive been coming to lately is that I am not compatible with working at a desk for that long. The best days of my job are when i get to go out in the field and check out and document a building. Last friday my boss and I went to troubleshoot a building and it was fantastic to tinker and try things and get to the bottom of a physical problem. The worst days of my job are days like today where I come in and dont have a god damn thing that needs done but im still stuck to my desk because i dont have the PTO to cover me stepping out for the day.

Lets consider the pros and cons:

Pros:

- The money is very good for my age and job title.

- I already have 2.5 years experience here and consider myself very competent at my job. I do get some satisfaction from crushing problems with my brain.

- I work about a 5 minute drive from my house and get to hang out with my dog during lunch breaks. Not my forever house, just the one im renting right now.

- I can do this same job almost anywhere in the world if I have to.

- The people I work with are all great. I legitamately have nothing bad to say about anyone here. The company is also great to its employees.

- Good health insurance (that i havent used yet) and decent 401k matching.

Cons:

- I am losing my mind working at a desk all week. Especially on the occasions where i dont have things to do.

- Being completely inactive during work hours means I either have to starve myself to not gain weight or workout every day. I stay active during the weekends including regular trips to the gym, but its not enough. Especially since cooking delicious food and home brewing beer are two of my favorite hobbies.

- I swear to god I go whole weeks without my body ever registering that I even woke up. Sometimes my brain is so tortured that i get to Friday and cant remember 1 single thing that happened during the week.

So what do I do? Does it ever get better? Also worth mentioning that i have no debts anymore (finished student loans last month). I would love if I could get into brewing or building computers or some other kind of partially physically demanding but also indoors. Even if it meant a huge pay cut for now would not be a big deal because my ultimate life goal is starting a business doing something I love, which at this point is not engineering.

My academic and industry advisors during my time as a grad student were happy to be a reference. So that's two good references.

My old boss at my first job after undergrad provided me with a pretty bland letter of reference after I left. When I was applying to my current position I reached out to him to see if he would be a reference and he just said ""I recommend you use the letter of reference provided to you"". That was 5 years ago. I emailed him again recently and I've got no response after 3 days now...this is after he had no issue being a reference for my professional engineering licence a couple months ago.

He's kind of a petty guy and I doubt he'll do this...it was a very small company and he took it personal when I left. I provided my prospective employer the letter and they asked if they could contact him...

I don't have any other option but to say that he would prefer not to be contacted and leave it at that. Hopefully that doesn't look bad.

However, I could offer another reference as a trade off. I'm fairly certain I could get a project manager from one of my current employer's customers. We are from different coasts of the US, but we've met in person probably 5 times and have good rapport. I don't deal with him on a daily basis, but when technical things come up we get along well. The project we are working on together isn't going extremely well, but I know he understands it's not my fault - I do my part well (or so I feel based on our communication). It might be a bit convoluted to provide a reference that way, but it's an option. I also feel it might be unprofessional in some way to basically tell a customer that I'm looking to jump ship.

25,"Dream job is turning into a nightmare, and not sure if continue for the experience or look for something else",1579742125,"Hi everyone, I'm a structural engineer-in-training in a medium size multi- discipline firm, with a small structural team. I've been working with the company for almost 2 years now right out of college and it has been a great experience as we do all sorts of projects. I am the youngest, less experienced and the only one in the team that is not licensed yet, regardless, i get to participate heavily in a lot of the projects. When i started, the job and the company seemed everything i have ever dreamed off, and my coworkers are extremely nice people that in a personal level i have no issues with. The issue started to come out as i noticed that some of the projects were always overbudget, management-wise it has been very messy. Everything gets filtered through my boss and the poor guy is already busy as is, and he tries to cover ground everywhere. In my short experience with project management, delegating is very important and more important is the flow of information. I also saw that most of my team (exception of a few) works from 8am till about 8 or 9pm. My boss can be in the office even past those hours. I've began to think about moving as this is not the type of work environment I want to be, seems as overwork is something normal. We do not get compensated for over time, and our bonuses are shit and are not considered based on the work we do, but on the overall performance of the team, which if we are overbudget in a lot of projects, we get the boot! The company says that we do not have money, but we keep seeing that the company keeps adquiring smaller companies around the country, none of them are engineering only architect firms. Our bonuses are tiny, and our typical raise is about 2% of our salary per year. I've also noticed that a lot of people leave after 1 or 2 years of working, there's new people coming in and out. Every time I have deadlines, I'm always ramping last minute because my boss has finally freed time to talk about the project and orient me. Now, i know many of you are probably saying ""your boss shouldn't be holding you hand"" and i PERFECTLY understand that and know that him holding my hand will not let me learn or make mistakes that will teach me a lesson. My boss micromanages everyone heavily and is over our shoulders all the time making sure we do ""not spend so much time on the project and get it done right the first time"" to avoid ‚Äúoverspending the budget‚Äù. We still overspend because of all these other issues and we still do not learn from the mistake. Now, I have been taking matters into my own hands and I began to be proactive and take the lead in the projects I get assigned and try to do things on my own, but my boss holds me down and buts me out until he figures out or has me do these ‚Äúwork sessions‚Äù where he basically designs the project for me. Not everything is bad, as I can take off a day or two and make up the hours during the week without burning my PTO, but not sure this outweighs the rest of the discussed points.

I know this sounds more of a rant than anything but I wanted to see if anyone has had similar issues and what did you ultimately do. Is this pretty standard work environment for structural firms? I have talked to a few other friends who are in the same industry and they do get paid overtime and they are left to do the design and later have a meeting with their supervisor to look at the design and walk-through the calculations behind the design, they receive feedback and based on it, either redesign, make corrections or wrap up to send out.

Lately I've seen a lot of arguments by gun people that a firing pin, which is a long metal cylinder often with a small point, that strikes the primer of a cartridge to shoot the bullety part, can become crystallized if it is fired without a primer and cartridge in there.

The argument goes that because the primer is soft resistance and crushes under the force of the firing pin, the firing pin's metallic structure doesnt change. But there are either fins or a round section that surrounds the firing pin to retain it in the bolt of a gun, which prevents it from forward movement past full release. This often is also coinciding with a spring that goes between the firing pin fins or cylinder and touches the inside of the bolt near where the cartridge would sit.

In essence, there is a spring that retains it in most instance.",AskEngineers,False,Dontdoabandonedrealm,/r/AskEngineers/comments/eskog1/people_seem_to_think_that_tripping_the_trigger/

Unfortunately after 4 years there, my contract eventually ran out so I'm now currently looking for a new role.

Due to the specialist nature of my job at Ford, it's seemingly impossible to find a similar job at other automotive/engineering/manufacturing companies.

I've asking around in my university and searching online but cant find any advice for my problem and my advisor will only repeat the same thing: 

I did 1 year of Cell Biology and Neuroscience and switched last year to Computer and Communication Engineering. ( long story short, I didn't know that this was my calling until I failed my last semester in biology). In order to earn a minor in Biology I have to repeat 2 hard classes ( I know that hard is relative, these 2 classes are microbiology and biochemistry). To be honest I really want a minor in psychology ( or at least to take some classes) but my advisor is against it and tells me that a minor in Biology as a Computer and Communication Engineer is really helpful and will open me a lot of doors meanwhile a minor in Psychology is useless. I cannot stand to read a word of Biology and don't really believe her. i'm willing to sacrifice the psychology classes If it turns out to be true.

68,Engineering Work - Inspiring or Monotonous?,1579681991,"So I'm on the final year of my mechanical engineering studies after completing a BSc in Mathematics. Whilst pondering on whether I should continue further study for interest, I figured it would be a good idea to pick up more internships in my free time.

Currently, I'm completing an internship at a construction project in the plumbing mechanical section. However, most of the work I have been assigned has been in areas such as tendering, handling documents, BQ and cost calculations . Most technical thing I got to do was calculate pump flow rates, diameters and design pipe routing networks for some floors. Apart from that, I'm starting to find much of the work quite tedious and formulaic. I've tried to pass the time by looking at other unrelated content, flicking through documents just to get a feel of the company. 

To the community here, is the majority of engineering work monotonous like this? Also what sector do you work in? I originally went into engineering because I enjoyed math and was academically excelling in all my STEM subjects. It seemed like an area where I could apply all the concepts that I enjoyed learning. I still enjoy that immensely, and to be perfectly honest, can't wait to finish the internship and get back to studying in uni. 

Granted this is my first industrial engineering work experience, I wanted to see what you guys experience when it really gets into the work? I've done other internships before in engineering, but those were much more enjoyable and engaging (did the mathematical modelling for rock cutting and fracturing). The work here seems to mostly be revolved around SOP, reading charts and getting approval for documents. I asked the senior engineers what they did, and their response was mostly the same just more complex and more management.

If I had to do this without any advice I would make a sub-bracket by drilling a few holes through some steel plate and putting countersunk bolts through in a pattern for mounting the bracket. I'd finish the part off by sanding the wall side flat and cleaning it.

I would grind and then sand the concrete wall down to something with a surface approximating flat, clean it and then paint the concrete with a bonding primer (not sure which type would be best). Finally I would bond the sub-bracket to the wall with a filled epoxy.

Using some sort of cone-like pulley also called CVT's which are kinda new in current cars. They let you avoid the shifting of gear changes making it ""sweep"" the drive ratios to drive at right speed while allowing engine to turn at max efficiency.

Some might say I should prove myself to get bigger responsibilities but I don't think that's the issue. I took some initiative at work and carried the project to a better level and this drew my managers attention but still my responsibilities are highly limited.

22,Job hunting while employed: I feel like the only job I can get is my current one,1579614460,"I'm a mid-career engineer with 13 years experience.  I've been with my current company for 8 years (well-known and respected F500), progressively moved up with promotions every 1-2 years, and now hold a role as a Manager overseeing an engineering team.  At work, I've won several awards, been in two nomination-based leadership development programs, and chair our LGBTQ employee resource group.  Nothing is written in stone these days, but my management sees a long career path for me.

All of that is great, except for one factor: I'm getting married soon.  My job is in a more rural area.  My fianc√©'s works in a niche healthcare field, and his job is near a large city.  Currently we split the difference: We live in a suburb halfway between our jobs, and both have a one hour commute in opposite directions.  I would like to find a job closer to my finance's so we can move and shorten our commutes.  Given the size my fianc√©'s field, him finding a job near my work is unlikely.

We always hear it's easier to find a job while employed.  And as a hiring manager, I'm frequently told that in this tight labor market, it's a job-seeker's market for mid-career leadership positions.  So, it's been a bit frustrating that in the past 6 months of my search, I've had very few applications result in interviews. Several times I've applied to jobs aligned with my current one, only to be shortly declined.  I've applied to roughly 25 jobs, and only a handful turned into interviews:
* Two were mutually a poor fit.
* On one, the hiring manager lost an email they asked me to send, and later missed a scheduled interview.  I let that one go.  Based on the misses, I had to assume the hiring manager was either disorganized, or just not that interested.
* Another I received positive feedback from the Director, but the position was put on hold due to budget.

All of this leaves me feeling like the only job I can get is the one I currently have.

I've had friends review my resume and they found no glaring issues.  My resume gets tailored for each application using keywords from the posting, and free of grammar errors.  I've also had ""career coaching"", and the only major feedback I received was I should try to come across as ""higher energy"" in person and let my personality come out more.  Since I'm not even getting to the interview stage, I don't think my personality is what's holding me back at this stage of the game.

Since I've missed on several jobs very close to what I do now, the best I can come up with is my resume is just not connecting with hiring managers.

The large well known fabrication company has sub 50% acceptance of delivered items but the mom and pop shop gives us 100% in spec parts on time they just can't handle the volume. 

I stated in a meeting that you either pay for quality now or 4x as much for it later. We are a defense contractor, but that doesn't mean our sourcing must match their procurement methods.

Some may flat out shoot this down. That's fine. But one contract with us would 5x their annual revenue and make them capable of precision machining that few on Earth can do. This will lead to more specialized, highly profitable business. In short, we will make you rich but you must do as we say. Work your asses off and if you do that we will work with you, invest in you, and ensure your longevity because your survival directly affects our business.

40,What's the difference between vertical and horizontal axis windmills?,1579574753,"What are the pros and cons of vertical/horizontal axis windmills?

Is one more efficient than the other at certain speeds? From my research it's unclear but it seems that vertical axis work better in lower speeds while horizontal axis work better in high speeds 

And does pitch angle only act as a component of the horizontal axis ones or is there a pitch and a yaw for the vertical axis windmills?

I also have a couple of general questions for windmills if you wouldn't mind answering

Also what is the pitch angle of a blade, angle of attack, yaw and yaw correction?

What is the link between torque and rotation speed and how does one effect the other.

How does the number of blades affects the torque? (More blades then you need more torque to start up?) What's the link between torque and mass?( I know it's a stupid question but I had a poor break and I kinda for this stuff, I'd really appreciate the help, and yes I am stupid)

Is solidity the ratio between the are of the blades and the total area the blades turn in and cover? Since this affects torque and speed, is it best to keep this in solidarity with the number of blades or is there a way to maximize area and number of blades to extract the most power?

49,Should I leave for an offer at a competitor company?,1579562930,"Hello all-

I have been working at my current company for about 1 year as an application engineer in the automation industry. This is my second full-time gig, and first in this particular industry.

During my 1 year tenure at my current company I went through a 4-ish month training program and was placed into an application engineer role-with a focus on a specific technology product category in the automation industry. Overall, I have been happy in my role and the company. There is ample opportunity to learn and grow and the culture encourages that. Co-workers are supportive and I have built a good sized network here. I have a executive mentor as well as another mentor within the company who I meet with and get advice from often. Only some minor issues with the company so far...with HR-there have been instances of moving targets as far as pay raises. Some co-workers have been moved around as well for no apparent reason as well-so sure it's not perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently been approached by a competitor about an opening pertaining to the automation technology i'm focusing on. The competitor is the world leader for this technology...everyone in the industry knows their name. This role is for a sales engineer position. This role is still fairly technical, but would ultimately be a more sales-oriented role versus my current role which is just helping out the sales team.

**Pros to moving to competitor role:**

* Pay. My salary would be roughly the same, but instead of having 10% bonus based on regional performance, my total earnings would be 1.5x or &gt;2x what I am currently making depending on performance.
* Company placement &amp; recognition. This is the world leader as far as technology and market share goes for the tech that i'm focusing in. 
* Much faster growing company
* Company based in US versus based abroad.
* Region is actually smaller, so the travel may be more frequent, but distances are smaller.

**Cons to moving to competitor role:**

* I would think it would FOR SURE burn bridges with everyone in my current company. After they trained me up on their product line/technology, me leaving after a year.
* My company has a strange no return policy-where if you leave to a competitor, then you are not allowed to return
* No more network/mentors at this company-something I worked hard to build up over the past year
* The general resetting of vacation days/other benefits
* They tout a 'work hard play hard' environment, which may be a double edge sword
* Walking away from engineering career path (possibly?)-after sales comes more sales-from what I understand

My current job is/was a 9am start, but my boss' boss' boss' boss has decided that everyone must come in at 8 now. I'll be looking for another job (and so might my boss), and looking for a 9am start.

The problem is, there's no real way to tell from job postings, or searching for info about the company online, what the normal/allowable start time is.

63,Fork truck capacity as load height and centers change,1579550854,"I have a fork truck spec'd for 4540 kg with a load height of 4.68 m and a load center of 0.61 m (10,000 lbs @ 184 in and 24 in).

Theoretically, this all seems like simple moment calculations but I really want to make sure I'm doing this right considering this lift could be dangerous if miscalculated.

I am going to add an attachment to the forks which moves the load center to 3.1 m. It also has a weight which I will take into account when doing the final calculations.

Using moment ratios, this should reduce the capacity at max height as follows:

    RatedLoadCenter / ActualLoadCenter * RatedCapacity = NewCapacity
    0.61 / 1.8 * 4540 = ~1539 kg

The attachment allows me to suspend the load from the forks. Rather than the load COG being the 4.68 m, it will be 2.65 m.

Applying the same math, the capacity increases:

    4.68 / 2.65 * 1539 = ~2717 kg

The piece that I need to lift is 2640 kg so that only gives a ~3% safety factor which is wayyyyy to low for this lift but is the math really this easy?

It is made of steel and is configured fairly like the drawing.  It has a minor amount of additional weight at the top compared to what is distributed throughout more evenly.

I am having a crane come in to lay it down on its side so that we can dismantle since there is constricted access to it that poses excessive risks when trying to dismantle while standing.  This is just a tower setting upon the ground.  No foundation or attachment to the earth.

No, I cannot just push it over.  It is on asphalt pavement and near other objects.

While the crane is a fine idea I cannot help but think there has to be other ways to do this.  I've thought of a million ideas from simplistic to advanced but none of them seems to set off the ""eureka bulb"", so to speak.  I thought I might see what the fine folks here come up with.

93,How do I achieve the success that I really want?,1579481737,"Hey fellow engineers,

Recently, I was looking at the [2020 salary survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ek4ki7/the_askengineers_q1_2020_salary_survey/) and I see these really high engineering salaries only after 5-8 years of experience and a BS degree. Specifically, some engineers have salaries of  $150,000 with a $90,000 yearly bonus or something similar.

I understand people advise to not worry about the money and concentrate on doing the work you love. I understand this and I'll make sure that it's work that I like. However, I also want to be as comfortable as possible and provide whatever my family needs in the future. Which includes setting my goals towards a fruitful salary.

I currently am working on my PhD in Electrical Engineering and my research is in the Device/Hardware security of embedded systems, FPGAs and ASICs. I also have experience in the defense industry.

I'm wondering what qualities should I focus on in order to achieve a comfortable salary? Should I stay in the defense sector? Work private or public sector? What career moves will help me achieve that goal? Managing a team? Becoming a contractor? Should I move to multiple companies to build up experience and gain salary?

I appreciate any advice I can get. I really want to nail down how best approach this and make the information available for others to read. I'm a student and have yet to start my career.

Which do you think makes for a better undergrad degree for someone interested in nanotech for grad school (mostly semiconductors, superconductors, and 2d-materials)?  My thoughts would be that chemical engineering might make me more rounded in the micro/nano world through combined Chemistry and the relevant Physics, while also making me confortable with nanofabrication process. While Electrical Engineering provides more in-depth physics and abstract math, the scope in nanotech are mostly in nanoelectronics, photonics, and quantum information. What do you guys have to say?

96,Is a Phd in engineering necessary/required to work for top tier Semiconductor companies in the US as an engineer?,1579478076,"I am currently a senior undergraduate electrical engineering and physics double major who plans to graduate in May, 2020. During my undergraduate career, I have been decently productive. I have worked on 2 different research groups/projects since my sophomore year with 1 project resulting in a publication where I am noted as second author, both of these projects are focused on semiconductor fab/physics. In addition, I have held an engineering internship at a decently sized semiconductor manufacturer for my entire senior year and the preceding summer. Through my research projects and internship, I feel I have a gained a strong knowledge of semiconductor physics and processing, at least for a student at the undergraduate level. GPA is only a 3.36, I had a rough freshman year, but had a high upward trend. 3.64 since start of sophomore year and 3.73 since start of junior year. 

As my graduation approaches, I am looking to acquire a position at one of the larger semiconductor manufacturing companies (Intel, Samsung, TI...) in yield enhancement/failure analysis/process engineering roles. I would really enjoy to gain experience working in a 300 mm facility, currently working in 200 mm at my internship.  I am noticing for most positions I am interested in, the jobs essentially require a PhD in either chem/electrical engineering, material sciences, or physics. 

Before working at my internship, I had deep interests in pursuing a PhD in either physics or electrical engineering to pursue a research career in microelectronics &amp; photonics. After a difficult decision, I decided that perhaps working in the semiconductor industry and pursuing a masters degree while working would be a more economical decision (student loans are not low). Not to mention, a 3.36 GPA isn't exactly high so I would unfortunately be a rough applicant. 

Now that I am conducting my job search, and noticing many of these high level companies require PhDs, I am nervous that perhaps to acquire these positions an advanced graduate degree is required? Some are in R&amp;D, but also manufacturing engineers require PhD at these companies. At my current employer, this is not the case. Many entry level engineers were hired with a BS and pursued a MS while working, some even pursued online degrees in EE or statistics. 

I guess my question is this, 

What is the best academic route for engineers after completing their BS if their goal is work for a top tier semiconductor company like an Intel, Texas Instruments or even LAM, Applied Materials, ASML...etc?. 

Perhaps there is no ""best route"" but maybe someone can include trends they have seen from working in the industry. Someone at my job suggested I work as a technician at Intel since I don't have a MS, but I feel this is slightly below my skill level.  

I truly do have interests in continuing my research and pursuing a PhD, but I really am confused on how much value it has in the semiconductor industry, which is the field I am attempting to branch into. Not sure if I should stay with my current company for 5 years and gain industry experience (and potentially MS) or spend those 5 years pursing a PhD? Which would open more doors at those top tier companies? Like I said, mainly looking for yield enhancement/failure analysis/process eng. roles. Finances completely aside, I would choose the PhD, I really enjoy doing research for the sake of doing research, but I am asking this on a job outlook perspective. If the PhD will open doors that I otherwise would not have access to with a MS and work experience, than I may reconsider a PhD.

99,How do I stop myself from using big words?,1579477067,"
It has come to my conclusion that many people I work with see me as
someone who ""shows off"" too much.

There is merit to this. I very much love teaching the new engineers
where I work how to do things and this comes off as obnoxious to many. I
am okay with this characterization.

The issue I currently have is that a coping mechanism I have for my
speech impediment has come back to bite me in the ass.

As silly as this may sound, when I was in early high school I came to
the conclusion that ""you can't not be able to think of a word for
something if you know a lot of words for something.""

This means that as I have gone up in the ranks of aerospace and
mechanical engineering, and as my vocabulary has grown more and more
specific, all of my first draft reports and documents I write need to be
functionally rewritten to have less specific and less exotic diction in
them.

do to help myself?",AskEngineers,False,bdazman,/r/AskEngineers/comments/er4f50/how_do_i_stop_myself_from_using_big_words/
