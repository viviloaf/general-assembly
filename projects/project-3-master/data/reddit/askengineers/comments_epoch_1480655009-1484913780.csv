I recently purchased a 'budget' laser engraver/cutter to tinker/play with and I want to squeeze as much capability out of it that I can. One value I would like to try and measure is the output power of the beam (advertised at 40W). A common suspicion is that these tubes are not actually putting out the power stated on the label. Laser power meters and beam profilers are prohibitively expensive for hobby/personal use, so I was wondering...
  
Can I, using known material properties (density, thermal conductivity, reflectivity, etc.) of a certain target (likely a metal plate) to measure temperature increase after firing the laser at it over some duration at it's max intensity, approximate the amount of energy hitting the target?
  
I assume that I will have to factor in an approximated amount of energy that would be reflected, as well as some thermal radiation... possibly the photo-electric effect?

Now let's get some stuff out of the way, I am aware of all the scams and false information out there regarding the topic.

I am only seeking an answer to the following questions directly, and trying to start a conversation about the following topics without deviating too far from the actual question at hand. Here are a few.

Assuming injectors (EFI) are turned off in the engine (say a small 4cyl engine) is it feasible to make the engine run soley on hydrogen alone and how much would it take? (not asking about an HHO system, just want opinions on the raw stats)

If Hydrogen has a lower density than gasoline vapors, if the combustion chamber was injected with Brown's gas, will the engine turn over, idle, and run?

Mythbusters opened a tank of hydrogen right onto a vehicle's carb and it did idle, does anyone know the facts and figures behind the volume it probably took to make this possible?

Should only hydrogen be injected, or should the stoichiometrically amount of oxygen be injected too? (I am concerned abou there being too much oxygen from the atmospheric air that the engine will also intake)

TLDR; can a 4 stroke engine run soley on browns gas? (would strongly advise reading the above questions)",AskEngineers,ricktheengineer5,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5p194h/questions_regarding_hydrogen_for_internal/

Context below...


&amp;nbsp;

So I've got a ride on mower (this [Rover Clipper](http://mowersbendigo.com.au/files/Ride%20on%20Mowers%20Page/rover.jpg) model), which has a smallish alternator that is used to maintain charge in the battery.

I've recently started to run the electric pump for a 120L spray pack (towed behind it in a small purpose-designed trailer) off the battery of this mower.  It seems that the combined draw of the ignition system and the new 12V (probably 2.6amp... so that's about 30w) electric pump, exceed what the alternator can provide.

I think if I use a full bridge rectifier, I should be able to double the average amount of power being supplied to the battery, and lessen and probably overcome the drain caused by the pump.

Please, tell me in advance... what I am going to break by implementing this great idea (and have to face up to my wife about...)?

I graduated this past May with a degree in Chemical Engineering. I did fairly well (3.3 GPA) while also holding multiple leadership positions in student organizations, two undergraduate research positions, and two co-op terms. 

When I decided on chemical engineering it was because I lacked direction in life and was going to become a police officer. My family told me to pursue an engineering degree because I had excelled in STEM courses up through high school and that I could always become a police officer if it didn't work out. I chose chemical engineering because it was rated the hardest undergraduate degree to achieve and I wanted to challenge myself.

I enjoyed my time but never had much of a passion for it. I think I had reasonable success given that I was not as interested in the material as most of my peers. 

After graduation I went through a slump with my ex girlfriend and not knowing what to do with my life. I took a job as a janitor to make ends meet while I tried to find what interested me. It has been 6 months since graduation and I am still unsure of what to do. I think I am an intelligent person and I can learn quickly on the fly but I just don't have the passion to pursue a position as an engineer. I feel that I will never be as capable as my peers who live and breathe engineering. I know I won't have the drive to pursue the 60+ hour work weeks on projects that I have no interest in. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on other career paths that would employ someone with the analytical skills of an engineer? I don't need much money in life I just want to make a living and have some savings. I realize being a janitor is not a reasonable career. I've spent weeks on job sites (monster / indeed / zip recruiter / glass door / university career center) but can't seem to find any non-engineering jobs that will hire me. Every company that has bothered to respond has said I am over qualified or in the wrong field. To be fair I do not really know what I am looking for I am just applying for the sake of finding a job. 

The irony of all of this is that at this point I can no longer become a police officer (at least in the city I live in) because I am overqualified.

Here is the top view of the structure http://imgur.com/d7fXFi7, the chevrons are 0.75mm thick and and the ribs are 4mm thick. This structure acts as a support for a skin that will be made out of a composite. The wing morphs in the spanwise directions so those chevrons need to be able to expand and contract. So far we have tried to 3D print the honeycomb using nylon but have had no luck. We also understand that the fatigue life of anything printed is extremely low so we are looking for alternative methods of manufacturing and materials.

52,The Only Advanced Process Control Engineer In The Company (Just Graduated) - No Experience,1484748873,"Hello guys,

Basically, this is my first time posting in reddit. If there are any mistakes, please do tell me.

My problem is this, I just graduated from my chemical process engineering degree. After doing an internship in a production site, I was then hired to be an APC engineer by a new chemical company. My internship was 70% programming (developed two softwares with vb.net and vba) while 30% of my time was spent in controlling processes. I guess that is why they hired me for APC.

I have no idea what is installed for me in this career path. I have only done basic process control involving PID tuning, linearization of production as well as implementing a feed forward design on one process. (I had huge help from an experienced engineer doing all of these)

Nobody in my new company knows anything about APC, and I feel like they are thinking as though as I am an expert in these domain. Which clearly, I am not. I love programming. I love process engineering. Is it enough for me to succeed?

I have spoken to one of my friends who is an APC engineer, but she is currently working faraway from me and she will not be able to help me. She told me that when she first started, there was already someone in her company guiding her throughout. And she feels that I am gonna have a tough time doing APC alone.

So, please, if there is any APC engineer out there, could you please provide me with some assistance on what I should know, what I should do, and what I should expect being a beginner as an APC engineer.

56,Help with mechanical assistance in a large costume,1484730826,"I’m looking for assistance with mechanical assistance in a lever design. We’re prop and costume makers, and we recently made [this]( https://scontent.fadl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14962765_587851134736325_5178701140790752497_n.jpg?oh=e4c265cc565b367dd0f68b5502e9ea48&amp;oe=590A6763) monstrosity. I’m currently looking at upgrading the arm design so that I have some level of mechanical assistance in controlling the arms, but I’m encountering some issues and I’d love some feedback and ideas.

Currently the arms run off of a [pantographic lever system that allow me to control the elbow] (http://i.imgur.com/JonfTvN.jpg), I will be adding a universal joint (pictured) into that system so that I will also be able to rotate the wrist from my ‘control surface’. I’m looking at using a spring to assist the bicep action. Would gas struts be a better? I’m extremely limited by space in this mechanism, as it is all internal to the arms. I’d love to make the load slightly easier on myself, as it is quite an awkward system to control (As my elbows essentially become shoulders). Is there something I’m missing, or a better way of doing this?

The shoulder is my largest problem (the arms are quite long, and moments are fun). I’m currently thinking of something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Ie1NHs5.jpg), however, this solution means that as I raise the arms the force supplied by the spring will be lowered, which is the opposite of what I need. I’m considering gas struts here as well (As far as I understand the force supplied in a gas strut is constant across its range?), but still maintaining degree’s of freedom in the shoulder is extremely important.

I understand my sketches are basic, and hard to discern. If what I’m saying isn’t clear enough I’m happy to expand on it. Whilst I can build things, I’m not an artist. I’d take a shot of the current frame but it is now disassembled for these upgrades.

59,Polling rate in automotive electronic driver aids and powertrain controls,1484722021,"Hello, I'm an avid gamer. I'n gaming, having devices with high clock speeds (CPU and GPU), high polling rates (mice) and high refresh rates (monitors) provides a smoother experience. 
low game framerate, high input lag and poor performance can make a game difficult to use and in some cases it can even make it not fun.

I am also an avid car enthusiast and I pay attention to a lot of details but since I don't work in the industry, it's kinda hard to get some questions answered.
I've noticed recently that a lot of electronic driver aids (traction control, electronic stability control, ABS) and powertrain controls like torque vectoring have very low polling rates. in reviews, brochures, websites and even commercials, they all tend to stick around checking on sensors 100 times per second.
I hadn't really thought about it much until this morning when I heard a radio commercial for Mazda which mentioned that their AWD systems monitor road conditions 200 times per second.
This got me thinking about the effects of higher polling, processing and output rates on automotive systems. would they be similar to the improvements I have felt with gaming? would a traction control system be better at maintaining a car under control if it polled its sensors and gave an output signal more than every 100 times per second?

61,What were you like before you knew you wanted to be an engineer?,1484720427,"I'm looking at majors and I think I could be a good engineer, but all the people who know they want to be engineers seem like child prodigies. They were always into Legos and puzzles and were in all the clubs for middle and high school. Going to special camps and taking really advanced math courses. Learning how to code arduinos and Lego mindstorms at 10. 

I would say if there were a ranking, 0 being completely uninterested in puzzles and problem solving, and 10 being an engineer from the age of 2, I would say I'm about a 6-7.

62,How can I course correct my career?,1484719355,"I graduated with an Ocean Engineering degree in 2014.  I worked for 2 years at a small engineering company before being laid off about 4 months ago. I think it was a mix of things that lead to me being laid off. I have not been able to really find any jobs in my field in Houston since that time.  There don't seem to be any job postings for positions relevant to my experience and I am afraid I will be running out of money in the next 6 months.  

As far as my experience with my previous job, I felt fairly anxious from the beginning.  From the interview, the company said they were fairly intense and had high expectations and that I would be working mainly in the marine department, but also picking up slack in the structural department.  For the first 9 months things went fairly well, but then it started falling apart.  They ran out of work in the marine department from that point on and I never really did anymore meaningful work like that again which was what I went to school for and was  a major disappointment for me.  They transitioned me to the structural department and I started getting up to speed there on a few small projects.  I enjoyed the freedom to create solutions myself, but I struggled with several aspects of the job, mainly that I was slow to produce results (mainly fab and test drawings, and load reports).  Then, I got some very tedious, time consuming, and low low low priority jobs.  I honestly think they were just biding time hoping more work would come, but it never did. I tried in earnest at first to complete them, but then they just gave me more of the same. 

From here, I got very depressed/frustrated with my work.  It felt meaningless, I could never get priority on drafting rescources, and my managers would check in on me about twice a week for a few minutes top because these jobs were so low priority. I tried to bring up my concerns, but it was a fight to get anyones attention for more than 5 minutes, and I was afraid to say I was wasting my time and being unproductive.  I would get stuck often but no one would take me seriously if I asked for help, the projects were conceptually simple but logistical nightmares, so their answers were dismissive in my opinion, they would just spitball some ideas that fix one problem but created 3 more and just seemed annoyed that I was wasting more of their time.  I won't lie, it got to me and I started dreading working on these projects. I started wasting time.  I was on my phone, or browsing the web a bit, but mostly it felt like I was just staring into space hoping that something would come along and help me get through these projects. I fell behind on deadlines, made a lot of mistakes on the work that was being completed that had to be reworked or fixed later, and it all culminated in a colossal mistake that embarrassed the company although it didn't cause damage or cost too much relatively.  

If i'm honest, I feel like they massively mismanaged my hiring and training process, and also that I didn't put in 100%.  All of my coworkers had masters in structural and more experience.  I would never have been hired into the role without the managers tossing me around.  There was one coworker who was exactly the same qualifications as me but a few years older, he got all of whatever work went into the marine department, and I ran support on the very limited occasions he needed it.  I could never convince anyone to make this split more fair on continue my training in that discipline to get me to the level where I could take any more of it on, I just got stuck with more structural work.  I did like many parts of my job, and I did not feel any of it was beneath me, I just felt that I wasn't suited for the structural work and that I wasn't particularly good with it.

I am at a loss as for what to do next.  I can't find a job, or even get interviews and I feel like its because my experience is this awkward hodgepodge of random things.  The oil and gas industry has been in a slump, so there arent many jobs out there anyway.  I feel like I have been working too long and that I am being passed over for entry level positions when I would be more than happy and willing to try a soft reset on my career.  I have a lot of doubt about whether my company was just a bad experience for me, because I had 1 coworker in particular who seemed to flourish in that environment and got all the marine work for himself, while I floundered.  Is it me? Was it legitimately a lack of work and just poor timing like they said in my exit interview? Am I cut out for this career, or should I try and find something else before I run out of money/time?  Is this experience normal? My biggest fear is that I get another job and that this is just standard practice, and I am not cut out for all of this.  

I guess I am just looking for reassurance, advice, other perspectives. Anything really.  I learned a lot from all this and I have been forced to really look inwards and evaluate what I need to fix, and I am willing to do it.  My family and friends have been a huge support, but getting fired really has brought up a lot of self-doubt about whether I can be a successful engineer.  I just remember being anxious from the beginning and having some success, but then it just started going wrong, and the anxiety buit and built and it became self destructive, and then I got fired, and now I just don't know how to put myself right.

I'm looking to calculate heat loss during that 45 seconds or so. Based on the ambient temperature of 5C right now. The lowest temp the pipe can go is 218C so I'm hoping to find a formula that I can use each day to ballpark how much time we have before the pipe will drop 22C.

It's a rental so I'd prefer shelving that stands alone rather than screws into the wall/ceiling.

Distance between end of the shelving I've already built and the opposite wall is just under 18' so I expect the span to be around 17.5' since the 2x4 vertical supports will take some of that space.  The beams to cross the span I planned to use two 2x4x10s and two 2x4x8s fastened into a 4x4x18  positioned so the joints are several feet apart from each half. Then use three of the beams so the shelf is 4' wide with one beam at each end of the width and one in the center. Cover the beams with 1/4"" OSB and then put our christmas decorations/etc. up there.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245353596_Low_NOx_and_Low_Smoke_Operation_of_a_Diesel_Engine_Using_Gasolinelike_Fuels

Hi everybody! 

I would like to know why there are no gasoline engines that run a diesel cycle, i.e. stratified compression ignition engines with regular gasoline fuel. Are there only big disadvantages or is it entirely impossible? 

It seems to me that compression ignition is generally possible because new HCCI engines do essentially the same with the additional difficulty that comes with timing the valves so that the air-fuel mix ignites exactly at TDC. 

I assume an engine like that would have significantly less power output but wouldn't it also have a higher theoretical efficiency due to increased compression ratio?

Is the fuel delivery system the main problem as higher pressure is needed to inject during a much shorter timeframe and gasoline is not as good a lubricant as diesel? 

Am I right to assume that emissions would be worse as combustion would occur at a higher temperature like it does in diesel engines?

Knock wouldn't be a problem as there is essentially no fuel in the cylinder during compression. It would only get injected at TDC when you want the pressure rise from ignition anyway, right? ",AskEngineers,harhurhel,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5oh9p7/what_are_the_reasons_against_running_gasoline_in/

A friend and I are planning a trip to Boston and where searching for a Hotel Online when we saw an add of a Pizza delivery Service in Boston. ""Pizza will be delivered within 20min"" We are from Switzerland witch is 6000km or 3728 miles away. In a kind of a joke I said: ""Let's order a Pizza there and see if they can make it within 20min."" And the discussion started.

**Is there is System to deliver a Pizza over 6000km in 20minutes?**
Let's assume two scenarios. **Scenario One:** The Pizza just have to arrive. It can be a mushy mass. It just have to arrive. Also ignore the damage at the target place. I just deliver it to my neighbour house.
**Scenario two:** The Pizza have to arrive intact and must be eatable. Also no damage to the target area.
Let's assume for both scenarios they don't have to prepare the Pizza. They can just take it out of the oven and send it.

Our best guess was a Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. After a little bit of research we found out it takes a ICBM 30min from the USA to Russia. For scenario one just crash it.

As a fellow designer I end up quite often figuring out various things on 'how to make this' or 'how to do this' through the work but this I'm a bit stuck on.

We had 2 projects and the supplier wasn't that reliable here so for future reference and understanding I want to know how this can be done and what tools could be prepped.

In one case we were setting up the cables on the facade. We had rings on each side, had to bring up the cable, pull it straight and hook it up to the rings/hooks in the facade. The challenge was to get those cables tight and straight since the LED lights hanging on the cables were a bit heavy. And 3 other cables had additional LED elements such as a big Xmas sleigh.
I can understand it may be impossible to get it perfectly straight but newer the less I would like to know how to improve it.
Rather hard to see but this was one set up. [facade lights](http://imgur.com/a/HV8Rm)

Another situation was where we set up metal cables indoors, from one metal railing to another. We prepped separate metal pipe with ring to which we attached the cable. but again, once we added all the decorations, the cable was sagging too much.

I came across few tools but was really confused if they could apply to our needs or even different ways on how to use them. And also a process of how to stretch and attach the cable to the points in situations like that.

20,Cold Chamber not holding temperature once you fire an engine up in it.,1484586580,"Because of EPA regulations most diesel engines need SCR systems now. Because of VW they need to work and test results need to be presented to EPA and CARB.

SCR systems basically spray Urea into exhaust gases  break down NOx gases exiting the engine. Urea freezes around -11 C compared to other engine fluids (Fuel, Coolant, oil) so it needs special testing for the cold to see if it can thaw out and begin spraying in a specific time.

We have a new US$2 million  Cold chamber for testing. It might be cheap compared to what other people might have but that's all we could afford. I know a lot of people will say just get a larger cooling unit. Getting budget approvals for those aren't easy.
Our Cold Chamber supplier said it would be able to hold temperature. If we cool it to -40C within 2 hrs the temp is up to -20C.

So the test is you have to thaw out Urea in 70 mins at no load low idle at the temperature you want to sell the engine/equipment rated to. The urea thaws from an engine coolant loop in the tank to heat it up.

Example: We want to sell equipment rated to -40C for oil fields and exploration. The equipment has to be soaked at -40 C for a while. Then we have to run the equipment as stock with no blankets or aids so heat isn't contained in the engine to be transferred to the engine coolant and thaw out the urea. We can't keep the radiator outside the chamber since the coolant will not lose as much heat to the cold -40 C air and will heat up the urea tank right away.

So the chamber is pretty large so we could put fork lifts and tractors in it for testing. The engine we have in there is pretty small  compared to the volume of the chamber. Like 90% of the chamber is air during engine runs.

One thought process I had was that Air doesn't have that high of a density or specific heat capacity so it's easy to heat up.
If I was to put in drums of water with a density 1000 times higher than air and and heat capacity 4000 times higher than air and cold soaked before running any tests the chamber wouldn't heat up as fast. I don't know if my logic is flawed that the water would absorb the heat.

If my logic is flawed what else can I try?

If not water is there cold gel packs or things I could use which are made for this particular application?

As a mechanical engineer graduate (2015) currently going back into the job market (worked for a year as a CAD designer), what important skills do employers look at?
Apart from the basic CAD skills (Solidworks), and some knowledge on industry standards like ASME Y14.5 and GD&amp;T, what can a young engineer learn to really set himself apart from the competition. The skills i described above are going to be in almost any mech. student who has done his bachelors. I am currently looking at Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing certification along with Solidworks CSWP certification as a helpful too to enhance my resume.
Are there any other skills or tools that can help in getting an employers attention?

P.S. - Want to get into manufacturing and designing, looking at analysis software such as ANSYS, etc.
Ansys offers an 'Online Master's Degree in Numerical Simulation in Engineering' in collaboration with The Technical University of Madrid [UPM](http://www.ansys.com/products/academic/online-masters-degree) . Is this course going to be helpful? I am not merely doing it for adding 'skills' on my resume, it is also to actually learn and understand. I often read how many engineers don't really know FEA properly and only a specialized course and experience helps. Undergraduate is garbage tbh.

I have an idea that I would like to develop, and in order to build a prototype I need some profile cuts out of steel. The steel would be mild, with most pieces being 1/8"" thick and a few others being 1/4"" thick. Most of the pieces are significantly smaller than a square foot, and all told all the pieces could probably fit into a four or five foot square piece of plate steel.

I believe CNC plasma cutting is likely the best option as far as affordability and capability go, but I had a few reservations. What precision is easily attainable on those thicknesses of steel by plasma cutting, and how perpendicular would the sides be? If the tolerances are reasonable, I would like to have a shop/manufacturer make a set of pieces for me, but I am also unsure as to what kind of businesses would be willing to do such a small batch without breaking the bank.

I have completed CAD models of all parts and can convert them into .dxf easily enough. I appreciate any input/suggestions or recommendations for moving forward.

I'm a horse owner looking at purchasing a property. I came across one that I really liked, and its best feature was a long pasture that ran in a ""loop"" around the edge of the entire property with things like barn &amp; arenas in the center. The only issue with it was that the loop was ""interrupted"" by the driveway - essentially making it one long C instead of an O. 
Now, not that I'm dead set on buying this property and making this happen, but I got curious - could I create a ""bridge"" over the driveway that would allow the pasture to remain a continuous loop without constantly roping off the driveway with electric fencing? It would look similar to the wildlife overpasses on various highways here in the PNW, but wouldn't need to be nearly as high (our tallest trailer is 10'2"") or wide. There would be 20 horses on the property, ranging from 600 to 1800lbs each, and I think the ideal bridge would be around 20 feet wide. I wouldn't sow it with actual pasture grass, it'd probably be similar to the rest of the ""track"" around the property - all weather footing over a grid like HoofGrid or EcoGrid.

How does that sort of thing work? Is it essentially a giant pipe that we would ramp up dirt around? Or is there some serious structural stuff underneath? Have you ever seen a project like this done?

50,How voltage works with respect to conventional current vs electron flow?,1484517600,"I'm trying to understand how voltage, conventional current, and electron flow are related. 

Let's start with a battery. When connected to a circuit, a chemical reaction causes a build up of electrons in the negative end of the battery, which flow through the circuit to the positive end. Setting the negative end as ground, we can say the positive end has 9V for example. In this case the 9V is really ""attracting"" electrons. This makes sense, and of course using conventional current everything works out nicely. 

What I don't understand is using a DC power supply. If we connect the power supply to the same circuit and set it to output 9V, electrons should flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. Now let's remove the circuit, and set the voltage high enough to feel an electric shock, say 100V. My question is, if I were to grab a grounded metal object with one hand, which terminal would give me a shock if I touched it with my other hand and why?  If I were to touch the positive terminal, would the 100V ""attract"" electrons from my body and the ground, meaning electron flow is actually into the positive terminal? If I were to touch the negative terminal, if it were truly grounded I would feel nothing as there is no potential difference, correct? What if the negative terminal is actual +10V with respect to ground, would electrons flow from me into the terminal? What if the negative terminal is actually -10V, is this even possible, then would electrons flow from the terminal through me into the ground?

I'm soon to graduate with my Masters of Engineering Science (MESc) from a Canadian university, and have my Bachelors (BESc) from a Canadian university as well.

In Canada, an MESc (sometimes called MASc) is a two year research based masters. You take 4 courses but the bulk of your time is spent doing research. You write a thesis, and usually have a thesis defense.

This is in contrast to MEng, which is usually a 12 month course based program, also done after your BESc.

&gt;In situ vs ex situ activation Advantages in-situ
– Within control of producer (supplier should be invited to witness)
– Safer to handle in loading and precommissioning phase:
• Catalyst loading can be done within “normal” circumstances.
• Complete load of catalyst can be activated in one action (efficiency gain)
– If possible, combine existing infrastructure to execute activation.
– See Process Flow Diagram (PFD)

70,Senior Project -HVAC Load Calcs / Equipment Selection,1484418582,"As the title states I am working on a college-level senior design project with 3 other engineering students in which we are designing a hypothetical HVAC system for a local fire station. We have been working on this project for roughly 4 months and are to the point of needing to select equipment.

I posted a question on AskEngineers at the beginning of project here:

&amp;nbsp;

[Project description and initial questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/558fgv/hvac_senior_design_project_initial_system/)

&amp;nbsp;

In which I received a ton of good information to get us going on this project. 

&amp;nbsp;

**So far we have:**

* researched systems that could be used
* Selected 3 systems to compare to an ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Baseline
* Created a building model using CarrierHAP 5.0
* Modeled the systems in CarrierHAP 5.0
* Contacted a local sales rep to help price equipment

&amp;nbsp;

**Deliverables we need to complete:**

* Block and Space loads for the building
* Equipment first costs and operating costs
* Compare systems using the ELCCA (energy life cycle cost analysis) method to select one system to proceed with
* Start designing the system in Revit, fill in all the details/minor equipment, etc.
* Turn in complete drawing package

&amp;nbsp;

**Further Description / Wall of Text:**
Currently I am having a hard time determining what information I need to actually size and select equipment, but I feel I should have everything I need from our energy model in CarrierHAP. Our project adviser asked for ""Space loads and block loads"" as part of our deliverables for this project, and to go through an Energy Life Cycle Cost Analysis to formally compare the systems we are looking at. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was able to get numbers for the space loads by summing the peak loads of each space, but I am not entirely sure what to do for the block loads. I know a block load is the peak load that the building experiences (more of a realistic peak load) but I don't see an option for that in CarrierHAP. Should I create a space that is the entire building and find the peak space load of that ""space""? Also, should equipment and lighting loads be taken into account for block and space loads? Or just the loads generated from solar/people/walls/roofs/floors, etc? (basically the building envelope)

&amp;nbsp;

I am also not 100% confident on our CarrierHAP model in terms of the system design and plants for the systems. There are many parameters that required entries that I didn't feel we had the information for. Most of the time our adviser would tell us to look through ASHRAE 62.1 or 90.1 / our states energy code to find the information. Sometimes I was successful, other times not. I am able to generate a ton of different reports in CarrierHAP if anyone is interested in seeing the numbers, but I feel if we have a solid model we should be able to use the information (CFMs per space, thermal loads, etc) to size and price our equipment 
properly. 

&amp;nbsp;

As far as pricing equipment goes, I was thinking of trying to size/price the large system components (such as AH, boilers, chillers, VAV units, etc) only in order to compare the systems, and leaving the smaller equipment to after we have narrowed down to one system. Would this be a good idea? 

&amp;nbsp;

Overall I am open to any suggestions and advice on this project, it has definitely been more of a challenge than we were anticipating and there is such a huge amount of knowledge required to design an HVAC system. I am really interested in HVAC design though, and hope to work in this field after graduating next semester. Sorry for rambling on, please feel free to ask clarifying questions!

&amp;nbsp;

Being the absolute idiot that I am, though, I have chosen to do my International Baccalaureate Extended Essay on a mathematical problem that involves finding the velocity profile of the fully developed flow of a ""river"" (velocity as dependent on x and z, if we take y to be the direction in which the water flows) by knowing its discharge rate, width and height (the ""river"" is just a rectangular channel), assuming that the inlet is veeeery far away from the section I am considering and knowing the friction factor for the ""bed"". I am considering the fluid to be incompressible, no heat transfer, uniform density and all the possible simplifications you could assume.

As I stated before, I do not know much about fluid dynamics. I am good at Math and all, but I still haven't gone to uni. What I can do, though, is using Wolfram Mathematica very well, so the complexity of whatever set of equations is necessary to solve this would not discourage me (as I can make Wolfram solve them).

I haven't been able to find, though, in a few weeks of research, any useful material online, nor been able to find on the books I am using to ""study"" anything particularly useful. I thought that my problem would be fairly ""standard"" (since I thought it would be incredibly ""schematic""), and expected to find a solution kind of fast (by fast I still mean days, but whatever).

1,Attempting to build a linear motor of sorts. A question about leveraging for lack of a better word.,1484272039,"A quick note, I'm more or less teaching myself electronic and mechanical engineering as a go, so there's a lot I don't know, a lot I'm learning as I work on new things, and a lot that I think I know but I'm not sure of.

Now, essentially I'm trying to build a linear, reciprocating motor of sorts capable of moving 4-10"" back and forth around 10-11 times per second, delivering a minimum force of 20lbs. This project is ideally for a working end result, but curiosity and building someting from scratch that will help me compare theory and results led me to stick with an idea I had for foregoing a rotary motor. I want to create my linear force from a stacked arrangement of electromagnets for an end product with a cylindrical form factor with the smallest diameter/length possible. Half of the magnets will be a stationary assembly mounted in the cylinder, the other half will be connected to each other in a separate assembly that slides on the same central axis as the stationary assembly. These two assemblies will be layered (Moving coil, stationary coil, moving coil, stationary coil, etc.). I don't think the rest of the details on the magnets are relevant, but I'd be happy to go into it if it's useful.

I'm relatively new to building electromagnets to specs, and I had considered directly coupling the drive rod to the moving magnet assembly. However, once I started trying to calculate my magnets, the first thing that jumped out was that (unless my conclusion from the formula was wrong) magnetic force drops exponentially, not linearly over distance. So please correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, this means that for the same size of magnet, I get more efficiency by keeping the distance between magnets smaller, and somehow magnify that distance traveled while reducing torque, right? So if I use an example of moving the rod the full 10"", have the magnets moving 2"" and generating 50lbs. Is my logic correct here?

If it is, does anyone have any advice for increasing the distance and reducing the torque in a way that minimally impacts the diameter of the tube, while being durable? My first thought was a rack and pinion using racks for the assembly and rod, with a dual diameter gear (sorry, I don't know the name, but a gear with a large diameter, and a smaller toothed diameter next to it on the same gear) to drive them at different rates.

4,"Is rapid pressurization/depressurization ""bad"" for pressure vessels?",1484260500,"I'm using a regular air compressor tank from Sears (with compressor removed) as an intermediate storage vessel in a system I'm using.

Currently we fill it from zero to 90 PSI in maybe 30 seconds, then rapidly vent the air in (far) less than a second.

The usage is intermittent, not continuous, but I'm wondering about the long term repercussions of such rapid depressurization. Will it fatigue my system quicker than normal pressurization and depressurization?

There's no risk of overpressure accidents as it's fed from a 100 PSI source, which the original compressor was rated to.

20,How much effort should I expect a structural engineer I hired to reconfigure a roof structure to put into assessing the existing roof structure and foundations?,1484201151,"When one hires an engineer to reconfigure a structure is it unreasonable to assume thats should include  assessing the existing structure and foundations? 

Our house was built close to 90 years ago and our gable roof's  design seemed a bit wonky  to us, with collar ties serving as ceiling joists, so we got a structural engineer to come out and look ($250) . He suggested it be restructured and we employed him to redesign (design cost $3000) so the roof is supported by a ridge beam (proper ceiling joists would have screwed up the interior). 

I don't have a lot of experience hiring engineers (or contractors for that matter) and don't really know what services to expect from what we paid him.  But in order to discuss costs of construction with contractors I had made a perhaps unwarranted assumption that what we paid him  would go towards him asessing the existing structure and foundations to include in the permitting plans. But he took very few measurements while he was here (I don't think he spent more than 5 minutes taking measurments) and didn't look at the foundations at all. He actually asked to verify the basic floor dimensions of the room the day before sending us the plans (I  ended up offering to do it for him to save him a trip), so I'm pretty sure his actual observations must have been pretty sparse. He pulled floor plans from the county (they were innaccurate in places not attached to the project area but that's a different story), but I suspect they don't have much information about the existing foundations as the foundations were built 90 years ago. I suspect all the stuff about ""existing foundations"" in the plans were purely conjecture, but given the wonky way the frame was built I think there is a decent chance the construction might be something unexpected. 

Would it be too much to ask him to come and take a cursory glance at the foundations and if necessary update the permitting plans accordingly? Are there any minimum professional duties I should be expecting of a licensed engineer I have contracted with?

Currently, I am very satisfied with the work that I do since I am learning many things from each project. However, the pay raises are minor and I got only a 2.5% base salary raise both years (excluding bonuses), despite my manager saying he is very satisfied with my performance.

Recently, I have received a job offer from a large electric utility, but I am conflicted about whether to take their offer. The new job pays about 15% more and is unionized, but it is in one of the largest cities in the country, which has a higher cost of living.

The pay however is not my main concern between the two jobs. My current salary is above average from a survey published by the engineering body governing us.

I feel that I will not learn as much at the new job compared to my current position at a consulting firm. My friends who work at utilities say most of the engineering work is contracted out, while they meddle with project management duties... I feel that as a young engineer, I should focus more on building my technical skills in my 20s, so that it is easier during mid career for me to either transition to a technical expert or move laterally toward the management side. With a ""cushy"" job at an electric utility (I am only reiterating from my friends. Hope I am not offending anyone...), I feel I will be lacking on the technical side.

My parents and friends both encourage me to take the job at the utility because of the job stability and the excellent pension plan. Coming from an immigrant background, I full understand their reasoning.

How do you more senior engineers feel about this? Should junior engineers focus more on building their technical skills, or take the job at an utility for now for the higher pay and benefits? I am scared that if I dislike the new job, it will be difficult to transfer out because the new position deals with a very niche part of the energy market.

However, in my spare time I was thinking about how to simplify the circuit (see attached gyazo link) and, much to my chagrin as it should've been easily done (I feel), I struggled with figuring it out. I asked my professor after class, but he wouldn't tell me anything, saying ""You don't need to do that for my question, and I haven't taught that material yet - so you can't do it"". My theory is that resistor 4 is short-circuited, as it is in parallel with the wire branching off to the left and, as the electric potential along the wire going to the left is 0 v, the voltage across the resistor is 0 v, meaning its shorted out and no current travels along that path. That would then leave resistors 1 and 2 in parallel, and that would then be in series with resistor 3. Is this right, or am I completely off base? Thanks for all the help in advance!

Basically for automatic gate systems that are made of metal would the opener system of the gate most likely to be set above or under ground? 

What are the minimum and maximum weight these systems can open/close for any type of gate that is metal? (rough estimate)

If for some reason a person added more weight onto their gate would it still open/close without fail? Between 0-100kg extra weight? 

How often do these gates just breakdown by their own accord? 

If a gate was attempted to be forced open by hand or anything else e.g. crowbar would the gate stop these attempts or would the force of the attempt break the motor of the gate making it then faulty and in need of repair?

29,[Mechanical] Comparing X-Y-Z Vibration Data Vs. Power Spectral Density Specification,1484179473,"I'm an engineer but not mechanical, so this is new to me and probably basic.

I have a vibration specification that gives breakpoint frequencies (Hz) and power spectral densities (g^2/Hz).

I was sent vibration data in the form of m/s^2 @ various frequencies.

Some google later...

According to this: http://www.vibrationresearch.com/university/random-rms-calculator/
I calculated the ""area"" (to use that site's term) of each frequency range, which should give me an answer in units of g^2.  (Taking the square root of the sums of the results should give me the RMSg, which agrees with what is stated in the specification, so I'm pretty confident in this step.)

Then I take the square root of the g^2 in each frequency range (gives me g for that frequency range) and multiply by 9.81 to give me m/s^2 for that frequency range.

I interpret this as the acceleration allowed in each frequency range.

Then I took my X-Y-Z data and found the combined vector.

Am I now able to compare my data (combined vector) with the allowed acceleration in each frequency range?

e.g. at 50 Hz, the combined vector is 10 m/s^2.  According to my spec, at 50 Hz, all my number crunching gives me 15 m/s^2.  Therefore, the data I received is OK.",AskEngineers,totalnewbie,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5nfvti/mechanical_comparing_xyz_vibration_data_vs_power/

46,What is the work environment like in RF/Communications?,1484142199,"I'm going into electrical engineering mainly out of interest in the above specializations. The issue is that I've never really known what the day-to-day routine of someone working these jobs is. I know most engineers, regardless of being mechanical, electrical, etc..., dwell in your typical office space in front of a computer. I always imagined that RF and Comms would be a little different from the norm, that I'd be able to find a job out in the middle of nowhere doing work in a remote facility that handles satellite communications or radio transmissions. 

What I'm starting to get worried about is that maybe I'm going into RF design and DSP with the wrong expectations, and that the jobs I'm interested in are mainly delegated to technologists and technicians. I think going above and beyond to learn the why as much as the how is what attracts me to engineering, but at the same time I loathe the office environment. Being stuck in places like Dallas or Kansas City with your standard office workplace and the accompanying politics just sounds awful. 

If I'm wrong about commercial RF/Comms/DSP, are any of the military private contractors any better? I always got a little jelly thinking of all the experienced techies that finished their enlistment swooping into private sector jobs with contractors like L3 or Lockheed in remote facilities.

47,Naval Architecture and Hull-Shape Optimization,1484139799,"Hello r/AskEngineers!

I'm a 3rd year mechanical engineering student and my robotics team is designing an ASV.  The problem is that my school doesn't offer any courses in naval architecture or marine engineering, or have an aerospace program.  What I'm getting at is that we all have very little experience with aerodynamics or hydrodynamics.  I picked up a book from our library on theoretical hydrodynamic analysis but damn if it isn't complicated.

So far, we've been trial-and-error testing our designs with SolidWorks' CFD simulations, trying to find the optimal design out of 12 or so potential sketches.  This is great for picking and choosing the most appropriate pieces of each sketch, however I feel as though we're really missing the engineering aspect of calculating optimal values.  Problem is, I'm struggling with that part.

We know that the ASV will have two hulls, and our max permitted dimensions are 3ft x 3ft x 6ft with a max weight of ~140lbs.  We're aiming for about half that for navigational reasons, as it will require a high degree of maneuverability.

I have some books on hull design but they are obviously focused on larger, transoceanic vessels and most go into great detail on things like bulbous bows which from what I gather are very impeding to small craft, so not very helpful.

I know this is a very broad question, and there is not one correct or complete answer, but how can I go about optimizing our designs without so much trial and error?  Are there any basic-to-intermediate concepts that you could pass on that would at least get me started in the right direction?

50,Tyre max load,1484132403,"Hi all,

I have two small tires which has a load rating as follows:
90/90-12 54J

I know 90 stands for tire width, the next 90 is for Aspect Ratio, Rim diameter is 12, 54 stands for the load rating, and J stands for the speed code which is 100 km/hr in this case.

On the tire itself it states max load of 212 kg and max speed at 100 km/hr at 250 kPa (cold).
My question is that is this max load at static, stationary conditions when the vehicle is at rest? If the vehicle is moving and turning left or right, wouldn't there be more 'load' on these tires?

For example, I am building a 3 wheeler trike as a DIY. These two tires are going to be my front wheels, and before I installed these, my weight distribution was 169 kg on the right wheel and 160 on the left wheel (stationary).
Is this max load figure of 212 kgs considering dynamic loading?

57,Quality of Life - Best Way to do On Call / Coverage,1484096389,"**tldr**: What is the best method do do coverage / support on long weekends or when the weekend engineer is on vacation.

Current situation: We have one day shift process engineer (7-4), one swing shift process engineer (3-12) and one weekend day shift process engineer that works Thur-Sun on 4 10's.  Whenever a long weekend comes up or the weekend engineer takes vacation someone has to provide engineering support.  The engineering manager also provides coverage some times.

We currently get the following: 

* We get a 5% annual salary premium for being on call.
* If we are on call (need to be able to show up at the plant within 1.5 hours) we get nothing.  If we don't get called in we do not get additional PTO.  
* If we get called in while on call we get 1/2 day PTO if under 4 hours or 1 day PTO if more than 4 hours.  
* On holidays we get double. 

Some suggestions for improving our coverage rotation were the following:
* Instead of being on call, just come in for the 2-4 days and then get those days as PTO.
* When you are on call you get a 1/2 of PTO regardless, even if you did not get called in.

59,Looking for a flow meter type of device for small amounts of epoxy,1484093233,"We have an application where we need to dispense a fairly exact amount of epoxy into a small enclosed space. We currently have some very tiny holes we can use to see the level within the cavity, but it's a massive pain to get exactly right.

I'm hoping to find some semi-disposable metered dispensing system. We use something like 5 mL of epoxy to fill this area, and we only do a handful at a time. The goal is to be repeatable and deterministic rather than ""fill it to the hole that you can't quite see through"".

Lots of production-level systems exist for semi-continuous dispensing, but with such a small quantity of epoxy and parts the setup/cleaning time for an industrial system is far too expensive.

We use the ratchet-gun style pumps with static mixer nozzles dispense the epoxy. I'd love to find some way to monitor the flow coming out of those with better precision than ""number of clicks on the handle"", like perhaps a peristaltic style ""pump"" that is actuated by the passing fluid rather than actually pumping the fluid itself. Then we could use a small hose to connect to the system, which could be discarded instead of cleaned every time.

Does something like this exist already?

We have already used some of the dispensing syringes with volume markers on the side, but the process itself is cumbersome- we dispense mixed epoxy into a syringe, then have to try to put the plunger back in and get the air out without trapping a bubble, which introduces a big bubble into the dispensing operation. If this could be done easier I'd love to hear a way.

61,How much pressure is required to press fit bolts into a steel oil pan?,1484086826,"tl;dr I've got a dealership trying to pull one over on me and I need to know if it's possible to over-torque a press fit bolt onto a component with a brass bushing while causing damage to the oil pan itself and not crushing the bushing.

_________________________________________________________



I purchased a new, genuine BMW oil pan from a dealership online. It comes with a 2 year factory warranty including labor. I had a local shop install it for me, but there was an issue with oil leaking from a bolt in the pan. I had it taken to the dealership so they could issue a warranty replacement.

The pan (bmw part # 11137539413) has a hole where an oil level sensor (bmw part#  12617607910) fits. There 3 bolts that surround the hole that are press fit into the steel pan that the oil level sensor fits over. It is then supposed to be torqued by 3 nuts to 10 N m onto said bolts. The level sensor itself has 3 brass bushings where the bolts go through.

The dealership is trying to say that the previous installer over-torqued the bolts to the point that it caused the oil pan to warp/become damaged. YET, somehow over-torquing these bolts did not cause the brass bushings to crush or become damaged. I'm calling BS! The bushing should be damaged significantly before the press fit components are broken loose or the steel pan is damaged.

Had a geek phase about rockets lately and was wondering why you did not use the exhaust from the rocket to directly drive the fule/oxidizer. So I drew up my own design and started looking up how to calculate the flow of such pumps. 

Seemed that there where so many upsides that it could not be ignored. But at the same time it looked like no one had made one. And off-course there would be many difficult issues with just calculating the pump flow with a extremely hot gas and extremely cold fluid. Etc etc.

So, google google and hours wasted I find this [patent](http://www.google.se/patents/US5551230) for this exact thing.
The patent is from 1994 and the pump design is much older.

Why are there no such rockets? 
Do they become inefficient at the temperatures/pressures?
Not possible to control flow?

So I'm basically educating myself about the whole thing at the moment, feel free to contribute your share of knowledge. :)

The thing that's always intrigued me however, has to do with Electromagnetic propulsion, and if it's even possible. I've read about it in books and how it's related to Extraterrestrial vehicular technologies, but I've always asked myself:

*""Is this technology far off? If not, do the authorities already have this technology?""*

I've been itching to create something along the lines of a machine or device that's capable of some form of efficient propulsion, yet I don't even know where to start. It'd just be such a marvelous thing to accomplish, creating such a device that's capable of levitation via diamagnetic means. ;D

I'd just like a few experienced users who are not only familiar with electronics, but also mechanics, to maybe give me a little more of an insight into the whole propulsion topic.

I just moved to the United States a couple months ago, got married and am here to stay. I'm 26 years old with a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from the Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria. The program was entirely in English just to make that clear. My education was sub par at best in my opinion, with no real focus on mechanical engineering, manufacturing or management. All of the above but nothing in depth. Right as I graduated the next day I got a job as an assistant to the Production Manager of a plant producing mainly croissants and other baked goods. It's a big company with as of this moment around 7 big factories around the world. The factory I worked in has 7 production lines with ~700 employees, mostly general workers. After a year at that position I got promoted to Chief of Shift with a significant raise although nothing compared to Western Europe/US. I was in charge of 25-30 people, 5 of them being machine operators and mechanics (with engineering degrees). I got two Blanchard Leadership trainings but worked a little more than a year until I had to leave in order to move here. I am going to get a Master's at University of Maryland - Baltimore county but won't start studying until spring 2018 because I need to get my GRE/TOEFL + time for admission. My questions are: Do you think I'll be able to get a decent job paying around $40k until I start studying? Do you think that it's better to get a Master's in mechanical engineering although I will struggle with the sciences or is it more reasonable to get an Engineering management degree?

50,Long Steep Driveway in Winter... Need out of the box ideas!,1483712396,"So I was inexperienced (dumb) when I bought my house. Didn't imagine the 300 foot, steep driveway was a big deal (grew up in the city where snow was ""taken care of"" so never dealt with it). No contractor is willing to handle our drive because:

a) it is 300 ft long

b) steep incline

c) slight curve at top with no protection down side of hill

d) those that said yes want $100 - $500 for one pass (dependent on snow fall)

Now year 12 in the house, my husband I are getting older and fatter and more prone to accidents.... slipping and sliding on icy hill (yes even with those yak tracks on our shoes). Not to mention the time my husband knocked himself out when he fell, and woke up when he heard two coyotes nearby laughing(?) . He says the coyotes were licking their lips as if they wanted to eat him, but I think he's being dramatic.

Anyway, we have a fancy snow blower. On a 3-4 INCH snow fall it takes about 45 minutes to clear driveway, then we take another 45 scraping it clean with shovels, then use about 15 pounds of salt. We've had 3-4 FOOT snowfalls... so you can imagine.
I've seen people around using 4x4 Quads with shovels, but no one is sure if it could handle the steepness of my driveway (down it might veer off into woods if icy; up the snow might be too heavy).

Quotes for a heated driveway were about $100,000.

So I'm begging your assistance. There must be something I can do.

My husband inevitably is away on business when the big snow storms hit. I have two kids, but they are still too little to do much in the way of helping.

55,Bracing to prevent buckling?,1483686941,"Hi

I am an engineer in the construction industry. We are a formwork company that designs and provide formwork for clients.

My question is regarding bracing of the heads and feet of the screw jack heads and feet under extended lengths.  If the heads and/or feet are extended more than 300mm, effective length (EL) becomes a problem and buckling will start to occur.

Now the way we brace the heads/feet are in a triangle of forces way where the top of a head/foot is braced to the bottom of the adjacent head/foot. See [pic 1](http://imgur.com/GXDlBCP) and [pic 2](http://imgur.com/oluQ2Ob).

Now I understand how triangle of forces work and why we do it, but it doesn't make 100% sense to me why we have to brace it this way to reduce the EL of the heads/feet. Why not just put a horizontal brace and reduce the EL by ~50% [like this](http://imgur.com/0pAlRp9)?

Can someone please give me a detailed and/or mathematical explanation as to why option 1 is better than option 2?

tl;dr:  Why do we reduce the reduce the effective length by bracing the feet like [this](http://imgur.com/GXDlBCP) and not [this](http://imgur.com/0pAlRp9)?

While I'm not a part of this Non-Profit they asked for help and I offered. 

So I'm helping set up a solution for doctors that go on medical mission trips and run MASH type hospital. 

The problem is that they have to be able to print out prescriptions for their patients (writing is time consuming and mistake prone). Some criteria to consider:


*  There are 5 doctors and each have iPhones. 
*  The less money the solution costs, the better
*  Since the NPO travels to different countries, there are different electricity constraints.
*  A Wi-Fi network can be set up
*  They have a Pi with Windows 10 IoT (more Pis can be purchased)
*  Security is not an issue
*  Can't count on internet only a local wi-fi network

The woman from the NPO is considering using Raspberry Pi and the USB Mini-Receipt Printer. Each doctor would have their own Raspberry Pi and Receipt printer. They fill out the prescription using a web-form I'd have to write, and it'd print to the Pi. 

I've never worked with a Pi. The .html file and .php script I'd have to write would have to be hosted on the Pi to process the prescription. The issue then is, how can I get the Pi to print out the prescription through an iPhone? If the form was turned into a .PDF could I somehow automatically print it if I saved it to a certain directory?


I was thinking maybe I could find a cheap AirPrint printer and get the phones to print straight to the AirPrint printer, but I'd still need a Pi to host the website. Plus the cheaper ones are slower and then ink gets expensive as well. 

If anyone could help me out, I'd appreciate it a lot.

I do not want to use any external set screws for this application as I want it to seem as one piece. I decided to place a key to stop it from rotating on the shaft and using either Gorilla Glue or red Loctite to hold it in place. I was thinking that if the Gorilla Glue expands, it may create a layer locking it into place and won't rotate even without the key. I also am considering press fitting it on with some red Loctite instead of using a key as that seems somewhat overkill. Cutting threads has occurred to me as well but I do not have the proper tooling for that.

I am very passionate about the aero industry, and don't want to throw away my opportunities as an engineer, hence I have been putting a lot of thought into joining the air force reserve in an aircrew position, such that I can work as an engineer, and still fulfill the desire of military service. 


The company I will be working for is a big defense contractor, and is very supportive of the military. However, most people in the situation of balancing military and a job, were already in the military when they got hired. The issue for me is the vast amount of time required for initial training. Despite a company legally being required to retain me, if I were 1-2 years into my career and said ""hey I need to leave for 9-12 months"", I can't imagine a manager or HR liking that at all. It would be so easy to claim budget cuts and fire me. The commitments once I'm done training are minor in the grand scheme. It's just the initial huge swath of training that worries me.


If you were a manager and an engineer came to you saying ""I want to join the reserves, but will need to be gone for a year to train"" what would you think? The company is officially very supportive, but would I become the most hated engineer in the group? Should I just put 1-2 years in (as to not burn bridges), quit and then go play airman, and then come back to engineering once I'm settled? Would taking 1-2 years off from engineering to pursue military service be seen negatively?


I'm leaning towards the latter option (quitting and focusing on training). 1-2 years of a career is nothing, and I don't like living with regrets.
Any insight is appreciated.

Welcome to the AskEngineers biquarterly thread to apply for contributor flair!

**Contributor flair** is both the [icon and text](https://i.imgur.com/ECzkrGp.png) next to a someone's username which indicates his or her engineering specialization that you may have seen while browsing AskEngineers. Flair with no icon does not necessarily indicate demonstrated expertise. We're always looking for new contributors, so if you think you have what it takes, keep on reading!

* A list of our currently flaired users can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Askengineers/wiki/flairedusers#wiki_flaired_users).

* **If you previously applied for flair and did not get a response:** please [**message us**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers&amp;subject=Flair%20application) or simply apply again in this thread. Sometimes applications get lost or neglected over holidays when the mod team is on vacation, etc.

---

###Requirements for Contributor Flair

* **Expertise in an area of engineering.** Expertise means degree-level academic knowledge (min. Bachelor's or BSc), or an equivalent amount of self-study, work experience in the field, or research.
  * **Note:** we will not ask you to verify your credentials, meaning this is a purely merit-based system.

* The ability to **cite sources from engineering literature** for any claims you make, especially within your area of expertise.

* The ability to provide **high-quality answers** in accordance with [**our answering guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_answers).

#### Expected behavior

We afford a certain level of trust to flaired members of AskEngineers, as they are the face of the community and represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole.  Because of this, we take into account every flair applicant's user history when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history contains any form of racism, sexism, and other types of bigotry.  Such behavior is not tolerated in AskEngineers as stated in [**our rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_civility), and we do not tolerate it from our panelists. Additionally, applicants who participate in discussions that are anti-science, pseudoscientific, or otherwise not supported by peer-reviewed scientific literature will be rejected. We also reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. AskEngineers is a space for engineering discussion based on science and verifiable facts, and the attitudes described above have no place here.

### How to apply

Simply post a top-level reply in this thread, and include: 

1.  **Links to at 3-5 comments that you've made within the past 2 years, answering a question in your field of expertise. Your posts do not have to be on AskEngineers — if you answered questions in /r/Engineering, /r/AskScience, or another relevant subreddit, they will be accepted.
  * **Note:** we may ask for additional comments beyond what you initially provide if some of them are considered insufficient (length or depth), or irrelevant to the expertise you're claiming.

1. **The desired icon and text of your flair you want to be designated as.** Try to be as specific as possible, but be aware that there is a hard limit of 32 characters (including spaces).

### How to nominate

Follow the same instructions above, linking 3-5 comments that *another user* made that you think would qualify him or her for contributor flair. Be sure to tag them in your comment by including `/u/username-of-nominee` in your comment. If the user doesn't claim the nomination, they will be given a generic ""Trusted Contributor"" icon that they may opt out of at any time.

### Revoking flair

Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules or fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise.",AskEngineers,AutoModerator,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5lldjt/askengineers_flair_application_thread_january_02/

40,First year in need of advice: Is staying in biomedical engineering a good idea in terms of job stability and future prospects or is industrial engineering a better idea?,1483323912,"Hi, I'm a first year biomedical eng. student at Ryersom University . For the purpose of this post, if it helps, my gpa is 4.0. I applied to biomedical engineering  for the following reasons:
1. I had hoped it would be a good undergrad to get into med school, because I feared that majoring in just biology would not allow me to get a stable job (given the high chances of not being admitted into med school in Canada);
2. I love to help  people and I wanted to make prosthetics for children;
3. I am passionate about math, but I find Physics related courses hard, so I thought the emphasis on biology-related courses could ease this.
I am doubting whether I should stay in biomedical engineering for the following reasons: 
1. Recently my father (a PEO electrical engineer), other PEO's, and a couple of reddit and yconic posts, I have asked for advice seem to agree that the broad nature of biomedical engineering may not provide great job prospects after undergrad;
2. If I don't get into med school (highly likely) or if I change my mind about medical school (highly likely since I am just a 1st year) I may reduce my chances of being hired by other engineering companies in other fields;
3. I ignorantly thought that biomedical engineering required few physics related concepts, but I learnt that it relies heavily on computer and electrical engineering courses, which may indirectly affect me since I find physics concepts challenging -- I am willing to learn and put in the effort, though.
As an alternative to biomedical engineering, I thought about pursuing Industrial Engineering for the following reasons: 
1. I have a passion for leadership and business strategies;
2. Job security after undergrad may be higher if I decide or I am unable to quality for med school;
3. Less reliance on advanced Physics is seemingly required-- please excuse me as this statement is ignorant on my part-- in comparison with biomedical engineering;
4. If I decide to go into med school and I get the grades for it, I could take a couple of summer biology courses or minor in biology to fit requirements.

I am trying to transition from one (fairly niche) engineering field to Aerospace (particularly Space), in which I have a degree. So far I've submitted 50+ applications to specific roles over several months, but I've not had any interviews. 


My old role and these new jobs are loosely related, but the technical details are quite different and not much of my specific experience is directly applicable. I have 5 years work experience, so I'm trying to decide if going forward I should submit:


a) specific applications. This is because they'll be an open role but generally the employers require experience in the field which I don't have - why would they hire me over someone with the correct experience?


b) a general application. This perhaps is the best way of pitching myself to them, but I feel that I would be easily ignored as they'd have to create a role for me.


c) or apply to graduate roles. These are potentially good for a change, but I'll probably be considered over experienced and perhaps too expensive.



Has anyone else been in a similar position, and have advice for either approach? My last option is try to go in as an entry level project manager, but I'd rather remain as a engineer for the moment.

`automoderator-schedule` has received a long-needed update to make the flair application, list of engineers willing to be interviewed, and engineers' experience threads get posted on a recurring basis. Moving forward, the schedule of these posts will be:

Thread|Frequency
:---|:---:
Flair application|Every 6 mos. starting Jan. 2, 2017
List of engineers willing to be interviewed|Every year starting April 1, 2017
Engineers' experience|Every year starting July 1, 2017

If you've expressed an interest in applying for contributor flair in the past, look out for the new thread tomorrow morning.

Finally, we will make an announcement soon to take on some new moderators. We've been short-staffed for a while as old mods retired, and we need a fresh set of ideas for things to deploy in 2017 to improve the subreddit.

I know I need some kind of op amp to boost the voltage signal for the arduino to read, but I'm lost on how to decide on one, and probably on how to understand this.

Please correct if I'm wrong:  
The data sheet for the load cell says it has a rated output of 3 mV/V. So assuming 5V from the arduino for excitation, that means 15mV at maximum load of 4000 lb. Then dividing 15mV/4000lb = 3.75 µVolts/lb. Also, with the 10 bit ADC at 5V on the arduino, it has a resolution of ~4.9 mV, requiring a total gain of (4.9 *10-3 ) / (3.75 *10-6) = 1302.

The engine has a mechanically governed fuel pump so I just need an appropriate actuator. The actuator could be an on/off solenoid (and I'll make adjustable endstops for RPM) or have an analog output. I'm worried I can't just slap any old electric actuator onto it because the vibration of a 400hp diesel will kill the actuator in short order.

The actuator must be 12v and may occasionally be rained on or be hit with high pressure spray. I'm assuming roughly 40 pounds of force over 2"" of distance is needed. Does anyone have any suggestions for an appropriate actuator? It would be awesome if the actuator had a build in throttle cable but I could take care of that myself.


Sadly no air or hydraulic power is available as that would solve all my reliability concerns.

Hello everyone, first time poster here but I'm really desperate and thought this might be a good place seek advice as I'm sure many of you have dealt with similar sounds in the past. I just bought a new place and either I didn't notice it or because I don't have much furniture yet there is a hum coming from the floor, and partially the lower portions of the walls in my living room, and bedroom.

The hum sounds exactly like this (minus the sirens and voices in the background) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Kn9JlXE5w  THe hum is between 15-20 decibles and is very consistent, running 24/7. 

My initial idea was to get a large carpet and underpadding for the living room area, however it's over 200 SQ feet and would be a pretty significant cost I expect to put in a carpet that large. As I'm a first time home owner funds are probably going to be tight for the first few months and I'm looking for other suggestions to help mitigate the noise, either temporarily or permanently that wont' break the bank and look like trash.

73,Help in estimating flow through a water line,1483155123,"Hi, I was asked this question by a friend that has this water hookup between 2 hoa's that water a common area where they live. The drawing shows two lines coming off the city main. One is a 6"" diameter that flows through meter 1 and the other is a 1"" diameter that flows through meter 2. The meter outlets are connected to either side of an 8"" pipe and there is a spigot in the middle of the 8"" pipe. The question is when 1,000 gallons leaves the spiqot, how much of that flowed through meter 1?

I went down the thought process of:   
Q1+Q2=Q3.  
V1A1 + V2A2 = Q3.  
Then sub in the area as it relates to eachother (A1 = 36*A2)   
V1*(36*A2) + V2A2 = Q3.   
At first I though that because of the area ratio that the flow would be 36 times greater. But I'm stuck at this velocity term. Any thoughts? Of course this is a thought experiment so I'm neglecting any losses and assuming the pipes lengths are irrelevant.

I am the primary manufacturing engineer dedicated to a new product line we launched last year. 

When the project first kicked off, the actual cost of the product was about 25% over cost. So I was told by management to artificially inflate labor productivity in our MRP system, SAP.  (i.e., say we can weld 20 frames per hour when we can only really do 10 per hour). To date, we have been absorbing the variance in the actual cost of the product into other product lines. 

I have proposed reporting the actual labor rates in the MRP system to decrease our variance. (Variance is how much we actually spent on labor vs. what the MRP says we should have spent). 

Is being told by your employer to increase labor productivity as a means to decrease the cost of a product unethical? I am essentially under reporting labor. I don’t want to be caught up in a scandal within the company when shit hits the fan.

Any fluid dynamics experts in the house?

I think my below interpretation is incorrect but the loose consensus so far does seems to be that the pressure wave would indeed travel at something like the speed of sound (minus some inefficiencies.)

----
original text: 

My apologies for what is surely an elementary fluid dynamics question, but Google is failing me. The hyperloop is a Elon Musk's idea for an electric vehicle traveling at ~600 MPH in a tube that's been depressurized to 1/1000th atmosphere, running down the median of the interstate. From an economic standpoint, I suspect it's a pipe dream (har har) for multiple reasons, but there's one specific point of contention here that should have a simple, objective answer.

There's this guy on Youtube, a chemist I think, who does some general debunking stuff on his channel, and he says that in the event of a catastrophic breach (full diameter of the pipe opened up) [the wall of air would accelerate down the tube in both directions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=RNFesa01llk#t=901) until it was close to the speed of sound. A bit unexpected, but not unintuitive. Atmospheric pressure is a direct consequence of gravitational acceleration, yes? So, it didn't seem very odd to me that the atmosphere could basically ""fall sideways"" into an effective vacuum like that, and as such be limited only by the speed of sound in the mixture. Maybe tangentially related, I recalled also that the gases in pyroclastic flows/surges are accelerated to insane speeds through the force of gravity alone.

But many people think this is wrong. With much hand-waving, they are claiming it would be some lower constant velocity (nowhere near the speed of sound). If that's the case, presumably there is a simple equation to describe that constant velocity.

Staring at Bernoulli's stuff on Wikipedia, fairly sure the answer is in front of me... maybe if it weren't 2 am it would be obvious. But the tradeoff between pressure and speed certainly seems relevant. Thunderf00t had claimed it would be a one atmosphere pressure wave traveling that fast. Or is the speed of the air even relevant here given its relative incompressibility and the fact that it has nowhere else to go?

What exactly would that wall of air be like... and what would it do if it hit a relatively lightweight vehicle traveling at hundreds of miles per hour in the opposite direction?

1,Real time Braille reader(Cheaper alternative for linear actuator),1483005487,"So I'm trying to design a braille reader which reads off text shown on screen sent by Arduino controller. The text shown on screen letter by letter will be emulated by six pins which are controlled by servo motors. The blind person will put his/her finger on the pins and feel the movement. So distance between each pin can't be more than 1 centimeter and the pins that are moving should reach the person's finger at precisely the same time. 
The servo motors aren't perfect for the application since the arm also has rotational motion accompanied by translational. Also I don't want to use linear actuators as they are too expensive.

In college I used to think that there was a hierarchy to engineering and I thought that Mfg Eng was below Mechanical Design. Out of college I took the first job I could as a Mfg Engineer. I liked some aspects and didn't like others. So I decided to leave that company and take a position at another company with the promise of Mechanical Design opportunities in the future. 10 months later and I am offered said opportunity.

Long story short I need a new job and I am looking for suggestions on what type of job is best for my skill set. 

My skills:
- I figure out the best way to do things, naturally. I don't know how to explain it but I have just naturally figured out the best way to do things. Whether it's mowing the lawn, my second job unloading and organizing garments off a truck, my first job prepping papers to be scanned or assembling my kids toys I have just been able to figure out the best way to do it. It manifested itself at my first job as a Manufacturing Engineer. 
- Working with my hands. Sitting at a desk all day using CAD was definitely not for me. Hated it. Still do as that's what I do now. 
- I also relate to people well. Whether it is an assembler on the mfg floor, IT, bosses or CEO (worked at a small company) I have been able to get along and relate to them. I think it is a valuable asset as an engineer to have this skill. 

Saying this I have been looking for Manufacturing Engineer jobs recently and I just want advice on types of Jobs that would be a good fit for my skill set as the job I am at right now has all but sucked the life out of me to the point where I want to make sure that I will get into something that I like and am good at and not something I will crash and burn again.

I have the feeling that one of the main issues of a PhD is that the knowledge you acquire during your research is so specific that it will be useful in only very specific cases. However I have the feeling that a PhD in control systems might be pretty useful.

I graduated from an accredited Canadian engineering school with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering a couple years back. Since then, i've been working as an Engineer-in-Training at Canadian firm under a number of Professional Engineers (P.Eng). I will be eligible to apply for my P.Eng. in about a year.

I am considering my options, one of which is to move permanently to the US. I am a Canadian citizen only.

I imagine this situation comes up a fair bit, but the information is mixed. I'm hoping I can get advice from someone knowledgeable or who has been through this.

Unlike US universities, the Canadian system does not require new graduates to complete the FE exam, or any technical exam from that matter; one automatically gets the Engineer-in-Training (EIT) designation. After four years as an EIT, there is no technical exam (only a law and ethics exam) to obtain the P.Eng.

My questions are these:

1. Is it preferable to stay in Canada to first receive the P.Eng. designation before applying to jobs in the US?

2. If one moves to the US as an EIT (say in my current state of having worked in a firm for 3 years), will one have to take the comprehensive technical FE exam?

3. If one moves to the US as a P.Eng., will one have to take the FE exam and/or the P.E. exam, or are these waived?

So my question is, how valuable is a Master's degree in engineering (specifically the engineering job market in Australia)?

94,Golden Gate Bridge Suicide Barrier,1482438111,"The project to install a suicide barrier got the go-ahead at nearly triple the original estimate of $76 million. The primary reason for the cost overrun was that a special stainless steel alloy for the wire must be used and it is not available in the US so it must be custom made. Even then, it is still not available in the quantity required anywhere in the world.

I assume the reason for the special alloy must be resistance to chloride cracking due to tensioned wires in salty air and resistance to crevice corrosion. Stainless steel is just terrible around salt spray. Wouldn't some copper alloy such as NiBrAlFe be a better choice? I just feel like my tax money is being squandered on some really amateur engineering here.

Edit: looking over the quotes posted by u/RKO36 it appears the cost of the net itself is only $10-13 million. I had assumed it was a much higher part of the overall cost.

95,"As an electrical engineer aspiring to become a energy engineer, which field/path involves the most vertical growth?",1482435609,"Good day, i am currently a second year undergrad student in Electrical Engineering and i am envisioning my future. I am interested in becoming a Renewable Energy Engineer hoping to help third world countries in their energy problems but i am very confused on the path i need to take. 

Currently my university offers five choices in my 4th year and **i can only choose one of them.**

The two that i am interested in taking are:

**1**.Power and Sustainable Energy = The easiest out of the five and the one closest to energy engineering and my dream but i am reluctant to take it due to its popularity (because it is the easiest) and hence high competition. 

**2.**Electronics = Probably the hardest choice but the one i am most interested in because there is a lot of potential for growth and it is very interesting going in depth in learning electricity. 

The rest which have little to do with energy engineering (i think):

**3.**Communications, **4.** Systems, **5.** Microwave &amp; Photonic.

Now first of i am confused which option i should take. Either i straight up take the power option or i take the electronics option and learn power in my own time (which i have the discipline to do). If i don't take the power option, *my bachelor degree will mention the electronic choice and not the power option* which will hinder my options to work for an energy company.

Secondly, I want to sort of master energy. I would love to have in-depth knowledge of electricity and energy but i also want to work hands on in a company to gain the practical experience.**Which jobs should i apply to which will yield me the best experience in renewable energy.**


I am not concerned about becoming the best engineer or the most famous one. I would like, however, for everyone in the world to have free energy on their fingertips and for that dream to come true i need a lot of knowledge in electricity and energy and so i am thinking of the best path that i can take after i graduate to help make this dream easier to get closer to.

All in all the two questions that i would like answered are:

1. Which option do i pick in my 4th year.
2. Which field should i work in to get the most experience in renewable energy and involves a lot of growth in said field.

I am sorry for the long post and bad writing style but if any engineer can help me with some of their wisdom being former graduates that would be great.

Regards,

a second year student.

Long story short, I am an engineering student doing my internship and the boss asked me the following question: Whether I can find a way to **measure** (*not calculate/estimate*) the **cos(phi)** of a particular appliance (is that the right word? not a native speaker). Posting here because I think this doesn't belong in r/science or r/eli5, but if there is a more appropriate sub, maybe someone can point me to it.

I am a mechanical engineer and this is an electrical engineering question, and apart from 

    P = V * I * cos(phi)

I'm drawing a blank here. I am doing some googling on the side, but I'm asking also here. I don't want you to ""do my homework"", but maybe point me in the right direction.

The project has to do with energy conservation. There are factories around here that want to reduce phi and harmonics, so they want to use power factor correction devices (is that the right term? What I'm trying to describe is effectively a capacitor). We want to **measure the old and new V, I and phi, to calculate how much P we are saving**, in order to make an offer to the company. V and I are easy, but what about phi?

Is there even a way to measure it? Or do I have to estimate it based on machine usage and the power company's bill? Is this a prank from my boss, because this is an easy problem that is simply not taught at school?

4,How Do Sails Work?,1482361020,"When people describe how an aerofoil works, they say the air on the top has to move faster than the air on the bottom because it's got a greater distance to travel. However, for sails the difference in thickness is negligible. 

The next thing they may introduce is circulation using the example of a spinning disk producing lift with no difference in thickness in either side. It's ""easy"" to see where circulation comes from in this example. However, a sail is not a spinning disk. 

The next thing that was shown in my control surfaces class was approximating lift by looking at the curvature of your camber. A curve has high pressure on the inward face and low pressure on the outer face. However I don't think it was explained why this happens (for a 0 thickness aerofoil). 

I think there is a gap in my knowledge somewhere stopping me from understanding where lift is generated. 

Why must the top molecules accelerate? Why do the particles which separate at the leading edge have to meet at the trailing edge on an aerofoil with thickness? 

Where is the circulation generated on a sail and what does this mean in real world terms? Do the particles on the high pressure side of a sail have a higher velocity than the low pressure side? And if so, do the separated particles meet together at the trailing edge, like an aerofoil?

I do technical work, not managerial (or paper-pushing work), and I'm lucky enough to be in a group that does this kind of work, even though the rest of the organization rarely values it.  I have published patents and papers.  I've looked at other jobs, gone on interviews, and have had a few offers.  Basically, here is my point of view about the working world in this profession:

1)  At your job, you are suppose to show up, surf the web for 8 hours, and go home.  Occasionally you have to play politics every now and then - and if you're good at it you'll get promoted.  Sure you can do ...real work..., but don't expect anything for it.

2)  Nobody cares about your experience at all.  Nobody cares what your skillsets are.  Do you have some skillsets that took years of training?  Doesn't matter, we'll just point to Phil over there and assign him highly-technical work - he spent a day or so googling that stuff last month.  He's just as good as you.

3)  Job interviews are just checking you out to see if you fit in.  Like middle school clique fit in.  Too tall?  Too short?  Does he look like us and talk like us?  Does he like beer?  He better like beer.  No?  Sorry, the position has been filled.

4)  Job offers are going to offer you less than what you're currently making.  Sorry, not-negotiable.  Going to negotiate?  We can't go any higher.  Still trying to negotiate?  Even though you have some directly related skillset that we need for this position?  How dare you, we'll just pull the offer.

5)  You have to be living in a big city - preferably writing software.  Not living in a big city?  What's wrong with you?

6) You're going to have a bad manager.  He's not going to care about you, your career development or his department- only how many more years until he retires.  As per #2, he'll have no problem assigning highly-technical and critical tasks to anyone who needs to look busy.

I want to make the leap to the private sector, because I'm hoping that competency and skills actually matter, and I can use that to get greater compensation as my career progresses.

The shortest widths of the table top are about 6 3/4"" at the back of the keyboard tray, and I'm not sure about applying weight to the usable front center of the desk.

I installed a repeater (850MHz 3G 2G GSM CDMA) to help with calls. I don't care about data at home since we have internet over wifi. With it, I get glorious -70 dBm signal.

The problem is that my phone occasionally switches from the great 3G signal to the very poor 4G signal. What do I do?

Things I don't want to do:
Switch carriers or turn off LTE every time I'm at home

EDIT:

My phone does turn off data when making a call. I noticed that when connected to the poor network, my bars go from 1 to full bars once I make a call. Is this expected? I may not have a problem after all.",AskEngineers,Tater_Schroeder,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5jk78g/how_do_i_make_my_phone_use_cell_repeater_signal/

19,HS Student - Is a college/masters degree required?,1482298028,"Hey, thanks all for being around to answer my question. Long story ahead, which I think is required to answer my specific question anyway.

This may sound pretentious or even insulting, but I'm a high school student in 11th grade currently asking myself a couple of questions. Specifically, I really dislike school - I'm putting myself through hours of unrewarding class and being asked to do hours of homework for classes I couldn't care less about, and I'm getting Bs as a result of this frustration and missing assignments. School has been frustrating because even though I don't think it is particularly difficult to do well, I don't want to spend the hours doing work I don't like for a grade I don't care about. (I've generally been doing well on the tests and not doing half the homework and getting Bs as a result).

I want to establish that I'm not stupid, nor have extenuating circumstances whatsoever - I have a 1540 (or 2260 on the 2400 scale) SAT first try and I've taken 6 APs on my own (and currently doing another 7), my parents are fairly well off. I am not saying I am a genius or the next Gates, but it is typical of high school dropouts to be stereotyped accordingly so I want to clear this first.

This year, I've had the chance to explore beyond AP courses, and I've discovered MOOCs and online material, which is so much more interesting. I want to take Udacity, edX, and Open Course Ware stuff on the internet in colleges offered for graduate students because it is honestly more so what I want to do than anything in school, and is more directly applicable to anything that I actually pursue in the future anyway. I've noticed that college has been mostly about the networking and research opportunity than the classes themselves.

So my question is - can I skip out on high school, even college, spend my next 2 years studying CS and EE from the myriad of online sources available, and then apply for an entry level position? Is it possible for personal projects, competitions, or Kaggle to take prominence over something more traditional (GPA, degree, extracurricular involvement) in the job market? Could I potentially have discovered a viable shortcut for a $240K degree and 5 years granted I put in the effort in the next 2 to build my skills?

20,How to evaluate sine-sweep (chirp) signal for system Identification,1482286802,"Hi All! 

Hope you'll are well. 
I am trying to do system identification for a vehicle. 

My background is manual control cybernetics, so normally I investigate human subjects in simulator based (compensatory) tracking experiments. There I would excite the 'system' (read human) with a multi-sine signal and use the instrumental variable method (and function fitting) to perform system identification (Fourier transforming in- and output; and only evaluating the excited frequencies).

However, for a human driver this may be a bit difficult to do in the car. It is easier to provide sine-sweep (or CHIRP) signal. 

Unfortunately I think this input signal is not compatible with direct frequency domain analysis, because each frequency is only excited during a specific timeframe and the Fourier transform assumes a harmonic oscillation during the entire sample-time. I have checked some books (System Identification: A Frequency Domain Approach, System identification : an introduction and ) but can't seem to get a grip on how to use the CHIRP signal for the estimation of the Frequency Response Function (thus also the transfer function).

The purpose of the inlet bleed heat valve (http://imgur.com/cGhJVZl) is to protect the compressor from surging by reducing the compression ratio, to provide the ability to operate at lower loads without flaming out and within emission compliance, and to prevent the conditions necessary for ice formation on the first stage stator blades.
Running at approximately 100MW with ambient conditions of approximately -12°C, the inlet bleed heat valve closed causing the potential for icing conditions in the gas turbine inlet, therefore we were forced to shut down. Here is the trend with the relevant data during that time (http://imgur.com/YXRUsVX) (http://imgur.com/8luA4hH). 
So essentially as we were trying to reach a higher load on the gas turbine generator, icing conditions presented themselves as the inlet bleed heat valve would not open so we were forced to shut down at 22:00. Has anyone else experienced anything like this, where load output has been restricted due to the inlet bleed heat valve closing?

___
So this is fairly common in the area. A friend of mine has two steel beams under the garage and two metal screw jack posts under each beam. These two steel beams run parallel to the way the cars park. He said that a few others in his neighborhood had paid extra to have three steel beams ran perpendicular to the way the cars park. They did this so that they would not have any posts in the room under their garage.
___
So, in my house I have not two, not three, but four steel beams that are running perpendicular to direction of parking. Not only are their four beams but each beam has a post under it directly in the center. This seems like overkill to me and a few others I've talked to at work. I don't mind having four beams, that's great. It would be nice however if I could eliminate the posts.
___
What design aspects come into play with this? Structural engineering is not my area at all but if I could at least get pointed in the right direction that would be helpful.
I assume the posts are to avoid deflection of the beam over the span? With four beams sharing the load I wouldn't think this would be a fear.

I want to offer an uncomplicated (meaning no welding or machining; just hand drills and saws etc) and inexpensive design for people to start building with. Ideally the parts can be just ordered online (McMaster, Amazon, etc) without having to talk to salespeople etc.

My idea is to provide a build guide for turning a CIK competition kart (because they are cheaply available used) and a ROS build to get it working. So far I've been using inexpensive linear actuators for steering. Here is my first try: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOkGumHzopc for steering. Parts list in video.  I'm not particularly happy about the way they work and I am considering alternatives. I think they will steer fast enough for the kart to go around a road course, but not a proper kart track; that's ok for now. The controllers have RC inputs as well as serial control so I am just controlling it via RC for the moment. Robots come later

I also have the beginnings of a design using a Baja Bug steering rack (with a worm drive motor) and another to directly actuate the steering wheel (using taper-lock parts? not sure if they will be grippy enough without a key). Further away is a simplistic design for a lead-screw based rack.

Question 2) My attic has an entry space in the garage, no stairs, so I'd have to use a ladder and climb in. It's about 2' x 3' space in the ceiling. Could I lay down some 2x4s to form a walkway up there so I can do some basic wiring work? I don't want to fall through my ceiling.

71,Coaxial electric motors,1482006165,"
I'm a new EE and work for a controls company. 
We were contracted to control a custom piece of equipment with an unusual design.   It has a rotating horizontal shaft with an ordinary ~100 hp induction motor on each end.  It looks like this. 

|M1|---------|M2|    

This is an interesting situation I'd never considered before, and I've been wondering about it in my spare time.
My company has taken the most obvious approach to this, by controlling each motor with it's own VFD.  I'm unsure of the details of the programming, but I think that one vfd matches the torque of the other (in the opposite direction, of course).  However, there's no requirement for the motors to operate at a particular or variable speed, but they must start under some load. I am curious if using 2 VFDs is always necessary, even if it is more practical. 

*What sorts of problems would develop if both motors were simply stated at the same time, using perhaps constant current starting?  Would they really tend to break the shaft?   For a low horsepower application, would this work?  How would I calculate this? 

*Is the system unstable?  Would some harmful feedback develop and cause the speed of the shaft to oscillate? 

*Is there some way of wiring the two motors together that would improve things?

I'm in a complicated situation. In a nutshell, which EE track is easiest and most relevant to a career in aerospace (where I would likely want to do high level systems engineering) for me? I've listed the tracks that I'd be most interested in below, but I don't really know too much in detail about each one.

A bit of background: I'm graduating undergrad with a BS in physics. I do research in space plasma physics (first authoring a paper), but also work on a NASA mission as the attitude determination and control system lead. I'm fairly engineering savvy as I like to stick my nose in other subsystems. I was just granted the opportunity to part time work as a project lead on the same NASA mission while pursuing a masters/phd in EE. Since I've never taken any EE classes, I feel like there's gonna be a ton of catch up for me. In addition, a requirement is that I finish the masters in 2 years. That's why I want the easiest yet most relevant EE track possible since project leading is a non-trivial time commitment.

**Electromagnetics.** Courses in this track deal with electromagnetic theory; propagation and scattering; antenna theory and design; microwave and millimeter wave circuits; printed circuit antennas; integrated and fiber optics; microwave-optical interaction; antenna measurement and diagnostics; numerical and asymptotic techniques; satellite and personal communication antennas; periodic structures; genetic algorithms; and optimization techniques. 

**Photonics and Plasma Electronics.** Courses in this track deal with laser physics; optical amplification; electro-optics; acousto-optics; magneto-optics; nonlinear optics; photonic switching and modulation; ultrafast phenomena, optical fibers, integrated waveguides; photodetection; optoelectronic integrated circuits; optical MEMS; analog and digital signal transmission; photonics sensors; lasers in biomedicine; fundamental plasma waves and instability; interaction of microwaves and laser radiation with plasmas; plasma diagnostics; and controlled nuclear fusion.

**Solid-State and MEMS Devices.** Courses in this track deal with solid-state physical electronics; semiconductor device physics and design; and microelectromechanical systems design and fabrication.

**Communications Systems.** Courses in this track deal with communication and telecommunication principles and engineering applications; channel and source coding; spread spectrum communication; cryptography; estimation and detection; algorithms and processing in communication and radar; satellite communication systems; stochastic modeling in telecommunication engineering; mobile radio engineering; telecommunication switching; queuing system; communication networks; and local-area, metropolitan-area, and wide-area computer communication networks. 

**Control Systems and Optimization.** Courses in this track deal with state-space theory of linear system; optimal control of deterministic linear and nonlinear systems; stochastic control; Kalman filtering; stability theory of linear and nonlinear feedback control systems; computer-aided design of control systems; optimization theory, including linear and nonlinear programming; convex optimization and engineering application; numerical methods; nonconvex programming; associated network flow and graph problems; renewal theory; Markov chains; stochastic dynamic programming; and queuing theory.

**Signal Processing.** Courses in this track deal with digital signal processing theory; statistical signal processing; analysis and design of digital filters; digital speech processing; digital image processing; multirate digital signal processing; adaptive filtering; estimation theory; neural networks; and communications signal processing.

Ive learned a lot about engines and how they work, and everything I've learned says this video is full of crap. However... 


They have their source for this info in the credits. And its not some schmuck, the guy has worked with engines longer than ive been alive and is currently an engineer at the Argonne National Laboratory. So either the writer of that video did not listen to their source correctly, or he knows something I dont. Can someone help me understand why this video could be correct? 


The video claims:

-your car runs rich when its cold and at idle

-gasoline is a solvent, and will wash the oil off your cylinder walls

-warming up cars is an outdated tactic from when carburetors couldnt richen the fuel mixture and wouldnt start

-todays cars need 30-60 seconds before theyre ready to drive. 

. 

My rebuttal:

-solvents only work when they are liquids. Vapor cannot dissolve the oil.
 
-gas is supposed to be sprayed onto the valves, not through the opening of the valve. This is to prevent the gas from getting sprayed onto the cylinder wall. 

-cars with carburetors had a choke to richen the mixture. Your computer richens the mixture. They both need to warm up so they can stop richening the mixture. 

-todays cars tend to have lots of miles and large bearing clearances due to wear. Most people use conventional oil bc its cheap, but it gets very thick when its cold.  If the engine is still cold when you drive, your worn bearings wont get enough oil (pump cant move the thick oil fast enough), hence the knocking sounds when the engine is cold. Todays cars need time to warm up.

Here's my dilemma. I work during the day (8am-6pm) as a financial advisor which is during school hours so there's a clear scheduling conflict. I make a comfortable wage and I've not had to take out many student loans (&lt;$3k), it also allows me to pursue my hobbies which can get expensive.

My question for the professional engineers, did any of you have to leave a decent job to focus on school? How did it work out for you? Would you recommend doing it?

I should add that I have no real baggage; I'm single, no kids, and I live with my father (rent is insanely expensive where I live). I know that engineering is pretty tough but I believe that I can do it, especially now that I'm a little older. I also feel that a degree will lead me to a job that feels more meaningful than what I do now. On the other hand, the idea of leaving this job is unnerving. It's a secure job, a make a good wage and I'm comfortable, it's not the most rewarding job, however.

43,Looking for a flexible alternative to Raspberry Pi?,1481718352,"Hey guys,

I'm building a wearable livestreaming camera embedded into a choker-style necklace. It will look similar to: https://www.pound-accessories.com/collections/necklace/products/vintage-gothic-black-lace-choker-necklace-with-charm-nz0301

I was hoping to use a Raspberry Pi Zero (which is 1'' x 3''), a RPi camera module, etc, for this project. I wanted to hide the large components (raspberry pi, battery, and powerboost) inside the flexible strap of the necklace, so as to distribute weight evenly and produce a nice-looking necklace. However, I'm realizing that these parts are rigid, so they would not wrap around the wearer's neck properly.

If I had to stack all these components in the center of the necklace, that would result in a 3'' long chunk that would be ugly and heavy. The biggest issue is with the RPi zero, as the battery and powerboost are both smaller. I'm hoping to avoid this.

Apart from manufacturing custom parts, can you suggest any alternatives?

I am with a facilities management company and one of our hospitals recently ran into a wet pack problem with their autoclaves/sterilizers. To resolve the problem they installed water separators before each of the autoclaves as well as one at the main steam distribution line.

This resolved the wet pack problem however brown staining started appearing on the operating equipment. This problem was resolved eventually however I am not sure exactly WHY this happened.

They shutoff the steam system for about 24 hours to install the separators which allowed the cast iron steam pipes to cool for the first time in years. Then turned the system back on when they could.

Now my assumption is that the pipes decreased in size due to the large drop in temperature causing iron to.... move freely? I don't quite know the technicalities and chemistry behind this and I would love if I could get an explanation about the properties of cast iron piping going through such a drastic change in temperatures.

Any input would be greatly appreciated,

*TL;DR – Did not have an engineering internship upon graduating. Found an engineering job, which really only dealt with CAD. Released from my employment in April 2016, have been trying to find my next position since. I feel as If I lack experience compared to other candidates . Any suggestions?*

Dear r/AskEngineers,

I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from an ABET credited program in May of 2014. Unfortunately I have been unemployed for the last 8 months as I have not been able to find a position that will allow me to advance my engineering career. Because of the growing employment gap in my resume, I am afraid that it will become increasingly more difficult for me to find another engineering position. To the experienced engineers on this subreddit: do you have any advice for me for taking the next step in my engineering career?

**A little background on me and my situation:**
Upon graduating in May of 2014 I entered the job market without previous engineering co-op or internship experience, which in retrospect is something I should have been more proactive to obtain. In June of 2014 I took a position on a production line in my hometown in order to build employment history and financial security with the intent to find an entry level position. Although I had a handful of interviews over the next couple of months, I was still unable to secure an engineering position by early 2015. I therefore decided to quit the my position late that March, as I wanted to spend 1st shift being more aggressive in my job search instead of on a production line pressing buttons on a preprogrammed CNC machine. My aggressiveness seemed to pay off, as I finally was able to secure an engineering position at a company who produced custom vendor carts in May of 2015.

Overall my experience at this company was positive as I enjoyed the coworkers I interacted with and the product the company was producing. The position also allowed me the opportunity to master the CAD software utilized by the company, where I was able to explore the different features and tools of the program. Unfortunately CAD was the only engineering skill I was practicing, as the products the company produced did not require analysis or other engineering tools. But I knew holding an engineering position was beneficial for my resume so I decided to stay at the position for about a year before starting to look for another engineering position.

Unfortunately in April of 2016 my company released me from their employment, which came as a shock. On my final day at the company my manager stated that I was behind on my work production, which he gauged by the number of production and quote packets I had created so far in 2016. Up to that point management never communicated to me that I was not performing at their expectations or gave me the opportunity to learn and improve my work output. Although dismayed I tried to be optimistic, as I know had the opportunity to pursue the next step in my engineering career.

Now it’s 8 months later and my optimism is starting to run out. Even after countless of applications and dozens of phone and on-site interviews, I still have not been able to land another engineering position. I am starting to get nervous that the employment gap on my resume will start to become a red flag for potential employers. I have used my university’s engineering career services and attended their career fair, searched many online job boards, and submitted my resume to numerous staffing firms, which has resulted in interviews but as of right now no offers of employment.

I have felt that some of my interviews have gone smoothly as well, and therefore the companies’ decisions to pursue other candidates came as a surprise, leaving me to only speculate their reasons. Occasionally a company would provide me with some feedback on my interview or resume, the most common response being that other candidates had internship or co-op experience more applicable to the position than the experience I had.

As 2017 comes to a close I have come to a realization that I might need to think outside the box if I want to continue my engineering career. So to the experienced engineers on this subreddit, what do you suggest I do in my predicament? Do you have any tip or suggestions to help me either land another job or develop new engineering skills to help bolster my resume? I am starting to consider following: taking some courses at my local tech school, studying for EIT Exam (which I am a little hesitant to take,) joining ASME, and/or finding a hobby that would allow me to develop a hands-on engineering skill set. But even with these options I feel like a need a bit more direction. Any suggestions?

I did read over the subreddit FAQ, and I do realize that some of my questions overlap with “What are some things I can do in my spare time to make myself more marketable as an engineer?” But a lot of the suggested skills are ones that I already acquired. I am familiar with CAD and have taken coursework in programming (Java, C), LabVIEW, and prototype design/fabrication (which covered using mills, lathes, and other machines in the shop.)

2) Architecture Firm

3) Structural Engineering Firm

The construction internship is all but guaranteed through a good friend that works there as a superintendent; however, I'm not quite sure if I like the idea of one day working in a field that's so stressful and aggressive (both in terms of the work and the environment) even though it might be the most pay right off the bat.

I have a couple of casual friends who can get me an internship with their architecture firm. I love design related structural engineering stuff and I thought it could be beneficial to see the design process and how the architects interact with their engineering counterparts.

Lastly, my wife and I have three acquaintances who head up structural engineering firm offices in town. These are highly competitive compared to the construction/architecture internships but I believe would be worthwhile considering my current career plan.

First off, you guys are really cool. As a non-engineer, I really appreciate all the interesting discussions that go on here. Everything from Samsung batteries to the benefits of powder coating vs anodizing. This community is something to be proud of. 

My question pertains to what skills a non-engineer should be familiar with to collaborate better with engineers. I am trying to become a more well-rounded student/job applicant and my current area of study is in entrepreneurship/business administration. 

I figure that I'd be a better team member if I had some general experience with computer science other than the stupidly easy courses I was offered in high school. I'm not sure how much CS I'll see in college, so I was wondering: What aspects of coding should I be learning/are there any free courses/videos online that do a good job of this? I suppose my question pertains mostly to electrical engineering and computer science/coding, but I'd be interested if there are any important skills/knowledge that would be helpful to someone like me in the realm of other engineering fields.

I spent a little while recently designing an joint for a robot arm. The design I came to [looks like this](http://imgur.com/a/gSnQD).

The loading on the arm is as shown in the final image (green is fixed geometry and purple is the loading) but essentially the arm carries some weight and is fixed at the other end with the joint in the middle.

I have used thrust bearings to support the weight and its allowed me to make the joint very small. I could however have used two round bearings in almost the exact same place with only some minor redesigns.

93,Civil Engineering Specialties - Transportation vs Structures,1481510390,"Hello civil engineers! I am a student in my final year of college. I've had a somewhat turbulent semester; originally I planned to graduate next Fall with a co-op but due to some crafty course selection, I developed a plan to graduate this coming Spring with only 7 semesters (not including summers). However, this has created somewhat of a predicament for me - I still haven't developed a true specialty in my field and haven't had much time to prepare for my time after undergrad. I intend to go to graduate school next as I have worked tremendously hard throughout my undergraduate career and want to maintain my momentum and gain further appreciation for my field. 

I've narrowed it down to Transportation and Structures. I'm not too into construction, and I've done enough coursework in environmental to know that isn't my primary interest. I've had some internships in land development/municipal engineering, and while the work was good, I don't like the idea of working on suburban subdivisions/contributing to sprawl (just my personal opinion) which is 90% of what we did combined with strip malls and pad sites. 

My interest in transportation is primarily in systems operation. I don't like highway or roadway design as much as I like logistics. However, my schools current program has a heavy emphasis on geometric and pavement design, and most people who work for my state's DOT or private companies do just that, which I don't have much interest in pursuing. I simply don't have much experience doing anything else, so I wouldn't know what to expect from other programs.

I have focused some of my senior coursework on structures, with this as my intended graduate focus. However, both of these areas are what gauged my interest in civil engineering to begin with -  large, progressive infrastructure projects like the ones that inspired me as I was growing up. 

I don't have much experience working in either of these areas so I was wondering if people who were currently in the field could provide some commentary, advice, or feedback. If any of you have criticism for my choice to go to graduate school immediately, that is fine too (my old boss at my internship heavily discouraged me, although I always thought he was a little biased given that he wanted most of us to come back).

1,How would I go about finding the initial velocity of the water from a drinking fountain?,1481436425,"So for my Grade 11 Physics class we've been asked to determine this value. My current approach has been to solve for the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity and use those values to calculate the combined initial velocity. Here's what I have so far (sorry about the formatting!):

Measurements (not final, will be retaken to account for uncertainty):
vertical distance of water arc (dy) = 0.093m,
horizontal distance of water arc (dₓ) = 0.212m,
acceleration of gravity = -9.8m/s²,
time = 0.3875 seconds,

Calculations:

Horizontal Component:
dₓ = Vₓt ,
Vₓ = 0.212m/0.3875s ,
Vₓ = 0.547096m/s (extra digits carried) ,

Vertical Component:
Δd = Vyt + 1/2at² ,
0m = (0.3875s)Vy + (-9.8m/s^2)(0.3875s)² ,
(0.3875s)Vy = -0.735765625m ,
Vy = 1.89875m/s (extra digits carried) ,

Pythagorean theorem for the combined initial velocity:
Vᵢ = √(Vₓ²+Vy²) ,
Vᵢ = √((0.547096m/s)²+(1.89875m/s)²) ,
Vᵢ = 1.9759973673m/s ,
Vᵢ = 2.0m/s ,

11,Cheap insurance: Upgrading weight capacity on this bed. Advice please.,1481408476,"Hi all.  I'm looking at the [Night and Day Ginger Loft Bunk full bed](http://nightanddayfurniture.com/showroom/images/spices/ginger_loft/full_loft_curvy_720.jpg), with [assembly instructions here](http://nightanddayfurniture.com/imagebank_serve/serve.cgi?id=1346).  This is a project to turn a master bedroom in a 1,300-sqft town home into a master study, with a desk area under the bed.  With the requisite ten-inch mattress, this gives 42 inches between the bed and the ceiling; ceiling fans and other hazards are addressed.

Information on this bed is hard to get.  I've repeatedly heard that it's suitable for two 250lb persons (not one 300lb person--load distribution); I'm 150lb and I live alone, so of course this seems fine.  Doesn't hurt to throw $50 at a $1,750 project just for peace of mind.

I'm not the world's greatest engineer.  My engineering expertise extends as far as seventh grade, when I once built a model bridge out of toothpicks and Elmer's glue.  The way I designed it, any stress distributed load evenly among all other points in the structure; they tried to smash it with a hydraulic press, and required over 1,000 pounds to do so.  There was no math involved, which doesn't mean I'm just that good so much as it does I have know idea what the hell I'm doing.

As such, I'm ham-fisting this effort with some brute force.

I'm looking at two primary upgrades:

* Static load on the slats and its supports;
* Dynamic load at the top straining the posts.

For the first, I'd stabilize the center rail bracket, probably by making it hook up and over the L/R side frames (2A); and route a 3/16 inch by 1 inch inlay along each side at the top of the center rail (5B) and add a 1x3/16 flat aluminum bar via wood screws.

If the physics in my head are correct, rolling to one side flexes the slats between the center rail and a stretcher, which will use the center rail as a fulcrum; and with the opposite stretcher attached rigidly to the far end of the slat, the fulcrum becomes load-bearing, assumes most of the load, and distributes the remainder between the stretcher on the loaded side and the stretcher opposite the center rail; the far stretcher should take more (upwards) load than the near one, because it's further from the center rail than the load is.  With two people, the center rail should bear at least half the load.  This looks like a complex system of wooden springs and levers, but I have no idea how it works and am going off physics simulations in my head.

For the second, I'd produce additional diagonal bracing between the stretcher rails and end frames (upper frame) and the posts.  This should distribute any horizontal (but not twisting) force throughout the structure produced by the bracing, essentially converting much of the load into compressive stress instead of tensile stress.  This also moves the point of greatest stress downwards, shortening the length between the floor (fulcrum) and the point where the posts start to bend (load), thus reducing the mechanical advantage by some magic and requiring a greater load to break posts.  This should also reduce stress on fasteners in the top area.

That should take an extra two hours of assembly, and mitigate the primary failure modes of this bed.  Other than that, I can replace the ladder with some sturdy stairs.

Am I probably ignoring a critical load point that's going to fail first whether I add this bracing or not, or is it essentially center rail and diagonal bracing?  I am not an engineer, and I don't think this thing is fragile; it's just not published with a 2,000lb dynamic load capacity, and spending $50 and an extra 2 hours of my time to reduce the likelihood of a bunk collapse is a long-term risk mitigation strategy.

Use some or all of the rubber bands and string in an arrangement which suspends the weight from the hook in the ceiling, such that*** **cutting one string causes the weight to rise.** ***Before you cut the string the weight is X inches above the floor. After you cut the string the weight is (X+1) inches above the floor.  Connections to the floor and/or the side walls, are forbidden.***

Sorry for the excessively wordy explanation, it's an attempt to forestall the most frequently proposed ""cheats"".  In fact the weight is most conveniently implemented as a can of beer or cola, but then some jagoff ""solves"" the problem by emptying the liquid.  The business about the hook merely emphasizes that the apparatus connects to the ceiling at one, and only one, point.  Room height and distance to walls prevents other types of cheating which introduce paths from the weight to non-ceiling surfaces.  I apologize that bitter experience has proven, these explicit constraints are necessary.

22,A lazy incompetent is ruining my top-performing team,1481359512,"I am a firmware engineer.  I work with the most incompetent laziest most useless fucker on the planet.  Let's call him Shithead.  He's been at the company for 15+ years,  but does not know how to unit test his code or use a ""for loop"" to do a series of repetitive tasks.

He spends his day sleeping, texting, surfing the web or on the phone with his wife.  Whenever he is given a task, he fucks it up and someone else quietly fixes it.  Management knows, but simply makes everyone else work harder to make up for his shortcomings.

When the tech lead tried to ask Shithead a question last week, Shithead told him to ""come back later  'cause I'm texting my brother to get a new IPhone from Amazon.""  Then, the tech lead came to my cube and dumped Shithead's delinquent work in my lap.  I stayed pass midnight for most of this week to finish.

We are horribly behind schedule and our project has run out of funding.  And I blame Shithead.  But, everyone here is super-duper fake nice to him as if he's a mentally challenged adult and they feel sorry for him - like Slow Donnie on Just Shoot Me.  But he's just a con artist that gets off on getting a 6 figure salary to do nothing, and nobody has the balls to call him out.

TL;DR - We are a team of top performers who are doing amazing work and a lazy incompetent Shithead is ruining our chances of success.

35,ICE - turbo wear related to intercooler heat soak,1481303784,"There are several closely related ideas circulated in the automotive world regarding the effects of a heat soaked intercooler. Since it's a topic most often discussed in car enthusiast forums, engine output is the primary focus. I'm well aware of how high intake air temperatures increase the likelihood of detonation, how ECUs compensate for that, and how it can be counteracted. My concern is about turbocharger reliability.

When an intercooler becomes overwhelmed, the temperature and pressure of the air in the intercooler (and ducting) increases, and its density decreases. I'm hoping that some mechanical engineers, perhaps including some that have worked turbocharged internal combustion engines, can weigh in on the consequences, as related to increased load/wear on parts of the turbocharger.

Some thoughts:

- as pressure on the intercooler side increases, the axial load on the turbine must increase

- excess heat is generally bad (oil coking, stress on materials through heating/cooling cycles)

- in order to meet the pressure demands of the ECU, perhaps the turbine will need to spin faster, increasing wear; on the contrary, the higher temperature has left the air pressurized, though will a smaller mass of oxygen, so there may be no effect on turbine speed, just on the amount of fuel that is burned

Anyone care to weigh in with educated answers? My degree was in pure (read ""useless"") math and I work in the software industry, so don't be afraid to share in depth information. #shouldhavestudiedrealengineering

I was hired out of school at a salary of $60k four years ago. I've gotten the standard annual 3% raises twice (there were freezes on raises when the company wasn't doing well), bringing my current salary to $63k. Now the company is doing well, and I've taken on a lot more responsibility. Based on messages from LinkedIn recruiters who have tried to get me to come work at other positions (both from local companies and industry competitors), I figure I can make about $80-85k easily if I left the company. I would rather stay--I like my team and I like my project, but at some point it doesn't make sense for me to stay. 

My questions are two-fold:

1. Is it unreasonable to ask for a 35% raise? To me this seems like a pretty hefty amount. Is it reasonable to expect this, even if it seems to be the going market rate?

What I'm referring to are the lanes that are typically added to a highway when the road meets a steep incline, and an extra lane is provided to facilitate traffic moving around the vehicles that cannot motor up the incline at normal speeds (typically large trucks). First of all, why do those lanes end as the lane reaches the TOP of the summit, instead of JUST PAST the summit, which would allow the slower vehicle some distance to accelerate back to normal speed before the lane ends. The way they are usually constructed, the slow moving truck has to move back into the faster moving traffic just as they reach the summit, and are beginning to pick back up to speed, but are still moving well below the flow of traffic. The other question is, why are the lanes added on the right-hand side of the highway instead of on the left? If the lanes were added to the left side, the trucks could move at whatever pace necessary and the cars (and faster moving trucks) would then have to merge back into one lane at the top of the hill while the slow-moving trucks would not have to change lanes.",AskEngineers,BarneyG007,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5h80zi/traffic_engineers_of_reddit_why_are_truck_lanes/

61,"What is causing a mystery constant, fast, and barely audible vibration in private home?",1481207408,"I recently moved to the top floor of a three story home that is near an infrequently used express track (primarily on weekends during construction on the local line/once or so an hour). A train passing under causes the house to rumble hard and generally wakes me. It's an old home, and it seems prone to vibration.

To minimize the train vibration in my bed (metal frame with four legs on risers, wooden slats, foam mattress), I put folded-in-two yoga mats beneath each pair of risers. Each riser also has two dense hockey pucks beneath the bed legs. I added a fully inflated air mattress between my bed and foam mattress. Beneath my bed are boxes of books for added weight; two ten-pound weights are on the bed-frame. No part of the bed is touching the wall. (from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/5fzn07/how_to_reduce_bed_vibration_from_subway/)

It's helped with the train vibration, but it hasn't helped with what seems to be the entire upper floor shaking very rapidly and constantly. It tends to start in the evenings during the weekdays. This past weekend, it was on the entire time. My landlord (lives on the first floor; I'm on the third) said he's never heard of nor experienced something like that in the years he's been there.

My second floor neighbor doesn't seem to be experiencing anything (but he also mentioned that his family's encounters with the trains seems to be far milder than mine). He also mentioned that he doesn't have any vibrating machines in use (fan, AC, etc.)

We had some boiler repairs recently (I don't know what was done), but the vibration continues even when the radiators aren't fussing about (but I don't know definitively if this means the system is 'off'). It's still active when our refrigerator dies down. I tried recording it with the VibSensor app and got rates of 9.7-10hz, but I'm not sure if that's the app just picking up itself. No music, broadcasted or performed.

The room's former occupant (who I don't think spent much time in the apartment during the winter) doesn't recall any such vibrations.

Is this something new? Is something broken? Could it be something 'normal' and otherwise present but now accentuated because it's colder outside? How do I stop it? I'm very sensitive to my environment, but my landlord is at least in his late fifties, so I'm concerned he might not pick up on the vibrations.

As a follow up to my last thread on how to put together a concrete block. I made up something last weekend out of scrap that I had. 

Ideally I wanted an avil but I couldn't really afford it. So I made a really dense heavy lattice of rebar to give it heavy mass and put a 10mm plate on the top. I tack welded the lattice together and then set the whole lattice in concrete to hold it together much better.

Only minor screw up was not enough concrete - I only had 60kg of ready mix stuff and I wasn't able to cover the lowest row of rebar. It worked out to my benefit in the end as it digs in nicely to the sand bags.

Overall I'm very happy with it - it's rock solid and my hammer just skips off the top. It doesn't shake and rattle and seems to dampen out energy going into the concrete slabs. ",AskEngineers,Barry675,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5h1xo7/making_a_concrete_block_part_2_finished_block/

I work for an engineering firm and we have all our work billed hourly to projects (T&amp;M might be the term for it). Its been brought up by some managers that the expectation is theres a balance. As in if you screw up a task you shouldn't bill for the effort to fix it (or bill less).
I would imagine thats illegal right? They take a risk by giving you something you couldn't handle and thus thats on them not you right? Like in the past if its only going to take me an hour to fix a screw up I might just work that for free for something dumb but I cant imagine spending any more time than that and not charging being legal. I get why managers might be tempted to think you should have to cover for your mistakes and I get how in some ways it even sounds reasonable but legally speaking I would imagine a call to HR if there was ever push to not charge would get that manager in a ton of trouble.

EDIT:

I am talking about how I charge my time and get paid for my hours worked, not in any way how it ends up getting billed to the client. The way our time system works though in order to put in your hours you worked you have to assign it to a task code. There is no overhead code.

My main drive sprocket keeps getting stripped clean and the chain seizes after about an hour of use. If you take a peek at the album here: http://imgur.com/a/x8KCY you can see the basic layout.

You can see that the chain goes from the centrifugal clutch over a chain tightener to the main drive sprocket. Everything works fine for a while (almost an hour) and then suddenly I have toothless sprocket and a chain that doesn't bend so well (individual links seem to be seized).

I just graduated with a B.S. in Materials Engineering from Purdue University, and I'm looking to begin my career in engineering. I've been applying to jobs accordingly, generally in ""batches"" where I apply to a bunch of positions in one go, and then wait to see what comes back.

First time around, a major automotive manufacturer rejected me after an interview. Fine, I was just testing the waters then.

Second time around, interview goes well, with the interviewer saying he'll mark my profile as ""highly recommended"". 2 weeks later, I got a rejection notice again.

I had a 3rd interview with another major automotive manufacturer, and I won't hear back until maybe end of December.

Now I find out the manufacturer got bought by a competitor a couple years ago, and now there is basically no tech support or spare parts for my 4-year-old sonar. So I'm on my own...



* I need to convert 143 VDC to 48 VDC. 
* Max output current is 600-900 mA. 
* 48VDC needs to be clean.
* Size must be smaller than hockey puck. 
* Heat must be kept to a minimum. 



An off the shelf converter would be preferred, but I can solder up circuits on perfboard and print simple PCBs in the shop if needed. I just have no idea what components are practical for this application.

I first thought a simple LM317-type voltage regulator circuit might work, but I've never worked with supply voltages that high (143V), and heat must be kept to an absolute minimum.

Here's the closest thing I've found off the shelf. Would it work?

5.4.1.1.1Lay the vertical edge of the membrane at one side of the plastic panel.
5.4.1.1.2Starting at the edge, carefully press or wipe the MSTP to the backer so as to engage the adhesive to the backer without trapping excessive amounts of air.
5.4.1.1.3Continue the membrane application to the horizontal center of the plastic panel.
5.4.1.1.4At this point, 50% of the backer mounting surface area should be covered by the bonded MSTP.

I am an undergraduate ME and an intern at a machined parts supplier. I have been assigned to address a safety concern in the company. I believe there are more reliable solutions to this concern, but the details do not pertain to the task for which I am asking for help here today.

[Quick sketch of the problem.](http://i.imgur.com/rWy1luH.jpg)

My boss asked me to predict (calculate) what will happen once this I beam lifts the gear beam off of its supports, in order to justify changing the way we currently lift the gear beam or disprove the proposed method you see in the sketch . I have marked the CG of the gear beam as shown. My intuition tells me that once the gear beam is lifted off the supports, it will rotate CCW until its CG is a minimum distance from the ground. This will cause the I beam to rotate about the cable. 

My question is, what do I do to show exactly how much each component will rotate? I have looked through my dynamics books, my statics books, and my calculus book, but nothing deals with something of this sort. I have considered calculating the instantaneous center for the gear beam, but the problem with that is that it changes as the gear beam rotates. 

How may I approach this problem; and is solving this a realistic expectation of me by my boss? 

I can provide more details if necessary; I appreciate any input I can get on this. Thank you!

I'm stuck between knowing that I don't need a powerful laptop for my last year of college and having no idea what I'll be doing or need from a laptop because I don't yet have a job. 

Is it common for mechanical engineers to need personal laptops with the specs to run 3D CAD programs with large assemblies on the go? Should I be looking at a mobile workstation for my next computer, or just go with a reliable laptop that can run Excel, MATLAB, 20+ tabs 'cause that's how I roll, etc.?

I know all mechanical engineering jobs are different, but I'm mostly putting this out here for peace of mind. At this point I'm leaning pretty heavily toward just getting a reliable laptop.

Planar magnetic my headphones specifically benefit from high-current amplifiers. The headphone drivers are low-impedance, but the manufacturer recommends high wattage from the amplifiers - my amp, for example, maxes out at 6W which is massive for headphone amps. Would these require a thicker gauge wire?

Or in the case of a regular headphone that comes with a thick, heavy gauge wire - if I were to swap it with a thinner-gauge cable, is there a point at which a cable can be too thin?

58,"Electric vehicle motor questions: Induction Vs. Permanent magnet brushless, low voltage Vs high voltage",1480822916,"Could anyone provide some enlightenment regarding electric motors, specifically those you would design for an electric vehicle? My understanding is that induction motors don't generate as much torque and are heavier compared to a brushless PM motor. I've heard that you can achieve some cool effects by changing the voltage of one set of coils in relation to the other (inner vs outer) and that because it's made entirely of copper and aluminium they are cheaper compared to an exotic neodynium magnet. I've heard that you can alter the kV of these motors, but i'm absolutely uninformed on these sort of motors.

Brushless seems more expensive and exotic but more efficient and torque-y (probably because the extra power you save by being more efficient goes to the motor... Right?) as well as being lighter and denser, as well as lacking brushes. I've used these quite a lot and I like to think I know quite a bit about them. Are there any reason you might choose induction over brushless I might not have thought of?

I've also noticed industrial motors use inverters and bump up voltage to 390 to sometimes over a thousand volts where brushless are always happier at lower voltage. Why is this?

My understanding is that by having a huge voltage and a very low kV, you can draw almost no amps and make the same torque, reducing heat. Do induction motors only use high voltage to reduce brush losses?

Recently, he overstepped with someone other than me and I decided to put an end to this and spilled everything I knew to my boss. And things got really bad for him.

My boss wants my support in getting him fired for his past transgressions and for the toxic environment he managed to create under their radar. They are really angry the fact he insulted them and criticized them in front of other coworkers, including new arrivals, and they have no intention of keeping him around more than necessary.

Now, I have no proof of this, just the fact I was there. The owners are more than willing to fire him based on my word, and want me to support their decision in case they go all the way and fire him for cause.

Right now, I have the power to fire his ass or calm the waters by talking to them. What would you do in my position?",AskEngineers,neon54,/r/AskEngineers/comments/5g5trp/my_boss_asked_me_if_i_was_willing_to_be_a_witness/
82,Please advise on flexible plastic/rubber material choice for outdoor application.,1480712205,"Designing a bike lock cable retaining system (picture a retracting tape measure with steel cables instead of tape), and plan to secure it to the bike frame with flexible straps (picture along the lines of flexible plastic/rubber wristwatch straps). 

Looking for a material with reasonable tensile strength and elasticity, that can also withstand elemental factors such as sunlight/dirt/water/oil/solvents. Natural rubber and silicone, like used in watch straps, seem to be disqualified but I might be wrong about that. 

Googling yields a lot of different options, but I was hoping someone with real world experience could show me a practical choice.

83,"When building a house, what would be the most important precaution in avoiding both creaking floors and being able to hear people above you walking around.",1480701714,"Hello,

This may be a question for ask-science.

I live in a basement apartment and I have rowdy students upstairs who often stomp their feet. This quickly led me to the question of sound proofing between floors. Here are my suggestions:

0) The option to install carpet should be considered, but if that is under consideration then pure rubber should too. So for the purposes of this question I am going to assume hardwood floors. Floor thickness is also not under strict regulation, however realistically 1.5 feet should be maximum thickness. 

1) Obviously insulation between floors is a must, and dense insulation at that. Sound-proofing boards are expensive for their return, but would be installed to help. Perhaps a gyprock that is impact resistant?

2) 1/8"" rubber sheets between joist connections to minimize the transfer of energy.

3) Introducing a method of flexibility in the joists or floorboards. Perhaps by introducing a thick / thicker sheet of dense foam between the hardwood and the sub layers.

Rule 3) Google searches: The suggestions I have received  all pertain to installing insulation that is meant for sound proofing. Occasional suggestions are about sound proofing boards. However I am particularly looking for examples that may not be commercially available, but would be easy to implement and help considerably.

Thank you for your time.

84,Leaving job after 3 months after being recruited,1480700559,"I just started a job 3 months ago with a start-up second generation biofuels company. After 1 month at corporate, they decided to move me to the plant. Another advanced biofuels company is trying to recruit me in the same area and I am trying to make a decision on whether I pursue this opportunity or not. The second company is much more stable and established and is offering what amounts to a promotion with better compensation. 

A little background on me. I just graduated with my M.S. Before that, I worked in the biofuels industry for 2 years with 2 different companies. My concern is I will be viewed negatively as a job hopper, especially after leaving a job only 3 months in. I am not unhappy with my current company, and the compensation is nothing to scoff at. I am just wondering if I should seriously consider this opportunity as it does feel like an advancement in my career.

2. does your night shift differ from morning shift?
3. how bad is it? is it managable?
4. how is it being on call?
5. any horror stories?

99,"Why do I need to go to an ABET accredited school if I don't want to be a ""Serious"" Engineer",1480655009,"Background on me:
I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and a certificate in CNC machining from my local community college. I currently work for a technology manufacturing company as a Quality Technician. My new main career goal is to become a Quality Engineer. 

Now, I want to go back to school to get an Associate's Degree in either manufacturing or mechanical engineering. I've been researching the difference between going to an ABET accredited school v. A non ABET accredited school and I would prefer to go to the non ABET school because it's closer to me. 

Now my question is do I need to go to an ABET accredited school to become a ""non serious"" Quality Engineer? All I want to do is do paperwork, attend meetings and check things from time to time. I don't want a PE license either. I just want to check things to make sure it's correct. 

Is there anyone on this forum that is a Quality Engineering and can provide me with some information as to what they really do? Ive shadowed the one that works for my company and he isn't doing anything serious and it looks like I can do what he does. Some of the tasks that I currently do at my company is normally assigned to manufacturing engineers according to job postings at other companies. I can't apply for some of these jobs because I don't have an engineering degree hence why I have to go back to school.
