0,Automotive ME looking to move from EU to Canada,1551452495,"Hello,

  
I am a Mechanical Engineer working for about 6 years in Mechanical Design. For the first 3 years I worked as a Design Engineer in a Consultancy firm that took on some European automotive clients. The last 3 years I have been working in a fairly large Tier 1 automotive supplier Company as a Development Engineer. My work ranges from Designing and Developing automotive displays to their verification. I also did a masters in Product Design. Currently I am in EU.  


My biggest problem is that after 6 years of experience I am earning way less than I should be. (less than 27K Euros per annum). For exactly this reason I want to move to Canada. Firstly because of lower taxation and secondly because as a Pakistani national, immigrating to Canada is easier and opens the employment door for me to US.   


My questions are

1. What is the demand currently -if any- in Canada for Engineers with similar experience? I would be happy to talk to any ME who is currently working in the same region.
2. What are the ranges of salaries that ME's with similar experience earn in Canada? I have looked at some salary websites but I would appreciate if some engineers here share their numbers.
3. I want to transition towards consumer electronics and product design, are there any startups or small to medium enterprises that hire Mechanical Engineers in this sector?

Lastly I would appreciate if there are any job hunting websites that you would recommend, I already have a profile on [Indeed.com](https://Indeed.com/).

34,Is it possible to use periscope optics to make an optical zoom for a camera similar to Light L16?,1551388107,"For background, I found out that Asus made a smartphone called the ZenFone Zoom (ZX551ML). It uses a periscope based optical zoom. Oppo made a prototype phone using the same principle. The problem is that it only uses one small digital camera sensor. The Light L16 uses many small sensors and lenses then stitches the images automatically. The problem is that the focal lengths are fixed.

A solution I thought of was combining many small periscope zoom lenses with many small sensors and image stitching. This is because the phone with the periscope optical zoom is still slim. I know periscope optics are used to see around or above. For example, if you want to look above a wall without popping your head up, you can pop up a periscope lens and look through. Is it possible to use the periscope principle to maintain the same level of overlap while adjusting the angle of view at an optical level? Can it support an aperture of f/1.4 or wider all while using 1/1.5 (2/3) inch sensors?

43,Question about master's degree,1551376251,"Hi /r/AskEngineers,

I've come to a realization lately that I'm not going to be able to find work in my desired field (Automation &amp; robotics) without getting some kind of master's degree (I'm leaning towards control systems right now). I was wondering if any engineers here who already have a master's degree could lend me some of their wisdom/advice for how to move forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I try to find a school that I can attend full-time and get a masters degree in 2-ish years, or should I continue working full time and take classes 1-2 at a time (thus getting a degree in more like 8 years?). 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about me (if it helps): I have a degree in mechanical engineering, I'm currently employed as a software engineer writing code for industrial machinery. I'm a bachelor living in a rental property in San Diego, CA (USA). I would prefer to go to school full time for 2 years but I don't think I could afford to go to school and pay rent simultaneously, if there's anybody here who did do something like that I'd be interested to hear about your experiences.

44,Manager bias on BSME vs BSMET,1551374370,"Hello all, so the story basically goes like this. We have an opening at my work and the manager is being very restrictive on the degree type. He wants a mechanical engineering degree or a electrical engineering degree. The position is not entry level, but it is not senior either. Maybe 2 years of experience needed. We have had few applicants that have either, as there are no schools near us with engineering programs and we are in the woods so the local populous is thin. Maybe 10 semi-qualified applicants in 5 months. But, there is a school with a BSMET/BSEET program that is ABET accredited. From my point of view, this role is heavy on the MechE side of things, so I don't think ElecE is the best match.

We have an applicant, he is great, comes in and interview well. Did 1 year at a startup, and some internships. But the manager read his resume wrong. He thought he had a BSME when he had a BSMET. Besides that, he is the strongest candidate we have had and everything else matches up to me. Experience, education, pay range, commute distance, seems like a cultural fit. Manager won't proceed because he needs a BSME. There is no requirement for a P.E., E.I.T., or anything like that.

About me, I got my AS in mechanical engineering tech and transferred to a 4 year BS program for straight mechanical engineering. Later, I ended up getting a 2nd BS in mechanical engineering tech because it was only a few additional courses. I feel this gives me the best insight for how he could perform on the job given his skill set. For me, the two degrees are so similar it is practically nuance. The difference in my two degrees was talking one calc course, chem course, a few specific electives, and another senior thesis. I know some of you will disagree that a BSMET is not comparable to a BSME, but I think it is for the working world.

My question for those in management, can you think of a reason why he is so hellbent on needing a BSME? Perfectly good candidate to fill a role we have needed filled for months comes up, but a simple degree difference is stopping him. How can I convince him otherwise? Is this bias fairly prevalent?

52,Formula For Calculating Volume of a standard Hoover/Hoyer ISO Chemical tank?,1551362733,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

At my current workplace, we have around 7 of these ISO specification tanks for various chemicals. At the end of each production process, we have a guy who goes up to each of them and gets a strap via a strap stick. The ISO tanks are the Hoover Fergusson, Hoyer, and DANA models.

&amp;#x200B;

This causes a few problems: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Safety- Guy has to have a restraint harness and face shield every-time he does this. There is still the risk of falling off. It's also winter in Oklahoma- it is cold and windy af.
* Variances - Guy 2 on dayshift may strap differently than guy 2 on night shift and guy 3 on dayshift might strap the same as guy 1 on night shift. If it's dark out, it's hard to read the strap stick. Strap charts from the manufacturer are estimations, not exact amounts. This causes variances in chemical totals, inherently causing us to lose money or over bill the client, since we aren't getting the real volumes pumped. And since we aren't getting the exact volumes pumped, it's harder to calibrate our pumps.
* Time- It takes the guy 20 minutes or so to do all this, this is time he could be doing other work.

&amp;#x200B;

My idea is to setup a digital ultrasonic tank level metering system where all the tanks readouts are sent to the data acquisition system. The biggest problem I've come up with this is that I don't have the tank dimensions to create a formula to make an exact strap chart of an ISO container. It's not a simple horizontal tank- it has domed ends. I just need this data so I could derive the equation.

59,Need some advice on how to proceed further with working out a data/automation architecture,1551350051,"**Setting**  


I work at a cell therapy engineering company. We don’t deal with the biological aspect in detail, but rather develop automated processes for the production of these therapies. We are involved in a project where they are setting up a new manufacturing environment for stem cell production, and are tasked with developing the data architecture for environmental monitoring (pressure differential + airborne particles). The pressure differential ensures that the chamber in which the production is taking place, is kept sterile (i.e. only outward airflow). The airbone particles should be limited to a certain upper threshold in order to ensure manufacturing compliancy. The actual implementation of the hardware necessary for running the data architecture will be done by a subcontractor (most likely Siemens).   


&amp;#x200B;

 **Work so far**  


I have worked out a high-level schematic for the architecture which will make sure that no production can take place when the environment (= the ‘RISP’) is not sterile (a GMP requirement). This is done by maintaining a sterility status in the cloud which is changed according to this [very simple state diagram](https://imgur.com/a/9rOjCMw). The electronic batch record system they use in production will communicate with the cloud and refuse to go to a next step if the status is ‘not-sterile’. The high-level architecture I worked out, along with some extra info can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/gFaSxFv). Upon showing this to my boss, he said: ‘OK, work it out further’.   


&amp;#x200B;

**My question**  


What would be the typical next step for working this out, one more level in detail? Intuitively I am thinking about something analogous to P&amp;ID diagrams. If you know where I could find an example or learning resources on this, that would be great!

71,Feeling discouraged about job search this far. What do I need to do that I’m not doing?,1551325152,"I am a senior ME with a minor in Business graduating this May. I have been interning at a prototyping machine shop at one of the top three defense contractors out there (won’t say which one) over the past two years. I have learned a lot about machining practices and general engineering and manufacturing techniques during my time here. I would say my experience on my resume looks very good to most. My old boss has reviewed my resume and says it looks good and I also have reached out to colleagues for criticisms and made appropriate changes. 

However my (now) former boss who originally made it sound like he would hire me just switched departments and is now a center manager for one of the main manufacturing segments of production operations. He is helping me out and writing recommendations to the hiring managers of the listings that I apply for. He also warned me that if I start out at my department it would be hard to move up in the company because this department is physically removed from the main facility. It would be hard to network and limit FaceTime with the high brass in the corporation.

Anyways, it is now almost March and I still have no interviews at this company that I wish to work for. I have applied to approximately 13 listings and haven’t heard back on a single one yet.  Disclaimer: I do have an interview at a smaller company as a materials engineer but it would require me moving away to a small town far away and I’m not sure if I’m ready to make that move.

Now I know I should be able to find something, but this is what discouraged me. I met with a senior mechanical engineer who told me a lot of the interns in the program I am have already been hired on and were hired on this past fall. Am I too late on the draw?  I am really starting to get worried that I won’t be able to find something at this company and once I graduate I will no longer be able to work there and it will be much harder to get my foot back in there once I am an outsider. 

So my question for you engineers is what can I further do to help my job search? I have a meeting with a senior systems engineer next week and also reached out to another ME in charge of hiring all of the graduating ME’s this past week.  But I have been grinding my ass off trying to get something to land and nothing has yet.

I try to just believe that something will happen but it just discouraged me when the guy I met with told me a lot of the positions are already filled up. It was just intimidating.

But it’s not definite which concerns me. we also hired a new staff engineer in January and I am afraid we won’t have enough work to bring me on the staff.

my design group and I trying to figure out the force to split wood. I'm curious if anyone could point me in the correct direction of doing hand calculations to predict the splitting force . The diameter of our hypothetical log (northern red oak) is 18"" and the length is 18"". Is there an equation to determine what force would need to be applied to split the wood with an axe wedge. The end goal is to pick a motor that has the optimal amount of force to split the wood (FoS=2) Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

From a sales perspective prototypes are worth $0 and there are no customers who will be pissed off if their order is late so prototypes almost always take the back burner compared to normal orders. Second issue is that engineering support is weak on the shop floor for prototypes. We only have 4 manufacturing engineers to the 7 design engineers. The design engineering manager doesn't believe that design engineer should have a presence on the shop floor. But manufacturing engineers don't have the bandwidth to support prototypes an addition to their normal job. Bottom line is prototypes are left high and dry.

I'm curious how other manufacturing companies handle their prototype processes. In my opinion I think the design engineer should be present on the shop floor throughout the whole entire manufacturing process learning and trying to design out issues that they encounter during production. I guess another way to phrase my question is where do you draw the line between manufacturing and design engineering responsibilities?

77,Career advice for a new engineer: is this a toxic work environment?,1551320172," 

All,

Full disclosure, this is a throwaway and if this is an inappropriate topic for this sub I apologize. I'm just looking for some advice from my fellow engineers regarding my career and workplace culture.

Some background:

I am a newbie engineer in my first role out of school (\~1 year). I work for a small niche manufacturer that is growing rapidly and it seems like it is going through some severe growing pains. I work with a team of engineers that handle everything from in-house automation to everyday plant support/process engineering/after hours on-call etc. We're essentially in-house integrators since in the past year the company saw the largest capital expense projects it had seen in its entire 50 year history. A large reason for my hiring was this massive undertaking. I was managing multi-million dollar capex projects right out of school. 15-16 hour days were not uncommon. I probably had one or two of those every month for the past year.

The team that I'm on has grown very close since we went through all of this together. My manager in particular was a rock during this whole thing and was extremely supportive and filtered out a lot of the internal politics so that we could focus on our jobs. We are much less busy now since most of the projects are in the closing phases. However, a few weeks ago he was abruptly let go for not meeting requirements set by his boss that were all completely unknown to us. We believed he was a great manager and many other people in the company respected him. I personally believe he was scapegoated for some poor business decisions made by people higher up. My coworkers were devastated and morale is at an all time low in the department. What adds insult to injury here is that we were lied to about his termination. We were all told by his boss, an executive in the company, that he left by choice; however, I am still in contact with my now former manager and he said that all of it was patently false. He was terminated. What is worse is that we have other people in the company asking my team what company my former boss left for. He is unemployed and I am feeling pressure to lie about the nature of his termination.

My managers ex-boss, the executive, is now assuming the role of engineering manager along with his other duties. I happened to be out of the office on the day that my boss was terminated. When I returned I expected the executive to come and speak with me about the new arrangements in the department. He didn't. He came into our office and made some small chit-chat about the weekend and didn't even address the termination or me. I had to physically walk into his office later on in the morning to ask him about the situation. We also have a new engineer starting in a week and no one has any idea who is handling the training and on-boarding of this new engineer since the executive has been out of the office for over a week.

I am basically at a loss for what to do. I consider myself highly motivated, but I'm feeling burnt out and quite honestly betrayed by this company that I've worked hard for. I enjoy my work greatly and I take a lot of pride in what I do, but office politics (a few very toxic people in middle management are able to dictate essentially everything in the facility - including my project priorities) and the recent situation with my manager has left me not wanting to go into work, unmotivated, and unsure about my position within the company. I am very conflicted since I love my team and I really want to gain some experience at this company for at least a few years, but it is no longer seeming possible given the circumstances. Jumping ship is the obvious answer, but I am slightly worried that my lack of experience would be very detrimental and a career move this early on seems like I'd be shooting myself in the foot.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? What did you do? And is this normal for a company and an executive to act this way?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. And like I said initially, if this post is inappropriate for this sub I apologize.

What materials could i use? Sure i could use silver but that would be hella expensive. I have seen that some copper cooking-ware have a Tin lining, so it might be possible to just electroplate the inner part or just melt it directly in the pan and smear it out  (as it would melt right of on the outside if i put it over the flames.)

3,Is a PVC Pressure Vessel Acceptable If Max Pressure is 7 psi? If so what should the fit between parts be?,1551294926,"Hello,  

&amp;#x200B;

My company initially designed a pressure vessel composed of a schedule 40 PVC pipe and two caps to seal either end. Primer and PVC cement was used to permanently bind the three parts together. The nominal diameter of the caps and pipe is 2”, wall thickness is at least 0.154” and the length of the pipe is 5”. The internal volume of the pressure vessel is about 15 in\^3 and max air pressure it undergoes is 7 psi. I need to redesign this pressure vessel so it is easier to make and easier to control the internal volume. I have two options as shown below, but I’ve run into several questions I can’t seem to answer from searching on the internet.  I do not have experience with pressure vessels and I was hoping you all might have some insight.    

1. The first option is to continue to use PVC but have it custom machined so we can better control the internal volume. I have two questions about this option:  

* I recognize that PVC should not be used for air pressurization in most cases due to safety issues. However, because the definite **max pressure the vessel will experience is 7 psi and the schedule 40 PVC parts have a max pressure rating of 180 psi, is it okay to still use PVC?**    

If the pressure vessel eventually leaks after several years of use this wouldn’t be a huge problem as we can replace it,   
but I am more concerned that this could one day injure someone based on all the warnings about PVC and air.    

* If we choose to stay with PVC, does anyone know **what the tolerance between the OD of the pipe and the ID of the caps should be?** I’ve found references to interference/press fits for PVC fitting, but not exact ASME or ISO interference fit standards. Also, those standards have tolerances significantly smaller than most machining capabilities it appears.  

2. The second option is to move away from PVC to a different plastic, so that we can instead mold the parts and also use a material meant to handle air pressure. I have two questions about this option:  

* Through my research it is obvious that most pressure vessels are made of metal and thus most guides and most of the ASME standard assumes you are using metal. However due to cost, weight, and a rather low max pressure the vessel will undergo, my company was hoping to stick with plastic. I can’t find much literature on plastic pressure vessels, but I did find an article that mentioned PET or HDPE. **Do you have any plastic material suggestions or opinions on PET or HDPE?**   
* We currently seal the PVC pressure vessels using primer and PVC cement. If we move to another plastic this will likely not be an option. **What are some options to seal the plastic cap to the plastic pipe?**

I have a tech diploma from college and I worked for Baker Hughes for a year before they became GE. 

I want to leave O&amp;G and switch to HVAC but my problem is that I have no relevant experience, only 1 year in O&amp;G. I am in the process of getting certified in LEED GA and learning how to use Revit MEP. I believe ASHRAE would be a nice addition too.

I can learn the software and get the certifications, but some postings say ""if you only have Oil and Gas experience, you will not be considered"". So what do I do in this case? 

Some people told me to stick it out for another year and try to relate Oil and Gas experience into HVAC. It does not look good if I switch jobs after 1 year. But I feel like the longer I stay in O&amp;G, the harder it will be to switch because I will be more embedded into that field.

What I mean by this is that by next semester I will have taken calc1-3, a proof based linear and ordinarily diff eq, so I don’t consider these courses as advanced mathematics.

Here are two pictures for voice coils: One is a \[moving coil actuator\](([https://www.h2wtech.com/Images/ncc-diagram.jpg](https://www.h2wtech.com/Images/ncc-diagram.jpg)), the other is a \[moving magnet\]([https://www.h2wtech.com/Images/ncm-diagram.jpg](https://www.h2wtech.com/Images/ncm-diagram.jpg)) version. There is a lot of information on voice coil operation, there's also a very nice, if a little brief on detail, open actuator project \[here\]([http://openactuator.org/](http://openactuator.org/)).

But I'm still unclear about a couple things. About positional control, for either a moving coil, or a moving magnet, the position is proportional to the current put into the coil. Most designs are closed loop requiring an encoder or slide potentiometer to report back the position to the microcontroller.

* Question 1: Once force is applied to slide the actuator to some position at a high current, is a spring or some other physical force required to bring the slider back?
* Question 2: For a sliding magnet, i dont get where the control is proportional. why does a magnet that is fully inside of a coil move at all? Wouldnt it just sit within the magnetic field formed by the coil? Or is that drawing kind of off, and the magnet would actually need to be longer than the coil in order to work?

I hope this is the right subreddit for this question, and if it is not if someone could point me to a more relevant one it would be greatly appreciated. 

My situation is this:

I am an Instrument and Electrical Technician at a natural gas power plant. For one of our control systems the company needs to make some extensive logic changes due to incorrect design during an upgrade/conversion from Micronet to ABB S+. 

I am fairly adept and from working as the technical lead on the upgrade and working heavily with the startup field engineers I have learned how to do most of the programming. The management team has asked me to implement the logic changes that need to be made and I said I am more than willing to do so as I have in the past, but I would request that they send me an email or some other documented request on the changes they would like me to make as opposed to just a verbal communique. One of my managers is fine with that, however another is not as much. His belief is that his word is bond and it sets a dangerous precedent that other people will not do stuff unless it is in writing. I understand his side, however I feel that given the nature of changing logic and the possible consequences I am not being unreasonable. 

So am I being unreasonable or should I stand firm in wanting documented proof for liability/cya? Is this / is this not some industry standard? The one other controls engineer I have talked to have agreed with me, but I feel like he may be biased towards my POV.

The position is largely focused on material selection and design improvements for catheters and other drug delivery systems. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been asked to give a 30-45 minute presentation on a topic of my choosing. At first I thought that I would base the presentation around one of my projects at my current job, where I am a Project Engineer at an injection molder mainly serving the medical device industries. The part I would be giving the presentation on is a catheter tip, so I thought it would be a great example. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I am putting this presentation together, I am realizing that I am not actually technically allowed to present on this information. I signed an NDA when I started with my current company, and the design/ functionality of the part I would be presenting on is in no way my design or my companies design. I did have a lot to do with the manufacturability of the design, as we do go through design for manufacturing and other manufacturing issues with customers on all projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

I certainly don't want to raise any red flags with the company that I would be interviewing with, as I feel like they will know if I am giving away design information that I should not be. I have also thought about just putting ""CONFIDENTIAL"" in the corner of the presentation and calling it good. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is whether or not I should proceed with presenting on this topic? (the manufacturing and design implications of a catheter tip I am the Project Engineer for at my current company). How does one proceed when asked to give a presentation for an interview where the work that they do at their current position is considered proprietary?

One fear I have is that an engineer from the company that I am doing the work on the catheter tip for will be at the interview working for the company. I know it's unlikely, but this project has been going on for over 2 years now and the medical device world is relatively small. A lot of engineers know the kinds of projects other engineers are working on at their competitors.

I just wanted to see if anyone has heard of/used a degassing sump for heavy crude (bitumen) unloading from rail cars. To be honest, I have never heard of a degassing sump and google only shows things in regards to an aquarium. The client is requesting that a degassing sump be placed in the rail car unloading header so that the vapors can be returned back to the rail cars. So my questions are:

1. Is a degassing sump essentially operating as a separator ? 
2. Is this a complete waste of time ? I can't imagine heavy crude to be flashing off a bunch of gas to allow for a vapor balance between the degassing sump and the unloading rail cars. We will have breather valves to eliminate any concerns with pulling a vacuum.
3. is there a resource that describes crude unloading from rail cars ? My main experience was with natural gas processing plants and I've never dealt with crude.

The way I calculate the accuracy is to plug in the FS value for each, and then adding the LSD at the end of each. Meaning you would have a blanket tolerance of 0.287 PSI ± 1 LSD for either unit. 

The other method of doing this has been adding the 1 LSD to the PSI side making the tolerance ± 0.387 PSI across the board and converting that to In Hg. I do not agree with this as adding the 0.1 PSI and doing the conversion afterwards changes the full scale of the unit by 0.1 PSI.

66,Any Environmental or Ecological Engineers available for a short interview?,1551201284,"  

Hello,

I'm currently enrolled in college in the U.S. on a path to become an Environmental or Ecological Engineer. One of my courses, microeconomics, has given me a career analysis assignment in which we investigate our chosen career's job growth, future potential, and day-to-day experiences and qualifications. One of the ways we acquire some of this information is through an interview with a person currently employed in our career choice. I have reached out to several engineering firms both local and national and have either received no response or not been able to be put into contact with an engineer. So, I decided to try to cut through the red tape and reach out directly to engineers through Reddit at home, on their lunchbreaks, or sitting on the toilet. 

What I am looking for is an Environmental or Ecological engineer who can take the time to answer ten questions, possibly taking around 20-30 minutes to complete. I've received the ok from my instructor that no personal information need be passed around since we are operating through an internet forum. I apologize in advance for any gross formatting or rule violations, this being what I think is my first actual post on reddit. I did check the sidebar for past interviews however the questions I was provided with differ, and didn't want to sort of fudge that information just to fit in line with my questions. I wasn't positive on if those who volunteered in the 2018 list of engineers willing to be interview were still active, so thought I would cast a wider net with this post due to time constraint issues.

I have included the questions below. Feel free to answer either through DM to me or right in the comments so others can read it. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Interview Questions--

Job Title:

1. What do you do in a typical day or week? How much time are you in meetings, on the phone, on the road, and working in teams versus working by yourself?

2. What kinds of decisions do you have to make? 

3. What skills are most critical to your success?

4. What personal qualities are important to being successful in this job?

5. What types of opportunities exist for advancement in this field? What are the keys to such advancement? 

6. What part of this job do you find most satisfying? 

7. What part of this job do you find most challenging?

8. How do you see jobs in this field changing in the future?

9. What special advice would you give to people entering this field/occupation?

86,Likelihood of Being Hired as PLC Programmer With Violent Felony?,1551156613,"Being a ""free"" person with a felony conviction on my record can sometimes make me an unpopular person.  But as a person whose crime took place a decade ago,  and who has a family, one still must find a way to make a living. I have a computer science degree and am still pursuing further education. 

Up until this point in my life, my goal was to pursue a career in computer programming, but with no direct experience, other than my own software firm (rather unsuccessful at this point), and a felony conviction, I'm having trouble finding work. It occurred to me that I might find an easier shake in the industrial fields (factories, etc). And that's when it dawned on me to become a PLC programmer. So I'm just looking for some advice on how hard the ground is in this field regarding past convictions. Other than that, I'll share some other mitigating factors about my situation below. I appreciate any responses.  


1. My felony is second-degree assault in Missouri. 
2. Expungement is not an option.
3. My crime happened ten years ago.
4. It did not include theft, drugs, and given that it is second-degree, it was not premeditated. 
5. It was a fist fight. 
6. Since that time, I've gone to school, started my own temporarily successful business, achieved many certifications and academic accolades. 
7. I never saw the inside of a prison cell, but was sentenced to probation.
8. I walked my probation in half the time I was supposed to be there, because it was deemed that I was in no way a danger to myself or others (good behavior).
9. Besides this charge, I've never had even a speeding ticket. 
10. I have not re-offended in any way since the event.
11. I have letters of recommendation from clients, co-workers, teachers, and colleagues, attesting to my skills and sanity.
12. I have no tattoos, or piercings, and have a very large vocabulary (not bragging, this could be useful for demonstrating normalcy and intelligence). 

Sorry about the length of the question, I just wanted to be thorough and honest. Thanks again to any who take the time to respond to me. I appreciate it. ",AskEngineers,False,Zdragon1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/auv7q4/likelihood_of_being_hired_as_plc_programmer_with/

96,Can anyone offer me advice for finding a position within MechE - Feel like I am stuck in unemployment,1551136247,"I feel like I am stuck without the ability to find a job in Mechanical Engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated from a fairly good public SEC college and graduated with a 3.88/4.00. I did a two-term internship, a semester of research, and worked as a peer tutor for the latter half of my education. I feel like I have a decent overall experience package.

The issue, however, is that I have received very little interviews or interest from companies. I never thought I would have this much difficulty getting a job post-graduation. I think my issues are these:

1. My internship was during the full 2016 year and I graduated in May 2018. So, its old. Retrospectively I see I should have done another internship.
2. While I graduated in May 2018, I took May-July to travel through Europe. Yes, probably not wise for my professional career, but I figured it was a good life experience decision given that I probably wont have that much time off until retirement. So, not working out of college for 2 months probably didn't help.
3. I'm working now, but it's so far from my degree and interests, that it adds 0 value to my experience. It just helps me pay for living expenses. It's not even a position that requires a degree, but pays fairly well.
4. I don't really think grad school is a feasible possibility for me. I took the GRE my senior year, and my scores were average at best. I wouldn't want to put myself under a huge financial burden when I already owe money on my undergrad.

I guess I just sort of feel trapped and that I am now in an area where no company wants to hire me because I graduated in May of last year, my internship is old, and my current employment doesn't really add any MechE experience.

To note;

1. I have really good interpersonal skills (I know that's subjective, but still) and have a professional appearance, but it appears that this doesn't even matter because I can't get past the initial resume/transcript/cover letter screening.
2. I've tried reaching out to people within specific companies via LinkedIn, and that seems to be pretty ineffective. Maybe 10-20% respond and often times they aren't really able to help much..

Can anyone offer any sort of advice to me? I'm not sure what to do anymore and I feel that aimlessly applying to jobs that fit my low-experience qualifications hasn't been working out. I would really appreciate anything to help me out. It's starting to really eat away at maintaining a positive attitude about my career and life in general.

Problem is, I've never really sized a hydraulic system before and I was wondering if anyone here had some pointers.

33,"For those that got a postgraduate degree while working, how did you do it?",1551100477,"Hi all.  
  
I graduated last May with a degree in Mechanical and in Aerospace Engineering. I'm working with a great company now and they have programs in place to pay for my masters (something like $5500/yr.) However, there are a few issues:  
  
1) I've managed, but I'm not going to lie and say that it isn't relatively hard to adjust to such a rigid schedule. In school, there were bad weeks (worse than my worst weeks at work), but there were plenty of good ones too (a few homework assignments and a classes is all I had to do). Now, it's the same thing, day in and out, and I do feel like overall I have a lot less free time. And I don't want to spend the little free time I have doing schoolwork.  
  
2) I still don't know quite what I want to go back to school for. I don't know if I want to go for an MBA, an MS in CS, or maybe an MS in EE/ME/AE. I've been here almost 8 months, which isn't too long, but I do feel like it's long enough for me to have determined what is valuable to the program here. But I think all of those options have value, and it's hard for me to envision what I want to do in the future. I think that I'm being molded to eventually step into a tech lead position, but I'm not sure if that's what I want.  
  
3) How late is too late? I don't want to keep pushing it off forever, because I'll make more money with a postgraduate degree. I also feel like I'm wasting money by not taking advantage of my companies tuition assistance. Also, I think that the more removed I am from school, the less likely I'll be to go back. I can kind of see that happening already.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
  
So, I guess to sum things up, I'll ask a few direct questions:  
  
- How old were you when you decided to go back to school?  
  
- How valuable is a postgraduate degree?  
  
- How did you decide what to get your postgraduate degree in?  
  
- Was it worth it?

40,How do I find a career that suits my disabilities?,1551088450,"  

I'm a science and engineering graduate, .I completed my PhD two years ago at the age of 28, and Since then, I have had and lost two jobs due to my disabilities.

I'm dyslexic and dyspraxic, which for the purpose of this discussion, means I struggled with reading and writing, my learning place is  also slower, and I can struggle to hear the spoken word in loud environments.

In my first job, I was part of a production team making thin film devices. This was excellent I first thought, as I was utilising all the thin film deposition and characterisation skills I developed during my PhD. Turns out, I struggled a lot. At the very start, I made a big mistake, where I misheard a number my manager told me when I was working. This didn't appear to have any major impact, but it came a frequent talking point regarding my competency. Later, when I was given a big task to do by myself, I accident made a small mistake, which resulted in me braking something within the vacuum chamber we were suing. This meant the chamber had to then be evacuated, setting the entire production team back about a week.

My confidence was completely in the pits after this, and I was asked to resign shortly after.

When I started my job hunt immediately after, I wanted something office based, or outside the loud of the loud environments where my dyslexia wouldn't be much of an issue.

Thankfully, after a few months of searching a very enthusiastict agent wanted me to apply for a role as a scientist in a mass spec company. I had no prior experience in mass spec, but with a strong positive attitude, I managed to ace the process and get the position. I spent my days working in a quite offices, so my difficulty hearing wasn't that big of an issue, however, I still completed my training at a lot slower pace, leading to me being asked to leave again at the end of my probation.

That was less than a month ago, and right now, I'm trying to decide what to do with my career. I am looking for another science and engineering role, but I’m concerned that no matter how hard I try, my disabilities are going to hold me back.  
 

An alternative I have discussed, is moving out of the engineering/science roles, and moving more into a service role. Something that involves me using the skills I have developed for a repetitive task might better suit me, but I have never looked at positions outside of science and engineering, and have no idea what would suit me.

The replacement motor for the drill is a Mabuchi [RS-550VC-8518](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MABUCHI-RS-550VC-8518-DC-12V-18V-24V-22000RPM-High-Speed-Electric-Drill-Motor-/262967820012).

48,Confused Engineering Physics Major,1551066005,"Hello, all!

I am a sophomore at Cornell University who is currently pursuing a double major in Engineering Physics and Computer Science. I have just discovered that after graduation, I want to pursue a career in either robotics, aerospace engineering, or both. I am unsure how to go about achieving these career goals, but I have two main options that i can think of:

1.           I can stick with Engineering Physics and Computer Science and pick up two minors in Aerospace Engineering and Robotics. I would then apply for a masters of engineering in aerospace engineering at my university. Given my current GPA, I have a pretty good chance of getting in.

2.           I can switch out the computer science major for a mechanical engineering major, and double major in Engineering Physics and Mechanical Engineering. Because I just did an internal transfer from the college of arts and sciences to the college of engineering, it is highly unlikely that I will be able to change my primary major, which is engineering physics. I can try to do that, but it's unlikely. The drawback to switching to mechanical is that I would have to take two very expensive summer classes to catch up (assuming I can't change my primary major), and I'll miss out on aerospace and robotics minors. I could, however, also do the masters in aerospace, but if I don't get in, I will not have taken the specialized classes in robotics and aerospace offered by the minor.

I guess what I'm really asking is, will I be at a severe disadvantage for finding robotics and aerospace jobs if I am not a mechanical engineer, but instead majored in engineering physics and computer science?

51,[Career] Help Applying Interests to a Specific Engineering Field,1551060874,"A bit of background first. I'm a mechanical engineering student, and plan to graduate in the spring. I have a decent GPA (~3.2) but never got any internship or related engineering experience in college. I know this was a bad decision on my part, and will most likely hurt me in the job hunt, but that's not what this question is about. Mainly, I'm worried I don't know exactly what field of engineering I want to get into and was looking for some advice as to what specific jobs I should focus on applying to, given my interests/strengths. I have a general idea of what I'd like to do, but could really use some help from those with experience to narrow down my interests into a tangible career option. 

I'm very interested in the ""controls"" aspect of systems. I've always enjoyed video games, and I feel like a game's controls really impact its success. The most popular/commercially successful games imo have controls that are intuitive enough for the average gamer to pick up and get an immersive feeling that makes you forget you are playing a video game in a way. I feel like this feeling drives success in many other products as well, and I was wondering what specific engineering jobs would allow me to apply this interest with user interaction of a product. My senior design project is to design a robot that must navigate a course as quickly as possible, and my biggest contribution has been the implementation of a control scheme which will quickly orient the robot to the playing field.

Ideally, I'd like to be able to design/improve the part of a product that the customer interacts with. I've looked into controls system engineering and that seems a bit like what I'd like to do, but I could really use some advice/information from those more experienced in the field that know more about it. I've tried to do my own research, but nothing can replace first-hand experience.

52,Life advice. [Still trying to get into EE],1551059572,"I was accepted into university for my undergraduate in electrical engineering. Unfortunately over the first 1-2 years of school my adviser somehow influenced me to switch to mechanical engineering before I could really get into the EE curriculum. (I did seriously consider a career in mechanical design + areas of research for maybe 6 months but ultimately I don't identify or have any desire to follow that path). 

I have some experience in electro-mechanical design (batteries), working with data, and after my undergraduate degree worked for about a year in the field of solar arrays, semiconductors, p-n junctions, basic electronics, and was writing software most days (in aerospace). I think I have used every bit of electronics/electrical related education I learned (what little of it), and don't have an interest in pursuing mechanical engineering. While it was interesting, at the time I did not envision focusing on the solar industry for the rest of my life.

During this time I was accepted into a 2-year EE masters program with full funding which I was pretty excited for. But before I could start my program I had a severe medical problem that basically put my life on hold for a while. Ultimately, I had to drop out and will need to re-apply.

I'm fine now, and am currently working in a test lab. It was the first job I could find at the time (without relocating) and while it is to an extent open-ended, it is still very much in a 'mechanical' lab, which is a little depressing, (mostly environmental testing). I also didn't apply to very many places. My current role doesn't add anything really to my desired career goals or technical knowledge. It was offered that I switch to an EMC/EMI testing lab under the same company (but the only location that is hiring right now is in a state that sees more snow that I might be able to handle haha). I'm also trying to do a decent amount of self-study outside of work to catch up everything I missed out out in undergrad + work on EE projects. Virtually the only interaction I have right now with people in any sort of electrical field has been joining the local amateur radio club.

The shortest timeline I could have is re-applying to grad school this autumn. Assuming I get re-accepted at some point, I could apply for internships or other jobs after accepting a program at least for the summer or spring or so before I start school. Some people have also said to find a company and work there for several years before grad school. I also don't intend on getting anything beyond a masters right now. It would also be exciting to take part in research but based on my experience or lack of experience we'll see what happens. I think in order to get accepted for research I'll need to move positions.

I'm not quite certain of what field I will want to pursue. Eventually I want to get out of test (at least based on my experience I like design). Most likely in PCB or board design. Or maybe in RF. There's also a lot of EE I haven't really discovered. For example, I haven't had very much exposure to signal processing, but I do have a natural liking of Fourier transforms. Maybe I'll even go full software.

Basically, I don't think my current job is beneficial to my life goals or being prepared for grad school and beyond. I'm not sure what I should do right now or if I should switch jobs.

If you have any advice on how to prepare for a career in EE, how to interact with more EE's, or anything else I should be doing right now, let me know!

There are many different ways of looking at what should be included in the energy investment.  

Another, more confounding factor in making this determination, is the presence of the many highly-motivated and very well-funded ""interested parties,"" each of whom wish to influence the results of such analyses...

I recently received a coop position with a company focusing on loudspeakers, amplifiers, dsp, and control networks.

I have gotten good experience with crossover networks, audio testing in an anechoic chamber, and have gotten to work on a mechatronics testing system we use. But a lot of this was picked up along the way, not topics I have seen in my major. I am only a sophomore and haven’t learned about vibrations or even taken intro to circuits yet so this might be why.

73,Help with job hunting in the age of online applications,1551027868,"I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/areegj/short_term_uhealthy_work_environment_may_end_with/) about a week back about my fears of being laid off/fired. I truly appreciate all of the advice you all had offered. Unfortunately, my fears came true. I used a combination of everyone's advice to start looking around and preparing for the worst, but also trying to make the situation work and be mature about things. I was told the extra work I had put in the past week was noticed and appreciated, but that this just wasn't the ""right fit"" and nothing to do with capability or performance. Despite all this, I was told by the plant manager he would give a reference if needed. Luckily, I prescribe to a lot of the advice over at r/personalfinance so I am able to survive for at least 6 months with no work, but I would hate to do so.  


So, for the first time in my life (since early high school) I am unemployed and still reeling with what this means and how to proceed. Prior to now, job hunting was a hit or miss approach as I didn't have much to include on a resume to spin towards each job, and now I am faced with including this experience or not. With every job listed online and all applications being sent in through what may be more recruiters, I am extremely gun shy. My questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I include this 3 months of experience given my manager has agreed to be a reference?
2. What is the most effective method for getting in the door in the most timely manner? If I can get in front of anyone I can almost always get the ball rolling.
3. Is it worth truly customizing your resume to the point of potential BS for every job? At times, the advice surrounding that seems vague because there is only so much customization that can truly happen.
4. Can I be proactive with each job listing and call the employer or stop by their offices? The idea of sedentary job hunting bothers me.

79,How do I be a better boss/mentor,1551019529,"Hey, I have been put in charge of managing a new engineer. In my opinion he is underqualified for the work (no engineering degree but a 2 year technical degree) but if he has enough drive and capability to learn he can easily learn the tasks at hand. The problem is, he isn't progressing quickly and I don't know if I am serving him well enough. He comes to my desk for help very frequently and I help him. He struggles with basic issues that in my opinion he should know. I get frustrated when that is the stuff he gets stuck on but I don't know how to articulate when its ok for him to be asking for help and when it really isn't. It doesn't feel right to tell him that he shouldn't be asking for help on this stuff.

Recently in a review my boss said I am a very good teacher but not a good manager. I need to give him a task and have him produce the results. The problem is this guy takes so long to get a job done that the deadlines get blown way out and I have to spend a bunch of extra time picking up his slack. I address these issues to the new engineer and he talks like he understands what I say but he does not put any of it in practice. He likes to talk about his philosophy on working all the time but I need him to understand that I don't care what his philosophy is, I just want him to work. He brags about working 12 hour days but doesn't understand that I don't care because I am getting the same amount of work done in 2 hours. I gave him some modeling work in SW that should've taken him maybe a day to finish. I did 75% of it and he needed to finish the last of it so I knew everything that was going on with it and what the task was at hand to get it completed. after 3 weeks he sends me incomplete work and then when confronted he gives me a bunch of attitude because his model failed and he thinks I fucked it up. He gives me excuse after excuse but I know all of the details, I knew that he had plenty of time to get it done. I knew the work was not complicated and used very basic technique. I knew the challenge was to interpret some of the customers design and make a few minor exception. Nothing majorly risky but it was an opportunity for him to think critically about the problem and for him to think about what the customer requires and what our manufacturing techniques are capable of and make decisions. He did not show me he was remotely capable of it. He says he is struggling because he hasn't been given a project of his own yet and only been tasked with helping other people on their project but he hasn't been reliable with that work. He says the reliability issue is due to not have control of the situation and being to worried of not doing the work the way the other person wants it done. I think that's bullshit because the stuff he gets stuck on has nothing to do with that, he struggles to know what software to use or what basic processes to use. Basically the reasons he thinks he is struggling is in reality not at all the truth and as much as I try to tell him and be nice and gentle about it, he won't hear it and comes up with his own excuses. I am about to be done being gentle with it because he is kinda on his last leg.

Long story short.  I don't think this kid can cut it but I read horror stories of bosses expecting too much out of their people and not understanding the situation at hand. I am worried that I might be going too hard on this kid and I feel like an asshole. Are there any techniques for when someone comes to you with a question that they should know the answer to and you tell them to go figure it out on their own but to do it in a way that is positive and motivates them? Or when they aren't using the tools at hand properly, how I can get him to change the way he attacks work. I am losing my patience and faith in this kid but I don't want him to fail.

This seems like it would be able to be houses on a 100ish FT ship/ barge and would take about a year to give me the 11 million tones i estimate it would take to hit the surface from the highest foundations seamount mountain.

The job market felt (and still does) saturated  with no room for new grad hires without nepotism.  So I chose software because it seems pretty lucrative and easier to get into.. I do web app development in an IIoT field. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am enrolled for a masters degree in CS. I have F/E certification and half a year of experience (co-op in college). I do not work anywhere near a P.E. so I can't log work experience to take the PE.

I assume that normally you choose a well pump and pipe diameter based on the flow required, well depth, and associated friction losses etc... 

But if you already have a well pump and a deep well, and care more about the system simply sustainably providing water, I assume that you can adjust the pipe diameter in order to lift an amount of water that is commensurate with the pump's power. 

Of course, there's probably some sort of limit whereby a tiny, but extremely deep, tube simply wouldn't work. 

Can someone please help me learn which variables (head, volume, power, torque, force, friction, gravity, etc...) and calculations are relevant here? Are they the same calculations that you might use for a normal pump selection process?

I'm interested in using a paintball CO2 tank in a device prototype. As a preface I'm looking for safety/practicality advice from everyone I can think to ask, this is just one forum I'm hoping to get advice from.

Here's a schematic of the device:

https://i.imgur.com/983aHHG.jpg

I need to inflate an bag to roughly atmospheric pressure with CO2 as rapidly as possible. What I'm thinking about doing is using a standard 24oz paintball CO2 tank connected to a paintball CO2 on/off valve. At the end of the valve is the empty bag. To fill the bag, the on/off valve is opened until the bag is filled, and then shut off once fully inflated. The tank/valve must be in a vertical orientation as shown in the schematic.

I'm not an engineer but I have a healthy respect for the energy contained in high pressure vessels so safety is paramount. My main concern is the CO2 freezing during rapid depressurization, as well as the stress induced by repeated rapid freeze/thaw cycles. I'm also obviously worried about the unknown unknowns I haven't even thought to consider.

Does anyone have any insight into the safety/practicality of this setup? Do players routinely rapidly depressurize their tanks? I'm expecting my device to have a limited number of uses until needing to be discarded, so if there is a limited number of cycles it can be put through that's fine by me.

38,Corporate engineering data problem professional perspective requested,1550881506,"My company carries out inspections for buildings so that they meet basic legal requirements. Smoke detectors, white goods, cameras, plumbing and so on. We're expected to propose solutions upon discovering failures and carry out the inspection within a timeframe to meet agreed KPI targets. My role isn't technical, it is simply to receive and process basic data containing the above.

The computer system for managing this is completely fucked. It's not just difficult, or just a little uncomfortable, or just awkward in places. Most of the certificates we receive cannot be stored. The majority of requests we have for certificates by clients have to be ignored. You can't accurately tell what maintenance is finished or outstanding for a building.

For instance, as an electrical technician in our company, you will be expected to access to your mobile device for each task to demonstrate to our client that you are working in real-time. Each comes through as garble such as ""$IMPORT PLA JUNE EE!/DOWNSTAIRS. IMPORTANT. 0000000982634"" That's it. The building will also have several floors. You will have to contact the resident caretaker or the regional supervisor to understand.

If the inspection is a fail, this creates a replacement 0000000X number and is manually e-mailed through a number of people to make a basic functional decision. This takes weeks to months. In the meantime the system will continue to automatically generate 0000000X numbers regardless of what is happening in reality. This means that they will be failed again creating a huge catalog of emptiness plus it frustrates the attempt to find where the work was ever recorded if it was ever done.

If a contractor sends an inspection document, our policy is to file it on the record. Except the person who sent the order often never gave our record references to the contractor. That's because they didn't exist. With continuity broken, the certificate becomes homeless in the name of records which never existed, or might exist, or should have existed. There's no way to even know. And if we get lucky and catch a record, policy is to recreate the record upon each step of meaningful progress until there are an endless confusion of duplicates.

Obviously this wholesale direction of obfuscation and obscurity is to attain success in a preliminary mode but its continuously applied strategy is misery itself. Not only does it cause so much short-term heartache, but we now have to regularly report failed KPIs, failing in a game which we set our own rules.

I am currently a masters student Aerospace Engineering at the Delft University of Technology and am looking into finding an internship to complete my studies.

The current problem I am running into is that I find it difficult to determine whether internships I find are at a sufficient level to be taken seriously as a university student.

My question is, are there negatives to selecting the wrong internship, other than figuring out the job is at a ""University of Applied Sciences"" level while I'm there.

54,Dual purpose fridge - looking for thermodynamics feedback on an idea I had,1550865634,"I'm trying to come up with a fridge system that can be run off solar power for an off-grid camper van, but with a twist. I do a lot of winter camping and am comfortable enough sleeping in very cold temperatures (down to zero F) with just my clothes and bedding to keep warm (lots of down insulation), so I don't really see a need to keep the entire van heated (uses way too much energy for off grid anyway), however, a problem I often run into is that any food and water will quickly freeze solid unless I keep it in my sleeping bag with me. So in designing this fridge system, one of the things I'm wondering about is if something can be set up to not only keep food cold in warm weather, but maintain a temperature of 35-45 even in very cold weather. Does something like this already exist in an off the shelf product?

In the interest of keeping things cheap, simple, and (hopefully) energy efficient, my idea was to buy a mini freezer and rig it up with a lightbulb inside for heat and a thermostat that can cycle the fridge or turn on the bulb to maintain an ideal non-freezing temperature.

It's been a long time since I took thermodynamics, and I'm still in the brainstorming phase of this project so any feedback is welcomed, but I'm mostly just wondering if this makes sense. Does a light bulb even put off enough heat/is it remotely energy efficient? What size light would I need?

If it's a workable idea, any other feedback e.g. what kind of fridge/freezer I should look for (12/24/120v), what a circuit diagram for such a setup might look like, etc. would be greatly appreciated, but I haven't even begun to think that far ahead yet.",AskEngineers,False,hellomynameis_satan,/r/AskEngineers/comments/atm2q9/dual_purpose_fridge_looking_for_thermodynamics/

Half my home in Maryland has a basement, and the other half is a slab on grade. I have discovered a crack under the carpet and that the slab has sunk 1.25"" at the exterior wall. It was built in 1968 and much of the sinkage happened at least 4 years ago and at most the year it was built. I moved in 3 years ago and didn't notice this during inspection.

There is a wall going from the exterior wall inward right where the sinkage is. One side of the wall is a pantry where the previous owner added more wall base to hide the distance between the original wall base and the sunk floor.

The other side of this wall is inside some built in cabinetry so I can see the total distance of shrinkage (assuming the original base was built touching the slab) between the original base and the current slab location.

The distance between the exterior wall and the crack varies between 6' and 10'. The crack under the carpet feels as if it has sank about 1/2"".

83,Pathways into Humanitarian Engineering [bit of a long one],1550832873,"Hello there! Final-year undergrad MechE student here. I'm looking for any insight into refining and refocusing my job search. I've always had a desire to do something that helps people, predominantly due to my Christian upbringing. Recently I've been exploring what that really means and how it should impact choosing a career. 

**Background:**

The problem with looking for that in Engineering is that *help* can be open to interpretation, it's not really measurable and has clouded my judgement for some time. Prior to this I've seen every role as both useful and helpful, e.g. big into renewable energy, but I'd gladly work on fossil fuels to ensure systems are safe and secure! After a lot of reflection, I realise that whilst I see the value in all these jobs... it's not what I want. I want to be involved in projects that specifically address problems in humanitarian crisis. One example being the refugee camps like the ""jungle"" in Calais, France. 

I'm talking more abstractly here, I apologise if this comes across as naive. But I feel at this point I have narrowed my scope from ""any job will have worth and help people, so I'm happy to do anything, to: I want a job that specifically addresses disasters"" and now I need to try to refine that even further. Because that could be designing water filtration systems, setting up smart grids in remote areas, project management of products/services to get things like this made, funded and delivered. Following that I have to get paid for what I do! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

 So with that explanation out of the way:

* Does anybody here work in roles that deal with humanitarian crisis? If so, how did you get involved in it? What do you do? 
* With a theoretical-engineering mindset (lacking practical experience), are there specific roles that I should focus on? If not, are there roles that are suitable for those with an?
* Should I just get stuck in and start volunteering to see what the problems are and find ones that I can help fix?
* Are there any approaches you would advise me to consider? Warnings you have about my ideas? Am I a mad man? 

Any answers would be greatly appreciated, just to help me gain extra insight and potentially help guide the direction of my research

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a software engineer, I support coworkers if needed, but I'm being asked to bring this guy (the intern) up from virtually nothing. This will take time out of my own job (which I'll have to start passing onto others), and this is not what I want to be doing for the next 6 months...

Our team is about to get hit by a storm of new projects for 2019, and instead of focusing on producing, sharpening my skills set, practicing and learning, I have to coach the new intern so that he can one day join our team and produce.

I have nothing against the intern, let it be clear. I just don't want to be the one who does it. It's not my fault that my other two teammates work remotely so they can't do it, that doesn't mean I have to be the one to be sacrificed...

I worked for a long time on both legacy projects and cutting edge projects. In the last few months I managed to re-assign all the legacy stuff and now that I can finally focus on the best work full time, I get assigned an intern?

I am currently trying to design a custom electronic valve that operates at -30 C (roughly -22 F).

I've had some experience a few years back with BPVC Section III Div 2 when I designed a component for use with geothermal steam (don't have access to that anymore, sadly, it was at a different company than I'm at now), but I'm unfamiliar with Div 5 and I'd love to at least get an overview on the concepts before my interview, if possible. I've been having some trouble with finding much info on it beyond websites selling the code, and I don't have $585 to drop on it.

22,How to implement a Tool-management-system?,1550771993,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi! I’m a business student working full-time at a small manufacturing company.

I learned the trade of a machinist and I will finish my Bachelor of Business Administration in a couple of months.  

For my final/capstone project I want to implement a Tool-Management-System at my company.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, we have a machinery park with 5 CNC-lathes, 1 CNC-mill and a couple manual mills, lathes and other machines. Right now the tools on the shop floor are stored all over the place in differed cabinets and drawers.

Every machinist is hoarding tools. There are drawers with piles of cutting tool, never in use.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to implement a tool management, arrange a central storage solution and organize the flow of the tools through the company and the department.

* For the storage I was thinking about a “vertical carousel” or a “lift”, because of the limited space we have. Maybe organizing the storage with the Kanban-system?  
* For the flow I was thinking about a picking system for the tools. For every job the machinist will pick the needed tools. The machinist gets a list of the recommended tools together with the drawings of the part.
* With the system I want to generate data, right now we have no overview of the number of tools we have or the “consumption”. Everything is mostly based on a gut feeling and tools are ordered when the box is empty.  
* I want to do this all with a specific method, for example the 5S Method.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you organize and store your Tool in your company or what are your general ideas?

24,Should I pursue a second bachelor's in engineering (ABET-accredited) if I want to pursue my master's in the US and I didn't graduate from a recognized university?,1550767610,"I've already read tons of threads on this topic but nothing that specifically caters to my situation so, yeah, I'm posting this.

My parents refuse to let me major in engineering since it's a very underpaid profession in my country. Since I didn't want to stray too far from my dream profession (electrical engineering), I decided to do my bachelor's in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science (and some electronics classes) since all the high-paying jobs here are either in finance or programming.

I understand that in the US, you can get a master's in engineering even without a bachelor's in engineering so long as a) you fulfill the prerequisites requirements and b) your undergraduate degree was obtained in an accredited university/was an accredited program. In this context, I'm assuming 'accredited' means a university/program recognized in the US. But I'm not from the US. My school, although considered the best in the country, falls somewhere at 400 on the Asia University Rankings. I'm worried if this will affect both my prospects for graduate school in the US and employment since I heard that most companies won't take in someone who didn't undergo the FE exam and I was also told you won't be allowed to sit for the FE without an ABET-accredited bachelor's degree so there's that. There's a local university here that offers an ABET-accredited electrical engineering degree so I was wondering if it makes sense to go for that and get a second bachelor's (which would take another 3-4 years), or do I have any other options?

Also, no, I can't just go for the ABET-accredited EE degree since my parents are paying for my bachelor's and loans are pretty much non-existent here so I have no choice but to major in something they'll let me go to school for until I can earn enough money to pursue engineering and work abroad.

29,Advice from experienced engineers?,1550762561,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping someone here can provide some insight. Here’s some background:

I completed a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics, and am now finishing my second year of an ME PhD program (which, upon completion of classes+the qualifying exam, I earn a concurrent Master’s as well). 

My dissertation work is biomechanics focused, particularly modeling and simulation of gait disorders, with applications in the development of predictive and subject-specific rehabilitation programs. 

Ideally, I’d like to work in industry after finishing my PhD. I like biomechanics/modeling dynamic systems, but I’m not even sure what’s out there in terms of industry, or where/how to look for anything, or if it’s even going to be possible to get an industry job without a post doc or any experience outside of my dissertation. I’d appreciate any advice you all would have here. 

Furthermore, coming from a physics background means I missed out typical engineering skill development. For example, I don’t have any CAD experience, and I am under the impression this is kind of assumed of applicants to engineering jobs. I’m trying to make up for some of the lacking areas with my classes, so I’ve taken dynamics, biomechanics, computational physiology, modeling and simulation of human movement, control systems (among others as well, but these stick out as potentially important for a career in this area). Do you guys believe there are other fundamental areas that I need to take courses in to be truly qualified for engineering positions in industry? 

Really I just need some direction, with an idea of where and how to go about even looking for a job. My advisor is really pushing for a career in research and following up the PhD with a post doc, so I don’t feel quite comfortable yet sitting down with him to discuss this without being better educated on my options.

31,Designing a self landing payload,1550755173,"Hi all,

A club at my school is designing a self guided payload system where after being ejected from the rocket at about 4,000ft and 30 MPH, the payload will land itself in a designated landing zone (Whether or not this is allowed by the FAA is questionable but we are doing this to participate in a potential competition). We are having a few issues on the mechanics behind this payload, specifically between two designs.

The first design is basically a missile where there will be two planar fins that are initially stowed within the body. After ejecting from the rocket (streamers will be connected to the end of the rocket, slowing us down just a little bit when freefalling), the fins will rotate away from the interior of the body so that they will be parallel to the air stream. Here, they will be able to provide roll and some pitch. After reaching a certain altitude, a main parachute will deploy slowing us down to an acceptable speed.

Our second design is basically four sticks with propellers at the end of the sticks, 90 degrees away from each other that are initially stowed inside the body. Once it ejects from the rocket, all four sticks will rotate away from the interior of the rocket (again, will have streamers) and the propellers will start spinning, with the four sticks only able to move on one axis. After reaching a certain altitude, a main parachute will deploy slowing us down to an acceptable speed.

https://imgur.com/a/LPTh4si

Half of us want the first design (since less moving parts reduces complexity, and we are familiar with flight dynamics of planar fins) and the other half want the second design.

Which design would be ideal for what we want to achieve?

Last May I started to work thru a temp agency for a relatively small manufacturing company (about 50 people). I have an associate degree in mechanical engineering technology and I'm about to graduate this May with my bachelor's out of the same program. (Which is ABET accredited). I'm also getting a certificate in corrosion engineering technology this May, which is nice but I don't think it really qualifies me for anything extra. I really just took the classes because they're good to know and it's something that stands out on a resume.

Anyway, today my boss told me they want to make me a full time offer because ""I'm an asset to the company and he doesn't want to loose me."" 

Now, I currently make $17 an hour from the temp agency and the job I applied for was a drafting role. Since then, I've taken on a number of projects that are at their core quality control and design. I do a lot of reverse engineering and I'm working on improving legacy designs to make them cheaper/easier to build. 

I feel that I'm fulfilling an engineering role at my current job more than drafting and I'd like my new pay to reflect this. 

Also, my company email signature now says ""My Name | Engineer"" after I send an email. I didn't change it and before a few weeks ago it said nothing at all so I'm guessing that means they do consider me an engineer not a draftsman lol. 

My biggest fear is that they offer me pay that reflects my two year degree and not the four year degree I'm about to receive, since they want my official start date to be early March, before I officially graduate and have that degree as leverage.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Is there also any scope to do BIM in a sustainable/renewable energy capacity as to work in renewables is my ultimate goal.

Is it true that stills use linear ADC while log format video use logarithmic ADC? When using regular video, the optimal ISO is only 200 or 100. I know the analog gain differences are why the same camera that is optimized for ISO 100 performs best at 3200 when log is used. I know digital cinema cameras often use linear ADC then compress the tone range to log in a smaller number range.

If the ADC mode is logarithmic in log video mode, then why do digital cameras use linear ADC which results in lower dynamic range at the same ISO for stills? Camera makers can always install internal ND filters that can be switched on.

A few key concerns and pieces of information I want to share:

* I am located in Bay Area, CA, US
* I haven't done any engineering work since college. No use of engineering fundamentals (dynamics, thermo, fluids, etc.), calculus, or physics.
* Where do I start with rebuilding/refreshing my engineering knowledge? Purchase a FE exam study guide and run through them until I feel confident to take the exam?
   * Or should I go back to each textbook from my core engineering classes and really take the time to learn everything (expecting this to take time that I'm afraid I don't have)
   * Night classes aren't really an option considering my job demands 12h+ a day
   * Youtube lectures?
* Do I even have a good shot at this? Non-engineering friends tell me yes, but I'm afraid I don't possess the technical knowledge and lost my chance at it. I am excited, but I'd like to be realistic.
* If I don't have a good chance at becoming an engineer in the automotive industry, I am still interested in the field, but don't know if or how I can get my foot in the door
   * Even if I'm not crunching numbers and solving equations, I want to be part of a team that can make an exciting product come to fruition
* What are companies going to be looking for and what kind of knowledge am I expected to have?
* I do love construction, but I want to leave my company. I don't want to/can't put up with the hours and work-life balance (or lack thereof).  I feel like now would be the best opportunity for me to get into another field
* Not sure if relevant but I'm making a little over $100K salary.

21,make me feel better - tell me your overseas manufacturing horror stories,1550632848,"I work for a US consumer goods company. We make plastic injection molded stuff. Due to relentless cost pressures from retailers we manufacture in China. We work with four main factories and they're all so, so horrible. I'm sure there are great factories in China, but we can't afford them. Anyone with their shit together is undoubtedly out of our price range. 

&amp;#x200B;

**situation 1:** Factory A was out of spec on the snap features for a new product. I told them they needed to modifying the tool to get in spec. This takes a week and they shoot new parts, which we fedex to the other side of the Earth, which takes another week. I measure the parts and nothing has changed. I tell them nothing has changed, but they swear up and down that they revised the tool and shot new parts. I tell them to revise the tool again and send new parts. Two more weeks go by and same thing. I'm going ballistic and trying to get the people who control the money to put the fear of god into the factory, but instead I just get a lot of ""Maybe it's a language barrier issue? Have you tried sending pictures?"" Yes, we sent pictures. They're called tool release drawings. I also sent them photos, videos, illustrations, and all manner of emails. Rinse and repeat one or two more times and we finally get parts that work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Four months down the road and their sales rep was feeling chatty (drunk or whatever) and confides on Wechat to one of our employees that the actual problem was that Factory A just wasn't paying their toolmaker's bills, so the toolmaker wasn't doing any work. Instead of getting a business loan or whatever to smooth over their cash crunch, they just lied to us, causing us to waste hundreds of dollars in fedex fees, and more than a month of time, countless hours of my own time, and years from my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

**situation 2:** Factory B is awarded the contract to produce a product. All along we've been clear that the strap is supposed to be silicone. We get the first samples and notice that the silicone strap is an amazingly good color match for the TPR overmold on the product. Great! Then we notice that the strap is getting permanent elephant skin wrinkles, and has a permanent kink. It smells like a garbage fire and feels gross. ""This part was supposed to be silicone. Are you sure this is silicone?"" ""Yes, this is absolutely silicone."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I take the strap outside and heat it with a lighter. It melts, making flaming drips, and the strap catches fire and sustains it without the lighter. ""We think this is TPR."" ""No, I promise it is silicone, but it is injection silicone. \[i.e. LSR\] Maybe you don't like injection silicone? We can make it from pressed silicone instead."" Surprisingly they retool the part for pressed silicone without any charge to us. They send us new parts and they're exactly what we wanted. It only delayed our project by a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

A year and  a half later, we're discussing another new project with them. We ask if this product can be made from TPR. The sales rep for Factory B says they don't think that would be a good idea because it would wrinkle and form a permanent kink just like when they used TPR for that strap on that other project.

27,Choosing a position sensor (encoder) and obtaining velocity from it,1550627540,"How do I know how many counts per revolution I need for an encoder for my application?

I need to be able to accurately capture a 1000 Hz signal on an input side running from 1-133 rev/sec (60-8000 RPM) and a 1000 Hz signal on an output side with gear ratio 1:100, so speeds are .01-1.33 rev/sec (.6 - 80 RPM).

Here is the math I have but am not sure if it is correct:

For a 1000 Hz signal, it takes .001 sec for one period. But if I want to accurately capture this and accurately obtain velocity from this position data, I need 100 counts (is this a good assumption? what would be a better value?). Hence, I need 100/.001 = 100,000 cts/sec. Now, if I divide this by my rev/sec, I'll get cts/rev which is what encoders are rated at. Assuming input is running at 10 rev/sec, I need 100,000/10 = 10,000 cts/rev. Assuming output is running at .1 rev/sec, I need 1,000,000 cts/rev.

I strongly suspect my math is incorrect however because the best encoders that meet the speed requirement of my application are 1024 cts/rev for input and 72,000 cts/rev for output. Would these cts/rev actually be good enough for my application then?

For context, I need to obtain the Bode plot of a gear drive and hence plan to give sinusoidal inputs to my motor. I do not expect this the bandwidth of my gear drive to be more than 1000 Hz, but since I am not sure what it's exact number is, I would like my design to be capable of accurately measuring a 1000 Hz signal. This sinusoid will be in terms of velocity which is why I want to obtain velocity data. Also, I know it may seem odd that I am using position first and then getting velocity rather than getting velocity directly, but my client would like this system to be capable of positional control.

It's my first ""real"" project, given that so far most of the work I did so far was fairly basic.

Basically no one in the team documents their work, which has been always one of my biggest complaints. I really like the atmosphere and how compromised everybody is, but the ""culture"" there involves just studying about the part you're responsible for, designing it &amp; running a few simulations and manufacturing it.

That really bothers me because I think we spend a lot of time working out issues that were already worked out in the past.

38,How to determine critical points from large point cloud?,1550616276,"How's it goin' everybody, I've been racking my poor little ME brain on this problem for a little while now and I've come up empty so I've come to you for help. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The situation:** I have a dataset of \~600,000 3D spatial coordinates (x, y, z, rx, ry, rz) which represent movement of a given component as measured by numerous sensors. Individual sensor data is compiled into one data set which represents movement about a given origin. Currently we visualize this data in excel using 2D graphs (set on each of the standard planes) to represent displacement at any user entered coordinate. Every project generates roughly 2-10 of these datasets over its lifecycle.   

&amp;#x200B;

**The goal:** I would like to visualize this movement via a swept volume or vibration volume in catia, but catia doesn't handle 600,000 point paths very well (single threaded processes make me very sad). So I need a robust method to determine which points represent the maximum displacement of the object in order to greatly reduce the load on catia. The goal is to end up with a list of no more than 500 data points total. 

   

**Whats been tried:** I started out with the assumption that any point which resulted in an extreme displacement at the origin would also likely result in an extreme displacement at any given point along the object which is moving. Under this assumption the solution was simple enough: find the shell of a 3D point cloud. However, the group which generates this data verifies the accuracy of the graphs their spreadsheet produces by comparing it to actual data gathered at a group of arbitrary points (usually 4-6 places easy to reference on the physical object itself). Now if you're smarter than me you've likely already realized that taking only the points which result in a displacement extrema at the origin will not necessarily produce displacement extrema at an arbitrary point when you take into account rotational effects. The other caveat is that I don't just need to match the data at the 4-6 given points, I need to maintain \~95% accuracy at any point on the object itself and with my current method I've identified discrepancies of more than 30% in some places. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my first thought was to also flag points which represented a rotation extrema, but this was likewise not enough; e.g. one of my current test points exhibits a displacement maximum generated by a data point which is neither a displacement nor a rotation maxima. My supervisor suggested flagging points adjacent to previously flagged points, but the data point mentioned is roughly 10 samples away from the nearest flagged point. Including 10 points on either side of every flagged point would obviously have a severely detrimental effect on the data size so that's out. 

&amp;#x200B;

My next iteration involved a bit of trig. I added three additional columns which would calculate the displacement at a set arbitrary distance from the origin (x', y', z') and check for extrema there. However I obviously can't calculate these for every possible arbitrary point (my workstation is unfortunately xeon powered as opposed to quantum) so I calculate the displacement in the same octant that the given data point resides in, working under the assumption that displacement extrema in a given octant will be produced by data points already therein. I realize this isn't a great assumption, but as it sits my spreadsheet calculation time is approaching an hour per sheet, with 6 sheets of calculation to determine the final point cloud and I'm still seeing 20-30% error at my test points, so if anyone has any ideas on a better approach to this I am all ears.

I decided to split my final year into to because I was unsure on what type of career I wanted to pursue after graduation. I was thinking of doing web development as I really enjoy working with software, but I'm feeling anxious about that career path because I cannot see myself sitting at a desk, staring at a screen. My goal would be to eventually get an MBA and get into management (or start a business), but I don't want to place all my hopes on an event that is far into the future. Also, I have a bad feeling that the market for web devs is getting saturated, and I won't be able to compete with the comp scis and software eng grads, since most of my knowledge has been self -taught.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently became aware that tech companies like to hire engineers as sales people, and I'm really like this option. I'm very good at conversing, and I think I would be a lot better at proposing, and selling a project than actually working on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my main question: What can I do to make myself the best candidate when applying to Sales Eng jobs next year? Is selling software products more lucrative than traditional engineering systems? 

And, if I'm unable to get a tech sales co-op for this summer, should I try to get a regular sales job, or look for a regular eng co-op?

48,Considering Electronics and Computer Engineering at 27,1550605025,"Hello,

I am currently in my third semester doing a 3year Software Engineering (not an accredited engineering degree at the university I am studying at) it's basically a degree in software development. I am 26, 27 at the end of the year, and am interested in taking up a 4-year Electronics and Computer Engineering degreee, which is an accredited engineering degree. Some papers will cross credit but it wouldn't take any time off the degree. I would be graduating at almost 31 if I switch or 29 if I stay on track.

Is it worth the change? I really like the idea of combining programming with engineering to create tangible devices. The device inside a smart fridge or TV etc. I also would like to have the rudimentary skills to perform my own electronical repairs if I so wanted to, if my computer monitor died, being able to figure out why it died would be awesome.

I've talked to an electrical engineer grad that ended up doing the sort of programming that you could get a job in if you did some sort of 3year CS degree or even self-taught so I'm concerned that extending my study time out won't result in the outcome I would like.

I live in New Zealand, a country with a population(~5mil) of a medium-sized city in most of the world and am concerned about finding a job related to what I would be studying. IT jobs are a dime a dozen here, and I would have no issues getting an entry level job in whichever field I decide on after graduating with this software degree.

Is engineering exciting? I am partially motivated by money, but not to the degree where I would go into sales or finance to chase an unfathomably big salary.

82,Trying to use Murphy Bed spring mechanism to build a raisable home theater riser.,1550526424,"I have a 10 foot section of wall that is recessed back about 10 inches from the rest of the wall. I am planning to build a couch riser that i can raise and lower, similar to a Murphy bed. My question is in regards to making sure the riser can be raised and lowered safely as I have small children. I estimate that the riser will weigh between 500-600 lbs. It is 6.5 feet tall and 10 feet long. 

Most murphy beds weigh between 250-600 lbs, but they typically dont get any wider than 6 feet or so. 

Will adding the extra 3-4 feet of wall length compromise the springs ability to raise/lower the riser?

Why I'm doing it: The project is meant to allow me to convert my family room space into a theater room, but also have it as a wide open space when desired. When the riser is lowered, the wall space behind it will house a popcorn maker, mini fridge, concession stand, and lowerable bar/counter, as well as other theater decor.

0,How efficient can a generator get?,1550509895,"Hi all,

I'm out of my element here, so if I say anything stupid, please forgive.  I'm trying to find out the limitations of generator efficiency.  Specifically, I'm looking at natural gas boiler-powered generators.  I understand where some of the efficiency losses come from.  My understanding is that for every \~42,000 BTUs worth of natural gas put into a boiler, you get about 33,600 BTUs worth of steam (about 80% efficiency).  Then there are losses in the steam line on the way to the generator and fouling factor to account for.  That's where my understanding ends.  According to the US Energy Information Administration, natural gas power plants are now able to produce 1kWh (equivalent to 3,412 BTUs) with 7,812 BTUs of natural gas, an efficiency of about 43.7%.  Where is the rest of all of that loss coming from?  My understanding is that it's coming from the conversion of the steam's energy into mechanically turning the turbine of the generator where it is again converted, this time into electrical energy.   
 Everything I've looked at has waved the ""thermodynamics"" wand at this with little or no explanation.  I imagine it's too technical to get into on here, and I would need a stronger base of thermodynamics knowledge to do more than plug and chug with the equations, anyway.  That brings me to you kind ladies and gents.  What are the limitations of generator efficiency?  How much of the drop between BTU potential in the gas going in and kWh of electricity coming out is attributed directly to the laws of physics, and how much of it is due to inefficiencies that can be improved upon?

it's my understanding that NFPA 99 is intended for medical devices which interact directly with patients in a medical setting.

is anyone aware of a general industrial-use specific specification for leakage current? is NFPA 99 a tighter test to pass due to the medical application? what would expected ""safe"" values of leakage current be for a home-use device?

I'm hoping this is the best place to ask my question:

Is it possible for load cells, of the type used in weigh scales, to develop a 'memory' or bias for a particular weight, so that a weigh scale might display a weight that we repeatedly finish at even though that weight is actually incorrect?

Background: I work in a meat processing plant where boxes of meat are packed and weighed before being sent for strapping. The main weight we try to achieve is 27.62 kilograms, or between 27.60 and 27.68. Recently we noticed a run of boxes throughout a few days being sent for strapping that were outside of this range despite the scales (7 total) all being zeroed. Much higher than standard incorrect weighing from the operator.

Something I've noticed is that it's suspiciously common for us to get a box to, say, around 27 kg, then cut a piece of meat to make up the 0.62 kg, put it in the box, and magically this brings us to 27.62 on the first attempt. I'm dubious that we're all just good at judging the weights, so I'm wondering if the load cells in the scales have some kind of memory that has been imprinted into them.. a specific amount of compression that they are biased toward, so that they'll display 27.62 if the actual weight is reasonably close.

I hope that makes sense.. I'm not sure if 'memory' is the correct term I'm looking for here.

11,Can I run an inverter off an LED driver?,1550496809,"So, now, this project kind of sounds like madness, but hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

A good friend of mine from the US has a pretty extraordinary collection: washing machines.

And by some luck he aquired a machine made for the EU market.

He had German machines like the current one before and was - pretty much always - lucky enough to be abled to run them on an US 240V single phase 60Hz outlet (the once used for dryers and ovens and such, NEMA I think the standard is called).

&amp;#x200B;

The machine in question has a rating of 230V 2300W 50Hz, so no overload for the 240V 20+A circuit and I know for a fact that these machines play along happily anywhere from 200 to 250V.

But the machines PCB throws an error code relating to incorrect supply specifications due to the US grid being 60Hz and the EU being 50Hz.

He bought a smaller 400W rated AC to AC converter to test if the machine in general with the heater disconnected even worked and it did.

&amp;#x200B;

So he set out to buy an AC to AC converter that could handle the - lets say 2500W - continous load. 

The converter however would have to handle far greater peak currents. The 2300W rating consits of a 1950W resistive heating element and a 350W motor.

That motor pauses and reverses direction every 30 or so seconds and on startup apparently pulls close to 1kW (if not more) according to my friends observations  (mostly due to the heavy wet laundry in the drum).

That current quickly subsides however once the motor gets into motion.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, an AC to AC converter that could handle that load is hideausly expensive (cheapest I saw was like 1500$, though even that unit was of questionable quality), so, I set out to find a cheaper alternative.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After some reasearch I found out that EU solar inverters are surprisingly cheap. A unit that turns 24V DC into 230V 50Hz AC sin-wave and can handle 3500W continous with 7000W peak is only like 350$.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I had to find a 300A 24V DC power supply.

&amp;#x200B;

First idea was a 240V to 24V transformer with sufficent rating, then put it through a large diode pack and smooth it. But I wasn't abled to figure out a capcitor value that could smooth that sufficently. That would have been the cheapest and toughest solution though (diode pack would have been something like 40$, the transformer 100-150$ on AliExpress plus I dunno 10-20$ for a large capacitor), so if anybody of you could solve that I would be greatly thankfull.

&amp;#x200B;

Next idea was a lab supply, but those were hideausly expensive.

Then I ran across electroplating power supplies, but those couldn't handle the peak currents and were not cheap or easy to get either.

I found a driver for a DC motor that could handle 200A continous and 300A peak at 24V for just 150$, but a) had no idea how to power that as it needed a low voltage dc supply itself and b) had no idea how to use that thing/how the output of it looked.

Next idea was to get some deep cycle 24V lead acid batterys. But, to get the total power output needed for a wash cycle, that would have been something like 5-8 batteries in parallel and I don't think the inverter could have run the batteries dead (would have cut out before that). Oh, and that would have been 450$ minimum for the batteries alone plus a charger.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was about to give up when I ran across some cheap LED drivers on eBay.

They were 24V 30A 720W units for just below 40$. They could take the 240V single phase straight from the socket. Going off of 5000W of power at 24V I aimed at 210A total; basicly 7 of these in parallel. 280$ dosen't sound so bad.

Now, the listing did not say if those were constant voltage or constant current supplies and did not say if these could be run in parallel. So I just dropped the seller a quick message and will see what he says.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that some of these switchmode power suppplies can be run in parallel, some can't.

I know that the DC output of such units - even if they are advertised as ""flicker free"" - isn't plain old constant DC.

What I don't know AT ALL is if an inverter could even run of a switchmode DC supply like an LED driver. I mean, my basic knowledge would tell me yes since the step-up transformation and subsequent uber-smoothing for a ""proper"" sin-wave output rings huge bells in my head in terms of inductive and capacitive ""volume"" in that inverter.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, do you guys think that could even remotley work?

15,Increase in velocity of fluid = less pressure exerted by it?,1550481315,"Can some one give me an analogy as to why the pressure of a fluid going fast exerts a lower pressure? Ive heard its because molecules bump less into the object in question . But I dont think that is the case and this is why = If you blow on one side of the object then the fluid layer that was occupying that side of the object, would indeed bump into the object less times than the other side of the object. However, the layer of air that you blow out onto that side of the object would take over the place that the original fluid layer was occupying before it got blown out. And that fluid layer would also bump less times onto the object than the other side, however, if you keep blowing, then the ; amount of original fluid layer bumps + the amount of new fluid layer bumps = the amount of bumps in the other side of the object. What I mean by this equation is that the fluid layer that replaces the original fluid layer compensates for the lack of bumps in the original layer so together the total bumps generated by the two layers equal the amount of bumps on the other side of the object. Thats just my thoughts on why it cannot be, im happy to be proven wrong.

17,Any degree qualified engineers moved into manufacturing maintenance work?,1550479192,"Hi,

  
I have a mechanical engineering degree and have worked as an operations engineer, process engineer (machinery design) and process engineer doing production line improvements. All these previous jobs have been in very big companies but now I've now moved into maintenance engineering for a very small company and I'm the only one there initially, tasked with starting up an engineering department to take care of all their machinery.  
I think the closest thing I can describe myself to is a maintenance fitter now. I have found my engineering degree really helps me understand technical jargon, read electrical and pneumatic diagrams and help do basic calcs when speccing pumps and the like. However I don't have the ""trade"" or ""shop"" experience that those from a more hands on qualification may have. For example, I had to google how to properly do basic plumbing, how to safely run and secure wiring, pneumatic hoses etc.  


Anyway, I was hoping some of you might be able to guide me to useful resources tailored towards maintenance fitters that I could read or listen to and also give me any great advice you have picked up over your years in maintenance engineering.

27,"I’m Building a Kiln, Can Anyone Help with Some Calculations?",1550455871,"Hey guys, 


I’ve been getting into casting recently and in order to cast metals with a higher melting point and not break the bank, I’ve started building myself a kiln. I have most of the pieces already, and have the body built, but I’ve become hung up on a few calculations I need to do in order to make the heating element. If anybody here is skilled with these kinds of calculations, and feels like helping out, I would be extremely grateful. That being said, I’m not really sure what field these kinds of calculations belong to, so if this is the wrong place, I apologize. 


The basic idea is that this baby will plug into a regular wall socket (120 V) and will end up heating up the inside to about 1400˚C. The dimensions of the kiln are 9” x 9” x 9.5” on the outside, and 4.5” x 4” x 6.5” on the inside, and it is made of soft fire brick, 2.5” thick, held together by a frame made out of slot angle iron. The heating element will be made out of Kanthal A1 resistance heating wire (https://www.kanthal.com/en/products/material-datasheets/wire/resistance-heating-wire-and-resistance-wire/kanthal-a-1/), coiled by yours truly. The heating element will run around the inside of the kiln and then out through the side, through a ceramic connector block where high temperature wire will connect it to the power. Using a K type thermocouple, a PID controller will determine the temperature in the kiln, and it will then then use a solid state relay to turn the power running to the heating element on or off depending on whether it needs to heat up or cool down to achieve the temperature I have programmed it to. I didn’t come up with the design myself - I pieced it together from a couple different Instructables and Youtube videos, using elements I liked from each, and trying to overcome various flaws apparent in each of them. This is where I’m stuck:


1. What gauge of Kanthal wire, and how much of it should I use? I will be winding the wire myself, I think that seems like the best way to ensure that the heating element is right for the space. I’ve seen people using anywhere from 12 to 16 gauge wire, and ideally I’d like to use 12 gauge, but only because it’s easily accessible. I’m not sure how to calculate how much I need, or if there is reason that a higher gauge would be superior. I’ve considered winging it, but there’s a bit on this page (http://www.kilnparts.com/kanthal-a1-element-120-volts-12-amps-1440-watts.html) cautioning against having too little wire resulting in overloading and thus melting it. I initially calculated that I would need roughly 20 feet, but that didn’t take into account element surface load.


2. What diameter should I coil the wire to? I know if I wind it too tight I can ruin the element, but that should change depending on what gauge of wire I use. But what exactly is the relationship?


[Pictures of the kiln so far, and the various components](https://imgur.com/gallery/a3HNP9r)


Finally, a couple simpler electrical problems - these don’t really require calculations, but if anyone knows the answers, that would be swell.


1. Can I connect the high temperature wire right to the plug? Or should I switch to regular power cord?


2. The original video showed the thermocouple sticking quite far out of the wall since it’s too long to have the wall shelter the whole thing. Will it interfere with the functioning of the thermocouple to insert it in an open groove along the top, say, of the kiln (on the inside obviously)? 


3. How can I insert the ceramic blocks? One video showed them just inserted into the bottom of the inside of the kiln, but I think I run the risk of the wire being too close to the inside of the kiln. I’m not sure it’s a good idea. Would it be ok to have the ceramic blocks set into the outside of the kiln?


Please believe me, I’ve tried everything I can think of to solve these problems, but with no formal knowledge in the field it’s proved quite difficult - in fact, I’m not entirely sure what field this even belongs to. I’ve looked through similar problems on Stack Exchange and other similar sites, but being given various equations still doesn’t really help. I’m not an electrician or an engineer, and I’ve been stuck for so long. I know that it’s a lot to ask, but if anyone feels like solving a puzzle and is skilled in this area, I would really truly appreciate it.",AskEngineers,False,badgerfudge,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ars00e/im_building_a_kiln_can_anyone_help_with_some/

44,Would you accept a job with a company that's been jerking you around while interviewing?,1550436590,"Hi /r/AskEngineers, I'm in a weird job situation that I haven't had experience with before.

I've been interviewing with two companies and have been dealing with a company this week I nicknamed 'No Call Back' because of how bad their communication has been, other firm will be 'Awesome Company'.

**Background:** 

They originally ghosted me this past summer and then started talking to me again late December/early January to have me come in and interview. I later found out that one of their managers hired someone they knew that desperately needed a job and then fired him 6 months later for performance issues.

I interviewed in early January and they said they would get back to me 'in the next week or so at the latest', they didn't call me back for almost a month and then asked me to take an 'assessment test' to prove I wasn't an idiot.

I sent them back the 'test' and then waited several more weeks before hearing back from them on Thursday this past week offering me a job.

It's a very competitive job offer, a good raise over where I'm at now. 

**The Problem:** 

In the time that they were dragging their ass on this process I interviewed with a different company a week ago that seems like a much better fit, has a much better commute, location, I really like the manager, etc.

They are interviewing someone else this week and would like to choose someone in the next week or so, I believe I have a good chance of getting the job.

The problem is No Call Back says they need my answer by this Tuesday. I'm very frustrated by them keeping me hanging and now needing me to answer them immediately when I told them I am considering a different position.


**Deliberations:**

The commute to No Call Back sucks to be honest but they are putting a lot of money on the table with a much higher title that would help with future career moves. I could handle it for a few years but it would destroy my social life and continuing education that I've been pursuing at night for the duration of working there.

The main thing I am hearing is 'You'll never get to work for them in the future if you want' but the biggest issue with them is that their firm is located in the middle of nowhere which won't change and I still won't want to drive 1+ hours for them in the future. 

The other thing is 'saving face' which doesn't mean much since no one from this company comes to professional society events due to being in the middle of nowhere. It would be awkward for a few years but our industry is like musical chairs with people changing firms for raises and titles.

I'm not sure if the consequences are that terrible if I accepted this job offer and then got an offer from Awesome Company and took theirs before I even started at No Call Back or if I'm failing to take something else into account? 

I've also considered turning down their offer and staying with my current company that I am not happy at but know exactly what I can get away with, has a good commute, and is located close to the college I'm taking masters classes at.

46,New Gasoline Engine Concept,1550435125,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have conceived a radically different engine design from that of current 2 and 4 stroke internal combustion engines. I have secured prior art through a provisional patent for its development. I am in need of some engineering assistance to essentially put the numbers to the concept. The configurations and components are otherwise fully documented through technical pencil drawings which can be imaged and shared with anyone interested in providing (what should be) a relatively small but critical amount of engineering analysis for presentation to potential manufacturers.

&amp;#x200B;

Though ""Brand new"" in comparison to current 2 and 4 stroke I/C engines, the basic design is derived from that of the dual oscillating steam engine developed by John Ericsson in the mid 1800's. This engine powered the original ""Monitor"" warship in the American Civil War as well as the Stanley Steamer automobiles of the early 1900's. Two opposing power strokes per cycle per cylinder it has, and very simple it is. Adapting this engine to internal combustion power has taken more than a little thinking and sketching to achieve functionality while maintaining its essential efficiency and simplicity.

&amp;#x200B;

Look under the hood of any car! To the unfamiliar, it's an unfathomable mess of belts, hoses, wires, linkages, canisters, tubes and brackets. All is well designed and necessary for its performance, but mostly unneeded for the design I am proposing, which is a paradigm shift in vehicle propulsion. Ericsson's design translates well to internal combustion if a few problems are solved.

&amp;#x200B;

I am certain that this engine profile has been considered by others who were likely stymied by inherent challenges in heat dissipation, aspiration and cylinder lubrication this profile presents. My design thoroughly and simply solves these problems and makes the practical use of this engine type possible. Graphic descriptions and narratives of all systems have been created.

&amp;#x200B;

The resulting power plant is a screamer -- small, light, simple, powerful and efficient. The 3 cylinder version provides 6 power strokes per cycle and compares to a larger turbocharged V-8 using otherwise conventional aspiration and fuel. As power and efficiency go hand in hand, models can be designed to provide twice the power or twice the fuel economy as a 4 stroke engine of similar displacement at roughly 1/3 the weight and size.

&amp;#x200B;

The engine can be developed in 1 to 6 cylinder versions, with a range of piston diameters as appropriate for the type of fuel to be used. Diesel, gasoline, natural gas, or racing fuels can be accommodated. Applications for all types of land vehicles, aircraft,  watercraft and industrial uses have been explored and graphically developed. These also can be imaged and shared.

&amp;#x200B;

For any automotive engineer that may be able to work with me on establishing the feasibility of my concept/design, please reach out to me via PM. If this turns into something, we would certainly share in the rewards.

The wiring of the motor purchased is strange. It has 6 wires coming from the back and on the website, it says each of them is; Red wire (+), Green wire: Speed signal control output, Yellow Wire: CW/CCW control, Black wire: PWM speed control, White wire: Brake.

This seems strange to me as most of the hobby motors which people use (in videos) use three wires for each of the phases, allowing for power to be supplied to each pole for relatively easy commutation. 

This is mainly confusing because if this was possible presumably there would be a built-in bridge inverter or something which would allow for commutation to each pole? and if this was the case surely it would be described on the website.

My formula SAE team has purchased and have been running carbon fiber wheel shells with the reasoning that they are a lot lighter than aluminum ones despite the extra cost (I'm out right now but can provide the numbers later if anyone's interested). We would, however, like to further validate our decision to run them and would appreciate any advice on that.

We've run a basic test for stiffness comparison between aluminum and CF (same geometry) by fixing a wheel shell to the edge of a table and very crudely placing weights in a weight basket hung by rope on the tire. As we increased weight, we took measurements of deflection from the furthest edge of the wheel shell from a dial indicator fixed to our wheel center. We then converted these numbers to measures of stiffness and found CF to be slightly stiffer. However, we had a couple cases of the dial indicator slipping on top of not having enough data points in general, decreasing a lot of confidence in our test. Additionally, this would only be a rough measure of the effect from weight of the driver/vehicle at regular ride, but it is much more important to replicate the lateral forces felt in the wheel shells in cornering, which we are having trouble coming up with a simple way to do.

Are you aware of any active methods to measure stiffness in wheel shells while running the car on a track? We want to use a strain gauge on one of our rear shells but are not sure how we'd connect it to our electrical stuff (have a hollow center bolt on our hub/housing and connect to the slip ring at the axles?).

91,Am I understanding magnetic fields correctly?,1550349881,"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how I understand magnetic fields:

A magnetic field is the quantified as the ratio of the magnetic force to the velocity of a charged particle moving through it, or more simply it describes the amplitude and direction of a magnetic force exerted on a charged particle as it travels through a magnetic field.

In a solenoid the magnetic field is generated by the flow of charged particles through the loops of wire. The induced magnetic field will apply a corresponding magnetic force on any charged particles that travel through this field.

In a permanent magnet the magnetic field is a result of all the magnetic domains aligning and combining. These domains consist of magnetic dipoles all pointing in the same direction. The magnetic dipoles result from the intrinsic magnetic fields generated by the atoms that make up the domains. These atomic dipoles are the result of the negatively charged electrons spinning about a positively charged nucleus.

92,Am I understanding permenant magnetic fields properly?,1550347811,"I'm not confident in my understanding of magnetic fields and was hoping someone could confirm if I'm getting it:

An electric field is described as the ratio of electrostatic force to charge, or more simply it describes the electrostatic forces between charged particles at a distance. A magnetic field is described as the ratio of magnetic force to a charged moving particle, or more simply it describes the force exerted on a moving charged particle as it passes through a magnetic field.

 In a solenoid the magnetic field is caused directly by the movement of charged particles. The induced magnetic field exerts a force on any nearby charged particles and causes them to move in the direction specified by the cross product of the field vector and the charged particle's velocity vector. 

However, a permanent magnet's magnetic field is the result of the magnetic domains aligning. Each domain consists of magnetic moments that are all aligned in the same direction. These magnetic moments produce magnetic fields because of the combined intrinsic magnetism of the elementary particles in each domain. Each of these elementary particles have intrinsic magnetic fields as a result of the electron spin of each atom about it's proton/neutron core.

Is this generally correct? (I'm least confident about my understanding of the permanent magnet part)

93,How would you go about setting up a water pump in a third world village?,1550346316,"Hi everyone,

We're a group of four students in engineering currently working on a project aiming at providing a village in DRC with a source of clean water.  Or at least to provide a plan to that effect,  since we realize the huge amount of work required will very probably be too much for the four of us. 

Right now, we are in a very early stage and looking for advice about what kind of system would be best suited for a congolese village with little or no infrastructure. So we have a few questions in the hope that someone with experience in that kind of work can help us to find a good solution.

First how would you produce the electricity needed to run the pump? We are thinking about solar panels since the village has already used some and they seem to work well enough. But we know there is between 4 and 7 hours of sunlight a day and we're not sure if that will be enough. So except that and fossil energy, we are wondering if there might be a good solution we haven't thought of? 

Then for the water pump what kind of system would work best under the circumstances? (Also the more resilient it is, the better!)

About water purification we're thinking of using chlorine. We are not really thrilled about that solution, but everything else seems to be too hard to set up or too expensive to maintain for a poor village. 

So if you have any advice that can help, or some link to relevant resources or even a particular sub where I might find further help for one of our questions, please share it!",AskEngineers,False,mihien,/r/AskEngineers/comments/arc9ka/how_would_you_go_about_setting_up_a_water_pump_in/
94,I urgently need help simulating the stability of a steel beam in ANSYS for my thesis,1550345456," 

Im trying to build steel beams for stability analysis including  


1. pre tension (tension resulting out of the production process)
2. pre deformation (resulting out of imperfections)

I messed up my simulations at some point and cant figure out the problem.

1.  PreStrains: I already read about the inistate APDL command, which  writes the strains at each node in a text file. I thought about editing  this file so that I can apply my wanted pre tensions. Anyway this plan  does not work out since there are too many nodes to define stresses for.  Is there any other way to do this?

2.  How do you arrange the analysis modules in order to find the needed  force? I know that the module Eigenvalue-buckling gives me a force  multiplier to calculate the critical buckling force. Is it correct that I  need to define a linear-structural analysis in which to attach my APDL  commands and based on this calculation have to run a Eigenvalue-buckling  analysis in order to get this force ?

\- my current simulation [https://imgur.com/a/WTi6S7Q](https://deref-web-02.de/mail/client/3lfC5AZz0M8/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fa%2FWTi6S7Q)

to explain what I did here ... the simulations A and B are made to generate a modular form which I export via nread.

The next simulations should calculate the critical load with imported deformation (nread and inistate)

My biggest gripe is that I genuinely believe that i'm not qualified enough to be full-fledged junior engineer, and I feel like is my only option is to take on debt just to go back to grad school for the sake of being a student again and have that internship option open

29,Diversity initiative in engineering recruiting - I’m concerned we are reverse discriminating.,1550266996,"Disclaimer: I am a white male in the US and enjoy working on a diverse team. I know this may be a touchy subject. My company has implemented diversity metrics in recruiting and management promotions.   I recently performed an exit interview with a Hispanic female engineer (a good friend of mine so she was candid). She recruited for her alma mater and was responsible for interviewing (only 3 years experience, so already seems like she is being exploited as a diverse employee). Anyways during the interviews, she and the other interviewer selected the top 4 candidates, the top 2 being white males. In order to meet diversity metrics for ethnicity and gender, the lead recruiter forced them to offer numbers 3 &amp; 4 positions despite lower grades and lesser qualifications. These two happened to be ethnic females. The employee admitted to me this made her feel she was selected because of her diverse background too. These metrics are required for us at the moment - over 50% of incoming interns are ethnic or gender minorities, despite our company located in an area with ~75% white male engineering candidates. In addition to recruiting, the company will not hire a leading white male candidate into a leadership position if there is an ethnic or gender minority in the running. In other words, it’s rare for a white male to replace a white male in a leadership position. I’m honestly concerned we aren’t going to have the engineering talent in the pipeline 10 years from now because we are lowering our requirements to meet the metrics. Has anyone else experienced this at their company? Is it normal or even legal? Sr. Management is convinced a diverse workforce leads to “35% higher productivity” based on a relatively recent study. 

Tl;dr: my company has diversity metrics and is recruiting lower talent because of it. Is it normal?  ",AskEngineers,False,blandsaw,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ar1now/diversity_initiative_in_engineering_recruiting_im/

&amp;#x200B;

I am 28 years old, working as a Fire Alarm Systems designer for a young Fire Alarm contractor. My business card says Engineer, but as I will begin to explain I believe that's kind of a lipstick on a pig job title. I graduated with a BS degree in Fire Protection Engineering in 2013, and fresh out of college I chose to work for a sole proprietor who was interested in growing the company. The goal was never to get huge, but to expand to the point where we could handle large design and installation projects. I became the new company's first hire. Early on the plan was that I was expected to learn everything about the FA trade, as well as be able handle a lot of operations at the office (above and beyond just designing  FA systems). Less than a year in, it became obvious that I would be doing mostly CAD design work and creating our shop drawings and submittals. 

&amp;#x200B;

Less than 2 years into my new career, I was approached by an electrical contractor who wanted to hire me as an estimator and plan reviewer. In addition, they wished to teach me lighting and controls. I was making $22 an hour at the time, they offered me $57k and additional perks that I currently didn't have. My boss panicked and begged me to stay, and at the time I was 100 percent sure I loved working for this small company, and I took slightly less to stay ($25/hr,but could make it up with OT at $37.50). I believe that my boss learned he didn't want to have to compete again, because he now ties all of our field tech and CAD designers' pay to NICET certification level. I am currently getting my level 2 processed, and plan on getting 3 by the end of the year to increase my pay. I have not gotten a raise since my last job interview, and since the NICET policy was instituted. I also have 1-2 CAD techs working under me depending on the time of year, I am responsible for reviewing their designs before the owner of the company OK's them.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the dilemma. After I sat down with the owner and said that I will max out my NICET to level 3 (not eligible for 4), however I want to grow as a manager, and be recognized as such. This was immediately shot down, I was told I'd have to get Level 4 before he would be even willing to consider the idea. I will keep investing my time to getting certified in the short term to increase my pay, but long term I believe that this company no longer provides me with the best opportunity possible. Why should I manage CAD techs underneath me, if they can make the same $$ by getting certified? Why should I cover for the owner when he's on vacation or overbooked, if I can't permanently have those extra responsibilities and get compensated for it? Why does my training say next in command, but my pay only reflects my work as a systems designer?

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking of transitioning into Project Management or Sales Engineering. I sacrificed becoming a PE because I wanted to learn more about starting a business, and gain skill sets that go beyond just Engineering/ Design. I believe it's time to leverage what I've learned into a new position where I can be appreciated/compensated for such. Maybe someone who has been there/ done that could lend their insight.

37,Design For Machining (turning and milling),1550251573,"Hi,  
I have been offered a trainee job in which I would be reviewing parts that are going to be manufactured by machining. 

To my understanding I should have good knowledge on what are good and bad designs regarding the manufacturability, so I can assess the design of parts coming from product design and ensure a well functioning manufacturing process.

&amp;#x200B;

In my studies I have attended a couple of courses that have dealt with machining in the following topics:

* Cutting theory
* Cutting forces
* Tool choice
* Mounting design
* Cutting path design for turning and milling

The courses have been good, but I feel like I have only touched the subjects on a surface level and would have a hard time assessing the suitability of parts in real life. It is hard to get a good understanding of certain things because I don't have hands-on experience of working with actual machining of parts.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very interested in finding some books or other resources to learn more about designing parts for machining.  
I would think the following topics would be most important.

* Design rules for machining (what features are easy/hard, what machining operations are cheap/expensive, what are suitable materials...)
* CNC Machine choice (How many axis do I need?, How to utilize the possibilities of the machines?)
* Mounting design (what are best ways of mounting in different cases)
* Technical part drawings for machining.",AskEngineers,False,Zensor7,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aqywob/design_for_machining_turning_and_milling/
38,"Recent grad, now working as an Engineer and I feel like I am getting underpaid. Am I or not?!",1550250791,"Hello Engineers,

I am a recent grad from UCSD, with a B.S in EE. I stared to work in my field, or very closy related, about 4 months ago. I work with a pcb design and manufacturing company. It took me slightly over a year before landing this job. When I got hired, the company made it seem as if I can grow into a design role, which I can (and really want to, eventually), but we currently outsource our designers. We have the software to design pcb's but no experienced EE's are currently here to attempt such a role (only I am, but I'm an entry level EE). Now I find myself working heavily with machine calibrations, signing paperwork, and light maintnence. Every now and then I get to shadow our test engineer, and trouble shoot certain pcb's. This I LOVE VERY MUCH, because not only does it relate to my field, but I have learned so much, and it always presents a challenge. The basics of EE are a must to understand such a role. However, I can only shadow him from time to time because I was hired as a Junior Engineer, to work under an ""engineer"" who was grand-fathered into his role. I desperatly wanted to begin some sort of ""real life application"" experience and so I took this job at the most they were willing to offer me - $20 an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Now before we get into the heat of this topic, I took this offer because the company tossed in some benefits from the get go, and because of their customers. We have conncetions to many well known companies such as Boeing, Northrop, Honeywell, L3, Syncardia, Axonics, Raytheon, RC Electronics, Richard MFG, L-Garde, etc. I see myself making connections with some of their engineers, and potentially transitioning into one of these places. Both reasons make me want to stay, and just a few days ago, I had a SURPRISE progress checkup. I have done so much in the 4 months that I have been here, and have asked for more workload. I have learned quite fast, and have exceeded the companies expectations thus far. I remember during the hiring process, the HR Manager had the audacity to say, ""although you have a degree and school experience, you are only worth around $16 an hr because you don't have much industry experience"". She was trying to justify why $20 an hr was more than enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

School has taught a lot of theory and most of it doesn't even apply to real life applications. But at the very least, school has done its job in exposing me to such topics and most importantly, giving me the capability of learning whatever material may come my way. I know I am an entry level EE and should not automatically expect the avg of 60-65k, a year, that school made it seem like we would get. Although it is possible. But if not this, then at least 55k would be nice right. And if not that, then I guess 45k would do lol, although I would not be as content. In reality, I am making anywhere from 41-43k a year. AM I GETTING UNDER PAID OR NOT? I am asking because my 6 month REAL check up is coming up, and I would like to bring up this concern of my hourly rate. But then again I don't know if should for the following two reasons. First, I dont have the all the experience they required, but it will come with time. Second, I should be thankful for even having a job. This is what keeps me at bay, but I would like to see what other engineers think.

I am in a.. quarter life crisis I guess. Im from CA so I guess that can narrow down a little bit. 

Anyway.. I'm 6 years deep in construction and saved money to open my own Muay Thai Gym. (Am a licensed fighter also)

But my mother needed money to re model her business into a brand new Restaurant.

While I was in jail for (Health and Safety violation) trafficking Cocaine. I served my time and decided to live a normal life.

I promised God I would never sell drugs again in my life (started since 15 and Im 28 now) this is my 2nd time being in jail but only got 1 felony. So far I have not talked to anyone regarding drugs and am doing fine.

Anyway... long story short, I landed a job that agreed to pay me 80k a year starting.. thought my life was turning around so I quit my construction job to get into this one. (I was a PM without a license) Upon doing a new hire.. I notified them about my felony and they still wanted me to come in with all legal documentation and even for 1 day of training.

Now I went to 2 interviews, met with the owner etc and everything went well. I took the drug test and I notified them that I drink Cannabis Tea for Insomnia. I don't smoke it because it effects my fighting career but I do drink it mixed with CDB and THC so it knocks me out at night. I told them I'm going to fail the drug test but since its California , weed is legal for recreational use. So after the training , few days of work.. they let me go because I didn't pass .. that was their excuse. I told them I left my old job for this .. like wtf? They said the company insurance is refusing to insure me because I failed the test and I'm a felon for a drug conviction. 

So now I'm left with no job... all this happened in a week. My probation is on my ass and doesnt believe me and is threatening to put me into jail again if I don't find a job or go back to school. 

I'm tired of this shit and am thinking about going back to school, since I have 6 years in the construction Industry.. Thought about going into engineering.

Its 3:06am and i been sending in resumes the entire week.. 60 to be exact. No luck besides low paying jobs. My question is Can I become an engineer with this Felony in California? 

Can I go to community college for 2 years and finish off at a university for 2 years to get my bachelors ?

I know going to college isn't a big problem but getting licensed seems like it (from what I read online).

Is there any Felons with an engineering degree ?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading.. I know I put a lot of non sense in here but just thought I'd let you know my situation. It's hard out for Felons man.. we just trying to be normal and I know this Fighting thing won't take me too long. Please help.

I’m a recent college graduate (BS in engineering - Mechanical Engineering) and seeking a full time Entry Level Mechanical Engineering position. I currently live in the greater Los Angeles area. Everybody always said “oh you will have no problem finding a job when you graduate.” Well, I believed them and had all the confidence in the world that I would find a job once I graduated. However it has been two months and I have only had 1 in person interview and 1 phone interview. Neither of which made me an offer. I’ve literally applied to over 300 places over the past month or so and nothing seems to stick. I was under the impression that I would have many offers on the table by now and I would simply be able to pick where I saw the best fit for my interest. 

The problem I face, and what I believe to be the issue with landing interviews/ offers, is the fact that I have no internship experience and my cumulative GPA is a 2.96. So when applications ask for a GPA I have a strong feeling that my applications are quickly thrown out.

I’m a hard worker, fast learner and positive person that always puts my best foot forward. I played sports my whole life and understand how to collaborate and work in a team setting very well.

82,Older College Student That Needs Your Opinion What Path Do I Take?,1550162076," 

Older college student (25 M) needs your advice: associates vs. bachelors

I am sorry for the long post. TLDR just read the questions in the middle. I welcome any input.

I currently have a Machine Tool Technology diploma, a CNC Technology diploma, and a Basic Machinist Certificate. I have experience welding and working in a hot rod shop and various construction fields.

However, my goal is to become a ME to work in a challenging, mentally stimulating environment surrounded by intelligent individuals. I was accepted into a university and began pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering last semester (I still have almost three more years to go), unfortunately, this moved me four hours away from my significant other (soon to be fiance) of four years (24 F). She started her PhD  in Quantitative Genetics a year ago and has about 4 more years remaining. The long distance and lack are funds are becoming more and more difficult for both of us, and affecting my grades. I am torn. I want to be a engineer desperately, but I also want to be there and support her while she pursues her incredible opportunity.

There is an opportunity for me to move back in with her, and attend an extension campus of a different university. Unfortunately, the extension campus only offers an Associates of Science (Engineering Pathway or Engineering Technology Pathway). I could finish the Associates in a semester and then work to support us both until she graduates. Once she begins working(and making tons of money), I could then return to a four-year degree which puts me graduating with a B.S. around 32 years old.

Any advice or alternative pathways I should look into?

What job opportunities are available for a person with my schooling and experience? Alternatively, what job opportunities will be available to my future self based on what path I take?

What job opportunities would be available for me graduating at 32? Does age factor for recruiters at all?

Will I be able to start getting gainful experience and the possibility to work my way into a good engineering position with an Associates Degree?

How are engineers with Associates Degrees regarded within the field? Specifically, what is the difference in the type of work they are given versus their counterparts with BS or MS?

Should I work couple years as a Machinist with my diplomas for my resume?

I feel so ignorant on what all my option mean for my future. I have always loved engineering and learning in detail the secrets of why the world behaves the way it does, and using that insight to solve complex, real world problems. 

A little bit more about my personal experience and why this is very important to me personally. It is long and boring and you don't have to read it. I will still welcome your opinion, or any knowledge you have, on the questions and options above.

 I have worked in various residential construction fields (plumbing, framing, HVAC, roofing, electrical, sheetrock, painting, ect.) I have worked as a farmer growing vegetables and keeping ancient tractors running. I worked in a higher end  restaurant as a saute chef. I was being trained as a floor manager for a manufacturing warehouse until the company dissolved. I have worked in pond and lake management. I have worked as a forester cruising pine and research plots. I have worked as a mechanic and body man in a hot rod shop. I have done a lot of manual labor in my life working in trades and seeing the other people that work their lives away in all those fields for hourly pay and no benefits with nothing to show for it except broken bodies and missing digits. The thought of getting stuck working in that kind of job for the rest of my life because I don't have a degree or the right degree scares me to death. I want to make sure that the path I choose at least has a path out of the hard labor I have spent my adult life in so that I can do fulfilling, challenging work one day.

These are roads, usually in large and old cities, that have been built to bypass the congestion of the inner city, and allow you to go cross-town without navigating nineteen sets of traffic lights. They are built underneath the city, so to speak, without being actual tunnels. I tend to think they're built on top of the river that used to flow through town or perhaps through some parkland -- because how else do you build without knocking down a bunch of necessary buildings? They seem to be BIG engineering projects and I would imagine they cost a fortune to do. I would guess it started in Europe, but I think most of them exist in Asia. Japan, perhaps started them? Could be wrong. They often cross the city, or bypass it altogether. They have been half-buried and lined with concrete walls (sometimes ceramic tiles added atop that), and all the roads that used to pass over this river, or vacant lot, or slum, or park, are now short bridges suspended over this buried road. The only explicit example I can think of is the ""half-buried"" railway track they built in, I think it was, L.A. that went for 11km and went to the port, from memory, and cost a small king's fortune ... though I know there are more of them scattered around big Asian cities.

0,tig welding thin wall 4130 N tubing,1550121738,"I’m looking for more info on the correct way to tig weld 4103 condition N chromoly tubing, from .035” to .120” wall thickness.

The methods I’ve used is to start with room temperature tubing (up to .095”), deburred, cleaned with acetone, and welded with er70s-2 (~75 ksi tensile strength) filler up to .065”, and er80s-d2 (~85 ksi tensile strength) for material over .065”. When welding .083” and .095”, I’ll take my time with the tig torch and give the tubing a bit of heat before starting my weld. For .120” I’ll preheat the area around the weld to ~300 with an oxy acetylene torch before welding. 

I’ve never had any issue with welds cracking before the tubing has yielded, but in those cases it breaks in the heat affected zone. I’ve done my research and came to this method, but still encounter a lot of people that claim all 4130 welds need to be pre-heated to avoid having the surrounding material quench the weld and make it brittle. Is there any truth to that? Is there a way to improve on the method I’m using? Unfortunately post weld heat treatment is beyond the budget and time constraints for most of the projects.

2,How do I calculate how much steel I will need to lift a load without deforming the steel? Is my math correct?,1550114104,"I want to put some forks on the front of my tractor. To purchase them would cost nearly a grand, and they would be for lifting things far more than the hydraulics on my tractor can handle. So I just want to make two metal beams, that I will bolt onto the front bucket of my tractor, so they will be cantilevered out.

&amp;#x200B;

I want each one to have one meter stick out

Each will be made from mild steel (Yield Strength 250 MPa)

I want to assume that the maximum load at the tip of each fork will be 100kg. (i.e. worst case, generally load will be evenly distributed)

That means the bending moment where the cantilever is 1kN\*m

A typical piece of mild steel I have access to is 10mmx100mm, so it's area moment of inertia (rectangular cross section) is b\*h\^3 / 12 which is 8\*10\^-9 m\^4

The stress at the base of the cantilever is 1 kN\*m \* (0.01 m/2) / 8\*10-9m\^4, = 625 MPa well beyond the yield strength of mild steel. And so that would not work in a million years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if I had a T beam, made of 2 10x100mm sections welded together, and I placed it in the strong direction, it would have an area moment of inertia of 2.4\*10\^-6 m\^4, assuming the same as before, the stress on the base of the cantilver is

1 kN\*m \* (0.01 m/2) / 2.4\*10\^-6 m\^4 = 2 MPa, which is WAY under the yield strength.

So that should be fine. Yes? The safe working limit of the bucket is 200 kg, so this should all be safe enough, assuming the bolts hold (a single M10 bolt can hold over 5kN, and I'd use at least three per fork, so I'm confident that will be fine)..

3,Is it accurate to calculate the linear force output of a screw using a simple calculation and plugging in 15-20% efficiency?,1550111344,"I'm finally wrapping my head around the calculations to determine mechanical advantage of a screw when using it to drive a press. If it matters, my use-case is to drive a small manual press for extracting oils from plants. I need to provide up to 16000lbs (70kN) with a screw driven by a simple torque wrench. The Torque wrench is my only guage and that's why I need to calculate the rest of the variables, I have no scientific measuring equipment and the project is meant to be a fun DIY press project, not an investment.

I understand the mechanical advantage before efficiency is a matter of distance traveled by my hand over linear distance traveled by the screw (2π[wrench length] / lead). I also understand that friction is a significant factor and efficiency can be very low because of this. So I found some reference number between 15% and 20% for efficiency depending on the material and lubrication. As for the accuracy I require, I need to be applying anywhere between 9600lbs and 16000lbs, which is a pretty big spread. That's ±3200lbs.

6,I've never quit a professional job before and I'm thinking of quitting my current engineering position.,1550108949,"This is my first job straight out of college (BS in Mechanical Engineering) and I've been here for about 18 months. I knew I didn't want to work here after the first month, but friends and family advised me to stay as my role may develop and they said I should give it a chance. Well, I'm a year and a half in and I don't think I want to pursue this for long. 

The reason I'm thinking about quitting is because I'm afraid I'm not doing any ""real engineering"" and not gaining reasonable experience in case I have to move or get a new job. I also work in a niche market and I'm afraid of pigeonholing myself into this industry due to my lack of engineering experience (I don't think I like this industry). When I say ""lack of engineering experience"" I mean that all I do is reply to customer emails, answer phone calls from potential customers, do some data collection on our products, and do general administrative tasks in excel/powerpoint/word. I think what I'm doing is ""Sales Engineering"" since I'm suppose to sell our products and be knowledgable about them, but my position is not titled as such. I'm also incredibly bored and not engaged at all -- I get to do the crap administrative work that upper management doesn't want to do. The people are super nice, but the work is so damn boring.

I don't do any CAD work, I don't review/make/handle any drawings, I don't use any 3D modeling software, I don't do any design work in terms of creating parts, and I'm just generally in my office from 8 am to 5 pm everyday waiting on emails. Some days I don't even talk to my supervisors, other than when they pass by and say hello. We have other employees who do all the modeling/CAD and I tried involving myself in that but my supervisors didn't want to spend money on a license or subscription for me since they can model themselves or hand it off. I don't even have any of that software on my computer so I can't even practice if I wanted to. Some days I go without talking to anyone and I'm kind of a social person so I need the interaction or else I get bored/disengaged. It's not a money issue either as I have received two raises in the first year (I'm earning what's considered low on the average scale for ME's but I live in low COL area so I'm comfortable).

45,How to reduce signal interferences from an electrical motor?,1550068604,"Hello,

My boss wants me to solve an issue we are having with our instruments (pressure transducers, pressure transmitters, thermocouples, etc). Basically, we have them all hooked up to NI DAQs and we get a nice clean reading until we activate our motor, which heavily skews the voltage readings.

Now I was able to drastically lower the interference by plugging the motor into another power source, but the closest power source is located pretty far, so my boss is not to keen on the idea of having a long extension cord running across the room.

So my question is, what else can I do to reduce this interference? The motor is grounded and controlled by a shielded cable, the instruments are all grounded and use shielded cables. 

Any help would be very much appreciated!

There are lots of interesting things in civil engineering if you are interested in the subject.

As a student, I think that you would need to study hard on subjects like calculus that might sound daunting and abstract but will give you the base skills to understand civil engineering. It wasn’t fun and interesting for me but that was the price to pay to learn how engineering works.

At work you would experience an amazing feeling when you see built what you have designed. It is something that may live beyond our lifetime. It is an heritage of yourself and what you have accomplished with your life.

On the practical side, a degree in civil engineering gives you many chances of employment and opportunities that you would never imagine possible. Today I work in my dream job. It wasn’t like this when I started. Actually it was the opposite, under paid and unhappy. It took me years to turn my career around and craft my CV to land my dream job.

70,Part Time Engineering Position Offer for Degree Seeking Student,1550022063,"So I am in a pretty unfamiliar situation. I was recently offered a part time engineering position for a company involved in nanotech/semiconductor R&amp;D. I'm extremely lucky, grateful and humbled to even have this opportunity while I am still in school. When I first started talking to the company, I originally thought this was for a summer internship but it turns out they want to hire me for a long term part time position until I graduate in Spring 2020 with a BSEE, after which I could have opportunities for full time employment. 

Since I originally thought this position was for an internship, I requested $20 an hour in the desired salary range of the application, thinking that that was a reasonably competitive amount to ask for an internship that might offer a housing stipend. They offered me exactly that amount in the offer letter which I have not yet signed, which (naturally) leads me to believe I could have asked for more.

Now that I have the offer and I know it's a long term position with no housing stipend, I was wondering whether or not $20/hr is still competitive for the nature of the position (Fabrication). Since I am still a student pursuing my degree, I know I do not really have any leverage to negotiate and that I will be more valuable and have a pay increase once I officially have my degree. 

I'm really stoked for this position and I'm definitely going to accept. However, since I now know that it is not an internship and there is no housing stipend combined with the fact that I have yet to formally accept the offer, I was wondering if I am in any position to ask for a little more due to my initial misunderstanding. I'm asking this here because I do not want to mess this up. I will definitely be more than happy to accept this position already, but if I can get a little more to help with rent for summer housing, that would be even better.

For a little more context, I do not reside in an extremely high cost of living area, and the PhDs in the department start in the low $30s/hr, so they'd be making around $12 more per hour.",AskEngineers,False,lucky_engineerboi,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq13rv/part_time_engineering_position_offer_for_degree/

Garage sits atop of a steep, long, winding driveway. The first 1000 feet are straight and flat but then there's a sharp left turn followed by a sharp right turn, followed by a final left turn until you are at the top. The grade is over 30 degrees in some spots.

Right now if it snows while I am not home I have to park at the bottom of the steep part and walk the last 400 feet. I don't really mind, I bought the house knowing this defect, it was priced accordingly, I am happy. 

I have no issue clearing the snow. It is not the topic of this question. My only dissatisfaction is I can't park in my garage when I need it most, aka it is snowing (I have 4wd and snow tires, this thing is steep). My question is would a winch system be possible to pull my car up to the top? I can spend some money on this, pour concrete slabs to hold anchor points etc, but I am new to winches and even the terms associated with them. The driveway is steep so something would need to lift the winch cable as it came over the convex shape. How would I handle the curves? I'd prefer one winch in the garage so not to have to send conduit out to power multiple winches but will if that's the only option. I don't want the winch on the car either, would rather have part of the house, not needed on every vehicle.

81,Fasten Thin Collar to Shaft,1550002352,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to design a shaft collar of sorts. It is for the purpose of keeping a blast nozzle centered inside a pipe. The blast nozzle and holder has a 2.25"" OD, and pipe IDs range from 2.65"" way up to about 7.8"". Currently, the nozzle just drags along the bottom of the pipe. Before designing anything fancy, I wanted to make a few sizes of UHMW collars that could clamp over the nozzle holder (made of brass) to keep the nozzle more or less centered. It isn't difficult to design a collar for a larger pipe ID, but I am struggling a great deal to fasten a collar with an OD of less than 3""or so to a 2.25"" OD nozzle holder holder. The proper size of setscrew is far too large (1/2"" threads, need at least 1/2"" of length which protrudes), and having a two piece collar, the screw heads stick out as well. Really, the fasteners shouldn't be able to touch the inside of the pipe in any way.

88,How to choose a job offer? (Money &amp; Foot in the door vs Engineering skill development),1549989108,"In May, I'll be a fresh college graduate with a degree in Electrical Engineering.  Right now, I have 2 offers that I'm trying to compare and contrast, and I don't know which one to take. Option A pays significantly more, but I wouldn't be getting the technical skills that I'm looking to obtain.  Option B is in an engineering field that I think I would really enjoy, but the pay is less.  

&amp;#x200B;

Option A:

This offer is from a fortune 50 tech company, and I'd be doing technical customer support on their products.  This job seems like it would be easy and straight forward, but I wouldn't be building my engineering skills.  While I do enjoy engineering, I'm not too sure if I'd enjoy doing customer support.   In this role, I'd be making $89,000-100,000 (adjusted for cost of living relative to other offer.  \*89 Base with a 0-20% bonus)  This offer is extremely above average for a starting electrical engineer.  Also, this could be my foot in the door to being an engineer at a Fortune 50 company.  

&amp;#x200B;

Option B:

This offer is from a fortune 500 defense company.  The role is an engineering job in the defense sector working on things I find to be interesting and important.  I'd be gaining technical skills and engineering experience, which will be very valuable later in my career.   This offer is for $75,000, which is slightly above average for a starting salary of an EE in this area.  

&amp;#x200B;

Help:  

I'd really like to approach this decision in a smart way, but I get held up at the fact that I'd be leaving a lot of money on the table if I choose option B.  However, if I choose option A, I won't be as valuable in engineering (which is primarily where I'd like to end up) because I won't be learning the engineering trade.

These seem to protect very well from the actual falling off the bike and skidding along the ground, but what happens if you hit something like a wall before coming to a full stop?

Your bones could still break from hitting something directly, so why isn't there something that would, for example, cover the broad side of your forearm from a strike perpendicular to your bone and something sticking out in front of your fist to take the impact that came parallel to your bone?

Wouldn't an exoskeleton help a fallen rider if he hit something hard like a wall? Am I missing something obvious that would make designing a suit like this impossible?

19,Is it possible for a part to fail from fatique if temperature is too low for creep and there is no crack?,1549910426,"Most of fatique life I have learned in Collegue is based on

1.Pre-existing cracks, assuming real-life scenario

2.Pre-existing weak spot

3.Cristallization temperature

&amp;#x200B;

I could not find a theory about fatique other than pre-existing cracks it seems like a poor theory to be very useful. It still relies on perfectly shaped cracks and even then I had hrard time to understand why size of micro-cracks matter this much.

I know it is unrealistic to think that there is any material without a crack, even in microscopic level but if it always needs a crack, how can we really make a realistic assumption of fatique life without somehow detecting cracks in whatever specimen we are analysing? I have not yet taken any courses about how are cracks detected experimentally but I am informed big cracks are possible by ultrason and vibration profiles of the machinery while working in some niche cases.

&amp;#x200B;

Such tools would give little about small cracks and even small, they may be very numerous or creating tiny hot spots and we could not catch it experimentally until the workpiece gets near retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

So, it seems like to me thatfatique theory based only on cracks tells half the story, or quarter.

In the past our systems consisted of a few dozen cables at most, including both COTS and custom cables/wiring. Many of the custom cables we manufactured in-house so our documentation methods were developed to fit our needs, usually consisting of CAD drawings (which take a long time to make) and spreadsheets.

Now we have a large system comprising a few dozen sub-systems (and sub-sub-systems) with well over 100 cables/wiring harnesses. Documenting this with our usual methods would be unwieldy and there is a push to outsource all custom manufacturing.

Unfortunately, we do not use formal PLM software and I don't believe we have the resources to integrate a full PLM system unless it is very flexible/scalable, easy to learn/use, and of course cheap.

**The documents I know we want:**

* BOM(s) with suppliers and pricing for all components

* Manufacturing instructions for the custom cable manufacturer(s)

* Assembly instructions so our system assemblers know which ends to plug in where

**Details I want to document for each cable:**

* Internal (entirely in a sub-system) vs External (interconnecting sub-systems) cables

35,Help calculating the maximum load of a steel beam.,1549859019,"Hi folks,

&amp;#x200B;

For shits and giggles i wanted to work out how to calculate a simple load on a steel beam equation, but i'm having issues interpreting the results. I weld up lots of projects and wanted to develop this understanding. I have some material here, a U beam. Its a 13 gauge sheet, of what i'd imagine is mild steel, thats been folded into a U. If i support it at its ends and stand in the middle it will bend a little... so its this that i wanted to replicate on paper.

There was a similar question on here and i used the answers there as a guide. I went to the skyciv site, pluged in the numbers for the centroid calculator, then used these figures to plug into the beam calculator for simply supported beams.

In the moment of inertia calculator i used 250mpa for the mild steel but planned on running a worst case 160mpa too (as some on the great internet quoted mild steel to be). I also used the profile on its side - C. 

So its a 5.5m beam, with pin supports at each end, with a point load (me) in the middle at 0.6kN.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where the results puzzle me. But first before i get to that, how do you guys determine whats a safe load limit on a beam? Its almost certainly not while the beam is bending right?!  

So back to the results... I imagined that the bending moment calculation would tell me at what load the beam starts to bend.... it gave me 0.825kN-m which appears to say that after a load of ˜1kg the beam is already going to start to bend. When i stand on it deflects maybe a 10mm.

Then the deflection result is -25906mm, which makes no sense to me at all... (actually the definition of bending and deflection probably play a big role here). 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, any help in interpreting these results would be much appreciated.

Mike

(I'm planning to eventually work with robotics and machine learning). So that leaves me with only two options.

Now the thing is, these two schools are far from where I live, and I'm not so sure my parents will allow me to move out (it's very uncommon for students here to move out for college). So that basically leaves me with no options and no chances of getting to enroll into an ABET-accredited program.

I know that for 2 gears to properly mate, the module (or modulus) needs to be the same: pitch diameter/number of teeth needs to be the same for both the spur gear and the pinion.

I'm just not totally sure how to get the pitch diameter. I think it's the root diameter + the tooth length, but I don't know if this is an approximation or the actual way of finding it. For example, I want a 3:1 gear ratio with a 26 mm tooth. Gear 1 has a root diameter of 166 mm, so I guess the pitch diameter is 166 + 26 = 192, with 30 teeth. Gear 2 has a root diameter of 38, with a pitch diameter of 64 and 10 teeth. I feel like these two gears should mate, but they don't really.

When I try to find how to find the pitch diameter, the only answers I get are using the modulus equation backwards. I can't really find much on how to design a gear without any set parameters.

My company has now researched, tested and ""failed"" for a long time on this material, and we must find a solution here.

I have come to the conclusion that it is only RHC machine with 150Kg (stationary equipment) that can be used, if it is the material we are testing and not the surface.

The problem is that there are no RHC handheld machines for stainless steel.

 

Machines such as Sonodur and Ernst (handheld, mobile equipment) are not suitable at ALL to take hardness measurements of 718, as this is precipitated hardened material.

 

We have now used 30Kgf DURASCAN 70G5 Brinell Hardness Test to verify the results, and get the same here as with this as on the handhelds.

We print with 30 kg on a 1 mm ball and then we only measure in the hardened bed after the machining, which is not representative of the material.

The impression clearly shows in the microscope that we do not get around the imprint, can send pictures of interest.

 

This means:

After a lot of testing and testing, handheld machines like Ernst and Sonodur and stationary DURASCAN get exactly the same results about 5 to 6 HRC over material certificate.

If the values ​​are a little high on the material certificate, the parts are rejected. We have taken these samples to LAB, where they have a stationary 150 kg HRC machine, and then ""spot on"" material certificate.

 

It is not the equipment or the people there is anything wrong with here, but simply the method.

60,Love everything about my job except the actual work. I have a fantastic work environment but I'm not gaining any real technical skills. Is it worth leaving a great work place just to do more technical work?,1549819380,"Right now I have pretty much the ideal work environment. Hours are so flexible that I can more or less work whenever the hell I want. I work downtown in a decent sized city meaning I have fantastic food options for lunch all within walking distance. My commute is relatively short and easy. My coworkers and I all get along very well and some I would even consider really good friends at this point. I'm somewhat in a leadership position in my group and my boss trusts me 100% to get things done and its totally hands off. In fact, I maybe only see him once every couple of weeks. The general office vibe is very laid back too meaning there's no dress code, management is very accessible, almost no red tape, etc. I genuinely have a good time at work too because my coworkers are so awesome. 

The problem lies in the actual work itself. I'm an engineer by degree and title but based on 90% of my work, I feel much more like a CAD operator than an engineer. I often feel that I could take a homeless man off the street and teach him 90% of my job in a couple of weeks. There's no room for technical growth whatsoever and I say that after I went out of my way to convince my managers to get some new analysis software in that I thought would be beneficial to our customer. I taught myself how to use it on my own time (I wasn't paid) and put together an analysis I thought our customer would really like. Turns out they weren't interested in it at all despite it literally costing them nothing. Because they weren't interested, my managers weren't interested and it pretty much died then. I loved doing it though because it actually required me to use my brain for once! I felt like a real engineer developing these models and simulations despite them being very basic and all. I continued to push my managers and tried to convince them to send me to formal training for it but they didn't want to spend the money. Our trial license for the software expired and I haven't touched it in months now. Since then I've been back to more or less pumping out drawings and simple components in CAD. 

I should also mention the pay is below average but more than enough to live on comfortably and save a good amount. I live in a very cheap city so that definitely helps. I feel like I could easily be making $15k more elsewhere though. 

My gut instinct is telling me I need to leave because I'm not developing any real skills at this point but I'm also worried about jumping into a shitty work environment. Like is doing more math in my day to day job really worth an overall less enjoyable work environment perhaps? Phrasing it like that seems ridiculous to me. 

I've had interviews in recent months but I really struggle to discuss any technical details of my work....because there are no technical details. It's really obvious I'm going into 'bullshit mode' when I tried to tie my projects back to engineering principles and I think interviewers can see right through this. 

But again is all of this worth it? I feel like my work environment is what everyone really strives to find and I've gotten lucky to find it very early on in my career. ",AskEngineers,False,sts816,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ap60hf/love_everything_about_my_job_except_the_actual/

74,Feeling unsatisfied with structural engineering,1549801147,"Hello fellow engineers of Reddit, I would like to ask a question that has been consuming my mind for the last year or two. 
I'm a structural engineer, in London, from Australia. I love engineering, am enthusiastic, driven, and have an eye for detail and practicality that makes me good at my job. I'm sure similar to many engineers here, I want to do good, to contribute to the world and humanity. The field I consider most important for us (which I could be a part of) is the exploration frontier, ie. the human understanding of the universe, leaving Earth to explore, settle, etc. I feel like I have chosen the wrong specialisation and feel stuck and unsatisfied, unable to achieve what I want. And with the incredible surge of progress and investment in aerospace technology recently I imagine there must be opportunity out there. 
I attended a lecture ""engineering in zero gravity"" which was incredibly inspiring, however realised that typical structural design does not constitute fine analysis of materials (ie. meshing custom materials and geometry further than a fin plate or piled slab) which appears to be critical in advanced design. This type of engineering is where I would like to be, if there's enough market for it. 
Has anyone been through a similar experience and worked their way in to where they want to be? Or know an industry I could investigate to get appropriate experience?

81,Can I please have advise and critiques on my designs for a clock?,1549768031,"I am designing the Clock Town clock from Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask. It does not run like a normal clock as it has two faces that both rotate. This link gives an example .([https://cresun9.tumblr.com/post/146251588849/in-the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-if-you-look](https://cresun9.tumblr.com/post/146251588849/in-the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-if-you-look))

You tell the time based on the location of each face relative to the arrow at the top. My main problems are determining the best way to rotate the outer ring and stopping the ring at the right spot for each minute. The clock is going to be  anywhere from 16""-20"" in diameter although the design is not to scale and merely conceptual.

This picture are my designs for rotating the outer ring. ([https://s.put.re/js9Z2dxY.jpg](https://s.put.re/js9Z2dxY.jpg))

1)  As shown by the left side, have a lazy susan attached to the minute face and a backing run by a motor connected to a gear train driving an internal gear connected to the outer face

2) As shown by the right side, essentially making a giant, gear box where the face slides over the gears that hold it up and screwing another piece of wood on the back to prevent it from sliding off the front as shown in the cut out view (1)

The next predicament is how to have the time be shown accurately. The first three ideas would include a Raspberry Pi.

1) Make the motor run slow, with the help of a compound gear train, at a constant rate so that it takes an hour to make a full circuit.

2) Use a motor with an encoder to track how many rotations the motor has made to reach each minute mark or at least the hour depending on how well I paint the clock.

3) Have a wave/bump cut out at each minute mark on the minute clock face, that hits a stationary button/lever, on the inside base piece, as it rotates

4) Do a lot of math and make a ""normal"" clock of gears, springs, and the like.

Also, could I please have advise on the various ways I would gear the motor to the outer ring? I would more than likely need to do some form of miter, bevel or screw gear to transition. Mind you I would need to carve the matching teeth into the outer ring and master carpenter I am not.

I hope I'm in the right place - if I am not, please let me know where I should post this for the best advice. Thank you!

I'm looking have my own monitor stand fabricated in brushed steel, so I have taught myself a little bit of CAD (autodesk fusion), and designed what I think to be suitable for my needs. However I lack the professional engineering know how to know if this project is viable, complex or not, and most importantly - stable. 

The project can be viewed by [clicking this link.](https://a360.co/2DzsP0f)

I also have some images available for viewing here:

* [Front](http://prntscr.com/miwqg7)
* [Rear](http://prntscr.com/miwr3i)

So, as you can see from the design - 3 x 27"" Monitors will be mounted to this frame - they will be mounted using [these arms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0722YHHX7/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).

In addition to the monitors - 2x Rockit 5 monitor speakers shall sit on the platforms at each end of the frame. 

I have concerns about the front leaning weight (total weight of all 3 monitors plus arms comes to ~28kg). So I have added the base plates which reach towards the front of the desk as a counter weight. 

In addition to this, the centre arm which clasps the desk from beneath - ideally I would like to remove this if possible. However if from a physics standpoint I am told it is required, then it shall be there. Last thing I want is for the frame to dip, or to lean forward in any way. 

The metal I wish to use is 1cm thick, I plan on using the cavities for running cables etc. 

Thats all I can think of, at the moment. However if you need any further information to help me, please ask. I'll get back to you asap.

Is it mainly a combination of math and tools (e.g. GPS) or is there an X factor that most people don't know about (e.g. the super sonic underground beacon)?",AskEngineers,False,dibs_on_pluto,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aovuix/how_do_engineers_drill_or_create_a_straight_line/
97,Temperature &amp; humidity control for a cameraman,1549741071,"I am working on a project with an astronomical observatory to help with keeping their diagnostic cameras from shutting down. Those cameras are installed on the side of the telescope, in a dome that is kept as close to possible to outside conditions, to avoid air movements that could distort the image. When the temperature goes below -20°C and the relative humidity is high (ie always), the cameras stop working. While not essential to how the telescope works, they are useful to make sure everything on it is working fine without having to go out of the control room and into the cold. My task is to control the temperature and humidity of the cameras, without affecting the surroundings so much that it distorts the picture taken by the telescope. This means I must be careful about heat and vibrations. Right now I am looking for reports or descriptions of similar systems, that is, systems with:

- Temperature control
- Humidity control
- Sensitivity to vibrations
- Sensitivity to heat.

I’ll keep looking on my own, but any link or mention of a similar project is welcome.",AskEngineers,False,relativistictrain,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aovr6z/temperature_humidity_control_for_a_cameraman/
98,Advice for the only female engineer in the office,1549736118,"I’ve been working as an engineer 1 at a copper mining company for almost a year now. Not sure of this would be the case everywhere I work, but at least in the mining industry it’s common to have little to no women in engineering. I am 23, so both the youngest person in the office and the only female. 

It’s starting to really be tough as I have such a different work style than any of the other men in the office. It’s sort of a “loudest idea is the right idea” environment which is not something i thrive in. I just wondered if any one has any advice for me in this situation or as I move forward in the career?

99,P&amp;IDs vs How the equipment actually looks in service?,1549735964,"Hello,
    
I'm looking for the best resource(s) to show examples of how a P&amp;ID actually looks like once manufactured in situ.
    
Is YouTube my only bet or are there learning resources out there that show some good examples of ""here's a P&amp;ID, here's what that actually looks like in real life?""
    
Please no smart-arse answers such as ""experience!"". Thank you ",AskEngineers,False,MechMonk2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aouuo9/pids_vs_how_the_equipment_actually_looks_in/
