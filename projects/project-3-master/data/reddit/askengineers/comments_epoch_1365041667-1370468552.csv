1,Force needed to strip internal threads.,1370464376,"I am trying to calculate the force required to strip the internal threads of something I am working on. 

I believe the formula is:

F=A_ts(S_us)

where S_us is the ultimate shear strength and A_ts is the shear area of the threads.

My biggest problem up to this point is finding out what the ultimate shear strength is. I have read .5(T.S.) and also .57(Y.S.). Which of these is a more appropriate calculation.

With this force I was going to simply compare it to the forces acting on the bolt (from use and from tightening). 

My bolt I am using is a 3/8-16, UNC made of A-286
The female end is the same threads made of A-182

2,AES key question,1370461046,"Situation:
The AES algorithm is being used on a project which uses a simple bootloader that has the key hardcoded to decrypt and install a bin file of the encrypted main application. The problem is that the key has been compromised because the unencrypted bootloader hex file was accidentally given to the wrong person.

My question is: Can I just change the key or will we have to utilize some other encryption/decryption method? If we can just change the key, do I have to use a AES 128-bit key generator or can I myself input random values for the key?

I don't know much about AES which is why I'm asking and the stuff I've found online has made me even more confused. ",AskEngineers,HindiKoAlam,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1fqozk/aes_key_question/

My stand will be 24.75"" square and 30"" tall. I estimate the load to be around 1100lbs. I'd like to use 1"" square steel tubing but I'm not sure what wall size I need to safely carry the load.


I found the formula for calculating maximum deflection at load of a beam supported on both ends.

Wl^3 / 48EI

W = Load in lbs.

l = distance between supports

E = Modulus of Elasticity

I = Moment of Inertia

As a starting point, I decided to run the numbers for 1"" 16 gauge square tube stock. I calculated its Moment of Inertia to be 0.03448 in^4.

    1100lbs. * 12in^3  / 48 * 29000000lbs/in^2 * 0.03448in^4  = 0.0396 in.

I used the same equations for 1"" 11 gauge tube. I calculated its Moment of Inertia to be 0.05697 in^4.

    1100lbs. * 12in^3  / 48 * 29000000lbs/in^2  * 0.05697in^4  = 0.024 in.



My questions are:

* Am I correct is assuming the horizontal beams are the weak point in this type of stand?
* Am I using the correct equation to calculate the maximum deflection on the beam for this application?
* Is 16 guage safe or should I use the beefier 11 guage material?
* Do I need to consider lateral forces? If so, how?
* How many gussets (if any) are required?",AskEngineers,cantrecall,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1fnuug/request_help_material_selection_to_support_heavy/

Summary:

1. Me: I griped in a post about the way Android will display a strong signal on some WiFi access points, but then when you attempt to connect, the signal display will change to become weak.
2. Response: ""Your phone has a better idea of the true signal once it tries to connect - it gets information about latency and dropped packets that won't be available otherwise. The actual hardware changes from monitor to active mode....""
3. Me: This issue doesn't seem to happen on Windows. [not in my original comment, but if they response I was replying to is correct, I wonder if it's merely a UI difference, and Windows simply doesn't display an updated signal strength of after it factors in latency and dropped packets]
4. Response: This is because laptops have more powerful WiFi adapters.
5. Me: That doesn't make sense, because if a more powerful WiFi adapter can reach further, you would expect that to simply increase the number of access points available, but access points at the edge of reception would still be marginal.
6. Response: It makes sense, because laptop WiFi is more powerful, and anyway, WiFi range is mostly a function of the router.
7. Me: Factually, more powerful cards and antennas do get you more access points, but besides, no matter the power, you would always expect that the access points on the edge of reception would be marginal.
8. Response: Link to Wikipedia on Inverse Square Law, with nothing else written.
9. Me, getting frustrated: I don't see how the Inverse Square Law means that when laptops connect to marginal access points they don't suddenly display a decrease in signal quality, nor do I see how it means a stronger card or antenna won't get greater range, and I've seen these phenomena before with my own eyes.
10. Physics.
11. I don't think the Inverse Square Law stands for these propositions at all, and a claim that power and antenna don't affect range not only contradicts the original assertion that this is because laptops have more powerful WiFi, but also the factual existence of setups that can receive WiFi over a mile away.

I am going to be a second year student at my local community college next semester. I have been very unsure of what I wanted to do my entire life until it clicked recently. My only obstacles that I think I will have to face are my prior mistakes/failures/inattentions due to lack of motivation which leads from depression.

I want to get into computer engineering in particular. Computers have been a big part of my life. I have been fortunate enough to have my own personal one since the age of 15 and then moved on to build one for gaming and such last year. Technology as a whole has always fascinated my and has given me a hope for the future of humanity. Technology is just the way of the future and is pushing us past limits we didn't even dream of years ago. Finding this all extremely interesting, along with the whole ""do what you love"" advisement I've been given from adults, I would like to be a part of the effort that is advancing our technology and pushing us forward. This is the biggest goal in my life right now and I've honestly wanted nothing more. (I'm extremely passionate about this). Anyway, math has always been the bane of my existence. I am just horrible at doing it and I have no idea why. I have no experience with math after algebra, which gives me huge problems. I never took pre calc or calc in high school or college so far. It's always been a weak point of mine. I was NOT necessarily the best student but I think it was due to lack of motivation. I got by with straight B's all through high school in every other subject without really paying attention, studying, or doing homework. I decided to go the community college route because college is very expensive and I still did not know what I wanted to do. My plan is to transfer to my state's large university and possibly enroll in their program and if I don't make it right away junior year, apply to do computer science and work harder until I make.

I'm trying to build something very similar to this [Radio Flyer wagon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWfVSZXKDNY).

I bought three of [these pneumatic air cylinders](http://www.ebay.com/itm/321061462309?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649). They are double action air cylinders with a stroke of 60 mm. 

I've been trying to find suitable solenoid valves and come up with a design to allow the wagon to move up and down. Would I need two solenoids for each cylinder, for a total of 6 solenoids? Would a three-way solenoid valve allow me to get away with one solenoid for each cylinder? 

I'm planning on using a small 12V battery designed for lawn equipment, as well as a medical-grade steel pressure tank for the air supply.

46,CATCHY TITLE: I'm a novice and would duly appreciate any experienced input regarding my career plans and future.,1370232401,"So I recently decided to pull my life together particularly in the scope of my career path and dumped my lame business major for engineering. Always being keen and fond of mathematics and recently taking an intrinsic interest in the sciences (especially space), I believe engineering could be the path for me. Considering the nearly rampant and prolific pace at which my thoughts run, definitely a problem-solving sense, and what I speculate is underdeveloped creativity, I am actually very intrigued and eager to swim around in the engineering waters. 

I'm at UGA which just recently revamped their engineering department, but don't have much of a intellectual clue on which field is right for me, in a sense. For a space-inclined career I was thinking of doing mechanical undergrad, possibly joining the military for a few years, then getting a MD at GTech (whatever the best school I get in to) in Aerospace engineering..

..Also, I more recently speculated on whether or not a civil engineering undergrad would do well with an architectural degree. This of course is something that I would be interested in but the biggest question is how practical and applicable to the real world either of these career paths are. I have only combined online research with my interests and hence am skeptical or rather cautiously analyzing these options but would love to have an engineer's analysis and input.

49,"Questions regarding electric motors, for use in a musical instrument.",1370212742,"I have been experimenting with an old aboriginal instrument called the bull roarer. Traditionally it is simply a small chunk of wood around five inches long that is spun above the head like a lasso. I have been doing this same thing with small cut pipes closed at the end as well. The pipes create a hollow whistle tone, and I am able to get the diameter of the spinning motion down to around 25 to 30 inches. The bull roarers have a much wider span, but I think that with an electric motor I could decrease the diameter for both kinds. 

I am currently looking into trying to buy some electric motors in attempts to get this same effect, but instead putting them on a wheel. I have a lot of questions about the various kinds of electric motors. How to go about buying them, and what would best suit my needs....

I've made a list of questions here. I would really appreciate it if you could answer as many of them as you can. Also, if there is any more information I could give so that you could better help, let me know.  

1. Because this will be a musical instrument it would be extremely good to have a relatively quite motor. Which motors create the least amount of noise naturally?

2. How much mass can electric motors hold? And what specs would help me figure this out? Does it have to do with how many amps or volts it needs?

3. brushed? brushless? DC? AC? What would you recommend for this application?

4. If DC, what type of adapter or AC/DC convertor would you recommend. Does the convertor just need to meet the minimum volts/amps requirements, or can it not succeed the requirements?

5. What are some tools that will be extremely handy that you recommend I also buy? I don't have a supply of tools at all. I would imagine I might need some kind of voltage meter. Maybe a soldering tool kit as well? 

6. Where would you recommend I look when shopping for an electric motor? I would like to keep things at a minimum price wise as far as possible....

so I'm working on a safe cracking robot for a floor safe I found in my garage over in /r/WhatsInThisThing and I've run into some issues with the stepper motor. I can get it to spin and stuff, but I need more torque of out it. I have it rigged up to the safe dial, but once it picks up the 3 wheel inside the safe the toque goes way up and the motor starts to skip.
I'm using the EasyDriver Stepper motor controller and an Arduino One (Actually it's from the makeblock.cc Advanced Kit). And I have this https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9238 stepper motor.
So I'm asking if there's anything I can do to get the most torque out of it as possible. I'm not real sure how to make sure the potentiometer. on the Easy Driver is supposed to be set (i.e. the correct reading for the stepper motor i have), or if i need a more powerful stepper motor. Or if mechanically there's a way to lessen the torque because of the way I have the motor driving the safe lid.
This is a picture of a prototype I was messing with before I got the stepper motor.
You can see the dial . The motor wasn't attached in this picture, but you can see the middle pin and the guide pin hole. (I've removed the number wheel, if that helps make sense).

The welder wants to do it with a torch rather than the other methods.

the torch will get the job done in 2 minutes or so, so great for productivity.

From what I remember one the main issue in this scenario are temperature gradients, (will cold shuts form because of the initial temperature gradients)? Assume it's TIG welding.

Since you're heating it so fast, is it safe to assume that most likely the bar is not at the desired temperature? maybe the guy is even using one of those flash temperature sticks.

68,Input on an idea or two please!,1370015914,"I’m looking for input on various ideas I’ve had (a.k.a Tell me what obvious thing I’ve overlooked that makes the whole thing impractical and unviable)! I’m aware that it’s unlikely that I’ve solved the world’s problems by musing in the bath, but any feedback would be brilliant, cheers!

So, let’s get down to it… number one:

I remember in one of my undergrad lectures hearing about the Carnot limit/cycle, where the efficiency of a heat engine is directly linked to the heat difference in the engine, and the less difference there is between the hot operational temperature and the cold reservoir, the worse the efficiency. Well, I was thinking, what if you were to use cryogenic liquids for a fuel, and a heat element as the driving force to expand the liquid to a gas (using liquid air, for example, would give roughly a 1:700 volume expansion), thus creating a huge temperature differential, and so an efficient engine… maybe! The idea would be to base the design upon a piston engine, where you squirt in a little bit of cryo-fuel through a one-way valve, then heat it, push the piston up, and then using the same kind of thing as in a reciprocating engine, release the exhaust on the way down, using other pistons to drive it.

I have already realised a couple of issues which would need to be overcome for the operation of this; firstly, the exclusion of water from the system will be critical, for ice will either seize the engine or reduce the efficiency dramatically (though I feel some sort of  lubricant over all the parts should do the trick). Also, I understand that although most dewars have only a small amount of leakage over time, this will become a large problem if ever used in a car, as no-one wants to come back after a holiday and find their car has released all the fuel into the garage! The solution to this I feel, would be to only use it in scenarios where the whole tank is used at once, and then needs to be refilled – so maybe ships, or lorries, which could be fuelled before each run, so although it’s not exactly solving the problem all in one go, it’s still a start! Besides, we seem to have an ‘all-or-nothing’ approach to alternative fuel, which is weird because if you could solve even half the problems, it’s definitely better than leaving it as is.


Anyhow, my rant is over, and I realise now that I should probably not carry on and put down anymore - enough for one day I think! Please feel free to tell me what-for!

Obviously we want to stay well under any possible failure point, and it supports 2 x 1m3 water tanks with no issues, and we'd prefer to have more rather than less. We currently think that a 20m3 plastic tank would fit perfectly, but we're not sure...

73,Is a UART serial port's buffer a stack or queue? Or: Good buffer reading practice?,1369958182,"Hey AskEngineers, 
This is my first post here. I appreciate any help.

I'm working with the Raspberry Pi's UART serial port. I have an IMU that sends data strings in real-time constantly at 8Hz. My goal is to be able to poll at any time in my software for the most up-to-date data.

So, my first question is: Is the input buffer on the RPi a stack or a queue? This leads into what I'm really after: What is a good method of reading from the serial input buffer in order to get the most recent data whenever it is available in the buffer? The biggest issue I see is handling situations where the buffer is full of old data.

To put the problem visually:

This is the use case, where the IMU is sending the real-time data, filling up the input buffer of the RPi: (Data is a string in the form: ""x=?"") (Packet = [char])

Let's say the IMU sends the data ""x=5"":

            ---------------- RPi -------------
            ----- buffer -----     -- code --
    IMU -&gt;     [5] [=] [x]    -&gt;    program

The program would read the characters in the order sent, from right to left, so as to read ""x=5"".

Now, let's say the IMU sends new data, ""x=9"", but the program has not yet read the old data indicating ""x=5"". Let's also say a colon delimits packets:

    IMU -&gt; [9] [=] [x] [:] [5] [=] [x] -&gt; program

I can imagine that I need to read the packet at the end. But, what if there is not a complete packet at the end? Or, what if the buffer is full? This is where I'm stuck. When the buffer fills up, does it push old data out, or does it sit and overflow until the old data is read? How should I implement the program to read from the serial port in order to always have in memory the most recent data from the IMU?

All help/advice is very much appreciated.",AskEngineers,LordDuff,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1fddzc/is_a_uart_serial_ports_buffer_a_stack_or_queue_or/

83,How efficient could this engine design be?,1369905811,"I call it the Peace Engine because the cross-section resembles a peace sign when it's halfway through each stroke. [This is a very rough animation depicting the basic function of the engine.](http://i.imgur.com/2mSctrL.gif)

The first thing you'll notice in that animation is the arm swinging left and right. This is called the Floppy-Flap (definitely using this as the legitimate name). This is essentially a wall all the way through the cylinder, which serves to separate the two combustion chambers from each other. It is heavy.

To the left and right of the animation is a pair of circles. They represent their respective sides of the combustion chamber. The black empty circle means the Floppy-Flap has hit the wall of that side of the chamber, rendering that side completely empty. The light blue circle means compressed air has been released into that side, pushing the Floppy-Flap out a tiny bit but remaining high-pressure due to the weight of the Floppy-Flap. The light green circle means fuel has been mixed with this compressed air. The red circle means this fuel has been ignited. The orange circle means the explosion has run out of space to expand into and that side of the chamber is now full of pressurized exhaust gas.

When one side ignites, it pushes all of this pressurized exhaust gas out of the exhaust valve of the opposite chamber. This goes back and forth forever, producing a pulse of high-pressure exhaust. This is the function of the engine; the Floppy-Flap *is* connected to a shaft, but it only drives the air compressor, and isn't doing any of the work the engine is responsible for.

Some cool things about this engine:

* It idles at 0rpm
* It should maintain the same efficiency at any rpm it can run at
* It can hypothetically run with only one of its combustion chambers functioning, though it will meet a drastic reduction in efficiency

Some uncool things about this engine:

* I have absolutely no idea how efficient it is. I'm not an engineer and haven't been able to understand the math I'm supposed to use to figure it out. This might be the biggest gas hog ever invented.

So, that's my question. How much fuel would I be wasting by using this engine? The goal is to get the highest exhaust pressure for the littlest amount of fuel possible, without the problems of a turbine engine (requiring they be run at max power for any kind of efficiency, for one thing). Do I accomplish this, or is the design just making everything worse?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've been working on this problem for two days now and it's quite challenging to tackle it with no engineering expertise.

87,"Let's say we have a small submarine running on a turbine engine. Let's say it can go down to around 75 yards depth, at which point the atmospheric pressure (so to speak) is around 100psi. How plausible is it to keep the engine running? What if we use the exhaust for thrust?",1369874363,"To make matters worse, the exhaust doesn't go directly from the engine into the surrounding water - it runs through a pair of 6-foot exhaust pipes.

So one problem we have here is, turbine engines like to have lots of oxygen around them. They get very depressed in the ocean. How could we cheer them up? Oxygen tanks seem like a good solution, but I'm not sure how much oxygen you can fit in a tank relative to the amount a gas turbine needs in order to run.

So I get to thinking about the possibility of electrolyzing the water and taking oxygen from it, which would also give us hydrogen which could be used as fuel (though that's the least of our worries). The problem is, it seems like electrolysis takes a shitload of power, much more than I'd get from running the engine. Even if we just run the engine for a moment and then stop for a while to replenish oxygen, I'm not sure it's feasible.

Then we have the much more pressing issue of the fact that water pressure at 75 yards depth is much higher than the pressure turbine engines were desigined to run on. For a moment I thought of having two alternating exhaust pipes, where at a given time, one is closed off being pressurized by the exhaust, and the other is open releasing its pressure into the ocean, switching back and forth rapidly, but then I encounter the issue of this actually just meaning the engine has to deal with even higher pressure - when each chamber depressurizes, it can still only get down to about 100psi. Silly me. What if we had an electric pump helping them get down to a lower pressure than that? It seems like it would probably require way too much energy. So the question basically comes down to, realistically, how much back pressure can a turbine engine handle before it's so inefficient that it's completely useless? How much is this mitigated if we're using it in a turboshaft functionality connected to a waterjet, and the exhaust just has to make it out of the vehicle, not propel it forward?

Sorry for the stupidly challenging hypothetical, I just really wonder how feasible this is because it's such a damn terrible idea.

I just asked this on /r/engineering using another account, but because it's so fresh reddit wasn't happy letting me post anything else any time soon. Anyways...

 I'm looking into getting some sort of coordinate measuring setup for my lab, and was wondering if anyone around here could help point us in the right direction. We had first looked at something like the eMicroScribe[1] , but that turned out to be well out of our price-to-accuracy ratio (from ~6,000 at .009"" to ~10,000 at .002""). I've contacted the guys at Faro asking about their lowest cost options but my impression is that they'll be more expensive.

We're also considering just going simple and buying a dial indicator and necessary accessories, but this is less than ideal given its literal one dimensionality. Are there options out there for high accuracy (.001"" or below) multi axis CMM apparatuses of any kind? If anyone with advice could tell me either what they know or even where to look I'd really appreciate it.

Edit: Details I obviously should have included to begin with:

Use: I'm working in an astrophysics lab and whatever we get will be used to inspect various custom parts which we have manufactured for many different purposes, some much more sensitive to error than others. Immediate need which prompted me to search is that we have a couple of small (~2""x2""x.125"")mirror parts with hyperbolic and parabolic surfaces that we'd like to inspect for accuracy/positioning. Though this could be done easily enough with a low cost option (&lt;$500 for a whole dial indicator setup) we're looking into the option of getting something that we will generally be able to use for inspecting all sorts of parts we have fabricated. In particular a system which actually generates a meaningful coordinate reference is appealing when it comes to parts such as these mirrors, whose shapes and alignment are essential to the optical setup for which they were manufactured. So overall it will be used for measuring feature locations and surface features of parts which will probably not ever have a dimension larger than one foot, say. The Faro/eMicroscribe arm designs are appealing in terms of portability and positional flexibility, but if getting an articulated arm of this sort is a strong cost driver, it's not necessary.

Monetary/quality Budget: I'm not in charge of budgeting, so I can't say for certain, but if it gives any sense, we *might* have considered buying the $10,000 eMicroScribe arm if it had an accuracy closer to .0005"" rather than .002"". Let's say that we wouldn't be interested in any device with tolerances in excess of .001"", and depending on the quality of the device would consider entering the $10k-$15k range, naturally always preferring to cut the cost if possible. We'd love to get down below, say, $7k or further, but we really just don't have a sense for what you get at what price point. I'm sure there's a huge range and maybe our constraints aren't realistic (someone's already talking about a $60k machine).

At the end of the day we could lay out $500 tomorrow and get a dial indicator that would solve our current problem, but I'm interested to see if there's any realistic option that would have us set in terms of our metrology needs for the next 10 years.

14,Interesting brainstorming request for electrical engineers or anyone else,1369706372,"First a small bit of background: 

I have a magnetic implant in my finger. Why? The magnet is strong enough to respond to everyday electromagnetic fields with small motions. Since the magnet is surrounded by the nerve endings in my finger, I can feel these motions. Essentially it grants me a ""sixth sense"". Most electronics cause a buzzing or vibrating sensation, which isn't surprising due to the nature of alternating current. Microwaves, laptops, most things with a heating element, and many other everyday electronics produce strong enough electromagnetic fields for me to feel them from varying distances (usually up to a few inches or even a couple of feet from my finger depending on the strength of the device).

My question for you is this: Can you think of any interesting ways to utilize this sixth sense? What I mean is say I made some device that would rest around my finger, like installed in a glove, capable of generating an electromagnetic field. I could, for example, link this device to a laser range finder. When I measure a distance the EM generator will give off a signal, and when a longer distance is measured my device would give off a stronger signal, essentially letting me ""feel"" the measured distance. Now this example would be kind of pointless in practice, since a laser range finder would have a display already giving me the measured range, but it kind of gives you an idea of what could be done.  

Any questions or ideas are welcome. I'm open to practical ideas, or just fun ones.

32,Would this design make sense?,1369632651,"So, in my free time I come up with crazy ideas for urban transportation solutions, most of which for the mobility issues of my hometown. Not for real implementations though, seeing as I'm not really qualified (professionally and politically) for it, but at least to spur the discussion among other interested wannabe-urbanists.

So, one specific solution would require a 250m-long 17% grade to be climbed by a rail-like system. Now, I know for a fact that no rail system can deliver 17% grade climbing without it being some sort of rack railway but, seeing as elevated railway is acceptable, one option is to start the climb ""earlier"" and have a shallower grade for a longer run.

The problem, however, is that this would require a long and tall viaduct to be built, with several tall and obtrusive pillars holding the railway itself. So I thought to myself: if we want to save on building several pillars, why not build a cable-stayed structure then? That's where I hit a wall: I know that cable-stayed bridges have been built, with ginormous spans, but they're usually flat. All my googling couldn't find any example of a hill-climbing cable-stayed bridge.

So that's my question: would that design be sensible? The relevant elevation profile can be seen here http://i.imgur.com/DAUWhF6.png, already with a poorly-drawn tentative profile for the viaduct and its cable-staying structure.

I've done a little bit of research on geofabric/geotextile systems, and it seems like the fabrics all need to be installed in layers as the slope is constructed, which in this case would require a lot of earthworks. Ideally I would have thought there would be a product that could be driven or drilled into the slope without the need to remove and recompact all that soil. 

Other than that maybe a fabric could be placed on the face of the slope and grasses planted to improve stability. I currently do not know what the limiting factors are for erosion control systems like that. 

The steepest slope is about 40-45 degrees. The soil is heavy, highly plastic clay, with some gravel and large basalt boulders.

Recent EE graduate here looking for some advice.  I'm looking to break into the controls industry.  I've applied to quite a few junior controls type positions and been having some pretty decent success (probably a result of good grades/industrial internships).  About a week ago, I got a callback for a position I applied to labelled PLC Programmer.  I was interviewed and quite rapidly got an offer.  The compensation is quite fair, and the location is somewhere I'm interested in living... however I'm unsure if this is really an ""engineering"" position.   From what I've seen online, PLC programmer seems to be more of a ""technician"" job.

I'm just here to ask if this would be a good ""get your feet wet"" type of position for someone with my intended career path.

42,Miniature Forced Convection System Design Problem,1369557262,"I am designing a small system that attempts to transport air via forced convection.

The following link contains a couple of diagrams. One shows a plan view of the system, the other shows a cross-section view of the ""fan box"". 

http://imgur.com/a/BncAM#0

**The system needs to circulate air from the smaller box to the larger box, and back again in a loop.**

The tubes have an inner diameter of 3 mm. Here's a page with a picture and some additional information: http://www.coleparmer.ca/Product/Tygon_non_DEHP_ND100_65_1_8_X3_16_50/RK-95666-05

Each length of tubing (note that there are 4 lengths) will probably be ~ 35 cm in length. Connections (into the various boxes) will be via luer locks: http://www.coleparmer.com/buy/category/nylon-fittings

Cross section of a luer lock: http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6673059-0-large.jpg

The fans are small 4 cm x 4 cm fans that look kind of like this: http://www.pcsilent.de/ppic-MAXI-Scythe-Mini-Kaze-4cm-fan-2pin-connector-quiet-40mm-fan-hard-drive-chipset-scyminikaze40u.jpg

They will be enclosed in a plastic box that fits snugly around, and will have two luer locks, on both of the 4 cm x 4 cm faces. The fans will be arranged so that they will blow air in a loop (see the bird's eye view picture).

My intuition with this is rather terrible at the moment, so this preliminary design probably has quite a lot of issues with it.

**My questions:**  

1) Will the ""fan boxes"" actually push air through the tubing? I highly doubt this at the moment because of the large difference in dimension between the inner diameter of the tubing and the fan box (which is even worse really, due to the constraints in inner diameter imposed by the luer lock...so the minimum diameter along the length tube is actually &lt; 3 mm). I personally think the fans won't really push air through the tubing, as much as bounce air around the fan box (little as it is, since the box fits very snugly around the fan box, and is well sealed) but I would appreciate some way of being able to confirm this beyond just an intuitive look. 

2) What are some simple mathematical models I should be aware of while designing such a system?

44,Using starter motors to power a 30ish lb 'battle bot'. Not strong enough? (Pics),1369548752,"I have two lawn mower starter motors connected to two wheels on either side of the bot via chain and sprocket. The current draw is absolutely insane. I keep upgrading batteries; I'm now playing with a car battery borrowed from a friend. The motors start off very slow and slowly build speed if they're under any load whatsoever. They spin up quickly under no load. When I say ""under load"" I mean that I'll have the wheels off of the ground so the motor is only pulling the chain and two wheels (almost zero friction). They're operating opposite of what I want. Zero torque and high speed. I thought starter motors were known for their high torque, what gives? I fear I may have to go motor searching all over again and further bust my budget. The end goal here was to have a 'bot' powerful enough for me to ride on. Can I modify these 12v brushed motors? Do they need something I'm not providing? Any other motor ideas? (Power window motor, windshield wiper motor, wench motor, power wheels motor?)

First off, I apologize if I may have posted in the wrong subreddit. I am new and I couldn't decide the best place for this post to be in. So, multiple subreddits it is.

So yesterday a neighbor gave me his old PC. When I say old, I mean OLD. It's a Compaq Presario and here are the specs

CPU: INTEL Celeron
PSU: 250 W
RAM: 512 MB
CD  : Drive can burn CDs, don't know about DVDs
MB  : It looks like an OEM Machine so, the stock Intel chipset that usually used to come with such machines

Now, it's a pretty archaic machine and I was wondering if you folks had any good ideas on what to make of it. I thought NAS would be a good idea but I was looking to explore a bit more before actually doing something with it.

Another idea I had was to pair a bunch of ATmegas over serial and have it control/monitor lights, fans or other electrical outlets but to think of it, I could just get a Pi/BeagleBoneBlack and do all that stuff with it way faster and cheaper. So, this seems like a long shot as well.

So these are just some ideas I had, eagerly awaiting your response.",AskEngineers,runmawn,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1f12ms/got_a_compaq_presario_desktop_yesterday_what_can/

In a perfect world, when I push on the top of the table, nothing would happen.  In the real world, the table wobbles back and forth.  From a mechanical engineering point of view, what's going on?  

Is there some stress-strain relationship going on at the table-top/leg joint?  How do I reduce the wobbling?  Thicker legs?  Horizontal bars halfway up the legs?  Cross-bracing?  Lag screws?  A big tie-rod running through each leg?  Why would these work/not work?

The first problem is the motor spins 2x as fast, in the wrong direction, and is non-reversible. I'm probably going to make a friction wheel drive, or mount the motor upside down (either would also use the existing belt and pulley setup) to compensate for this.

I figured this would also be a good time to try setting this up for light milling work. The Jacobs chuck has a taper to it, which will pull loose during milling. I'm thinking about drilling a hole through the column to put a pin through the chuck to keep this from happening, but I'm not sure it that will work since it is enclosed in the (non-rotating) support column (maybe a threaded insert instead?)

I have 1,5 year of experience and a master degree in civil engineering. There are moments I like my job but there are also moments when I’m bored with my job. I spend more time in meetings or telling co-workers what to do than I spend time on engineering. When I spend time on engineering it’s mostly calculations for the quantity state.


With the current crisis in Europe we get less and less new projects. My boss gives me projects that are “bleeders”, projects where we don’t make profit. So I am spending time on projects that are years old but never finished, the previous engineers already had spent too much time on these projects; These projects are poorly designed since they are not good enough to deliver to the client. I find a lot of errors in these designs, which sadly cost time to correct these errors. Because I can’t make any profit with these old projects and new projects go to someone else.


The main problem is that the company gets less and less new projects, and I have a feeling that I will get fired when I finished my current projects, simply because there are not enough new projects. So I’m looking for a new challenge.


This weekend I saw a nice job offer to become a tender engineer for one of the most prestigious companies in the country. I really like to be competitive and I like to find the best alternative to make profit. I am good in finding errors in designs. Would you recommend me to become a tender engineer?

As part of a design, I have a large pneumatics pipe that is insulated. The pipe exists, this is about its insulation. The goal is to be solid and light.

I'm looking to put an insulation blanket around, kept there by some kind of plastic soft fabric (that we already know). We consider that the pipe can leak (for a while before it's detected and shut down) and the insulation can't burst open until a certain leak rate. Therefore there are holes made into the fabric to allow for the leak.

My question is about the installation and attachment of such fabric. We are going towards velcro, but due to the high leak rate we need quite a lot of it. So I'm trying to find other solutions to attach it.

So far, I've only thought of a lace (which could be double for fail-safe requirement), but I'm not sure of the feasibility of that. I'm thinking that the holes could be replaced by a gap under the lace then.

So picture a rolling mill. Wire is pulled off a spool, between two rollers spaced just far apart so text gets squished into wire, without (greatly) deforming the overall round shape; then coiled onto another spool.

All I can find on google are tools that mark the plastic sheathing of wires and cabling for electronic uses. Either using laser burning or dye printing.   I cant find a tool that directly marks raw wire.

I know that brushed permanent magnet DC motors would work best for my application, but rather than put more money into this (it's for a school project) I'd like to use what we've got lying around. 

We've got AC motors galore around our shops. Single phase, Three phase and old alternators lying around. Today i attempted to see if a relatively new single phase .5 HP AC motor would work. I hooked the shaft up to a drill press, spun it at about 1640 RPM using an old fan as the load, and lo and behold it worked! For about 5-10 seconds... It was reading about 50-60 volts, and was unable to check the current before it stopped working. After 5-10 seconds the reading dropped to around 0.1-0.2 volts. It was suggested that what i read was the startup capacitor discharging, rather than achieving any true power generation.

My question is.... 

Can a single phase AC motor work as a generator for my hydroelectric turbine? 

If not, would an old car alternator work? How much power would i need to provide it for it to produce? Are alternators able to produce in the 500-1000W range? Or are they more or less low power outputs?

me and my friend are making a nixie clock for our common friend's birthday, bu we encountered some problems. We need to feed the tubes with 200V, and in the outlets we have 230 (Europe). The tubes are IN-12B. We want to use this voltage converter: http://mirley.firlej.org/przetwornica_9v_150v (sorry, it's in Polish, but you can read the schematics) as far as I know it can handle 200V. Unfortunately, we get max. 80V. The mosfet heats up considerably, but we attached a radiator to it for further runs. Still, the radiator gets so hot after a while that you can barely hold it. As far as I know, the mosfet gets 3A, but it should theoretically last up to 5A. Still - not sure if it wasn't damaged the first time we tried it. The choke element we used was also DIY, but it had proper properties, so theoretically it shouldn't cause problems. Supposedly, the converter I linked to works, according to people who used it for their projects, although they do report problems with the mosfet heating up.

That second variable is a ultimate tensile strength of the material - so if had a [37Cr4 Nitro case hardened steel](http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Drive/Gear_tables.html) with a UTS of 1570 MPa, the torsional strength would be 78,5 MPa.

0.55 * UTS (the formula was in [NASA fastener design manual, 21 p.](http://snebulos.mit.edu/projects/reference/NASA-Generic/NASA-RP-1228.pdf))

After about 5 years of studying engineering, I realized that the only classes that interested me were Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, Combustion, a little bit of HVAC and fluids. I also did a bit of a senior project on Nuclear Power and discovered that it was the subject I truly wanted a career in.

Here's the thing : My GPA is not that great (&lt;3.0) and I tried applying to the power plants here in Georgia but nobody has called me back, not even for an internship. Most starting jobs for ME are in the design field, at least from what I've seen on my college job board so far. I'm not particularly interested in design/CAD work for a career, but I do alright with CAD modelling. 

I'm obviously going to get my masters in Nuclear Engineering in a year or two when I have a bit of money saved up from doing a job, even if it's something I don't particularly enjoy. So my question is, what type of entry level jobs do you NE guys suggest I take for my experience to be relevant when I apply for a Nuclear job after getting my MS?

79,Construction of a Centrifugal force plant growing system.,1368821216,"I've always been interested in how plants grow in different environments, and spinning them around for a few weeks sounds like a lot of fun. Let me describe the general setup that I have in mind.

The plants would grow along the wall of something the size and shape of a coffee can, which would be spinning fast enough to, hopefully, simulate one or several gravities in the radial direction. They would be lit constantly by a small LED source to promote growth, the faster they grow, the faster the effects of the centrifugal force will be seen, thus leading to less experiment time. A 12V motor or even a little hobby motor with a gear train would probably spin it fast enough. Watering could be accomplished by simply spraying water in several times a day with a windex bottle.


Visibility is a complicated issue. You might be able to flick your eyes quickly, like you can on the highway, and pick up a snapshot of whats going on inside, but I'd like to construct a timing system with a shutter that would give you an 'uninterrupted' view of a segment of the growing area. If you had a shutter wheel spinning at the correct speed, its opening would only align with the 'viewport' when the can was at the same position.

80,Should I teach myself CAD this summer?,1368814413,"I'm a rising senior studying civil with an environmental focus. I'll probably be working with my advisor this summer doing research on stormwater pollution from highways and setting up water monitoring equipment. Unfortunately it wasn't my first choice for summer involvement since I was declined (and am waiting to hear) from a few internships. 

Since I feel my involvement might not require too much of my time, I was considering learning CAD at home during free time (because I never had to learn it and know it's importance). My first thought was to find AutoCAD on TPB, download it, and look up how-to videos on YouTube and/or find a manual.

83,I am a Junior studying Petroleum Engineering and I feel so dumb. I still don't fully understand - when and how does a well start producing once it gets near the trap?,1368810055,"So I understand these main concepts (just summarizing):

For drilling the hole, the process is as follows: 

1. A starter hole is drilled (wider than main hole) and lined with conductor pipe. The main whole is drilled with an oil rig, but not the whole way down to the oil/gas trap. The bit, collar, and drill pipe are set, the kelly and turntable are attached, and drilling is started.

2. Casing pipe is inserted into the hole and the hole is cemented to prevent collapse

3. Stop drilling when the rock cuttings contain signs of oil sand from reservoir rock

4. Test the rock samples, measure pressure, and lower gas sensors into the hole to determine if the reservoir rock has been reached.

**Okay I'm fine til here, this is where I get confused:**

1. Lower a perforating gun to punch holes into the casing (OK)

2. Run tubing into the hole for oil and gas to flow through to the top: (What? Run additional tubing down? Wouldn't gas already be flowing once the perforations are made?)

3. Seal the outside of the tubing with a packer (OK, makes sense if you put more tubing down)

4. Control the oil flow (OK, so they control the oil flow, but WHEN does this oil flow actually start?)

5. Remove rig when oil/gas starts to flow, install a pump on the well head

**Basically my main questions:
We inject muds/slurrys to increase production rates, but I just cant visualize this. I just keep reading ""Mud is injected into the drillstring."" What does this mean? It flows down from the very top of the well? Then how does it come back up? And how can it be injected when oil is flowing?**

**Also, when exactly does oil start to flow up? Won't some start flowing once you are near the reservoir? Won't it be flowing once the perforations are made?**

The crank's torque then gets distributed to the water pump, oil pump, yada yada yada yada, but most of course goes into the wheels.
 
I've been thinking, would it be better instead to make the drive train and everything else electric by throwing all of the engine's power into a huge alternator instead (similar to how it is done on huge diesel train engines)? In this way you could optimize the engine specifically for generating power, and not worry about the demand of accelerating/cruising etc. Of course though, this would require a battery and all the other things that come along with electric cars. Could this possibly be more efficient? &lt;sarcasm&gt; Have I stumbled upon something that could revolutionize the car industry? &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

Despite it being an engineering job, the work that I am doing didn't feel like ""engineering"". For those familiar I was mostly executing IQOQs for some basic equipment and conducting Equipment Validation Reviews. This consists mostly of documenting actions and reviewing (and correcting when necessary) existing documentation. I haven't needed a calculator, I never use excel for anything other than organizing data in charts, there are no real design or problem solving aspects of my job. I don't model heat transfer, calculate flow rates or size reactors. This is not the kind of work I would like to continue doing.

Will my lack of experience in anything other than Pharma make it hard to switch industries? I hear that there are tons of jobs out in Alberta which is the biggest reason I am interested. That and the money. What kind of work can I expect? Will I be mostly in field locations like Ft McMurray or would I work a lot in cities like Calgary? I've heard a huge range of salaries for young engineers, what can I expect? Is it typically shift work, x weeks on x weeks off or 9-5?

I'm from Toronto and I don't have an objection with moving away from friends and family but if there are companies that would fly me to and from Toronto that seems like the best of both worlds.

12,"Just got an offer from a defense contractor, should I accept it or ask for more?",1368681025,"I've been working for the government as an engineer for about 4 years now, and I've pretty much maxed out my career path. The only way I can get a large raise now would be by becoming a team lead (positions don't come up very often) or a supervisor (not really interested, **and** don't come up often). So I started applying to private sector jobs a few months ago.

Earlier this month I scored a phone interview, followed by an in-person interview, followed by another in-person interview with my would-be boss and his chief engineer. Apparently they liked me and pushed me through HR. I did all the normal background check type stuff and just got an offer today.

First of all, it's a pretty decent raise in base pay, roughly 20% more than I'm making now. However, I'm not just interested in the base pay.

At my current cushy government job I earn about 4 weeks of vacation a year plus 13 days of sick leave. The new job will only get me 3 weeks per year until I've been there for 5 year (and only 2 weeks for the first year).

I also won't get as good of retirement benefits, the government job has a ""free"" pension that you get put into for working X years, as well as 5% matched in a 401k. The new job gives a 3% match in a 401k until I've been there for 5 years, when it goes up to 4%.

Life/Health/Dental/Vision insurance are just about a wash between the two, roughly the same options and about the same benefits paid by employer.

So if I take the new job I lose out on sick time, some vacation time, and some retirement benefits, but I get a substantial pay raise out of the gate, and more potential pay the longer I stay with them.

As for the job itself, the government job is boring. It's easy, and it's laid back, but it's also not challenging in the least, and I'm using less and less ""engineering skills"" each year and it's becoming more and more bureaucracy. I'm honestly a little worried that if I stay with the government job for too much longer I literally won't be able to go into an engineering career because my skills will have totally atrophied. Meanwhile the new job sounds exciting and fun, but could very well just be a case of the grass being greener. I have some friends that work in the same department I'd be going into, and they obviously have their own complaints, but they've been there for about 5 years now and still enjoy it.

So, does this vague description sound like a good idea? Has anyone else transferred from government bureaucracy into the private sector and enjoyed it (or hated it)? Should I try and negotiate anything else into the offer? This is the initial offer and I have a couple days before I need to respond. Is there anything else I should compare between the two jobs? The commute is about the same for each, and if I got the new job I might be able to carpool.

32,What are the design considerations for fatigue in non-civil/structural engineering related fields?,1368561939,"Ok, this is long, but it's something that interests me.  As a structural engineer, there are situations where a design load, which under a single application will not cause failure, may, under repetitive loading, cause a member/element/component to fail due to fatigue.  It seems obvious to me that this is also the case with non-civil/structural related engineering applications.  I'm just curious to hear from some of the Electrical, Computer, Mechanical, Aero, etc. engineers as to how fatigue failure or cyclical loading is considered in your field of engineering.  This can apply to any type of ""load"", be it an actual physical force, but also electricity, heat, rotations, cycles, etc.  

Specifically, I have the following questions:

1.  Generally, how many repetitions cause a given type of fatigue failure?

2.  How often do fatigue type failures dictate the design?  Structurally, fatigue failure most often is not considered simply because structures do not experience the repetitions/cycles necessary to result in failure.  Bridges are one of several exceptions to this, where vehicle traffic may need to be considered for repeated loading/unloading.   

3.  How is the design for fatigue controlled/governed to ensure the durability/performance of whatever you design?  For structures, fatigue is part of the building code, and required to be considered for any building or bridge.  Are there governing bodies that dictate how  much fatigue a given piece of electrical or mechanical equipment must be able to withstand before failure?

4.  What are your design considerations to balance the desire to minimize cost by providing less durable designs (increased profit), while also limiting your risk of product failure or poor performance if you provide less durable designs?

5.  Conversely, how do you decide that an increased cost to provide a more durable design is justified, even if a client or consumer is only worried about the bottom line cost?

6.  Are fatigue designs based on experimental research, experiential data, or theoretical design concepts?  Examples?",AskEngineers,adillen,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ec3f8/what_are_the_design_considerations_for_fatigue_in/
33,Hinges for circular pipes?,1368557227,"I'm looking for a way to attach a hinge to the ends of a pair of circular pipes that would allow the pipes to move in one direction in one axis only... if that makes any sense. Like most door hinges do not allow doors to open both ways, the pipes should not be able to go both ways in the axis that they are rotating in. [DIAGRAM](http://i.imgur.com/wZwqEUV.png) This should happen naturally if the hinge mechanism is placed at one end of the pipe's edge instead of in the middle.

The only other restriction is that the ends of the pipe must not be covered, or if they are then it should be kept to a minimum, or allow for a cord to pass through (the cord's diameter is 25-50% of the inner diameter of the pipe).

Any ideas? The only way I've thought of so far is to attach the hinge to a 'square frame' that sits around the outside of the end of the pipe. [DIAGRAM](http://i.imgur.com/qHVFfVY.png)

At the moment i'm following an internship at FishFlow Innovations. This company is making fish friendly passages, like an 100% fish friendly Archimedes screw.

Question:

The Archimedes screws are completely made of composite. We want to couple two cured composite parts together by putting a new layer of polyester laminate upon both parts. The connection between the cured composite and the new layer of polyester laminate doesn't count as a compleet composite part. The Polyeters resin will serve as a glue connection, because the polymers of the cured composite are completely done with the reaction and won't make any new connections with the new laminate layer. I can't find any information about the technical data of a polyester resin glue connection. Or is it better to prefab parts and glue the two parts with the prefab parts together with a better and stronger glue.

I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to explain, sorry for my bad English.

TL:DR: How strong is a connection between cured composite and a new layer of polyester laminate that acts more like a glue connection.


EDIT: I have chosen to use vinylester laminate, we are using Proxide Norpol 11 (for vinylester). We decided to not use prefab parts and glue the two parts togehter with the prefab parts in between, because of the glue surface. You can't guarantee an compleet glued surface but when we laminate the whole surface will be coverd. I added photo to carlify the situation (not the compleet parts just an portion of it).

I'm fresh out of college and working now for a manufacturing company that designs and builds mobile equipment. I raised a question today concerning our emergency stops, and I don't feel it was adequately answered (responses all seemed to be preference), so here we go.

Some background: the engine manufacturer recommends that emergency stops cut the ignition sense and power input lines (3-4) to the Engine Control Module (which can easily be done with a positive-guided relay), and then states quite clearly that there is no official recommendation for multiple e-stops.

The question: Surely there is some standard (or even an industry ""best practice"" for the wiring of emergency stops? Should they be wired in series with normally closed contacts, or in parallel with normally open contacts? One could go even further by using multiple contacts per operator in case of contact failure, or by using normally-open early-make contacts.

65,"Not sure if I can ask this here, but... am I paranoid, or living in a death trap?",1368410567,"Hi, /r/architecture.  I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this, but I'm a little bit at wits end about this inquiry. Let me try to sum this up as briefly as possible:

I live in Japan, and moved from my tiny apartment to a big house across from my place of work about a month and a half ago.  This is what the exterior of the house looks like: http://i.imgur.com/653B21Sh.jpg  

I'm not an architect myself (so I'm sorry for my lack of technical knowledge!), but the house is built in a very common lightweight style for this area.  The frame is wood running into a concrete base, and I'm fairly sure the brown outside walls of the house are just drilled onto the wooden frame.  The house itself is 12 years old.  

I was so enamored with the great location and low price of the house that I did not notice some obvious flaws until I moved in.  The first, and scariest to me, is that the entire house shakes when a heavy truck comes rumbling by.  I'm OK with it happening when a truck goes down the street directly in front of the house, but the house can also shake quite violently when a truck drives slowly on the major road 2 lots away from the house.  My place of work also shakes when trucks go by directly out front, but to a far lesser extent than my house.  My place of work does not shake at all due to traffic on the major road.  

So here's where things get really dicey... there are cracks running through many of the walls and ceilings of the house, on both the first and second floors.  These lines are basically perfectly straight -- vertical on the walls, horizontal on the ceilings.  The walls in the hose seem to be in no way load-bearing, and are made of very lightweight material with wallpaper on top. (and no, they're not just edges of the wallpaper, which is what I'd initially hoped) This is a gallery of what they look like: http://imgur.com/a/aCSkM#653B21S  

A few more things about the house: it's located on a former rice field that had dirt piled on it, and then three houses built on top of it.  Some of the windows in the house, especially on the second floor, refuse to open/shut correctly, like the frame around it is warped; some of the doors also don't shut correctly as well.

Anyhow, I realize this is long, but my question is: **Is my house unsafe?**  They're starting construction on an apartment building on the lot directly next to mine next week, which means heavy equipment rumbling by on a daily basis for the next 4~5 months.  I hope I'm being paranoid, but between the shaking and the cracks, I'm not sure how the house will hold up to the stress of drilling, paving, and building literally feet from my door.  Everyone here has told me not to worry about it and they won't help me take any action (well, my Japanese friends, anyway), while my boss has expressed some minor concern about the cracks in the walls.  

Thanks for any help or advice you can provide.  I'll also gladly take more pictures if they'll help the diagnosis.  Also, if this is the wrong subreddit, if you could please point me in the right direction, that'd be great.  The Internet is full of signs of imminent building collapse, but basically only for big concrete buildings, and I'm in a bit of a different situation... thanks again! :)

Specifically here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=xmYss_hNF4Q#t=315s. After crushing an oil drum with atmospheric pressure, he says:

So, the drum was optimizing to make the minimum volume in its interior, which is what you'd expect because there's a vacuum in there. Isn't that awesome?

Yes, it is awesome, I think. So, my question is, what else can we have nature ""optimize"" for us? Can we ""state"" the travelling salesman problem in a physical way so that crushing an oil drum finds the solution for us? What else can we do by ""computing with physical objects?""

It's a very cool design and allows a few people to put together something very strong.

Here's a link to a photos page of a 25' long bridge —http://www.woodenbridgeplans.com/1_25foot.html

http://www.woodenbridgeplans.com/step6.html

So my question is, instead of concrete footings which would be hard to build in my location, what if I stretched like 2 taut steel cables - like 1/2"" in dia. - across the bridge from end to end — would these provide the same weight distributing function as concrete piers?

I'd ask the guy who invented the plans, but sadly he passed away, and while there is one photo of a small test bridge using a cable, there's no mention of the idea.

I currently have an electrostatic mic which is my reference. I have tabulated data on this mic, in 5kHz increments. I converted to gain V/V and used linear interpolation to get the values in between. The mic is fairly flat in the range, but it does introduce some attenuation. I am interested in 10k-35kHz. [Mic Attenuation](http://avisoft.com/usg/images/fr_cm16.gif)

My setup now is a piezo transmitter 1m away from my receiver. I then sweep through frequencies slowly. At each frequency I collect 100kS at 100kS/s 5 times, and then average the five average peak values together to get my ""response"" at this frequency. I do this for each mic I want to test including the reference.

To determine the ""true"" output from the piezo, I take the tabulated data from the test mic, find its reciprocal and multiply it by the data I recorded from the test. My idea is that this will give me a decent idea of the true output of the piezo without introducing attenuation from the microphone.

To evaluate other mics, I then take my known 25kHz data, reciprocate it and multiply it by the output of the mic being tested.

6,"A question for the successful people: I have an ME degree, but I'm very natural in and love CS, can I get into CS field? Anyone else switch?",1368142576,"All my life I've loved computers. I started with BASIC as a child and moved to C++ around 14. Parallel programming, machine learning, robotics, and algorithms fascinate me. I've been doing lots of work looking into parallelizing Particle Filters lately with FPGAs or GPUs.

For boring reasons, I switched from CS to ME in community college, and while I don't regret the physical foundational knowledge I've learned, I'm realizing I ""think"" like a CS guy. Fast forward to me finishing my undergrand and I'm always the go-to ""computer guy"" for any of our ME projects and I even got into grad school specifically for my ""I'm an ME with CS background"" abilities.

But the further I went into an ""ME grad degree"" the more scared I got that I was wasting 2-4 years of my life taking classes ""to play ball"" (as my adviser called it) and zero of it (except my barely existent free time) learning the advanced CS topics that interest me.

So I'd like to ask for few things:

 1 - General advice from anyone who has been in my shoes.

 2 - Is it possible / hard to get an entry-level CS job from my position? 

 3 - If I don't have a CS degree (but still an ME degree) will I ""forever"" be paid less wages the same way someone without a degree would?

 4 - Do CS Masters/Ph.D. degrees require CS undergrad? I think not, but how does that work?

17,"Vibration, 1 sigma stress, and dealing with multiple natural frequencies",1368106297,"Quick background: I'm a mechanical engineer who has been working for several years in simulations and analysis (predominately FEA). I recently accepted a new position and now am trying to piece together a knowledge of vibration. So far I've figured out most of what I need, but there's still one piece I'm struggling with. 

Our parts are qualified in via a shaker test for 10 hours at a given PSD. I analyze them first to find problem spots early and fix them before they fail on the actual table. The analysis technique is explained fairly well in [this demo, put out by ANSYS](http://www.ansys.com/staticassets/ANSYS/staticassets/resourcelibrary/article/AA-V2-I3-Random-Vibration-Fatigue.pdf). 

Essentially, the square root of the area under response PSD curve is the ""1-sigma"" stress - 68% of the time the stress is under that value, 27% of the time it's below ""2-sigma"", and 4% of the time it's under ""3-sigma"". Then, for the full test, you take (10 hours)\*(natural frequency)\*.68 to determine how many cycles it experiences at 1-sigma; do the same for 2- and 3-sigma; then apply Miner's Rule to determine whether the part would fail during the test. 

Where I'm unsure how to proceed is when there are multiple significant natural frequencies. Our geometry typically has 2 or 3 modes which have similar magnitude stress responses. My thought is to break the response PSD into pieces and treat each peak separately - find the 1-sigma associated with frequency 1, 1-sigma with frequency 2, etc. and do the above calculations again. However, that doesn't seem to account for when the two frequencies are in phase, when most of the damage would occur. 

Any thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: I should clarify, the multiple dominant frequencies are per axis. For example, after the natural frequency extraction, modes 2 &amp; 3 may affect the X axis, 1 &amp; 5 the Z, and 1,4,7 the Y.",AskEngineers,ood_lambda,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1dzzq6/vibration_1_sigma_stress_and_dealing_with/

1) Does the pressure increase, decrease, or stay constant as you go further down the pipe? If the slant is at a small angle would the increased pressure forces due to gravity cause pressure gain and effectively 'cancel out' the drop in pressure (I think the pressure drops)?

2) Assume there are no frictional forces, same case as above. Would the pressure drop exponentially as the distance you go down the pipe increase due to acceleration of gravity? If you use P1V1=P2V2 it makes sense that a higher fluid velocity would cause a loss in pressure.

3) Basically, does pressure (from top -&gt; bottom) increase or decrease as the fluid flows down at a slight angle?

51,Entry level Embedded Engineer salary,1367896208,"Hi AE,
Today I got my first interview for a company that I would really like to work for. They are an aerospace and defense company with approximately 200-500 employees. They are hiring plenty of junior engineers for different roles.
I am not an engineer, I am a physics graduate with a strong 3.75/4.0 GPA, strong programming experience (around 2 years under a variety of languages). I also have strong knowledge of electronics and circuits with some experience designing motor controllers.

They asked me over the phone what my expected salary is and I told them 35-40k but negotiable. I really did not do too much research before hand and was not expecting them to ask this. 
I hope I did not sell myself short as I found that most entry level engineering positions are in the 50-60k range. However, I understand that this is not the profession I was trained for so I don't want to be too greedy either. I need a foot in the door.

Can you give me some advice? Should I up my asking price in the interview? I would like to bump it to around 40-45k. It is still pretty conservative compared to online data.

56,Which software are beneficial for Electrical Engineers,1367876481,"Hello EE's

I know this has been asked before but I'd like some advice on specific software. I am an electrical engineering student going into my last year in september. I didn't land a summer internship so I have a free summer. I'm thinking of learning a few programs and i'd like some advice.

Firstly i'm thinking of taking the [Microsoft office specialist certification](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/mos-certification.aspx#fbid=b_oxLnKe2DP). I figure that if i have a certification it will look better on my resume and i would have more credentials at using the software. I'm not sure if employers would overlook this and if its worth the 100$ to take the exam.

Secondly is AutoCad. From all the job postings i've come across, this program is great for general engineering. My university doesn't offer classes on how to use AutoCad so I'm just going to read a book and take the certification exam as well. same as above, worth it? or just say i've read this book entirely and I have a sound knowledge of how to use the program.

I want to specialize in Power engineering, and i've been looking for software that power engineers specifically use. I'm looking at SKM, ETAP, and EDSA. I have a general understanding of what ETAP is but the other two I have no clue. I did a bit of googling and it seems like there isn't a lot of info on any of these programs. Are these programs outdated? and if not are there any good resources to learn? I looked at the etap training website and i can't afford 2 grand to learn how to use it.

I'm also looking into SQL database and maybe C++ or Java. are these good to learn for Power engineering?

58,Need help with a problem concerning how much bentonite to mix with sand for a containment pond liner,1367869229,"The following problem was given to me on a recent assignment:

The native surface soil in the vicinity of an abandoned mine is a poorly graded 
silty sand with a void ratio of 0.75 and a specific gravity of 2.67. Acid mine 
drainage contains the toxic heavy metals copper and zinc in solution in the Cu
2+
and Zn
2+
 forms. It is to be collected and stored on-site in containment ponds. To 
prevent excessive seepage into the ground and underlying groundwater, it is 
proposed that a pond liner be constructed using the native silty sand mixed with 
Wyoming Bentonite, compacted to produce a material with low hydraulic 
conductivity; i.e., K&lt; 10
-7
 cm/sec. The bentonite has a liquid limit of 500%, a 
plasticity index of 425%, and a specific gravity of 2.8. How much dry bentonite is 
required based on its dry weight as a percentage of the weight of the dry sand? 
The air dry water content of the bentonite is 10%.


I am not looking for any one to solve the problem but more some suggestions on where I should try and go with the problem.  I have looked back in my notes and have not found anything describing how to calculate what percentage of bentonite would be needed to achieve the given hydraulic conductivity.  Through some research of my own it seems that the normal amount of bentonite used in these types of applications is in the range of 5-10%.  Am I thinking too in depth about this problem and he really just wants to know an estimate like 5-10%, or is there some sort of equation that I should know that would help me with this problem?

Details:

Minimum quantity is 100-200. That hopefully would rise quite a bit, but money could be tight early on. The basic design is approximately 15x15x5 cm box with (horizontal) rounded corners. It will need to look high quality.. for the finish I’m planning on sand blasting, anodising, and chamfering the top edge. I'd like it to be reasonably thick.. working on 4mm right now, that could change.

There will (can) be a gap in the sides, where plastic will go, so this could allow me to make it basically with just 3 pieces of folded sheet metal (top, bottom, sides) with notches as below, held together with screws.

73,What does 'M' in a logic table on a chip package data sheet mean?,1367820176,"**TL;DR - Attempting to use an existing polygon mirror/control circuit to prove a concept before we spend much larger sums of money on a higher end system. Need to figure out how to set the PLL chip to use an external clock as opposed to the internal one, which the data sheet says can be done. What is unclear is HOW to do it.**

Now, more info:

I have a rotating polygon mirror whose speed I need to control. The mirror speed is controlled via a phase-locked loop (PLL) controller (The chip in question). According to the data sheet for the chip, the PLL is set using an internal clock in combination with two logical inputs (N1 and N2) that sets a divisor. This in turn gives a frequency that the PLL (and thus the mirror) syncs to.

Interestingly, the pin N1 is wired up to a header, while pin N2 appears to be wired to nothing. The same is true for the E.CLK (Ext Clock) pin. I don't think it's relevant, but I'm including it in case it is.

What I am attempting to do is control the mirror speed with an external clock, which according to the data sheet can be done. The plan is to solder an extra lead to N2 and to the E.CLK pin, and set N1/N2 to use the E.CLK frequency to sync to as opposed to the internal oscilator.

Now, here we arrive at my problem.

On the data sheet, the table for N1, N2, and the corresponding divisor setting looks like this:

N1 | N2 | Divisor

H | H | #1 

H | L | #2

L | H | #3

L | L | #4

-- | M | Ext. Clock

Where #1,2, ect are some number that is dependent on the settings of N1, N2, though the dependency is hard to follow exactly (The multiplying factors associated with N1,N2 aren't explicitly dependent on just their High/Low settings).

So, since these seem to be logical inputs, I haven't the faintest clue what the M in this table means. Are there any EE's out there that would have an idea?

~~I realized as I was writing this that I can't recall the chip #, and don't have it availble to me. I will edit this post to include it and the data sheet if no one has any ideas by tomorrow morning.~~

Datasheet is here: http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/sanyo/ds_pdf_e/LB1870.pdf

84,Looking for suggestions for misalignment tolerant knuckle joints for a giant robot.,1367766167,"Howdy fellow engineers!

I'm currently building a walking robot with a group of friends which happens to be rather large. The Joints involved are much like you would find on a small to medium sized backhoe. 2"" diameter pins with an internal span of around 8""-12""

The application is slightly different because of the constraints involved:

Cheap as possible, non purchased parts should be able to be machined on a manual lathe, CNC plasma table, or 2 axis protrak mill, and be able to be mounted/welded into a non precise structure.

The structure is what is currently killing us. We're CNC cutting out large plates on the plasma cutter (with +/- .020"" tolerances or better) and welding them together to form a box structure. We then weld in the bearing bosses (steel tube with bronze sleeve bearings pressed in) with the pins installed for alignment across the span. We're having a TON of issues with thermal effects which causes the joint to bind with the pin. We've found work arounds, such as running a huge reamer through the holes, but this is not ideal especially since the reamer is about 8.5"" long and we want to go to wider spans.


Ideally we would pop the joints into a giant machine to precision bore the joints after welding but this is not possible with our equipment.
I'm currently trying to think up alternate mounting/assembling strategies which either help minimize the thermal effects/movement from welding or can tolerate a couple degrees of misalignment. Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!



**UPDATE 6-7-13**

We looked into some options and instead of making urethane encapsulated bronze sleeve bushings as one of the commentators suggested, we found an awesome source of spherical plane bearings that were very economical. The company is helping us out on the price a tad, but even without the discounts the bearings are affordable enough for average people.  These are awesome because they can take huge static and dynamic loads and allow up to +/- 6-7 degrees of misalignment per bearing.
We'll be announcing an update soon on our web page.

89,"Trying to reduce backlash in rack and pinion, think I have a cheap solution. Thoughts?",1367722948,"I have been designing my own 3D printer, and I plan to use a rack and pinion to drive the horizontal axes. I was trying to find a cheap way to reduce backlash, and I cam across solutions such as split pinion, double pinion, having two racks slightly offset and a gear train, the list goes on and on. But I am trying to keep cost down, and I don't need extremely high tolerance, just hopefully within .005"".

In my design I am using a rack and pinion with a pitch of 20, a 20 degree pressure angle, hopefully made of steel. Since there won't be much torque, I am thinking lubrication won't be necessary, but I would love some input on that.

Anyways my idea was to let the rack ""float"" in the y axis, and be fixed in the z and x axes. Springs will putting pressure on the y-ends of the rack, and will hopefully provide constant tooth contact (or near so, anyways). See this image for a visualization, http://imgur.com/6VzuGUB . 

The rack is 330 mm, with 5 mm of space between the ends of the rack and the outer limits of travel, making a total of 340mm. A spring will be fit in those 5 mm on each side. 

I'm not sure if this will work, but I think that the torque applied to the rack from the pinion will push the rack in the direction opposite of which the pinion is moving, compressing that spring. When the pinion reverses direction, the force from the spring will push the rack in the opposite direction of travel, hopefully providing constant tooth contact.

Does this work like I think it will? Are there any limitations I'm not seeing? Any and all opinions greatly appreciated. Thanks!",AskEngineers,bumpfirestock,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1dppae/trying_to_reduce_backlash_in_rack_and_pinion/

0,What causes cars to not respond the same after someone else has driven them?,1367602953,"I was taught very early on to never let anyone else drive my car, because it will never drive the same again.  Now, I'm sure this was true of older cars.  Newer cars seem much more resilient, but I still see this effect.  If someone else has driven my car, it often doesn't respond the same until I've driven it for a while again.

For example, if someone is choppy on the gas pedal, then the car is no longer snappy and responsive after I've taken it back - the engine response seems sluggish.  After I've driven it for a day (or sometimes, a few days), then it gets back in line with the behavior and responsiveness that I'm used to.

What causes this effect?

p.s.  Just to forestall the psychological questions - we're not talking about perceptions based on expectations, because I don't always know ahead of time that I wasn't the last one to drive it.  But I can tell that it's off and inquiring after the fact is how I subsequently find out that it was driven by someone else.

I am a grad student in mechanical engineering and for a final project in my advanced thermo class we're analyzing the cooling/heating system in the new chevy volt (mainly because my professor drives one). 

Does anyone have any information regarding the cooling cycle? I can find stuff on the cooling cycle for the batteries, and for the gas engine (when it's turned on), but just analyzing the cooling for the inside of the car I'm striking out. 

I'm thinking of ""replacing"" the resistance heater and cooling loop with a reversible heat pump loop instead. The resistance heating in the winter is pretty inefficient (or perfectly efficient depending on how you look at it), but using a heat pump to heat it would be better. 

So, any thoughts, or convenient diagrams?

Thanks!

edit:
I should clarify that this is only for when the car is running off the battery. Basically my professor drives 30 miles a day to school and doesn't use the gas engine. So I am only concerned with the heating/cabin cooling when operating in electric mode.

Factoring in all of this, I'd much rather work now and worry about such luxuries as 'higher education' if I can ever afford it. On the other hand, if I don't take the grad school offer and can't find work, then I'm in another heap of trouble. On the other other hand, I might fail graduate school (my 2.93 wouldn't fly) or I might be just as seemingly undesirable as I am right now anyways or I might not be able to afford it from the get-go anyways.

I know networking is (almost literally) everything, and since I graduated from a puny school in the middle of nowhere spending every career fair getting scoffed at by big lab HR reps, I'm at a loss. I was forced to move to my current location as a kid and have been working ever since to get out. 

**I guess what I'm asking is,** given my grad/work situation: On the school side of things, given my situation, is there anything I should know or consider? On the work side of things, what should someone in my position do? I've never had the slightest chance to work in the field for actual money, so I'm just hung out to dry. Are there people I should be talking to? I'm not picky. I can relocate just about anywhere in the country given a solid chance to work somewhere (I also have zero opportunities where I currently live and I've always, *always* wanted to get the hell away from where I am right now.)

I'm a recent ME graduate who wants to relocate anywhere in the country for entry-level work, but I haven't gotten the slightest acknowledgement from any recruiters. What should I do?

say I took a beam with square 10mm cross section and a weight mg = 100N, this weight is centered at the middle, I section the top half and there's no stress, I section the from the top to just before the middle and the there's no stress, I section from the top to somewhere below the center of gravity and there's a normal force of 100N.

I'm just a tinkerer here and thought this is a cool project. I'm trying to design a convertible standing desk and I just think it'd be cool to make it automatic. In my brainstorming, this is what I've come up with.

My idea is just a cheapo drill running a cheapo hydraulic vane pump to power 5 cylinders up slowly. One on each corner of the desk, and one for the LCDs.

These cylinders are going to provide only vertical force. To handle lateral force, I'll use 1"" TPG  and some bushings outside of each cylinder - probably at the far corners. Hey, it's gotta look cool too.

There will be a check valve after the pump to keep the desk up, and a solenoid valve after the check valve which, when opened, will allow the fluid to drain to the reservoir. The weight of the desk will slowly come down with that, but I may use a ball valve to fine-tune the resistance of the descent. 

Sitting to standing is about 16 inches up for the keyboard height, about 28 up for the screens. One of the 4 cylinders will be just for the screens

I will use a pressure cutoff switch to kill the pump on the way up, call it 120psi if I get the McMaster ones. 

Hydraulic cylinders are far too overkill and expensive for this. Pnuematic has the right power, size, and price point. Only issue is I'm not running a compressor in my office. Hydraulics will be quieter and more solid feeling, not to mention consume less space and generate less heat.

* Internal

* Corner

* Surface

* Edge

I just want to see if anyone can confirm if [this equation](http://i.imgur.com/ewNoksT.png) is correct for internal nodes in 3D transient Heat flow using a cartesian coordinate system, we have derived this and our supervisor had also got the same solution when deriving it however when comparing the excel to an ANSYS model, there is a huge different. A huge difference being that over 45 minutes, the ANSYS model shows the internal temperature going from a -4oC starting temperature to around 160oC with an ambient temperature of 180oC in the oven.

The excel shows an internal temperature of about 6oC. I don't want to ask and feel like I am abusing this subreddit but can anyone please help?

When I then unplug the synthesizer from the wall, the noise goes away. This makes me pretty sure it's not coming from the amplifier. 

[Here's a graph](http://imgur.com/jWE5JSu) showing the noise and noise floor.

I've been looking at signals from DC to 2 MHz but there is significant noise all the way up to 100 MHz. Another ""test"" that I've done is shorting the RF spectrum analyzer directly to ground, with no amplifier and the same spectrum appears. Not sure if that's significant.

I've also tested the outlets with a voltmeter and there is between 100 mV and 200 mV between the ground and neutral holes in different outlets throughout the building. I thought this is supposed to be zero? I tested the outlet with an outlet tester from the hardware store and it says it's working fine.

I work in a lab at a University so I have to wait until we can get someone to come out and take a look but any help or other test suggestions would be appreciated.

I'm doing a final research report for my last year to be a Civil Engineering Technologist and as a very pro-nuclear person, i chose to look into nuclear disasters and their environmental effects, this is a very broad subject so i decided to look into the Fukushima and Chernobyl disasters specifically. However i still have some separate sections that need answering:

-What kinds of radiation can be released, their effects and how damaging they are
-Some long term effects 
-The live stock/agriculture in the surrounding areas (other cases can still apply)
-Any other hidden/hard-to-find information on nuclear power/damage is welcome

Sources are not needed but are welcome.


This post is to get me some ideas on what to spend more time on and opinions are welcome about Fukushima and Chernobyl Disasters.

So after plugging it back in I have about ten seconds to change it from radio to speaker mode and set the volume, until it becomes unresponsive again. Eventually, it will mute itself again, for seconds, minutes or hours before it randomly unmutes itself.

4,"""Electromagnetic Levitron"" Questions (came here from /r/askscience)",1366945163,"Hello all! My friend and I (current high-school seniors), took it upon ourselves to make an electromagnetic levitron. We basically decided that we wanted to make things float using magnets, and using our new-found AP Physics knowledge on coils, wanted to create our own electromagnet to levitate ferromagnetic objects with. This being said, we are not entirely sure what we are doing, as we are only doing this because it seems interesting and fun. Sorry for all of the intro, now to the questions: -When we researched levitrons, they mostly seem to incorporate a spinning object to maintain it's position on the electromagnet, however, we have seen other videos/websites that show an object that is not rotating. When we personally began working on this project, we were able to create the electromagnet, but were unable to find out how to make the object ""levitate"" as opposed to being attracted to the side of the circular coil. How would one accomplish this? -Secondly, we noticed the coil, as well as the wire heating as we continued pumping an electric current through it, and were curious as to how we could combat this. We would like to create a ""levitron"" (if that is the correct word for it) that could stay on for a very long period of time without overheating, so any input on how to combat it would be very helpful.
That is all for my current questions, and thank you all in advance. p.s.

The staff cabins are not air-conditioned, and we can't afford a whole lot per-cabin for a cooling solution ($75 give or take 25, we have a lot of miscellaneous supplies), now that I' management I've decided to do something about it.  Unfortunately, I'm a trained economist and philosopher so I'm turning to you fair engineers for some help!  Here's the setup:

4 cabins (all the same dimensions)

One room, 15'x20'x~9'

Elevated 2.5'-3' off the ground

The 9' mark marks the height of the ceiling, although there is an apex probably about another 6' until the apex.  I do not know if the ceiling is insulated (it probably is for winter camping, but I'm not sure).

Power restrictions: each cabin's total power supply is 120V, 20A (I know nothing of electricity, if you need more information, I'll d what I can to find it!)

Built-in ceiling fan.

Up to 4 people living in each cabin.

I was thinking some kind of forced induction from under the cabin into the cabin and putting together a dehumidifying solution.  I wouldn't know how to get the air circulating right to ventilate the hot air out of the cabin and sucking the cool air under the cabin in.  We'd have to keep the solution reasonably quiet so the staff can sleep, keep a kind of screen on it to keep critters from getting in, and we'd have to keep the power tolerances low enough so they can keep their electronics going (some bring up TVs, computers, sound systems, you name it, and everyone has a cell phone they need to keep charged for alarms).

So basically I want to find the right type of sensor to detect that someone is occupying a piece of furniture or appliance including all wooden chairs, sofas, office chairs, desks, etc.  
I have looked into pressure/force/strain sensors, but my question is how can these be applied to the objects (lets say a wooden chair) in order to get accurate readings on whether or not someone is in that chair or not (obviously the vacancy part would be creating a threshold or some other condition).  I do not want to place anything on the legs of the furniture where the sensors will be dragged around and damaged by wear and tear.  
The chip I am imaging would go underneath a chair, sofa, table, etc. and be able to sense weight distortions or forces being applied to that object in turn signaling a presence. Also it needs to have a wireless component to transmit the data...so power source is an issue. I looked into RFID and Ultrasonic, as well as infrared but they all seem inappropriate (not accurate enough, data is hard to interpret, receivers really costly but feel free to prove me wrong, I tried my best to research).

23,Can a 158deg F 100PSI DIY autoclave exist safely?,1366864972,"There are these industrial air bubble removing autoclaves out there that allow you to remove air bubbles from 3M adhesive when applying the adhesive between two rigid surfaces. They all have PID temperature controllers, pressure sensors and a crazy strong polished steel chamber. The are essentially dry pressure cookers powered through compressed air rather than steam.

These things are really useful for cell phone glass repair, however they start at $1.5k. 

I was wondering if it would be possible to build one out of steel and would it come out anywhere significantly below $1.5k ignoring labor. Lets assume that I have a lot of engineering and automotive friends that would rather accept payments in favors rather than money.

I've built plenty of air cannons in the past that have reached well over 100 psi, but never anything with that much heat. I was thinking maybe a steel pipe, two flanges, neoprene gaskets, two custom plasma cut steel end caps w/ holes to match the flanges, one end threaded and tapped or welded to allow a valve for pressure release and air going in to pressurize the tank. The heating element could heat the entire assembly from the outside and the whole thing would be thermally insulated with fiberglass.

Here is a wiki page I stumbled over that was a good crash course. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave_(industrial)

I was wondering, what you other engineers thought.

This was my first attempt at a bill of materials.

$100 heating element 32-140ºF (0ºC-60ºC) Dry Heat

$20 temperature sensor

$100 temperature controller

$100 pressure source

$70 pressure regulator ()

$30 Pressure Gauge (0 - 100 PSI)

$50 Emergency pressure release (110PSI?)

$200 pressure vessel (Steel Pipe? Fit 1 Phone?)

$50 Steel plate cover (Plasma Cut)

$30 Compressing Latch

$30 Timer 20 - 60 min

$10 Start Button

$10 E Stop

$30 Potentiometer

$20 LEDs

$20 Door Interlock

$870 ish?

Oh and this is what it is used for. There is an autoclave in the video at 1:58 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndgBUhYIhaM&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
.

There are many considerations as well, I haven't gotten as far as drafting up a model and doing any simulations. Part sourcing for the pressure vessel is my biggest hiccup.

I can see that the obvious professional choice would be GT honors, but I'm a bit disillusioned with GT because I lived in GA for several years and know too many people that go there. But I fell in love with California.

From what I gather, the pros and cons would be like this:

UCLA:
+ California
+ Well-balanced
+ School spirit (I want to take pride in my alma mater) 
+ National/international prestige (I'm planning on working internationally post-graduation)
+ Will learn to fend for myself because I have to fight for good positions and good grades (But this may go for GT as well?)
- Too big (I don't mind the sheer number so much as class registration nightmares and competition for research opportunities and internships)
- Decent but definitely not as good as GT for engineering
- No 4+1 BS/MS program

GT:
+ Honors (small classes, priority registration, Challenge Fund)
+ Bomb ass engineering school (facilities, opportunities, study abroad programs for engineers, internships, job placement, etc.)
+ 5yr BS/MS program
- Social life -- or lack thereof (I feel like this could hinder my personal growth during the peak of my youth?)
- Honors may hand me things on a platter? (I feel like I'm way overestimating the impact of getting honors though)
- Not much prestige outside of engineering (I might want to go into social sciences)

53,I need some direction/advice as an aspiring engineer (long),1366746728,"I have posted once before pretaining to one of the questions I had, but I still have so many. I appreciate the people of this community and the answers they give. It helps me a ton, and hopefully students who gander at this can get a sense of direction as well..


As for me, I am on Square One with no knowledge on where to start and what path i should take.


A little bit of a backstory on my education: I am a 22 year old student at my local community college in California. I have been here for almost 3 years. I have done all but 2 GE classes and just started this past year on my lower division courses for an engineering degree. I have a 2.7 gpa with 57 units and about 14 more classes to take ( 6 math upto calc 3c,  3 physics, 3 chem, 2 GE).

I would like to transfer to a school here in California, but i have no idea where to even begin in terms of which schools are best, which ones would even accept me, and which ones could give me loans, etc.

In regards to which discipline I am most interested in, I am flexible. I am really interested in the idea of futuristic things: buildings, gadgets, appliances, cars ( anything on r/futureporn , r/futureology). I want to revolutionize the technologies of today. 

As far as my abilities go, my strongest characteristics are being a people person, a strong leader and communicator. I have ADD so it is hard to focus at times, but I am very detemined to succeed. I have no prior engineering experience, but I am a quick learner. 


Some of my resources include: 
-My father, who owns a machine tool/ CNC business
-my step dad, who works for a company that makes satellites 
-the dad of my old nanny job works for disney and has stated he would help me with talking to the imagineering department
-my good friends mom owns a very successful architecture company

As for my resources listed above, I am not sure how I could use those to my advantage.

tl;dr: What would you tell an engineer-aspiring 5 year old on where he should begin his path on transferring and gaining experience

Currently my two favourite subjects are Chemistry and Pure Math. I love the absolute shit out of Chemistry, so naturally I always thought ChemE would be a wise choice and it's been my plan for a while. 

However, we're now onto the subject of redox and electrochemistry which I'm finding fascinating. Because it's a low level subject, they only briefly touched on how these fields are used broadly in the mining industry to increase yield of ore and/or make strong alloys for structures. Is this something that a MinE does? If not, please give me a rundown of a typical day in MinE?

This was awesome! And it got me thinking, maybe MinE is something more up my ally? Everything we've learned about metals so far is cool as shit. Or maybe this is something more Materials/Metallurgy engineering?

To summarise my questions for the lazy;
1) I love my pre-college math and chem subjects - I really, really love chem. Would ChemE be a good fit for me, or is it vastly different?
2) We're learning redox and electrochemistry, touching briefly on how it is used in the mining industry. This is cool, could someone give me a rundown on what a MinE does and if this relates?
3) Australian MinEs (or anyone who knows about Aussie industries), how much longer do you think the current mining boom will last? Enough to nab a nice career?

Essentially, something on the same scale as a mid-grade gas powered jet ski.

I don't know if I would ever have the time or energy for it, but every year, I think about doing it.  I suppose I'm more curious than anything really.

I understand that the machine will most likely forfeit a lot of horsepower by using an electric engine over a gas engine, but I'm aiming to go green, for free renewable energy, lower audible volume, and less risk of chemical leaks to contaminate the waters.  I also understand that building one from scratch will be expensive in both time and money, but regardless, if I ever decide to take up this project, I think I would be OK with it.  I just need some help figuring out the details.

I have several obstacles should I want to actually build this thing.

1) the body and its aerodynamics (note: I'd most likely grab one from a graveyard)

2) the engine (note: I'd most likely substitute it with a high torque ""waterproof"" electric motor, most likely from an old fork lift; my knowledge of acquiring electric motors is pretty limited. Plus, don't know if any electric motor available is ""waterproof"".)

3) battery array (note: I'd most likely use large deep cycle marine batteries)

4) recharging batteries (note: I'd most likely use an array of solar panels to trickle-charge the batteries; I understand this method will be slow charging.  I'll need to figure out just how slow.)

If I can figure out the engine necessary to meet the towing requirements, then I can figure out how many batteries I would need for the array.  If I can figure out the number of batteries I need for the array, I can figure out how many solar panels I would need.

The frame will essentially be a cube. The middle will have a build platform that raises and lowers (z-axis) by leadscrews operated by motors on the bottom of the cube.

I want the x-axis to be a carriage that has the extruder for plastic/router/plasma torch/ whatever I can make, and this carriage will travel along precision ground rods.

The x-axis will be attached to the y-axis, which is the focus of this post. I am thinking of having a linear guide system on the top surface of the extruded aluminum, with a rack and pinion setup to move the y axis. The x-axis will move with a timing belt and pulley.

For a visualization on the axes setup, the first few seconds of this youtube video should show it, this is an Ultimaker. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWNj61rDDI . The main difference is that my frame will be made of extruded aluminum, and the y axis on top will be a linear guide on the top.

I'm still one hundred percent certain I want a STEM career, but I'm beginning to doubt my decision of four years.

To elaborate, I've always been highly interested in science and math, more so than most people at my school. However, I've never been the 'handy' type. As a child, I never played with Legos, never built much of anything, and I'm still not ultra savvy with computers. I always have and still do lean to the pure science side. While some of my friends enjoy talking about the different engines in cars (which I do find very interesting), I always find myself discussing less applied topics, such as what exactly the octane rating of gasoline means and the molecular explanation of it. What I'm trying to say is that if you asked someone my personality, no one would answer saying that I'm a tinkerer, but more of an academic (I don't like to use that term since I'm not actually an academic, being only a senior in high school, but I couldn't think of another word).

Regardless of everything I said above, I still find the idea of having an engineering degree more interesting than, say, a pure science degree. What I'm debating right now, is whether I should declare myself a mechanical engineering major or a chemistry/physics major.

What do you all think about my situation? More importantly, is a person like myself who isn't huge on building things but more interested in the science behind them fit to be an engineering major? Thanks for any help.

30,[lighting] Probe Start Metal Halide Ballasts &amp; Capacitor Sizing,1366335407,"Well this is a pickle and I'm hoping the collective pool of smarts here in Ask Engineers can help.

At work, I'm doing an emerging technology study for an electric utility analyzing a probe start metal halides and potential replacement fixtures. I'm pretty savvy when it comes to lighting design theory and operations, but I just can not find a good resource full of metal halide ballast design and operations (if any one has one, please let me know).

Our existing system is made up of 30 fixtures with 400W lamps (Sylvania M400/U) and standard probe-start metal halide ballasts (Advance, 277V service) with a constant wattage autotransformer (CWA). To improve the power factor of the ballast/lamp the factory or installer wired in a capacitor in series with the lamp. This is standard practice for this technology.

Unfortunately, they screwed up. They installed a capacitor rated for either 24 microfarads (what we want) and 42 microfarads. Instead of hooking up the 24 microfarad pins, they hooked up the 42 microfarad pins. Rather than drawing 458 watts of power, the ballast drew about 275W. The light levels in the space were between 9 and 45 footcandles rather than the 45 to 90 foot candles we were expecting. The lamp color temperature was 4800K rather than the nominal 4000K and not all of the halides were exciting properly, so we got some greenish color to our lamps.

What confuses me is as far as I can tell increasing the capacitor size in should have boosted the lamp output somewhat; however,  I believe the capacitance was so large, it missed the bell-curve. We're working with an electrician to take some readings of the fixture, but I'm not sure he'll take a voltage drop reading across the lamp due to safety concerns. In lieu of a direct measurement (which I'm pulling for), I'd like to figure out an  alternative approach to explain in our write-up.

Can anyone help me figure out how to calculate the nominal voltage drop across the lamp with the design 24 microfarad capacitor and the 42 microfarad capacitor? With that information, I should be able to correlate the results with some data I have for 200W and 150W operations curves, but my elements of electrical engineering class memory is failing me.

34,Key factors leading to marine diesels outcompeting steam?,1366318260,"Hello r/askengineers,
I am doing some research on marine diesel engines and steam turbines.  Specifically, I am trying to determine the key factors that led to the widespread adoption of diesel engines as current standard for marine propulsion.  

My preliminary research in a paper on the economic comparisons between the two from 1970 suggests that the diesel engine has the economic advantage on smaller ships (12-13k shp vessels), but then in excess of 17k shp, the steam turbine is more efficient.  This seems at odds with the increases in tonnage since that time and the popularity of diesels:  Maersk's Triple E vessels are being built with 43k hp diesels.

Have diesels become so popular primarily because of increases in fuel costs, and their advantage in efficiency?  Or have there been significant gains in efficiency in diesels over steam turbines since the 70s?  I'd appreciate any help in narrowing down the focus of my research. Thanks!

tl;dr - why have diesels beaten steam turbines so badly as a form of ship propulsion since the 70s?

42,Lowest wattage of a mains voltage incandescent? (alt; why low voltage lighting?),1366291100,"I just repaired, and subsequently rewired, some low voltage lighting that's installed under my cabinets to light the countertop there, and it got me wondering what the point of low voltage lighting is.

The disadvantages were obvious while working on them:

1.  They require transformers which are pretty expensive, not super durable, and loud depending on type. Mine weren't working because the transformer had failed, and I bought a really cheap one to verify that was the case. The super cheap transformer did prove that the old one was bad, but it also made a really irritating whine because it was a cheap magnetic transformer. This was eventually replaced with two electronic ones (switchmode, I assume?) which were pretty expensive.

2. Voltage drop, holy shit!
So I should've realized this would happen, but it didn't really occur to me until I replaced the single transformer with two smaller ones. When I originally fixed the lights I noticed that they turned on in sequence, starting with the left one and moving to the right one in a span of maybe 200ms. Long enough to be very noticeable but short enough to miss if you weren't paying attention. I thought that was pretty weird but didn't really think much of it. 

Then I split the circuit to install the much quieter electronic transformers and two previously dim fixtures ended up *way* brighter than they had been. Made me realize that the low voltage was causing a huge voltage drop over about 30' of wire, and all the fixtures were daisy chained. The sequenced firing was because the first fixture was at a much higher voltage and so the filament heated up way faster. This makes sense, since the low voltage necessitates much higher current, and voltage drop / resistive heating is dependent on current. Low voltages will therefore be much more susceptible than higher voltages, as well as a lot less efficient.

I rewired to reduce the length of the circuit, and tapped each on in the middle, rather than at the end, and now the fixtures are much brighter and fire at the same time.

Anyway, long question short: Is there a minimum wattage that a bulb at mains voltage can be manufactured? Found some lighting design forums which sort of insinuate that low voltages are necessary for reduced brightness, but nothing that outright specifies it. 

If a low wattage bulb can be made, what's the point of low voltage lighting? It seems to me like it's pretty much just a less efficient and more complicated way of achieving exactly the same thing...

Blah blah blah.  When boss's boss asks.... Yeah.....

So I told her I wanted to sleep on it but that I'd probably take it.  She told me that she would take that as a ""yes"" but that I had two weeks or so before the paperwork could be started (HR's computer system is being revamped) so if I woke up in a cold sweat I could back out until then.

What I don't know how to do is making the axle of this turner go through the top of the chamber without allowing gas in alongside it.

I was the kid that skipped every single class that I could get away with, only really showed up for tests and major assignments, and was happy to coast by on a 54%. I fell into a reasonably well paying job almost right after graduation that allowed me to coast along again for far longer than I should have without doing something that actually interests me. It's time to change that. I'm scrambling a bit to try and get my application in for this fall, and I'm wondering if I'm making the right choice.

I've always thought engineering would be perfect for me. I love math, it was the course I managed to pull off 80s in while still skipping about 1/3 of the time and putting in basically no effort. I also really like understanding how and why things work the way they do. I feel like the biggest thing that has held me back from doing this until now is fear of failure. It's an intimidating program. But that's a stupid reason not to do something!

My question is what can I actually expect out of a career in engineering. I'm still unsure of whether or not I want to do mechanical or electrical. I'm leaning pretty far towards mechanical. I don't think I want to do chemical (don't want to work for an oil company) or civil (don't want to work for the government). But I feel like I may have an overly romantic idea of what MEs do. I worry that it's less hands on than I want it to be and far more sitting at a desk doing math. I'm not afraid of the leg work, but what draws me to the field is the idea of building something new. Creating something that will better the lives of others. I want to build robot pants for paraplegics, or 300hp engines that get 200mpg, or silent wind turbines that don't piss off the neighbours, or a suction cup that actually holds the GPS to the window... Is this realistic or will I actually be spending 20 or 30 years redesigning and then redesigning again the same slightly stronger slightly lighter steering control arm for a ford focus?

Sorry, that quickly turned into a wall of text...

76,What to negotiate after accepting a job offer.,1366170447,"I already accepted a full-time engineering position at a device company. 

Tomorrow I'm going in to sign some paperwork. 

I was wondering salary aside (I got a great one), I was told by my professor who used to work at Intel that: 

-I should ask for three weeks vacation instead of two weeks (Or at least say three weeks paid vacation starting 2014) 

-Possibly working extra (2 hours) per day so that I can work 4 days of the week instead of 5 days. 

-Take some time off before starting the full-time job right after graduation but I decided to ask against this. I want to start working. 

-Other suggestions? 

Is it acceptable to ask for the two above or is it too early to negotiate? Would it sound snotty from a fresh college graduate with zero experience?

All I see is that you have to meet certain expectations like have a mechanism that controls the rudder, and if you make an innovation it's to cut costs.  I doubt I'm right but that's just the way I see it because I haven't been in the industry.  Where is the innovation in EE and CompE?

However, my original plan of extending the length of the piles that resist motion between the portion of the homes above/below the ground level seemed to give me pretty unreasonable results (drill far too deep, use far too much [expensive] steel). 

This project is entirely theoretical; so the money aspect should merely be calculated and analyzed

I tried to calculate the necessary resisting force of the densely compacted sand (known density) in order to keep the piles from rotating about a point located at ground level (since motion about this point would suggest damage to or detaching from foundation). I discovered that in order to keep the wall in place, the piles would have to be dug unreasonably deeply and the cost of the steel would be immense if this was done on a larger scale.

I have a question regarding summer internships in the engineering field. Since I am only about 4 weeks away from my summer, it's getting very close to decision time for me about my summer plans.

This will be my last summer for an internship as I graduate next year. I am a ME but am wanting to get into the BME field for my career. I have applied to a few BME companies for summer internships but haven't heard back yet. I currently have an offer from a well respected engine company that I have interned for in the past. If I don't get any offers from BME companies I will accept my offer from the engine company. But b/c I really don't have a passion for engines, I would really prefer to get an offer from one of these BME companies.

My question then is, do you think it's a good idea to go to these BME companies and tell them I have a deadline to make a decision with this other company in an effort to try to get an internship with them? I'm really not trying to use that as a bargaining chip or to gain leverage. I genuinely just want a job in the BME field but I only have about 2 weeks to reply to this engine company. I would probably phrase it as something along the lines of ""was wanting to get an indication of your intern hiring process timeline"" just to see when they're planning on making a decision.

13,Measuring the position and force of a soccer ball impact,1365973242,"Hey guys,

for a group project we have to build a sensor mountable to a wall that should be able to measure the force and impact position of a soccer ball kicked against it. Another group already tried this before using strain gauges on springs. They used three of those and - as a first attempt - built a triangle, cause it would be easier to get the signals of 3 sensors into a PC and interpret them.
They ran into some problems, the biggest being oscillations, basically making analysis impossible for them.

For a new attempt our group decided on these kind of sensors:
http://www.tekscan.com/flexiforce.html
These are called FSRs (Force Sensitive Resistors) and function just like that: resistance goes down when force is applied to the sensing area. They are paper thin and  quick and durable enough for a soccer ball impact.
Other ideas were:
- optical measuring (too fragile, basically. Vibrations would probably offset the sensors and light sources)
- piezoelectric sensors (way too expensive :P)
- a cylinder which has string gauges attached on the side, measuring how much the cylinder is ""compressed"" (I don't have a better word here, sorry... English is not my first language), this one would be our Plan B if FSRs don't work out

We made a basic prototype which goes something like this: we used four FSRs in each corner of a wooden board (we put a plastic-thingy between each sensor and the board) and used an op amp for every sensor to generate a signal between 0V to 5V, depending on how much force is applied. We're using a 4 channel oscilloscope and it's threshold mode for testing, which works pretty well. Later on, we plan on using a latch and transferring the data to a PC, but won't be that much of a problem.  The circuitry works just fine, it's another thing we can't get to work:
We somehow need to build a sensor area involving these FSRs that is able to help us measure the impact of a soccer ball, like I said above. We should be able to measure a) the force of the impact on a scale of 1-10 (so no industry-like accuracy needed) and at least get a basic idea of where the ball hit.
The real problem here is that we can't think of a good way to apply the force to the sensors... we thought about a setup like this:
http://imgur.com/MiVXTLx
(sorry for the poor quality, I just rushed it real quick in MS Paint)
(note that the actual sensing area would not be the whole board, just an area in the middle due to the fixation)

The problem we're seeing here though is basically the same as the first groups problem: oscillations. The board itself will probably start vibrating like crazy, rendering the signals more ore less obsolete.
We thought about adding a thicker layer of rubber between the whole board and the wall/sensors behind it. This could absorb some of the impact's force and maybe stop the board from oscillating too much. But these are just speculations, since we're not that experienced in those mechanical stuff.

If anyone has any cool ideas on how to build the board and everything around getting the impact as clean as possible to the sensor it'd be a great help to us.
Here's some stuff about the sensors and general purpose of the measurement to keep in mind:
- the company selling these sensors told us that a constant load applied to these sensors will eventually damage the sensor itself, so we should avoid constant load as far as possible
- the sensors are quick and durable enough for this
- the measurement doesn't have to be super precise, we just need a general idea on where the ball hit (3x3 roster would be cool, but 2x2 will do just fine, maybe like: ""the ball hit in the upper/left/right/lower area of the board) and the impact should be rated on a rough scale from 1-10

We only need help with the board so far, but any other tips are welcome of course! Thanks for the time if anyone reads all of this, you're an awesome human being \:D/

42,Diesel vs Petrol?,1365784127,"Hi everyone,

So i'm doing some research on engines specifically the difference between petrol (gasoline) and Diesel. If it helps I'm mainly looking at very large diesels and why they are used.

here's what I think I've worked out, can everyone please jump in and tell me if I'm wrong.

Diesel engines get more torque because (due to compression ratio) they push their pistons further on each stroke than a petrol engine.

A petrol engine cannot compress further than it does because the fuel air mix is already in the cylinder when it starts it's stroke, if it compressed further then the autoignition temperature of petroleum would be reached and engine knocking would occur.

So basically a diesel engine is like a high gear but a petrol engine like a low gear, has to work much faster to get the same result?

Is there any other reason that a petrol engine couldn't do the job of a diesel?

Is there a size limit for petrol engines? Why is it that there are diesel engines 7 meters high but petrol engines seem overall smaller?

However, the poster with whom I'm discussing it cannot grasp what I am saying and is really intent on the fact that Lift is due to resistance.

&gt; From the post in question:

&gt; Which specific part of this is incorrect, anyway?

&gt; Air is being physically resisted by the wing. That resistance results in a deflection of air. That deflection results in a force

&gt; Also, if wind did not resist being turned then how could there possibly be lift?

I proceeded to explain that the deflection of air upon reaching a body is due to the response of the fluid to the moving body, not because of the fluid being resisted by the wing. I further explained that the fluid exhibits gradual changes in fluid properties (pressure, velocity) as it is traversing over the body. Those changes in pressure and the interaction of the flow with the body produce the resulting aerodynamic forces (L&amp;D). Here is the exchange in question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1c36sr/eli5_downforcespeed_balance/c9cv1c8). I had to initially explain to her that wind resistance does not create downforce:

&gt; more downforce due to wind resistance pushing the car down into the road and more backwards force due to wind resistance slowing the car down.

Could someone here explain the proper generation of lift with regards to the interaction of a lifting body with incoming flow? I'm well aware that what I have posted in response to her may well not be correct and I'm open to criticism and clarification also. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1c36sr/eli5_downforcespeed_balance/c9cpzld) is a link to the complete exchange if anyone is willing to read it all.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/1c5ew3/proper_explanation_of_the_generation_of_lift_help/

74,How to Match Impedance and Limit Current,1365698173,"**Devices:**

* I have a mechanical shaker that is excited by a by a sinusoidal wave ranging from the 10’s to 1000’s of hertz. The shaker is rated for 1.8 amps RMS and has an impedance of 3.5 ohms.
* The sinusoidal wave is amplified by a power amp that delivers up to 590W (still confirming this with the manufacturer) and requires a minimum device impedance of 4 ohms.

**Questions:**

* Can I simply connect a ≈0.5 ohm resistor (with appropriate power rating) in series with the shaker (Z=3.5) to bump up the required impedance (Z=4)?
* Can I add an appropriately rated fuse to the circuit to prevent too much current from passing through the shaker?

76,A question about removing moisture from compressed air,1365672643,"G'day,

I've been sizing up some refrigerated air dryers for compressed air lines and found something odd - the lower the system pressure, the less flow the dryer can handle.

For example, a system may be designed to achieve a +2C dewpoint on 1000L/sec of compressed at at nominal conditions (read: 7 bar air pressure, 25C ambient, 35C inlet air temp). But if you use the manufacturers correction factor for, say, 3 bar (at the same 25C ambient/35C inlet air temp) then the capacity suddenly dies off to around 700L/sec. By the same token, if you increase the system pressure to 13 bar then the dryer is now able to achieve +2C dewpoint on 1300L/sec.

Does anyone know the logical explanation to this? It's the same accross a dozen different manufacturers from around the world who all use different correction factors for pressure but it's in the same trend - lower pressure = lower flow rate capacity.

I realise this is a bit light on detail but I'm figuring that a person who deals in this sort of thing will know the right response without subjecting everyone to a wall of text. If a wall of text is required I'm happy to oblige mind you.

6,What happens if you plug a USB cable into a power outlet?,1365547448,"Well, the short answer would be nothing good.

I actually saw this little scenario on a forum I frequent.  Basically, a guy has a computer with a USB cable plugged in but hanging loose.  Guy's kid walks by, takes the cable and plugs it into the outlet.  Shenanigans ensue.

So, what exactly happened (in terms of failure mode)?

Since the outside of the plug is just a ground plane, that means whatever power went into the plug just goes into the ground plane on the board.  Since the ground plane on the motherboard should be tied to earth ground via the power supply and outlet, I'm assuming two scenarios:

9,Job options for newly graduating engineer?,1365538572,"Hello! I'm a senior in biomedical engineering from an ABET accredited university, and I was curious what you thought was the best route for me to take. I've got one offer, and two other companies that I'm headed into third interviews with. I have no internship/co-op experience (sadly), and really only have industry experience through my senior design project.

The first (which I've gotten an offer for) is an automotive company that designs interior seating. It's a design engineering position, and I'd be doing FEA with the design team. They are starting to do more CAE with crash test dummy simulations, and so that's pretty exciting!

The second position is an intraoperative neural monitoring technician position. Not exactly engineering, but I would be working in the operating room with surgeons, and getting a lot of clinical experience in this way. There is potential to move to R&amp;D with this position after working a few years as a technician. 

The third position is a lab tech job, basically working as a QA microbiologist. Again, not engineering, but people say that they use it as a networking opportunity to get the door with a lot of the larger companies it works with, like P&amp;G. They also have a medical device testing facility, although I haven't been interviewed for that position.

My own personal interests lie in medical device product development, testing and R&amp;D. Basically, I'm wondering from an industry perspective, which of these positions (if any) have the most transferable skills if that's where I'd like to end up? If I were to take the first position, would it be an easy switch to go from automotive into medical?

12,Recently laid off engineer in need of some career advice,1365528812,"I was laid off recently, and I'd like some career advice from some fellow engineers.

I'm 23 and graduated with a BS in Materials Science and Engineering roughly 2 years ago.  Since then, I worked at a titanium mill, first as an Metallurgy intern (9 months) and then full-time as a Process Metallurgist (13 months).

As a Process Metallurgist, I helped develop the process routes for two new product lines and have them qualified by customers.  I also started and ran a couple projects that saved roughly $300k and will save another $400k over the next year.

About a week and a half ago, I was laid off.  I thought I'd be upset, but I just haven't been.  It's occurred to me that I didn't really like that job all that much, and that's why I haven't been too broken up about losing it.

While the work was cool and interesting at times, it seemed like there was a lot of resistance to anything new and different.  Really, in anything I tried to do to possibly make things better, I encountered a lot of inertia.  Granted, this may have been just the company I worked for, but before I got the full-time position, I interviewed at a few steel mills and they seemed to only want to ""fill in their ranks"" and do the same thing they've more or less always been doing.

In my last job, I really enjoyed the process development and manufacturing engineering aspects, so I think I'd like to do something like that but within the energy industry since it seems to be undergoing a lot of innovation right now.  I don't really want to work in the oil, gas, etc. industry for various reasons.

I don't think I'd enjoy going back to school to get my Master's, so I'd like to avoid that, if I could...

15,Electronic Engineering question for Game Systems,1365520387,"Hi AskEngineers!

I have been sketching out a design and product I want to make and persue which gives a new spins on game controllers as well as help handicapped/disabled players with easier game control for them. My question is how to go about from a layout/mockup to finding an engineer. Do I just google them or is there a set company/industry dedicted to rough ideas from paper to execution. I ask because I have contacted a few about prototyping but none will touch it as it connects to Xbox360/PS3 and they don't want to go near it. Maybe I am looking in the wrong place.

Is there a set industry to handling these electronics? THANKS!



EDIT: I know this is in the comments already but I figured it couldn't help to add to the original post to clarify a few things.

As for the actual design, I do have a design and hacky prototype built. However I need to go to a larger scale and make a semi finished prototype.

The controller is just a controller with a patent-pending design which is marketable. The problem I am having is investors want to see a semi-decent built one vs the nasty glue together raspberrypi board monster I built it on.

I come from a game design background. I also have a degree in design so I do have some sort of resources at my disposal. The UI/product is already CAD built, the wiring diagram is built, the code and software made by me is ready to be flashed. The problem I am having is finding someone willing to go to the next level with it as they don't want to tamper with the exsisting product because it is built onto an already made product. 

Hopefully that clarifies where I am at.

I work on a amateur high-powered rocket system as part of a club at the university level. We run a hybrid system with soft-cryo liquid nitrous oxide and HTPB-parrafin fuel, ~800lbf for 10 seconds. The area of interest is the combustion chamber, (5"" OD, 1/4"" wall, 450psi operating pressure).

We recently did our first successful 80% duration hot-fire, but we had a combustion chamber burn-through. Part of the issue may be imperfections in oxidizer injection, but we want to improve the TPS as well.

In the past, we have also used other materials (cardboard phenolic, single/double layer carbonfiber, and fiberglass), but representative burn conditions were never met (short burn, insufficient oxidizer, etc). We use epoxy-impregnated silica felt for pre and post combustion chambers, but the material is too thick to encase the fuel.

I'm building a super-simple crystal radio like the one I used to have when I was a kid - parallel coil/variable capacitor connected to a germanium diode for the detector.

I get how it is supposed to work at the high level - LC resonance builds up a voltage, the low-frequency amplitude of which is filtered out by the diode. The thing that I don't understand though is why many of the tutorials I've been reading suggest connecting the antenna and/or detector to the coil at various tap placements. Why is this?

For the antenna, I think it may have something to do with impedance matching the antenna into the LC part of the circuit, but I'm not positive, and don't know how to determine the optimal configuration.

I have been Google'ing and spending time at the library. I was only able to answer a small portion of my questions though.

My first question is it even possible to get past level IV (Armor Piercing) Protection on Fabric alone (like Kevlar)? If not what do you suggest?

Are the materials listed capable of withstanding a substantial amount of abrasion/drag damage?

Is the material grounded and good at water resistance (such as rain)?

What materials are good for reducing or stopping blunt force trauma caused by Kinetic Energy?

What materials are good for making a strong brace (to prevent bones from breaking)?

If these can't be answered here do you know a place I can ask these questions on the internet?

2) As for working final time. Should I work final time after I'm done with finals or after graduation date? If I work after finals, am I allowed to take a day off for graduation? Or should I just do it after graduation because it'll give me a small break from school and work and prepare for work starting June 1st?

3) Should I get the job offer in writing? If so, how do I say it? Should I talk about if there's any paperwork I need to fill out now? How do I get started in this company?

64,Switching from chemistry to engineering,1365251440,"Hi,

I'm just finishing my first year studying chemistry. In the past year I have studied general chemistry, biochemistry, inorganic and organic &amp; a few labs, analytical chemistry and mathematics. I have really enjoyed my time and I mostly enjoy inorganic and analytical chemistry. 

For the past four months I've been doing mostly mathematics and solution chemistry. I slacked through high school and my math skills were never so good. After that I spent a year in the military were I forgot the little math I had learned. Now I have worked quite hard and have found out that I'm quite good at calculus, statistics and linear algebra. The feeling is awesome and I would really like to study something that involves math.

I applied for bioinformation technology, chemical engineering and material sciences. The bioinformation technology department has some really interesting research going on with biomaterials and biotronics. It would be really interesting to work with microfluidics, sensors and related subjects.

The problem is that I have never studied physics seriously. I read most of the courses offered in HS but I just barely passed them as I never did any homework.  Recently my interest towards physics, especially the quantum stuff related to chemistry has grown a lot. I have purchased few general physics books and I've tried to study them on my own. The problem is that I have so much chemistry courses right now and during the summer that I don't really have time right now to study intensively.

I know that without using true structural design software that we end up being conservative on lots of our projects. Now that the firm is growing, though, we are starting to get larger commercial projects. This means that it might be a good time to really invest in learning and purchasing structural design software. I am trying to teach myself STAAD on my own time and sometimes during work.

It's been a while since my last Aero class and I'm not sure about the ""roughness.""  Can anyone offer some guidance?  Basically, my question is, how do you decide which roughness curve to read?

90,"Engineers of Reddit: how big an issue is ""company loyalty"" for the profession?",1365092740,"I remember a thread in a different subreddit discussing how to ask for a raise. One method involved applying elsewhere, getting a salary offer, and presenting that amount to the current employer. If they agreed to meet it, great; if not, you have position at another company.  
  
Someone pointed out this might backfire and give the impression that you lack ""company loyalty"".

92,Best FEM program to model a glass staircase with its steps cantilevered off of a steel column,1365091946,"I need to model a staircase whose steps are made out of thick glass panels. Each step is cantilevered off of a steel column that is anchored to the ground and the ceiling.

I'm concerned about torsional buckling in this design, and I've approximated the loads using Staad.Pro, but I'd like to model this using FEM.

I feel Abaqus would be a pain in the ass for such a simple task. I don't have experience with other packages, but I'm thinking Comsol, ANSYS, Solidworks, or Autodesk Inventor or Robot.

I'd appreciate any ideas from Mechanical/Structural engineers!",AskEngineers,felimz,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1bo20l/best_fem_program_to_model_a_glass_staircase_with/

There is an input x that ranges from 45 to 60. I need to come up with an equation to output y that changes proportionally to x from 45 to 0. So y needs to start at 45 and decrease to 0 based on x increasing from 45 to 60.
Also: I need an equation for input decreasing from 45 to 30 to output values climbing from 45 to 60.
