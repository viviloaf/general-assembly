8,Looking for advice regarding product design on a chair - tricky assembly process,1597679753,"Dear reddit,

I am a currently having some annoying issues with a joint on a chair that I have been working on for quite some time. I have tried to wrap my brain around this problem for so long, that I can no longer see the larger picture.

The problem in question is the middle joint for a chair (as seen in the link below), which acts as a focal point for the support of the whole chair. The assembly process is quite “simple”, as the the legs, backseat and seat are inserted as tubes, through first a stainless steel sphere (which is hollow) and a metal cylinder (the cylinder is first inserted into a hole in the sphere). When the tubes are inserted through the holes, they are then welded using STIG-welding through a hole in the bottom off cylinder (60mm - 2.36 inches hole) and the should be it, or so I thought. 

The feedback I got back from the factory is, that it is not possible to weld in such a tight spaces. Their suggestion is that either the sphere is split into several parts and then welded on (which ruins the overall design esthetic) or that the hole of the cylinder expanded to 130mm (5.11 inches) which is not a possibility as the sphere is 130mm.

So long story short, I don’t know how to exactly how to solve this problem. I won’t compromise the design (the sphere), but I don’t know how to solve the welding problem either.

I hope somebody can give me some advice/help - thanks to all for reading through this way to long post.

My wife bought this sink via Facebook marketplace:

And I am having a hell of a time figuring out how to attach / stabilize the two legs to the sink itself.

The ceramic legs don’t just spin on with some pre-made mechanism, the stump ends kind of just sit loose in the bottom of the sink, supported by nothing.

Leg end:

Receiving hole:

Manufacturers instructions (found online) simply say to affix the sink to the wall with the legs on, and then silicone the legs to the main sink. I doubt that is enough to keep the legs properly in place.

Only thought I’ve come up with so far was to use small toggle/anchor bolts in the receiving hole openings (like an upside down Christmas tree stand) with the silicone. I still think that would make the legs susceptible to not being attached 100%.

Seeking any and all suggestions to get this thing to function as 2 standing legs securely on the sink. I don’t care about maintaining the sink to ever be reused in another location.

I graduated with a Mech Eng degree almost two years ago, spent nine months looking for a job, no engineering company would hire me (I had a couple of interviews that didn't turn out well, but 99% were no-replys) so I ended up giving into a low paying job back home with no opportunity for advancement. My title is technically ""engineer"" but I do not do any actual engineering work and have no transferable hard skills from this position.

21,"First real job: Start a ""safe"" career in Europe or experiment in Asia?",1597663568,"Last year I did my master's thesis and worked a few months at a startup company in Norway, before I made the decision to move to Taiwan and study Chinese for almost a year now. I made that choice as I've studied the language as a hobby for the last 5 years, and wanted to get as close to native level as possible before settling on a permanent job. Now I need to choose whether to return to Norway or experiment with a career here in Asia.

My old company offers a position in Field Application Engineering, which suits my personality, language abilities and technical background. Thing is, I was very happy with my previous work doing development. They could not offer such a position now, but since it's a small startup tasks are very flexible/overlapping and I could possibly transition in a year or two. Other companies are also an option, but so far I've looked at this one since I really enjoyed working there. I'm not against trying FAE though, as it would expose me to customers/make connections, and help me figure out if I enjoy sales/administration or want to go back to development. But I'd be concerned if that would limit my future choices in a development position.

The other option is to remain in Taiwan, I'm in talks with a few companies with European founders, although the working conditions seem a bit messy/unpredictable especially compared to what I'm used to. The plus is I get to continue with technical stuff and grow in that area, and also keep living in Asia for a while longer which I think could be fun. My Chinese level would also naturally keep improving. The cons are that my salary would be much lower than in Europe, and have worse welfare plans. I also have student debt to pay and would like to start investing in property/hobbies at some point too.

* 1 letter of recommendation from employer
* Mediocre GRE scores

61,"Career re-boot? Graduated with B.S.E.E. over a year ago but had no idea what I wanted to do, didn't make connections, gave up job-searching, and took a dead-end desk job. Finally figured out what I want to do with my degree, but have no clue where to start?",1597593857,"**TL;DR** I'm interested in designing music tech and equipment (microphones/speakers, MIDI instruments, maybe DAW software, etc). But I just figured that out, graduated over a year ago, and have barely any relevant experience besides ""EE degree"". Stumped about next steps, and would love any advice you can offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I never found my calling while I was attending university. I dabbled in a bunch of different concentrations, from analog, to FPGA, to embedded, to DSP, to ML - and did graduate with a good GPA - but I never committed to any specific field and it *really* shows. 

The most frequent critique I hear about my resume is that it's super broad, and doesn't convey a sense of my interests. Because *I* didn't even have an understanding of my own interests. Whereas if I tried to tailor my resume to a specific job or path, I completely failed to fill out a full page, because I didn't spend enough time or experience in one area. 

Job interviews were always disastrous because I didn't have an answer as to why I applied for the job or wanted to work for the company - I was just trying to get a job because that's what I thought I was supposed to do.

So I stopped applying for a while, hopped around a few personal engineering projects to try and figure out what I enjoy, and I think I'd like to use my degree toward music equipment design. Even then I haven't entirely narrowed that down, as I'd be interested in anything from DAW software development to analog effects pedals. But at least I know the industry I'd like to go into.

The question I don't know the answer to is: now what? I don't have any serious connections to the industry at this time. I currently work a minimum-wage, part-time, front desk job. And it's been so long since I graduated, I'm wondering if anybody would take my seriously.

Some questions I have:

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Transition jobs?** I'm wondering what would be a sensible role to have if I can't immediately find an EE position - something a bit more relevant than front desk work. For what I want to do my current position feels like a complete dead end. I *really* don't want to go back to retail but have been considering even just getting a sales position at one of the companies of interest would at least be a better starting spot. Alternatively I've looked for technician roles but a lot of what comes up are audio/sound technician, which is not *quite* the same.

**Internships?** I know post-grad internships are... unconventional, to say the least. But I find it hard to believe that this isn't an option for me? (Given the pandemic/time of year, I don't know how many internship postings I'm going to find to begin with)

**Adjacent industries?** I'm aware that a lot of music equipment companies are fairly small, and jobs are probably, comparatively scarce. Are there more general industries that serve as a good starting point?

**Masters?** Because this is a specific field, and especially because I don't feel like I utilized my undergrad education properly, I've been thinking I should go for my Masters in EE. Thoughts? Programs? Would it make more sense to concentrate on DSP, or on analog? Is this something that I don't need a Masters for?

**Communities/Networks/Etc?** I've tried messaging alumni on LinkedIn who work at companies of interest, or managers at these companies, but haven't heard many replies so far. Any other suggestions for reaching out / finding people?

**Anyone with similar experiences?** Don't know if anyone else has gone through this same thing, where they graduated, got themselves stuck in the middle of nowhere, and were able to dig themselves out of it, but if you have, I'd love to hear what that was like for you and how you solved it for yourself?

93,[Question] Combined AC cooling loop and hot water heating?,1597523499,"Non-engineer here, just a geek. I hope this is the right forum to post this, if not please point me in the right directions. I enjoy efficient design and good engineering. I am in early stages of considering building a house with radiant floors and am attempting to integrate overall mechanical systems as much as possible for long term efficiency.

I hope I can articulate my question clearly. Why are there not integrated systems that combine the compressor cooling loop with hot water heating? So instead of having an outside fan unit, the cooling loop is inside a tank which cools the water and then the heated water can be used for domestic hot water or other purposes (e.g. heating pools etc). Instead current scenario involves running 2 motors (compressor and fan) and the heat is exhausted to the atmosphere. And then inside we use electricity or gas to heat hot water.

I imagine the cooling loop is plenty hot for domestic water and even if not could be used for a pre-heat thereby saving $$$. I know Rheem has a combined furnace/hot water system, but it is heating only - not for AC. That is really no different than my grandfathers 50s era oil furnace.

Do such systems exist in industry? Is it just the history of the market that keeps mechanical systems from being more integrated? Would there be an easy way to estimate the BTU/savings from such a system?

3,"Graduation is months away, I am spooked and excited, looking for advice and insight on grad studies, current and foreseeable health of various industries given the global pandemic, and any advice you'd share to new grads in engineering.",1597511121,"Dear redditors of the engineering community,

I am graduating with a bachelor's in chemical engineering this coming December (4 years worth of credits squished into 3.5 hence the winter graduation, note that this follows the suggested curriculum).
The only relevant internship I secured got swept away before even starting due to a global pandemic. 

I don't have a very good feel for the current state of various industries. I'm pretty open and of broad interests as I've yet to dip my toes in much (except a few extended projects in process design and control). I don't have much of a feel for the value of grad studies either, but don't currently have the capital to subsidize those studies.

I am considering pursuing a master's, in part for myself, in part because it seems to be the standard in (continental) Europe where 5 year degrees let you graduate Msc, Dipl.-Ing., Sivilingeniør, etc. To be clear, I am studying in North America where a B.eng tends to be 4 years instead of 3, but would like to find work/settle in EU.

To directly pursue a master's I would need a scholarship, a few of which I am currently trying to apply for. That being said, I am not holding my breath as my early semesters had circumstances very unhelpful to proper studying which tanked my GPA. Only the last 2 semesters have my circumstances improved and my grades bounced back a lot and I've managed to pull my overall GPA up past 3.0/4.0, higher than our program's graduating average, but still short of my closest peers and not close to top of the class. Moreover I've fairly long commutes with limited late/night public transport so my student engagement has also been limited, further not helping on the scholarship front (and in some instances in employment as well), but we'll see.

I'm also looking to maybe work 2-3 years and then doing a master's, or just sticking with it if the bachelor's opens enough doors and in time give up on graduate studies, too early to tell. I still don't know in what or where, but I've started looking tentatively.

If you have any insight on hiring freezes, foreseeable openings, or anything in between in your particular field/industry I would appreciate it if you shared.
Similarly if you've hesitated about grad studies I'd be curious to know what you decided to do, why, and what you feel it has done/not done for you. If you've any insight on how a master's changes your employability and future prospects (any wage ceiling based on education?) I'd be curious to hear about that too.

7,Specificities of satellite AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control System) engineering,1597506723,"I'm still a graduate student in aerospace enginneering, in Europe. I specialised in control systems, and I'm interested in working in the satellite manufacturing industry. I'm especially curious about satellite's AOCS, and I what I painfully lack at this point are real accounts of engineers working on this field. I mean of course I understand clearly what this field is about, but I have no idea what an AOCS engineer *actually does on a daily basis*.  


The thing is, up until now my control courses have been very general in their scope. But, I know the way control engineering is carried in practice varies drastically depending on the field : the temperature control of a heating system won't look anything like the roll control of an airliner (different environment, different physics, different mathematical tools, different concerns driving the control decisions..), and although both are technically control engeneering jobsand from an engineer point of view, on a daily basis they look like completely different jobs.  


I know the same can be said of every engineering discipline to a certain extent, but I've been led to believe that this variety is nowhere as prevalent as in control engineering.  


So my question is : what are some specificities of AOCS design compared to control engineering applied to other field ? Is there anything I should know about it, like aspects of control that are especially essential in AOCS compared to other field, or on the contrary aspects that are not as important in AOCS as in other fields ? What are the main things that are on the mind of an AOCS engineer, the main things to take into considerations that are due to the specificities of this field (spacial environment, etc.) ? What does an AOCS engineer *actually does* on a daily basis ?

35,Moving from USA to Germany,1597454693,"I am a British aerospace engineer, in the space systems field. currently working in the USA (with a greencard). 5 years experience. specifically in the space sector.

I grew up in Germany, and am considering moving back before the BREXIT deadline (this would allow me to apply for german citizenship). This is something I would LOVE to do.

However, I of course need to find a job over there. I have an MENg, good work experience and speak fluent German.

Also, if I do leave the US, if I spend too long abroad, my greencard could be taken away, after 2 years.

A green card still gives me limited options here in the US (ITAR ceiling is dumb). But I have good prospects at my current job and there are enough start ups if thats the environment I want to stay in.

My question is, if I were to move back, what are salaries like? what is the working culture like? I read one thing that says ohhh you like make 80K and work 35 hours a week and get 6+ weeks vacation.

On the other side I see, you will have to work unpaid overtime, make less then 40K, pay a shittonne of taxes that leave you with nothing.

My big fear is that I move back without a job in November (to finish up my citizenship application), and then get stuck in a place I dont enjoy working (I have never had a job in Germany I left at 18 for the UK).

What is the truth? I assume somewhere between these two? I could always wait to come back and come on a reunificiation visa or blue card in the future, but then I have much stiffer competition.

The basic concept is that when you drip water over calcium carbide, it produces acetylene gas, which is burned as a light source. Back when these were popular, the body was made out of 100% metal.

I am pretty confident that you would want to anneal each component individually BEFORE assembly so that you can prevent any permanent movement of the screws inside the housing during the annealing process. 

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker has a different theory: Given that the end position of the board doesn't significantly matter, you would actually want to anneal the completed SUBASSEMBLY. His theory is that after you screw into the aluminum, new stresses are introduced that could vary over temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

I naturally disagree with my coworker. I don't think there are any new significant stresses introduced when drilling annealed parts together AND I think that there is stack up error when you anneal two parts that are interconnected (meaning that things shift to the point that your fastener is no longer as secure). I also think you would lose a lot of clamp load.

62,"Using exotic breathing gases (e.g. hydreliox) to allow an ambient-pressure environment, could a suit capable of sustaining a livable temperature against the thermal conditions of the highest surface elevations of Venus be built? If so, for how long?",1597428311,"(This is a re-ask of [a question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Using-exotic-breathing-gases-e-g-hydreliox-to-allow-an-ambient-pressure-environment-could-a-suit-capable-of-sustaining-a-livable-temperature-against-the-thermal-conditions-of-the-highest-surface-elevations-of-Venus) I asked but got no answers to, though I am including more context here because I can. Not exactly sure if this is the right sub for such a question, but ehh...)

Immediately after I bring up the idea of human exploration (and specifically EVA) on the Venusian surface, I get slammed by people claiming it to be impossible with current materials technology, who always initially bring up the pressure as a reason for its impossibility before anything else.

In doing so, they are bizarrely limiting habitat and environmental suit breathing gas options to an Earth atmosphere at 1 atm pressure, which hasn't even been true historically in spaceflight—Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and most space suits use/d low-pressure pure oxygen, while the Manned Orbital/Orbiting Laboratory was (AFAIK) projected to use a heliox mixture with helium serving as the buffer gas in an Earth-like 1 atm mixture.

The highest-elevation, coolest, least-pressurized area of Venus is Maxwell Montes, with a pressure of 44 atm. This pressure is in the safe range of at least one known breathing gas mixture—hydreliox. This mixture delays the onset of negative health effects to 50 atm, and experimental wet- and dry-run dives have been performed using the mixture down to 53 (Hydra 8) and 71 (Hydra 10) atm, respectively. With novel drugs or genetic engineering to further delay the onset of narcosis or high-pressure nervous syndrome using the mixture or the adoption of even more exotic techniques like liquid breathing, this pressure limit could be raised still higher in the future.

Thus, ambient pressure survival is absolutely possible on the surface of Venus, and any mass that would otherwise be needed for containing the pressure could be used instead exclusively for rejecting heat from the 380 °C (653.15 K, 716 °F), approximately 35.66 g/L surrounding atmosphere, along with around 120 W of bodily heat.

So... is this feat of thermal management doable in a suit capable of being donned in a 0.904 g environment? Note that for the purposes of this question, such suit must not be impossible to walk, etc. in without external power and must be able to at least briefly operate untethered. Ideally, the full motion of the hands would not be hindered, though the replacement of gloves with an ADS-style gripper is acceptable if doing so would make or break the thermal balance.

Any technique (insulative, thermal mass-based, or using recuperative or active refrigeration) and material (that could be machined with current technology into suit parts) currently known is fair game.",AskEngineers,False,GrantExploit,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i9qywi/using_exotic_breathing_gases_eg_hydreliox_to/
63,"My neighbor claims the new air conditioner design of GE as stated by the company is BS, is he right or is he wrong? Does he have a point?",1597428195,"  

My next door neighbor who I am very friendly with is an engineer, and to give him credit he is really brilliant and top notch. He started and owns a company that designs custom heating and plumbing &amp; air conditioning systems/solutions for old commercial buildings . He started this (successful) business over 20 (i think close to 30 even) years ago and will be the first to tell you that he now employs his own engineer team who do most of the engineering/design work , and that he is much more involved in the business end nowadays. Despite that he is very confident in his engineering skills. 

Recently he noticed that I put in a brand new (expensive) GE air conditioner in my window. He called me over and said hey Do you notice that your air conditioner is making a lot of splashy wet noises. I said yeah but I know I installed it correctly according to the instruction manual so I'm not worried it must be part of the design. He said do you mind if I take a look at it I said no . He came over and looked at it and said look there's a plug over here by the water pan that you forgot to take out it must be causing the water to gather up in the pan of the air conditioner which is going to cause you problems. 

now only because I happen to be the type of OCD person who reads instruction books cover to cover did I know for certain that the instruction book did not say to take that plug out. In fact it only says to remove the plug if you need to drain the unit when storing it for the winter season if you plan on taking it out of the window or if you are moving it for some other reason Otherwise according to the manual you're supposed to keep the plug in the unit. 

When I told this to him he frowned at me and said how could this be possible? So I called GE and they said to me that modern Window air conditioner units are designed to hold the water in the pan the fan blades are made in such a way that they splash into the water and splash water back onto the motor or whatever which helps cool it down increasing cooling efficiency causing the unit to run better increasing the life of the unit and increasing energy efficiency. 

The next day when I met my neighbor I told him this, he laughed and said that this was absolute and complete bulls\*\*t and exactly the type of thing that some engineer would say because he thought it sounded smart . He said there is no question that the extra drag or resistance on the fan blades I don't remember which words are used would cause the fan motor to have to work harder and would absolutely decrease the life of the motor and the air conditioner since these systems do not have replaceable Motors, or rather the motor is not worth replacing instead of the whole unit. He was completely convinced that the real reason was that they were sacrificing life of the unit for better energy efficiency now so that they could print a better energy efficiency rating on the label but he was absolutely positive that it would be better off for me to remove the drain plug let the water drain so that the fan could spin freely without any resistance and that the air conditioner would last me, according to him, for many years longer. 

He also noted to me that it was no mistake that old window units lasted for dozens of years and you could find ancient window units in peoples houses that still performed perfectly , and that modern units simply did not last as long. He is very much of the if it ain't broke don't fix it mindset type of person. He did indeed challenge me to remove the plug and let it run for a night and see if I notice any difference in its ability to keep my room cool . Well I did in fact run it for a few nights without the plug and it does not seem to affect the performance of the air conditioner at all . However he is a single individual and he happens to be very strongly opinionated so I definitely wanted to post here and see what other engineers would have to say about this situation.

I appreciate your time and any and all insight. Thank you very much.

74,ME needs help teaching to BE and CE,1597418710,"I am a mechanical engineer and teach an experimental class in a Mechanical department. The class is basically how do you set up an experiment, take reliable data, then communicate that information in a report. Most of the experiments are using a data acquisition board or an osciliscope to read sensors (some data is acquired through manual measurement). This requires them to set up circuits, use filters/amplifiers, and understand how to use/the limitations of their sensors. The problem is the class also teaches to Bio and Chem engineers and the students don't feel the class is applicable to them. Many say they aren't electrical engineers and don't need to know this stuff. We try to inform them all engineers need to use electronics but they don't want to hear it. I can deal with that and chalk it up to their naivety but the experiments were definitely created from an ME's perspective. They are

* Intro to the equipment they use (oscope, multimeter, DAQ, waveform generator, breadboard, etc) basically take measurements of circuits.
* Understanding range, resolution, aliasing, averaging multiple samples and noise by reading a wave with noise at different sampling frequencies. Then using a fourier transform to see what frequencies you recorded and if there is aliasing.
* Imaging techniques by filming an accelerating spinning circle and using matlab to plot the position and speed over time. Then finding when aliasing occurs.
* Filtering techniques student build RC filters to get rid of noise.
* Using op amps to increase a signal and what limitiations that poses
* Scanning measurements - using an XY stage with a microphone on it to listen to a speaker and map a soundwave in 2D space. They also use a band pass filter to get rid of unwanted sound.
* Calibration, strain gauges and accelerometers - They calibrate an accelerometer by rotating it and measuring earths gravity, then take it and put it onto a beam and vibrate the beam to find its stiffness, Then measure the strain gauges which are attached to the beam and compare the two stiffness's. (We tell them the beam is a wing and we need to find how it reacts under load)
* Heat transfer - First they calibrate their thermocouples by measuring how much the voltage changes as they warm up. Then they have hot spheres they put in cold water and measure its temperature over time. They do it for different materials and forced/free convection. They amplify the thermocouple measurement and filter out electrical noise. 

I feel like this is general enough that BE and CE should find it useful but if you can think of any things we can add or change that would make it more universal I would appreciate it. We can't do chemical or bio experiments that would need any kind of fume hood or could pose a threat to the students as we handle 600+ students a year and logistically it would be a nightmare.

Now the rated payload in the tray is 500 kg, the battery pack that I'm installing will come in at around 300 kilograms.

Now I personally thought I was in the clear, as 300kg &lt; 500kg

The transport department on the other hand does not agree, they have said that I need to provide proof that the rear suspension can take this kind of payload.

So I thought ""yeah no worries I'll send in the manufacturer specifications""

No dice

Their opinion is that despite the manufacturer saying that the vehicle can carry that kind of weight, that the paperwork from the manufacturer does not state the intent of carrying that type of weight.

Now I might be looking this a weird way, but to me a 500kg carrying capacity on a work vehicle is a 500kg capacity.

What other intent could there be to ""Here is a work vehicle with a 500kg payload"" I'm gonna expect I can put 500kg in it and drive around with that, if I am a tradesperson, I may have that as my daily payload, all day, everyday.

What do you guys think they mean by ""Manufacturer intent"" here? Cos to me it sounds like they don't trust what the Manufacturer said, despite approving and licencing these vehicles on the roads.

Or is there something deeper I'm missing here?

Or do they just mean ""We think the 500kg is an absolute maximum, not a daily weight""

Which to me seems a dangerous way to design a car as that would imply there's no safety factors or margin for error. I'd assume that a payload would home with at least a 50% safety factor so 500kg = 750kg before stuff breaks.

I know Toyota roughly uses 100% on the trays so you can stick 2 tonne on something rated for 1 tonne and it will generally pull it, I've seen a Landcruiser tow a 30 tonne truck out of a bog and they're technically only rated to 3,500kg so that's what? 1,000%?

99,Do you feel there is a devaluation of the “Engineer” title and of the profession in North America?,1597380419,"Hello engineers, I’m currently a senior chemical engineering student in Canada. Although I love every aspect of chemical engineering and find it very rewarding, there’s a feeling that I just cannot get out of my head: the feeling that the engineering profession is being undervalued in North America (USA and Canada), and the title is losing its perceived value. 

Let me explain.

I feel that there currently are too many engineering graduates. Employers therefore do not see an engineer as a scarce resource with a unique skillset and valuable knowledge. 

Rather, they hire engineers for literally any job: Maintenance, mechanic, drawer, process operator, lab technician, you name it. This is so common that I’m feeling that the engineering profession is losing its connotation with innovation, and is slowly becoming like any regular job, be it in an office or a manufacturing plant. In European countries, such as France and Germany, the engineer title is very respected and engineers are rarely hired in tech level jobs, unlike here. 

So I’m asking you, whether you’re a student, recent grad or experienced professional: do you feel that engineers are not used by North American employers to their maximum potential, in jobs they shouldn’t be necessarily doing, resulting in a devaluation of their title, and ultimately, the profession?

6,Design of Closed Loop Hydraulic Cylinder. How will the Piston behave?,1597369877,"Hello and thank you for any response.

I have reached a bit of a logical puzzle when I tried conceptualizing a closed loop hydraulic cylinder system. I neither have the mathematics understanding to simulate the problem or the resources to actually try it. So I have come to the experts.

Picture a simple reversible hydraulic gear pump. Out of one outlet goes a hydraulic line directly connected to the inlet of a hydraulic cylinder. The other pump outlet goes to the other Cylinder inlet. All air is bled from the system. What happens when you turn the pump shaft?  

My original assumption was that turning the pump shaft one way would would extend the cylinder and turning the pump shaft would retract the cylinder. However, it occurred to me recently that the volume to linear displacement ratio is different in the retract side of the cylinder than in the extend. If in this scenario, since it is closed loop and there is no reservoir. the fluid rate into one side of the cylinder will be equal to fluid rate out of the other side of the cylinder. However since the rate of change of linear displacement is not equal on both sides of the piston. One side will want to move faster than the other, but since it is the same piston and therefore can only move at one speed.......What happens? Would the piston jam? and not move at all? I haven't been able to visual this so I would appreciate any insight.

11,What factors limit the speed and torque of electric motors in my trade?,1597364771,"Good Evening,

In my trade we typically use two types of saws.  The [sidewinder](https://www.dewalt.com/products/power-tools/saws/circular-saws/714-in-lightweight-circular-saw/dwe575sb) and the [wormdrive](https://www.skilsaw.com/lightweight-magnesium-wormdrive-saw-spt77wml-22/). Both type have power limited by the size of the electrical circuit so in North America this means 15A@120V.

Wormdrive saws typically spin the blade at 4250RPM and sidewinders at 5800RPM.  The wormdrive generated more torque by gearing down the motor.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Wormdrives are still popular.   They also weigh more due to the gearbox.  Is there a reason we don't have a motor that could spin slower and generate more torque?  This would eliminate the heavy gearbox (which also needs oil)
2. Is [this](https://www.skilsaw.com/wormdrive-dual-bevel-miter-saw-spt88-01/) the dumbest saw ever?  It has a gearbox and actually spins faster than a regular mitre saw (4000 vs the normal 3800)
3. How much power loss is there in a wormdrive gearbox?
4. Is this just a case of how things worked in the past?  We have a lot of different motor options now that surely we don't need gearboxes?
5. The industry now has cordless saws that are capable of more power output than a 15A circuit.  Dewalt rates their new [60V](https://www.dewalt.com/products/power-tools/saws/circular-saws/flexvolt-60v-max-brushless--714-in-cordless-circular-saw-with-brake-kit/dcs578x1) saw at 2456W.

12,Can you wall-run like Lucio or Surf like in CS:S or G-Mod using rollerblades and electromagnets,1597362398,"Wait! Don't write me off just yet for being an insane child. For one, I'm a teenager, two, I am probably insane.

My idea was, could you take a ramp, say, a ramp that was at a 62-45 degree angle. Plate it with some sort of magnetic metal. This is the basis for my idea. The second part would be a sort of arm vambrace, that strapped to your arm, around your shoulders, and to the other arm, and around your waist. In the center of the ""palm"" of this arm piece, directly in front of your actual hand, would be a sort of spherical electromagnet, allowing it to roll, even while magnetized (With enough momentum in the direction you're going). This would connect to a switch by your thumb so you can turn it on and off. Then you'd have rollerblades that went up around your legs, sort of like Lucio's rollerblade things in Overwatch. The wheels would be magnetic. 

The idea is to get going on flat ground, get some good momentum, and hop onto the ramp, activate the electromagnet sphere, this would hold you to the wall, but not so much that you're just stuck and can't go anywhere, especially with all that momentum. Then use your rollerblades to push yourself further along the ramp. If the electromagnet sphere by itself wouldn't be enough, or couldn't be fine tuned enough to hold you onto the ramp, while also still rolling, I considered another electromagnet could be on your hip, this one meant more for long distances, or a bunch of small ones so they didn't just force your hips against the ramp. These would be just to keep you pulling against the ramp so you didn't fall off, they wouldn't actually touch the ramp itself, as you wouldn't be able to push with your rollerblades if your hip was up against the ramp.

I get this probably wouldn't be possible, and wouldn't work for some reason like physics or whatever, but I was always curious if it might just work.

I'm 4 years out of undergrad and into the workforce and I've realized in the past 6 months that I'm not happy or interested in what I'm doing and I'd like to go into environmental engineering (specifically water resources engineering). I've done some research but I'm having a hard time answering the question ""**Should I try to go straight to a Master's program, or should I get a second Bachelor's degree first?**""

My educational background:

I graduated from a 4-year university in 2016 with a **Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and French and a minor in Physics**. I took no engineering courses as my school didn't allow double-majoring between the engineering school and the liberal arts school (where the math and French departments were located), and I also took no science courses outside of my physics minor except for a Botany 101 course. I had a solid GPA.

My professional background:

**I worked as an IT project manager for over 2 years after graduating** and so I have some experience with project management. More recently I worked as an ESL teacher, which is completely unrelated to engineering (and is incidentally what cemented my desire to get back into a STEM field).

Other relevant information:

I'm long out of touch with my undergrad professors and since I was dealing with mental health issues during undergrad I didn't form a strong relationship with any of these professors. Thus, I don't really have any academic references. I could get professional references if needed.

**So again, my question is, as someone with a BS in math, a minor in physics, and some project management experience, would you recommend I go back for a BS in civil/environmental engineering, or try to go straight to a Master's?** Also, if anyone knows of any kinds of entry level jobs in the field I could reasonably get without further education (and to ultimately take more classes down the road to be able to advance in the field), I would be interested in that information as well.

41,How to plumb Swagelok to rectangular block?,1597334082,"I am working on a hobby/research project involving PRO ([pressure retarded osmosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure-retarded_osmosis), yeah it's a terrible name). I'm building a [benchtop flow cell](https://www.sterlitech.com/sepa-cf-cell.html) that needs to take at least 1000 psi without leaking. Prototype 1 was a huge pain, the cells used untapered 10-32 connections (commonly used in HPLC) but I neglected to account for the tapered ferrule seat that's typical in HPLC connections. I want V2 to avoid HPLC hardware since it's a pain to get. Rotational loosening was also a PITA.

([McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/npt-thread-compression/yor-lok-fittings-for-stainless-steel-tubing-8/)). V1 was CNC aluminum (protolabs) and I plan to stick with it unless there's a really compelling reason to switch.

Here's some options I'm considering:

1. Tap in 1/8 Fem NPT, use 1/8 MPT to 1/8 compression. 
   1. Possibly epoxy the threads in. 
   2. Possibly with [some feature](https://imgur.com/a/Q9xV1qy) to lock the fitting's hex shoulder in place to prevent rotation, e.g. a ""shelf"" feature with a set screw to drive in
2. Tap in 1/8 BSPP or 5/16 UNF, x 1/8 comp. Use an o-ring to seal against the block. 
   1. Possibly with the set screw rotation lock above
3. Use stainless blocks, weld the fitting in. Currently have access to stick and MIG.
4. Aluminum block, stainless fitting, TIG braze it. I would need to find a TIG to borrow.
5. Something else entirely

I'd like to keep it under $1k, including the blocks, which for aluminum last time was \~$150 for each half.

42,"Standard names for directions and rotational motion in the 'pilot coordinate system' - eg. small U-Boat, helicopter, or space-faring vehicle",1597331736,"Hello dear engineers,

I'm currently working on a little side-project (computer simulation) and was wondering if there are standardized, technical names (potentially depending on the discipline) for directions and rotations local to the pilot / the vehicle.

Just as a side-note, I'm not a native English speaker so please excuse (but also please correct) spelling, grammatical mistakes and misuse of phrases.

Personally I know that for rotational motion the terms  
**yaw**: rotations around the 'up/down' axis  
**pitch**: rotations around the 'left/right' axis  
**roll**: rotations around the 'forward/backward' axis  
are commonly used.

For directions (ie. the names of the axes) I'm currently using up, sideways and forward - are there other names for these depending on the context? I think I've heard lateral for sideways, ventral/dorsal for forward/backward before.

Are there any books or articles that summarize this? I did google for a while, but probably used the wrong keywords - the stuff you just read was sort of what I found.

I took a look at the NDA and it considers as confidential any facts or any other info relating to the company's business which includes but isn't limited to all information relating to customers, sales, personnel, etc.

Would that msinfo file mentioning the names of the users who use that PC I had remote access to violate the NDA?

82,Help With Bridge Engineering Text,1597278527,"Hey everyone,

I have a friend overseas who is trying to complete her master's degree, but COVID and the poor education system has interfered with her ability to seek help from her professors. She's using a book for the majority of her work and she's stuck on pages 83, 84, and 87. It's in french, I'll put down the translation of the pages below, I just wanted to put the book in as well for the figures. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. I do so myself but I am but a humble biology major.

P: 83:

Fundamental parameters of the G-M method:

✓ An independent span of length L. 

✓ Width 2b. 

✓ Number of longitudinal beams ""n"" with span L and spacing b1. 

✓ Transversely we have a 2b staff and L1 spacing. 

(See figure 1)

The steps to follow: 

a. It is assumed that the Poisson's ratio ν = 0, the transverse modulus of strain: (G) become equal to E / 2. 

b. It is assumed that the slab plays the role of bracing a 1m strip. 

c. Determine the moments of inertia IP and IE respectively for the beams and spacers

d. Determine the moments of inertia of torsions KP and KE respectively for the beams and spacers. 

e. Find the flexural stiffness ρP = (E × IP)/b1 and ρE = (E × IE)/L1 respectively for beams and spacers.

f. Find the torsional stiffness γP = (G × KP)/b1 and γE = (G × KE)/L1 respectively for beams and spacers. Thus we will be able to determine the two fundamental factors of the method of G-M: 

1-The coefficient of torsion α = (γP + γE)/ 2x√(ρp × ρe) The parameter α responds to moments of inertia and torsion. If α = 0, the resistance to torsion is zero and if α = 1, the bridge is considered to be isotropic, i.e. it represents all the same properties in all directions. In our structure α is between 0 and 1.

2-The bracing coefficient θ = b/L × (^4√(ρp)/(ρe))

The weaker the bracing, the more flexible the structure, the more θ will increase. 

The narrower the bracing, the more rigid the structure, the more θ will tend towards 0. 

For values of θ &lt;0. 3, one will adapt the method of Courbon. In our case θ will be greater than 0.3.

P: 84:

Determination of the transverse distribution coefficient: 

The CRT is symbolized by: (formula: fig 2)

Pi: sinusoidal load applied to the bridge. 

K: the coefficient determined by G-M 

n: the number of beams. 

Coefficient K depends on: 

a. From the torsion parameter α 

b. From the bracing parameter θ 

c. The eccentricity of the load: e 

d. The y-coordinate of the considered beam: y 

For any parameter of torsion α, the interpolation is not linear. So calculate it by Massonnet: K (α) = K0 + (K1-K0) × √α 

A linear interpolation is allowed at the level of θ. 

K0 and K1 are determined by the hyperbolic equations in the appendix

To find K, we must draw its line of influence K (e) as a function of the loading position e. Road loads are placed in such a way as to produce the most unfavorable effect. Distance occupied by this loading is called Li. 

The coefficient K or Ki is determined by the following equation: 

(figure 3)

AL: the load of convoy ""q"" 

LAL = Li, width of the convoy load. 

ωAL: surface generated below the line of influence of K (e) 

Results: 

Proper weight : 

Rib: (n) Area of the equivalent section of the rib Acn: 1.143 m2 

Density weight of reinforced concrete: 2.5 t / m3 

Uniformly distributed load p.p: 1.143 × 2.5 = 2.86 t / m

P: 87:

Due to traffic loads: (G-M method), the basic parameters are as follows: 

L = 36 m, L1 = 1m, 2b = 10.6 m, b = 5.3 m, b0 = 2.12 m, number of beams n = 5 

Mechanical characteristics were noted at the level of the section located at mid-span with slabs: 

Moment of inertia of the rib: IG, p = 0.944 m4 

Torsional inertia of the rib: Kp = 0.0172 m4 

Moment of inertia of the slab: IG, E = (0.25^3 × 1)/12 = 0.001302 m4 

Torsional inertia of the slab: one calls on the theory of the membrane: 

(figure 4)  

To determine the parameter K (b / a), we admit the expression of Saada: Now we have that a = 0.25m and b = 1m where K (b / a) = 0.28104 m4; KE = 0.281 × 1 × 0.253 = 4.4 × 10-3 m4.

We can deduce: 

ρP = E × IP b1 = 0.445 × E 

ρE = E × IE L1 = 0.001302 × E 

γP = G × KP b1 = 4.05 × 10-3 × E 

γE = G × KE L1 = 2.2 × 10-3 × E 

The main parameters are as follows: 

The coefficient of torsion α = (γP + γE)/2√ρp × ρe = 0.11 

The bracing coefficient θ = b/L × 4√(ρp/ρe) = 0.63 

As θ&gt; 0.3 then we will use the method of G-M. 

Calculation of the distribution coefficients: A) At the level of the edge beam: 

The parameters K0 and K1 are determined according to the hyperbolic expressions. Their values are found in the appendix. 

For the torsion coefficient α = 0.11, the parameter Kα = K0 + (K1-K0) × √α = 0.668K0 + 0.332K1 

The position of the edge beam at for y = 4.24m 

Therefore we obtain the coefficient Kα depending on the position y of the beam, on the position e of the loading and the parameter θ.

83,Why am I such a failure as an engineer?,1597277688,"Hi all, 

I graduated with a dual BS in EE And Physics back in 2008 and then spend a couple years in a PhD program and dropped out because I had mental health issues.  Eventually I went back as an online student at the same university and salvaged my MSEE (in a poorly marketable field of EE in my geographical area) but it took me another 2.5 years part time while working.  

All of my jobs felt like I wasn't solving any real engineering problems or learning any useful skills.  They all felt like dead end production jobs (making widgets, processing paperwork, searching databases, etc.)  

I was top 20% of my class as an undergrad, did two 7 month internships, double majored in two rigorous majors, and have a collective 7 or so years of (albeit BS) experience.  Have I just become a jaded and lazy POS?  Maybe that comes across in my interviews or something.  

How can I revitalize my career?  I am sick of being a failure.  I make 71k/yr GROSS pay (but now it is around 63k/yr GROSS because of COVID reductions) in a 110 COL index area.

The beam length is 24ft clear span and I am trying to keep the beam depth at 9.5"" max. so that the ceiling height isn't impacted.

I looked into running 3x 24ft LVLs perpendicular to the current main beam (which runs the full 42ft) and attaching the beam w/ hangers to the LVLs to spread the load. 

The problem I am having is the beam depth constraint is making deflection an issue at that length so basic LVLs aren't sufficient. I looked into a hybrid approach with LVLs sandwiched together with 1/2in steel plates, but the steel cost and weight is going to make that a less than desirable option.

Ultimately my question is could I theoretically resolve the deflection issue with the height constraint by utilizing additional ( more than the 3x I was considering) plain LVLs?",AskEngineers,False,AstonM77,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i8o53p/can_structural_beam_size_limitations_be_offset/

Once hired they get paid like 60k to start and can end up between 100-150k at their peak.

I graduated with a BSE in Mechanical Engineering and was able to get a co-op out of college that quickly turned into a full time job which has now been my career for the last nine years. It is an automotive company - I specifically work with designing brakes and brake systems, but have acquired some tangential knowledge working with customers and suppliers in some larger scope vehicle-system items. 

I like my company and my job as well as the people I work with and for. And I was able to advance pretty quickly from an intro salary of \~65k to above 90k within just a few years. Though over the next several years following that, I'm now making just above 105k. 

It would be naive to expect that same explosive salary growth to continue forever. But looking toward the future I am afraid of stagnation. As a senior design engineer, it seems like the path at my company is just to become a ""higher level"" design engineer, which might offer some small raises over the years along with the small annual 1-2% bump, but I feel like I could be doing...more.

On top of salary, I don't necessarily want to spend my entire life as an automotive brake designer.

1,Rejected from one of the FAANGs and I'm crushed. Contemplating going back to do my PhD!,1597262425,"Hello everyone!

**Some background:** I am a hardware engineer working in wireless/cellular communications. I am a first-generation college student and pretty much had to struggle through college – parents couldn’t afford college for me and I didn’t qualify for a lot of student loans as an international student. I mention this because it usually meant I was begging to be let into classes before drop/add periods while my parents tried to scrape together cash for the semester. Luckily, I made it through!

Right now, I am about 3 years out of grad school. Completed my MS in Electrical Engineering at a pretty good school (Top 10 in the US) and got a decent gig right out of school – smaller company but relatively well known in what we specialize in. Despite knowing I had potential, college was not a walk in the park for me. Looking back with what I know now…I was insanely underprepared *(I know, I went to a top 10 grad school but I put this down to excellent Rec letters - my undergrad advisor was a very big deal)* and ended up graduating undergrad with a 3.0 and grad school with a 2.7 GPA. Not stellar by any means.

The weird thing is that professors that I worked with always thought I had a lot higher GPA than I did based on my performance in research tasks and chats in office hours and this always bugged me.

After getting adult money, I went to therapy (secretly – mental health is sadly still kind of taboo in my family) since I always knew something was off – I love what I do and was usually pretty vocal in classes but always had the hardest time focusing or completing assignments . Well, I was diagnosed with OCD and anxiety which, looking back now, had a major impact on my academics. 

Anyway, after starting my first job, I took on a lot of work to prove myself and I have completed a LOT of projects to date. My work has been sold to Fortune 50 companies, appeared on TV etc. I have gotten prizes and bonuses for outstanding performance on a couple projects. Nowadays, I am regarded at a top-tier engineer at my company and usually get to deal with a lot of the tough/high-profile designs. It’s been great on that front and I feel relieved to know that I could perform well in industry and that my GPA doesn’t define me (I struggled with this a lot). I feel like Mike from the TV show ‘Suits’. 

However, fast forward to a couple weeks ago – my Linkedin profile started getting a lot of attention. A recruiter from one of the FAANG companies reached out to me to tell me how impressed they were with my profile and presented an opportunity in line with my area of expertise.  I am happy where I work but this is a dream company, I couldn’t turn this down!). I send over my resume and he passed it along to the hiring manager. A couple days later he comes back to ask for my grad and undergrad GPAs……they definitely were not impressed *(surprise!)*. They even asked if my GPA was due to extenuating circumstances and requested transcripts – I imagine they had a hard time reconciling all of the accomplishments on my resume with that GPA. Despite all of my experience, they decided to not move forward with the interview. I was crushed…

I always thought that if I could get a few years of work and prove myself, the GPA aspect would fade away (I still get anxiety about it to this day). Their feedback was to continue working for a couple more years and return to them and I would have a better shot. I am not sure how much I believe them though - a close friend from grad school applied to this same company and got an offer a couple weeks before I applied...only difference between us is that he graduated with a 3.6 GPA..it seems like this is important to them

Ugh. On one hand, I’m proud of myself for making it through with all of the obstacles that I faced but sadly, I doubt that matters to big companies and that sucks. 

I’m really torn, I am truly tempted to go back to pursue my PhD now that I have a handle on my finances and my mental health. I know that this is not the best decision financially, but I really would feel accomplished by killing it at a PhD program and getting a high GPA that I can be proud about. GPA has always been my Achilles heel  - I kid you not, I get nightmares frequently that I’m back in college and failing courses. 

Anyway, I would really love some feedback:

**1) Is pursuing my PhD worth it in my case?**

**2) Will it getting a PhD open more doors?** 

**3) Is working at a Big 4 a pipe dream unless I do a PhD or should I just keep racking up years of experience?**

I know people advise against it from a financial perspective, but I hate the feeling of being trapped by my GPA.

Also, in HVAC/MEP jobs some places ask for Revit experience while others ask for Autocad MEP knowledge. 

So my question is should I just apply to these jobs even though I've never used that particular software before? 

I thought about starting to learn these softwares, but with each job posting I come across I find another new software and so on.. 


So what do you think guys?

3,"Alternative careers for multi-disciplinary ""electrical"" engineer (low-tech options)",1597261157,"Hello,

I know that similar questions have been posted a few times here, but I would like to collect some feedback on a specific situation which I do not think has been addressed yet, and may generate a worthy discussion. I'll try to make it short - sorry if I disgress.

I am an engineer in my late 30s working in the tech field, currently developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications for business customers. My academic training is a bachelor in electrical engineering followed by a masters in telecommunications. I started my professional career in the aerospace industry and stayed 9 years at the same company. At the time, I believed in old-fashioned ""loyalty"" to an employer and probably stayed longer than I should have. I've had ups and downs there, but overall I believe it was a good experience. Throughout my time there I've designed embedded software for communication systems, developed signal processing algorithms for novel products and conducted some applied research. However, I always felt the processes to be tedious and the old-style company structure and constraints finally wore me out.

I switched fields 2 years ago and became a developper for artificial intelligence applications. The company was a start-up and there was initially a lot of vibe and energy. I enjoyed learning about this new field (for me) and working in a totally different environment (more freedom, learning opportunities, being involved with different customers, etc.). Not to mention that the pay was (and still is) much better than what I was accustomed to (in the 6 figures, Canadian dollars mind you). I considered myself extremely lucky to have found this company willing to hire me despite my lack of experience in the domain. Fast-forward 2 years, I'm now working in my basement in this post-COVID era. The company is losing traction and many of the core elements are leaving. The work is getting repetitive and meaningless, and I don't feel like I am willing to stick around much longer.

More fundamentally, though, I feel like I reached a point in my life where working on developing a piece of technology just does not satisfy me anymore. I've never been a techno-geek, and despite being a straight-A student, never really felt the calling that other people may feel towards the profession. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy coding and solving difficult problems, and believe that I have strong quantitative reasoning capabilities. But I now feel like the end application of what I am doing is generally useless, or just such a small part in the big picture. Early in my studies, I rejected a career path in research, whether academia or within a company, as I felt that most of the time spent on research is wasted. Yes, there may be this one bright guy or girl once in a while that finds a new revolutionary algorithm, but I feel that 99% of the published (or internal) research is done for the sake of doing something interesting/fun/stimulating but ultimately finds no real purpose or application.

I may be wrong, but I am starting to feel the same way about engineering in general. Many things that we develop (at least in my domain) are there to try to make people buy more of product XYZ, or to offer some enhanced service that only has the remotest impact, or negative impact, on overall well-being (like, allow user to download stuff faster, or freely share personal information used by advertisers, or replace local shops by online ones). Plus, I've grown tired of the whole circus: C-level staff selling the company to its investors, marketing folks pushing dreamy solutions to their client, project managers tediously trying to move the project through the milestones, engineers picking up the mess and trying to meet the deadlines.

This may sound silly and out of place, but I prefer bicycles and manual mowers to cars and gas-powered mowers. I like simplicity over complexity, for many different reasons. I feel like most people think in a totally opposite way than I do. Customers generally like complex solutions that make them ""dream"", I like down-to-earth things that just work, are cheap and low-maintenance. I feel like this kind of preference has permeated my whole way of thinking to the point where I can no longer enjoy what the industry is offering in general.

I now more and more believe that what we need most as a society is to be wiser in our use of technology and consumption of resources, for the environment and our own sake. People need to be more careful in their consumption choices, take care of their personal finances and have good life ethics. To put it in somewhat bluntly, I am now at a point where I am looking to find some meaning in my work, which I can't find anymore in the path that I am on. As I drop my children to daycare, I sometimes envy the feelings of pride and meaning that the caregivers must have for helping children to reach their full potential, while I just go back to my basement and do meaningless activities (while being compensated ridiculously highly compared to them). Sometimes I think that I am just too spoiled, especially with COVID-19 and so many people losing their jobs, but no matter how hard I try, I just cannot make this feeling go away.

I should mention that I have a family to support, a house to pay and cannot just go on ""sabbatical"" and take time to ""discover my true passion"". I am past that point, and I find that sort of talk naive. Dropping everything to start my own business sounds too risky, and I don't think I would enjoy it. I've been considered to to business development, but I did not really succeed or have the motivation to do it well (I am too technical/honest).

My criteria for an ideal job at that point in my life would be as follows:  
\- No long hours (max. 40 hours), family-friendly work, flexible schedule  
\- No travel  
\- Has ""meaning"" (I understand this can vary for everyone)  
\- Minimal ""selling"" aspect  
\- Low risk  
\- Good pay  
\- Not too many administrative tasks  
\- Some quantitative reasoning is good (given that this is where I excel)  
\- Use of technology or coding in my work is OK, but shouldn't be the ""end goal""  


The following career options may find some resonance with me, although all of them have their drawbacks:  
\- Consulting work in engineering (""be my own boss"")  
\- Patent attorney or agent  
\- Economist  
\- Financial adviser  
\- Real estate investor  
\- Thrift shop owner  
\- Quantitative analyst   
\- Technical writer  
\- Continue what I am doing now, save money as much as possible and retire early (in my 50s)

To finish, maybe I should mention some of my hobbies: cycling, playing music, reading about history, philosophy and intellectual figures, gardening (as silly as it sounds, I actually enjoy it), spending time with my family.

At this point, and knowing myself, I think I will probably continue on the current track, probably switching employers multiple times, until I've had enough and retire early, but this does not sound like the most exciting life choice. I feel ashamed of already being thinking about retirement at such young age. I was wondering if anyone had any experience to share transitioning from engineering to one of the above fields, or had any other suggestion about what kind of work may be suitable given the long introduction above? Sorry for the post which is much longer than I had anticipated. I will be looking forward for any feedback.",AskEngineers,False,Dostoevsky1821,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i8kkgm/alternative_careers_for_multidisciplinary/
4,Blender jar retaining nut is corroding; what is happening to the metal and is it safe?,1597259921,"/r/AskEngineers I apologize if this question is not up to standard with the discussions that usually get posted here. With the blessing of the mods I was given the okay to post. 


I'm a paranoid mom with a special needs child that eats most of her dinners blended. I never paid attention but just discovered that the retaining nut is corroding. Like the chrome plating is faulty. I have always hand-washed and hand-dried but I believe over time water just seeps underneath it like a trap and corrodes from the inside. 

I filed a RMA and received a new one under warranty. Ran my finger over the same area of the new jar and felt my skin snag on a piece of plating. I suspect this is the same issue that has caused the first jar to go. I wanted to ask if you can tell from these pictures what type of metal this is and if this corrosion is dangerous to have near food? Or is it a non-issue considering how little will actually be in contact with food surfaces (not asking for medical advice but more so ""That is dangerous metal underneath and is not even food-grade"")?

A week later I still hear nothing, boss says just pick a random one you think might work for now and we'll revisit it.

21,Confused Young Engineer — Burnout,1597246248,"25 y.o. Spring ‘18 ME graduate. 1st generation. 

I chose mechanical engineering in 10th grade due to how stupidly easily math has always been to me, my mechanical fascination with cars my whole life, vacuums &amp; fire alarms as a child, and my desire to know how everything works. 

Highschool went smoothly. 
College went very well. 
Co-op experience was excellent. 
1st job was in an unrelated industry, but they applauded what I brought to the table even thought I *hated* what I was doing. 

I’ve been at my newest job for going on a year now (OEM Automotive Manufacturer) and I’m happy...or so i think...because this is where I’ve planned on being for the last 4 years.

Things in my life have slowly been falling into place EXCEPT my work experience.
I always find myself asking why I chose engineering knowing I have always had issues with anxiety &amp; burnout. This profession just doesn’t seem to do anything positive for those things, despite my work always being regarded as “more than sufficient.” Everyone needs answers from you, deadlines/tasks are always in your face, and real world problems are rarely ever black and white.
In college, this was okay before there was a literal end approaching. 
In industry, there’s literally no end in sight and the big picture is too much.

My question is mainly to the older engineers:
Does there become a point where your career goals *actually* begin to overshadow your fears and uncertainty? Or are those two things always present, equally?

29,Masters for a mechatronics grad - CS or EE?,1597230201,"First of all, I am located in eastern Europe so both the education system and the job market are somewhat different than in the US. The programs being offered are typically a lot less customizable than in the west, being basically pre-packaged with a few elective subjects sprinkled on top.

I graduated this spring with a bachelors in mechatronics (part of our school's mechanical engineering faculty). The job market is pretty brutal right now, but I can get a masters for ""free"" in EE at my own university, or CS at another.  Programming doesn't scare me - I've done plenty of controls work and some regular development on various platforms - but it's not exactly my passion either. The EE program my free placement is in is mostly focused on signals, communications and electrical design. It also comes with an official engineering accreditation (though I've got an ME one already). The CS program is much more flexible - with a broad range of software engineering, general IT and theoretical subjects to pick from - but is purely academic (no accreditation).  

I find physical systems and controls more interesting than pure software work. However with job markets being far from certain I wonder how much would it restrict my chances of getting hired as a software developer. Software and IT jobs are far more abundant here because we're one of the places where everybody outsources their programming to, and the pay is significantly better.

Is going EE shooting myself in the foot? Which option would give me the most flexibility in the future?

I was a student in the program and am the only undergrad who is a TA for this class, the others are grad students. I’m returning to this position for my second year starting next week. 

I actually am interested in project management, so much so that I have signed up for a PMI course and am working on studying for the CAPM exam, with hopes of eventually becoming a PMP. My older brother, who is a software engineer, is telling me that this is a mistake. He has been telling me that project management has little growth and that I am unlikely to be able to get a job as a project manager, or assistant, without working as a field or r&amp;d engineer first. 

For 2 years now I have applied for various internships in engineering and have been unsuccessful in getting one. I’m hoping that once I have my CAPM, I will be able to secure one, or even find and entry level project management position for the Spring.

I am honestly feeling hopeless about my future right now. Is it really a bad move to try and work in project management?",AskEngineers,False,umsolikeyeah,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i8911c/i_dont_think_i_have_a_future_as_an_engineer_but/

 I am currently taking environmental engineering at a university in Canada and going into my final year. I did two years of school at the college/faculty of science before transferring to engineering. 

I am looking at ways to enhance my employability in the future. I have done a 4 month engineering summer job and an 16 month engineering co-op term. I also get involved with engineering student groups on campus, Engineers without borders student chapter, etc.

Looking through environmental jobs some post P.Eng or other credentials P.Geo., P.Ag. Especially in the area I wanna get into, land reclamation and containimated site remediation. In Canada from what I can tell, I could be wrong, but in order to practice geoscience you need to have a undergraduate degree, hence the temptation to finish the other degree.I have seen some engineers that have both P.Eng and P.Geo.

For that reason I've decided I need to do some physical things on my own. I have a soldering iron and have worked on projects in the past with Arduino and raspberry-pis, but those projects were heavily programming based and didn't require more than connecting wires. I've started removing parts from old electronic devices and can order more if needed.

So I work in this room with some others and we have a very large temperature gradient from the back to the front. (about 50ft long room, maybe 20 feet wide). The windows are in the back and there is a 10k btu window unit but because of the devices we are running there is too much heat generation. Talking with our supervisor, he doesn't care how we deal with it so I bought a 14k btu portable ac but even with that hooked up to the back of the room it doesn't make much of a dent in front. We have an exhaust system going to the roof of the building where I have tried to hook the exhaust (6in diameter) of the portable to an equivalent diameter aluminum ducting to bring it closer to the front (there is no reduction in diameter going to the roof). But I found that the metal ducting conducted more heat into the room than what the exhaust system could pull out. We have locations with 2.5 inch diameter pvc exhaust ducts but those were too flow restricting and the compressor eventually stopped.

I don't really care about electrical efficiency since it isn't my electricity and I got the go ahead to make any ridiculous solution to make our office space a bit more comfortable. At one point I considered having a giant hose going from the front to the back window for connecting the exhaust of the portable to the window, but I'm concerned with lack of head pressure and heat radiating back from aluminum ducting.

Computer science is not my passion, but I can say building and designing stuff definitely is.

I don’t really know how the machines work here or how anything works really, I understand maybe 5% of whats happening and 95% foreign.

Great, I thought. Sounds perfect. So my first week, (last week) was kind of shitty and boring.

70,Injection molding design based on company,1597165415,"I am learning about DFM on my own with help from others, specifically injection molding parts.

I have noticed that the DFM engineers I work with (ie, the CAD people who work at big companies who are helping me learn) have no problem designing injection molded parts that may be less than optimal, such as walls that are 1-2mm thicker than ""ideal"" or drafts 1 degree less than ""ideal"".

When I talk to injection molding companies, the feedback varies much more and in unexpected ways to me. For example, some molders will say it is impossible to produce a part because a wall is 1mm thicker than they would suggest. Others will say it is no problem. Sometimes one molder will say something none of the others are saying, like how there should or should not be a radius somewhere and that is a deal breaker.

It is tempting to think that injection molding is just ""one process"", like ""just take my CAD files and mold it"". But I think there is some aspect of the injection molders business I'm not understanding. Whenever I ask the DFM engineers, they always have a simple answer like ""The mold maker can just do X to account for it."" I suspect they might not entirely know the injection molders perspective too.

Does anyone have more information as to why injection molders and mold makers seem to vary so much? Is it kind of like machine shops where they might specialize in certain things or sizes of parts?

The company decided to take a flier on me, my mechanical engineering degree was a bit of a mismatch but they said they love entry level grads and younger staff to help progress the business as much as possible. I don’t really know how the machines work here or how anything works really, I understand maybe 5% of whats happening and 95% foreign.

Great, I thought. Sounds perfect. So my first week, (last week) was kind of shitty and boring. First day I spent half of it doing the paperwork, bank info, SSN, all that jazz, and then safety training videos. They handed me off to my “supervisor” who was supposed to have a meeting discussing my responsibilities and tasks. That never happened. It still hasn’t happened. I’ve tried bringing it up, I barely see him, and it feels like I’m a burden.

My entire time here ive pretty mich just walked around, sat in my car and browsed the internet, and asked people questions. This sucks. I feel absolutely useless and everyone is using jargon and words that feel like code to me. I’m a bit out of my element and I feel pressured to do something, because I’m getting the feeling I’m not cutting it. 

The job market is absolutely brutal because of Covid. I’m already feeling weird eyes about my mask wearing everywhere (they “don’t believe in” Covid here). Point is, I don’t want to lose this job, not yet anyways. I’m broke and need money to pay for my bills. 

I mean, I don’t even have a fucking desk at this point. Or a computer. They told me they were setting up my email, I had to remind them three times to get that set up. My boss is spamming me with emails for training videos and stuff I want to respond to, and I have to manage it all on my phone, but if I’m on my phone I could get in trouble. For the entire first week I stood around at the entrance because they didn’t bother to have my badge made.

A little background on myself. I just graduated from college this past May with a BS and had been fortunate enough to have a job lined up for most of the school year. I have has 4 internships at this company, and I have been around since they were a third of the size we are now. I have worked on many essential projects and have always gone above and beyond in every aspect of my work, including becoming very friendly with everyone and always making a habit to help out someone if they needed a hand on any project. I really enjoy my job and am good friends with my boss. I get to work on exciting projects and get to be hands on.

As I started full time (\~3 months ago), so did two other individuals. Great people and I have alot in common with them. I think we will most definitely be friends. I only have my BS, but these individuals have their MS in their specific fields.

2,"I feel confused, Help?",1597116038,"\*\*TLDR at the bottom for those interested\*\*

I have to very soon choose Electrical or Mechanical engineering specifically as my major (all pre-req's done and courses split early) and i'm feeling overwhelmed by the decision. Here are some quick notes before I begin. 

1) Robotics and Mechatronics are not an option at my university (switching universities is also not an option) 

2) I will get my masters degree whether I go for EE or ME 

3) I plan to work at a large laboratory not small start ups. Specifically towards defense related contracts

4) I'm not afraid to learn things on my own whether that's basic electronics, circuitry, or CAD, solidworks etc... 

 That being said, electrical engineering has always had a pull on me for some unknown reason. There is an affinity I cannot explain towards going into EE. The classes for EE seem interesting, fun and exciting. Despite that, the projects ME gets to work on seem far more fun. Things like building robots, drones, even building a go kart on the side for my son. Mechanical engineering classes however do not interest me nearly as much. Things like thermodynamics, fluids, vibrations, materials etc just don't have the same pull. Yes, they do seem more applicable to everyday life but not nearly as interesting to me in comparison to circuits, electromagnetism, RF etc. It seems like I would enjoy the academia of EE more than ME but the functioning practicalities less. I love tech, absolutely love it. Things like computers, building them, programming, robotics, drones etc. That has always been a part of my life and I love it however, I want to design and build things when I'm done. I want to work as an engineer where I can design, build, and hold my product. (Even if that's on my own time outside of work). I feel like i'm swirling with near infinite possibilities, ""what if"" questions, options, scenarios, etc. Does anyone have any advice with this situation and what to choose? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

1) I have to choose Electrical or Mechanical engineering very soon for my degree

2) I have a pull towards EE, I love tech, EE classes seem interesting and fun. Despite that Mechanical engineering projects seem far more fun than EE projects however, ME classes such as thermo, fluids, etc seem far less interesting to me than EE classes

We're working on a product that as a part of it has a requirement to spray water on a target to keep it slightly moistened (via a mist/atomisation of the water), this target is at most 3-5 cm big. We don't know the exact flow rate and we will need, we will set up a works-like system where we will be able to vary the flowrate to determine what the optimal moisture content/parameters that will need to be applied will be.

11,Engineering (Non) Technical roles in a large OEM company vs small consultancies? Happy middle ground?,1597107029,"I am coming towards the final year of my undergraduate degree in Engineering. This past year I have completed a one year internship in a large OEM company who design and manufacture their own products, and I'm currently summer interning in a small engineering consultancy who provide specialist technical analysis. 

&amp;#x200B;

My large OEM internship experience was very negative due to my my role being a very non-technical and managerial team, I also got the sense that the bulk of the engineers at this company were systems integration engineers and repair/maintenance engineers supporting to in-service operation of these products - there were functions with the company however that did specialise in stuff like stress/heat transfer etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The experience at this small consultancy so far has been great because I actually feel like I'm doing engineering and science again due to the technical nature of the work. The only drawbacks to the company of this size is that there is not much progression and you very quickly run out of new people to talk to and work with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm concerned that for someone who is interested in a  research heavy engineering career, I might be limited to universities or specialist consultancies with &lt;20-30 employees. The large OEMs seem to only exist to build the products and keep them functioning in service - I understand there might be a chance I wasn't exposed to the kind of technical engineering work I'd like to have seen in that OEM, yet this is still a concern of mine. I'm also wondering if there are companies who are a mix of the two (such as Reaction Engines), where they are growing in size and working on innovative products - a company like this where I would be able to work on engineering research in a company with good progression, perks, people, etc etc.",AskEngineers,False,mripper,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i7hqa7/engineering_non_technical_roles_in_a_large_oem/

Although I enjoyed most of my classes as an undergrad and did ok (B+ average at a competitive school), I didn't think I wanted to do technical work full time (sounded hard and lots of sitting in front of computers) and ended up working at a class 1 railroad for a year as a foreman. Long story short I hated it and gladly took a layoff once covid happened. I've been home searching for jobs all summer and it's starting to look a bit hopeless. I figured applying to grad school in the fall might be a good backup plan if I can't get a job by the end of the year (I'll take anything that keeps me out of HVAC at this point) but I'm not sure what I should go for. If I did ME I'd probably do a general degree since I just haven't had the work experience to know what I'd pick as a thesis. I'm also considering an MEM as I could certainly see myself in some sort of business development roll down the line (again, not the biggest fan of doing technical work for the rest of my life although I obviously lack experience). I've heard good MBA programs require more work experience than I currently have and I'm not really interested in a MF or anything else.

14,Unemployed and lost. Should I give up engineering soon?,1597102663,"I am a recent Materials Engineering grad (December 2019) from a school in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I've been unemployed since I graduated so 8 months total now. 

My GPA is 3.10 and I have one small internship experience at a very small company where I did some FEA work. It is nothing notable. I also have some experience with machining, manufacturing and some metallurgy related research. I have no major 12-16 month co-op experience and I think that is hurting me a lot.

I've been sending out resumes and cover letters for the past 8 months and am getting nothing. There are also very few materials engineering related jobs in Canada. The only mat eng related positions that are available are Senior positions that require 10+ years of experience or research positions which im not interested in nor qualify for.

It really feels like this field is unemployable in Canada and I chose the wrong degree and wasted 4 years of my life. 

Through a network I was able to get a contract 6 month only tech support job for a very reputable employer but its not related to my degree at all and they are only hiring me due to good will which I am greatful for. They already said there is no opportunity to stay after the 6 months. 

I don't believe the issue is my resume or cover letters as I got them looked at by people who work in the employment center in my city and they are saying it looks great. The issue is just a lack of entry level jobs and an oversupply of applicants.

I have no desire to work as an engineer anymore because its unrealistic in Canada with my lack of experience but I would love to do a technical sales engineering job or something like that but I have no sales experience. I'm also considering getting a certificate in HR and try to get an HR role at an engineering company.

Overall im just lost as hell right now. I think I should try to get an engineering job for 1 more year and then maybe get a call center job or something and try to advance in that field.

Sorry for the rant i've just been going through it the last few months and im sure a lot of u can relate.

tl:dr : 

-Went into a niche engineering field that is nearly unemployable in my country.

 -Unemployed after graduating and got a tech support 6 month contract job

21,Quality Manager vs. Quality Engineer,1597094445,"Hello everyone, I have a question for those of you who work in quality. 

My boss and I had a meeting today to discuss my long term plan at the company I work at. I've been at the company about a year and a half (graduated with a BSMET degree last May) as a Manufacturing Quality Engineer. It's a small manufacturing company, about 50 employees.  

Today when talking with my boss, he said he wanted me to eventually take over his responsibilities as quality manager as he felts he should be devoting more time to other areas of the company. (He's basically the head of several departments because we're a small company). 

He said I would have people reporting to me and that my job duties would have a broader scope and would involve more front end planning work rather than trying to deal with stuff we've been doing for 20 years already. 

Now some stuff about me, I enjoy the hands on aspect of the job. I particularly enjoy doing root cause analysis of a problem to try to figure things out that no one else can and how to fix it. I enjoy the challenge and I actually enjoy being wrong in that, if I think a problem is being caused by one thing, but then prove that it's actually being caused by a different thing that I wasn't expecting, that's exciting to me. I also enjoy learning and doing new things. These are both things I currently get out of my job. 

I do not enjoy doing paperwork, I can't do it for any length of time without becoming bored and distracted by something else. 

However, I do want to advance in my career and I understand that at some point I will probably have to shift away from being hands in order to climb up the corporate latter so to speak, and this seems like a great opportunity to do that. So, I already told my boss I wanted to do it.

So I just finished my first year as a mech e undergrad and most of my courses were pretty theoretical (thermo, calc, diffeq, chem, physics) with one class focused more on design.

37,Would an MASc in wireless communications be worth it?,1597087712,"Hi All,

I graduated in Apr 2019 with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering. I'm a pretty introverted person, and like spending time alone and doing one task at a time for long periods. I think that's why I liked school and did well in my last two years. However, I am not sure if it's worth going back for a MASc with this job market and missing two years of salary.

Since graduation, I worked as a Business Analyst at a power company for around 6 months. While working in this role, I was applying to wireless communication type jobs, because the analyst role was doing the same work everyday and it was getting boring fast. Also, to be honest the pay was not that good, I understand that shouldn't matter, but with this job market and future expenses, I felt as though I need to take care of myself. After, through a family reference, I got a job as a Project Engineer at a big power company, been there since Mar 2020.

I've noticed in this role, I don't have much autonomy, and it's a very reactive job, with random meetings scheduled or tasks that pop up. Lots of time is spent following up with other departments via email. There doesn't seem to be much deep work involved, or technical work. It's mainly coordinating to ensure project deliverables are met on time, material is ready for projects, etc.

I feel as though I haven't learned much technically. Even though I have been working from home pretty much since I joined, and nobody can see me, I still get nervous/anxious during meetings when my turn to speak up approaches. I feel my heart beating pretty fast, I don't think this is healthy. I'm also worried about my health and stress levels when we have to return to the office and I actually see everyone during meetings. After work finishes for the day, whenever I'm doing chores, during downtime or exercise, work thoughts creep up in my mind. There is just so much to keep track of, I write it down of course, but I don't want to think about work after work or weekends lol. I feel as though I'm still performing okay in this job however.

I am hoping to find a job in the wireless communication field, where my introversion can be a strength. I feel as though I would prefer a job where I learn something new everyday in a field I like.

I had no luck when applying for these type of jobs before I switched to the project engineer role. Unfortunately, I didn't have any interviews.

Thus, with this information, would a MASc in EE unlock R&amp;D type jobs, wheer I don't need to be in so many meetings, and have time alone to perform deep work?

I have one offer for Fall 2020 admission from my undergrad school, however my prospective advisor's field of research is computer architecture and the Fall 2020 semester would be online. I don't think I will perform as well if I don't have school library access because I can get distracted at home lol. Thus, I would just apply again for Fall 2021 admission hoping for wireless communication advisors. 

I'm also not sure if liking my courses and studying translates to liking research type work. I enjoyed taking notes and learning new things, and that feeling when you understand a new concept.

42,How to make ultrasonic mister function,1597086374,"Hello, I am very new to electronics and have only successfully built a couple circuits for home automation purposes. I am trying to build a WiFi controlled mister for a small terrarium using a NodeMCU esp8266. I bought a small 5v ultrasonic mister and tried testing it off a 5v 1A USB phone charger. I know that the voltage is getting to the mister, but nothing is happening. At first, I thought this would be as easy as just connecting the positive and negative to a 5v source and it would work, but now it looks like it may be more complicated. Does anybody have any advice as to how to get this mister to work?

Here is the link to the mister:

43,Looking for input on linear drive mechanisms,1597083931,"**Context:** I am working on designing a device that can apply a known vertical force to an object and hold at that specific force as the sample is moved. The sample would be fixed to the device and then the force applied. Essentially like a pneumatic press (but not that extreme). It would be programmable where I can modify different parameters such as force, contact duration, and frequency. Looking for any feedback on alternative mechanisms or suggestions.
[**First iteration**](https://imgur.com/a/lmv8pjJ) was primarily 3D printed and utilized a slotted link mechanism. I was using [Nema 17 stepper motors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/324) and their [motor shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438). I then used a button force sensor like [this](https://www.flintec.com/weight-sensors/force-sensors/miniature/mba-tw) to measure the load. I had some issues being able to apply any significant load (didn't use a gear reduction though).
  
Looking for suggestions of other mechanisms and types of force sensors that might be better. I was thinking maybe a linear actuator like [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0615/2193/products/Actuator_exploded_view_8e8f5fb1-26e4-4301-b46e-3155bbdeb82b_1600x.png?v=1593019308) with a gear reduction might be better and could try designing my own or is it farfetched of an idea to make my own?
* Could a Nema17 stepper provide enough torque?
* I read a lead screw can prevent back drive compared to a ball screw is that true? Or would I need a separate mechanism to hold at a constant force?  
  
Few notes:  
* Travel distance only needs to be ~1""(2.5cm)
* Applied force ~1-25lbs (5-110N)
* Movement speed and efficiency isn't much of a concern
* Tolerance of force sensor maybe +/- 1 lb
* 3D printing and some machining would be used to fabricate it",AskEngineers,False,Apple___Eater,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i7aezp/looking_for_input_on_linear_drive_mechanisms/

So, I have been in my new role as a Sales/Support Engineer for almost 2 months.

5 weeks in my boss left to work for a family company, leaving me as the only technical person in my position. Our applications engineers are taking some parts of his role and people have taken over some of the small tasks.

However, necessarily, my role is shifting and I am taking on greater responsibility.

In my view this is reason to seek higher pay. The current plan is, instead of replacing my former boss, to higher someone less technical with more support exp who will be similar in level to me.

I'm thinking I should ask for a formal review at 3mo so that my request happens before the new person is hired or could get up to speed (I have lots of leverage as I've worked hard to onboard myself quickly).

Some comments I've gotten:
-i'm onboarding faster than any of the others who've held the role
-i seem to grasp the tech well/quickly
-sales guys like me &amp; are very happy with how communicative I am with them
...And other such things indicating I am excelling in the role.

I'm not sure if this is the place to talk about this but here I go.  


I am one year out of school working for an HVAC engineering firm.  I had a great mentor/engineer teach me a lot and make me valuable.  In March, I had an offer from another firm, I talked to my boss about it and my company counter offered and gave me a $6k raise with a promotion.  


Currently, the past week I've had 3 offers and two of them were an $8k raise in salary with great benefits, working with engineers I know and like.  I did not intend on telling my current firm of the situation since I've already played the ""I'm leaving card"" a few months ago and got a raise out of it.   


Well, my current firm found out about my offers somehow and just called with a counteroffer to the $8k raise and paid OT.   It is a really great deal, I do love the firm, but I feel really bad about them having to counter offer again. It makes it seem like I keep threatening to leave to get a better raise which is not my intent at all.  2 of the 3 offers that came last week were completely random from firms that I interviewed with last year.   


This newest promotion will bring me to $80k salary with OT paid.  I am happy to be wanted but I feel like I am being substantially overpaid and that I might not be able to live up to that worth and may be let go if they don't like me later on.  I feel like the higher ups in corporate are reluctant and might not like that they had to do this for me again.

80,AMA: Engineers Turned Patent Professionals,1597068009,"# Who are we?

We are a group of patent professionals passionate about educating engineers and engineering students about the patent law career path.

Over the past month or so, we have been talking with folks on r/AskEngineers, r/careerguidance, and r/EngineeringStudents about patent law and patent law careers.

We come from STEM backgrounds but looked for alternative ways to use our engineering degrees. Luckily, we discovered patent law.

The problem? ***There is not a lot of good info out there.*** We wish we had someone to ask about the career, what it entails, and how to get there. Our peers with a patent professional in the family had a huge leg up throughout the entire journey from engineering graduate to landing a job working in the patent field.

We want other engineering students to have that same opportunity.

We don't think patent law careers are for everyone. But, we think if more STEM majors knew that patent jobs can be both lucrative and rewarding, they would choose that path over a traditional engineering route.

So far, our outreach on reddit has been successful on an individual level, but we'd like to have one thread where everyone can have their questions about patent careers answered.

# Common Questions:

**Q:** Don't you have to go to one of the top law schools if you want to make any money?

**A:** Not at all. There's a ton of elitism and misinformation out there surrounding job prospects ...

**Q:** Don't I need an advanced degree if my background is in bio/chem?

**A:** It won't hurt if you already have one. But, don't go to school for 2-8 more years just to go to school for another 3 years when there won't be much improvement on your ""hireablility"" compared to the additional costs you'll incur.

**Q:** I heard that there aren't many jobs in patent law for MechE/ChemE/etc., is that true?

**A:** Couldn't be farther from the truth. Many of us, and many of our classmates and peers were MechE. There's no shortage of jobs for engineering graduates. Your ability to learn quickly is more important than your specific engineering knowledge.

# Further Reading:

We compiled all our experience on this topic into a comprehensive guide on launching a patent law career, which can be found here:  [https://gumroad.com/l/patentcareerguide](https://gumroad.com/l/patentcareerguide)

We are happy to share all our experience in this thread, in our DM's, and on our twitter. We are here to answer any questions you have. The book serves as a more complete reference because we believe there is more information than we can possibly describe in one AMA. If you want the most important information compiled into a cohesive guide, the Patent Career Guide is perfect for you. We imagine you'll have additional questions as you go down your patent career path and a reference to return to will be helpful.

I was also telling my Dad about this (environmental consulting engineer), and he was telling me, “I’d be pretty annoyed if I had a junior-level employee come up to me and say, “Hey, I worked 50 hours this week, so is it okay if I work 30 hours next week?”

Like I said, I’m (relatively) new to the overall workforce, and am still trying to figure everything out. I haven’t used “Modified Time” since I’ve started, and there have been quite a few times where I’ll work more than 40 hours a week (a typical say for me is 10 hours, as a junior level employee).

I should mention, though, that I’m oh the 9/80, where I get every other Friday off. So, typically, over the course of two weeks (bi-weekly pay period), I’ll total up ~90 hours or so (50 hours the first week, 40 hours the second week, and still take that Friday in the second week, off).

How to find final temp after heat exchange?,1597031515,"So I'm currently working on a project to cool a gas down to as low of a temperature as possible (without going over the top. Also, it needs to stay in gaseous phase). As a cheap and easy setup, im thinking having the gas (most likely argon) flow through piping (copper?) and possibly a coil that is submerged in liquid nitrogen, since it is a simple setup and the nitrogen should be available on campus. I feel that this is key since the pipe will be in contact with 2 different fluids: air, liquid nitrogen, air again, which would affect final temp. 

The experiments would run for well under 10 seconds so I'm not concerned about the liquid heating up too much /evaporating and no longer effectively cooling.

Of course, I'm not exactly sure how long the piping would be, or the diameter. I feel that this is a factor in the design. Also, I'm thinking the pipe shuold be ""pre-cooled"" to the temp of the liquid nitrogen by putting in the liquid itself before sending gas through. 

I need to figure out what the temp of the gas would be coming out of the end of the piping to see if there is any reasonable temperature drop compared to room temperature. I'm doing this to see if it is a feasible idea to begin with before actually building the setup, and I'd like to get as accurate of a hand calculation as possible.

Even if I miraculously got an interview or offer somewhere at this point, I would be hesitant to accept because there are only a few cities I’d want to live in (Denver, Portland, Boise, Chicago, etc.) and I have a long term relationship, but I am also very aware you do need to move to where the jobs are. I don’t know if I’d be willing to accept a job in a place I don’t want to live and where I can’t be with my girlfriend, even if only for a year.

I’m really at a loss of what to do now.  It seems like any city I want to live in, I don’t get any responses at all to applications. I would literally work any job at all in these cities if it meant I could get out of my parents house to a place I would like to be, even if the job sucks and does not pay well because it would be a great way to transition. But I can’t even find those shitty jobs.

What am I doing wrong? Should I not be stressed about bumming off my parents while my peers work and get their foot in the door at great companies? Is it too late to transition into CS? How would I even do that? Do I just need to keep shooting out dozens of resumes a day?

33,B.S. or M.S. in Environmental Engineering with B.A. in Environmental Geography? And Does ABET or PE matter?,1597009836,"Hey all,

I am hoping to go back to school for Environmental Engineering. My undergrad was a B.A. in Environmental (Geology/ Fluvial Geomorphology) Geography with Remote Sensing/GIS. I basically need a year of levelling coursework before I can go into a Master's program for EE.

I have also realized that most colleges don't not want students who already have a 'pseudo' STEM Bachelor's to get another one but provided my background I am not sure a Master's makes sense...?

Masters Route:

1 year- levelling coursework (intro Chem, Physics, Math)

1-2 year- M.S. Environmental Engineering (thesis or Professional track)

Bachelors Route:

4 year- B.S. Environmental Engineering

&amp;#x200B;

I have also looked into ABET and have found that most colleges only accredit the B.S. and not M.S. programs. That being said I have also heard that PE may be only accrediting individuals with a M.S. in the future so I am not sure if this will impact me in trying to find a job or not in the future.

I would greatly appreciate any insight into Environmental Engineering, academia and work profession wise, I have only really been exposed within the realm of waste water management and public works.

34,Exciting automotive start up position versus prestigious energy program?,1597005484,"As a preface - I don't have any offers yet, but if I get one, it will be a short decision period so I'm trying to plan ahead. 

Right now I am interning at an EV startup, in a position that is pretty hard to break into that I love. I love the company, the team, and my responsibilities. There is a potential for a full time offer at the end of the summer.

This week, I will be interviewing for a prestigious rotational program at a major power company (you can probably guess it) where I would get a free master's from a great university and loads of intentional leadership development. 

The downsides I see of the EV startup is likely lower pay, and being across the country from my family and boyfriend. For the power company, it is a big time commitment (3+ years) to a company that is going downhill financially, and potentially a less fun culture. 

The biggest struggle is, I can't necessarily switch to the other one one if I end up regretting my choice. The power role is only for fresh grads, so I would never get those development opportunities again if I applied to the company later. The EV role is hard to come by, and usually filled by people with decades of experience. They would be making an 'exception' for me because they get to shape me into what they want as a fresh grad. 
 
Does anyone have any logical advice on pros/cons of these options that I should consider if I get offers from both?

 I am about to graduate soon as an Engineer on Industrial Design.

I've done a few internships and jobs, but i am now a bit lost and not sure which path to follow. I dont have any experienced engineer to mentor me, so asking here for some insight!

My dream always was to work in automotion, in something related to design, as when i was in highschool I used to draw and model in 3D for videogames (3DS Max)

While on the uni, I managed the fairing area of a motostudent (like FSAE but for motorcycles). Here I learned about the project management side of things, gaining sponsors, and also got my hands in design for manufacturing. I loved it. (CATIA, mills, molds, carbon fiber...) The project was a success for our area and we made a nice carbon fiber fairing without anyknowledge or money. I loved it.

I am a bit lost about the automotive industry, don't know if i will like it, if it will fit my expectations. **What works are there? Which companies to apply in Europe? What should I improve to apply?**

I've been working while on uni, did an internship on a glass factory doing lean manufacturing stuff, then a maitenance project management internship on a automotive factory, and now working doing technical documentation for aviation.

I have grown tired of the boom and bust cycle of the oil and gas industry and am looking to change things up and change careers to something more stable and quite frankly for me more enjoyable. In school I really enjoyed HVAC design and was looking to pursue a career in MEP. Does anyone here have any advice on how to make myself relevant for consideration when applying to these jobs.

71,Is it possible to make a functioning Portal 2 core in real life?,1596938495,"(Tagged under the Mechanical flair, but I guess it could also be applied to Electrical and Computer engineering)

Hey there! The title is self explanatory, but I thought I would give some of my own ideas as to how this could be done.

However please keep in mind I've got no engineering experience, so I've got no idea whether this would work or not, but I'm hoping this would lead me in the right direction.

I was thinking the management rail could provide electrical power (two sides, one providing negative and the other providing positive power, with the ""roller"" in the middle to make the core actually move), while the core's internals contain the computers running everything, as well as the X Y actuators. Perhaps some sort of Raspberry Pi. 

The core would be able to access information through the internet by connecting via WiFi, which would also let you connect to it and send commands and information. It would be equipped with a camera on the front for environmental and facial recognition (as well as audio recognition) to recognize who is talking to it. 

Speakers and a microphone as well, obviously, as it would need to hear, process and let you hear the information.

What challenges would be introduced? I assume packing everything on the inside in a small Raspberry Pi would be a challenge, but I'd like to hear some more.

79,Need to design a Pulley System for specific purpose,1596925539,"I own a small Solar Power System installation company and need some help and suggestions in designing a small portable Pulley System.

The requirement is for lifting up the Solar Panels to the roofs of 2 to 10 stories high buildings.

So for now I've Block and Tackle pulley system design in mind which could be powered by either hand or a motor driven Winch. The frame I'm thinking could be an Oblique/Obtuse Tetrahedron with one pulley attached on its apex, which would be overhanging the roof's boundary wall and the Winch could placed at the base of the Tetrahedron. And for supporting all this on different thickness of boundary walls for different buildings, I'm thinking to attach two Bar Clamps like mechanism under it that can be tightly screwed on the walls.
And on the load end of business that will hold Solar Panels, I'm thinking nylon straps should do the job.

Still figuring out on how big I need to make this so that no one has to hang over the boundary to reach for the Panels and pull them on the roof meanwhile keeping it light and portable.
Also, what material should I use... Mild Steel Square Pipes perhaps?

Anyway, any modification in my design is most welcome or if you have something better altogether, even more brillant. Please be as exhaustive as possible. Just remember the 3 main features of the design:
 • Light weight
 • Portable/Foldable (i.e. can be easily put together and taken apart) and
 • Sturdy (i.e. can lift upto ~150kgs)


Answers to some questions that may come up...
 • This will be used as a backup plan for when there would be a broken or no elevator in a building.
If there exists a device for such purposes, I'm sure it won't be available in my country as we don't have hardware/home improvement stores like Home Depot, Lowe's, Menards, etc. I have to gather all the parts &amp; material from different shops and stores and DIY one for myself.
 • I don't want it to be done simply with just ropes and manpower, as first, it's dangerous because of that overhanging over the boundary part and second, the panels will slide and bounce over the whole way up on the face of the building or balconies and that's not practical either.

3,Does this strategy for reservoir tank level sensing seem feasible?,1596906124,"I am working with a couple colleageus on a commercial drinking water purification and dispensing system.  Most of the work so far has been electronic and eletrical automation but one sticking point is we have very little direct insight into the operational status, so we want to start integrating more sensors.

In particular, I want to be able to measure water reservoir tank water column height in order to detect early the conditions of the reservoir fill rate decreasing or the reservoir volume hitting a critical level where we would start pulling air from the reservoir outlet.

First of all, is a pressure sensor a reasonable way to detect the current reservoir tank water volume?  The math seems to work, considering the resolution of measurement I can get from pressure sensors, to be able to reasonably distinguish the water column height in the range of 0-4 meters (currently, we have a tank about 2 meters tall, but it would be reasonable to use ones twice as tall.)

If so, first of all, is there any reasonable way I can try to search for a sensor that can just be installed into the bottom of the reservoir tank?  I found this series of sensors on Mouser that looked great except that no one seems to stock the 126 series which is actually intended for interfacing with drinking water systems: https://www.mouser.com/catalog/specsheets/sensata_10292018_116cp_series_pressure_sensor_datasheet.pdf
They're also fairly expensive, and I live in a poor country.

On the other hand, it's very inexpensive and would be far more convenient to get an IC-based solution like the following: https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/389/dm00140895-1798256.pdf
but in this case, there is no direct way to sense the pressure because this component is obviously not submersible.  Could I reasonably mount it and seal it inside a pipe that would  be used as a pressure sender and mount it vertically atop the reservoir?  I know that condensation would end up being virtually the same non-starter issue as with submerging the sensor.

To this end, a silicone or similar material membrane could be installed just below the sensor and so the sensor would be in a sealed chamber and rely on the weight of the water column pushing up on the air column inside the pipe and the membrane to pressurize the chamber the sensor is in within the sender pipe.  I should then get a reading corresponding to the pressure of the water column which would let me trivially calculate the height of the water column, after calibration for actual current atmospheric pressure versus sea level.

Does this make sense or are there some factors which I have completely neglected?  Will a membrane barrier to prevent ingress of water condensation in my pressure sender pipe introduce any inaccuracy?  Is there an even simpler solution that is obvious if I'm so far unable to find drinking-water-interfacing pressure sensors for any price?  Maybe an off-the-shelf pressure sender component exists?

Thanks for any insight!  I'm new to this sort of automation and so I feel like there is probably some obvious aspect of this I've failed to notice entirely.",AskEngineers,False,electrobrains,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i62jxs/does_this_strategy_for_reservoir_tank_level/

9,What subjects should I take in the meantime (2 months)?,1596896119,"**TL;DR**: 3rd world medical doctor going to study MSc Nanotechnology/nanomedicine in UK starting October, completed fundamental math, phys, and chem courses for a year. In 2 months, **what courses should I study** to help understand **nanotech/medicine and tissue engineering**?

Hello everyone! I am a medical doctor in Indonesia (it's a bachelor's degree here) who has recently been accepted to study MSc Nanotechnology/nanomedicine in a university in UK.

I had been longing to be able to study biomedical engineering or a closely related field. It's a long story of how I get here, but due to the fact that I didn't get any quantitative courses during my undergrad, I had to get a year's worth of math/phys/chem courses by myself (fortunately there was a university that could do that here).

The main problem is that the university that I attended for extra credit does not offer courses in biomedical engineering, yet alone any engineering branch or physics. Therefore I maximised everything that I can take within one year given that constraint. Yet I have gathered the credits for these fundamental subjects, I still haven't understood nanomedicine and tissue engineering concepts.

I have 2 months before my course starts (will be online learning for some time, then I'll be going to the in-person classes). Do you have **any recommendations on what should I be studying (i.e. on edX or other platforms)**, preferably in order? The courses do not need to have credits, though. I need the content and comprehension more than the recognition at this point. I also hope that you can attach the link to the said courses.

My Course History

During the past year, I have studied:

1. Math - Precalc &amp; calculus I (differentials)
2. Math - Calc II (integration)
3. Math - Calc III (multivariable)
4. Math - Linear Algebra I (matrices &amp; vectors)
5. Math - Numerical Methods
6. Math - Computer (algorithms &amp; programming using Pascal and C)
7. Phys - Fundamental Physics I (Newton and beyond, thermodynamics)
8. Phys - Fundamental Phys II (wave, optics, electricity, magnetism) - quantum/modern physics had been omitted in my year's curriculum
9. Phys - Mechanics (in-depth coverage of Newton's laws)
10. Phys - Electronics (components, analogue &amp; digital circuits)
11. Phys - Mathematical physics (mostly diff. equations)
12. Phys - Intro to solid state phys (mostly x-ray and crystal structure)
13. Chem - Fundamental Chemistry (all chemistry topics covered in surface)
14. Chem - Organic Chem I (organic compounds)
15. Chem - Polymer Chem

11,Should I major in Electrical Engineering if I hated circuits in high school?,1596894130,"I love Physics and Math in high school, but the only subject that I hated was circuits. I.E, KVL, KCL, Ohm's law. I found it so unnecessarily tedious. I loved everything else, from thermal physics, to electromagnetism, SHM, etc.

I still don't quite know what I want to do with my life, but currently my main interests are AI, robotics, biotechnology/bioengineering, comp/theoretical neuroscience, and nanotech. I know the bachelors isn't everything, in fact, I'm planning on going to grad school, but if I'm going to spend the next four years studying something I might as well enjoy it. 

I wanted to major in CS, since the courses seemed so fun and I'm already quite good at programming. However, it seems like an EE major will open more doors to the stuff I'm interested in. Plus, majoring in EE will allow me to take higher level physics classes which I will surely enjoy, which I won't be able to do as a CS major. However, compared to a CS major or even an ME major the courses in EE doesn't seem like that much enjoyable to me. Plus, I hated circuits. But it could act as a ""necessary evil"" so that I can have more opportunities to specialize in whatever I am interested in in the future, whereas I'm afraid a CS major will ""lock me"" in the software side forever. 

On the other hand, the math of electrical engineering is what interests me the most. I'm more of a thereotically inclined guy. My math teacher introduced us to some fourier analysis and it was so fascinating. But I dread the circuits!

30,[HELP] Failure Analysis on Fork Dropout,1596859845,"Hello Reddit,

I am working on a mini failure analysis that happened on my ebike recently. I wanted to find the root cause of my failure through some FEA analysis and wanted some feedback if i am on the right track in terms of FEA. 

So with my 2000W electric hub motored electric bike i bought, i was going full throttle and went off a 1 ft jump about 3 times. Based on my calculations, the max torque output from the motor is around 40Nm (skipping a bunch of simple math here - this is based on a 20 in. wheel and \~max 470 RPM and single speed 1:1 gear ratio). Bike weighs around 75 pounds and i weight around 180 pounds. On my 3rd attempt at the jump, the left side (non-drive side) of the axle broke right at where the nut and dropout meet:

 https://imgur.com/uzP2Byg 

Here is the picture of the dropout specs (M14 with a 10mm width on the flats):  https://imgur.com/XDN5c1I 

As you can, see the axle cutout does not match the profile of the steel axle which makes me think that there was a stress concentration on the axle because of the sharp contact point from the flat surface hitting the inner cavity of the dropout, initiating a crack which led to the catastrophic failure. The dropout is also vertical, meaning the axle can slide up or down and is bolted on one end to prevent spreading. 

I performed a non-penetrating Solidworks FEA analysis and modeled the axle shaft and the dropout (4140 Steel and 7050 Aluminum, respectively. Toque of 40Nm on end, fixed the dropout on the top, non pentrating contact sets within the dropout cavity and outer faces of the axle, and fixed the end of the axle (using a fixed bearing) to simulate a nut so cant axially translate.

FEA:  https://imgur.com/W3eMx77 

The questions i have are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The actual axle is sharp on all 4 edges. In Solidworks, sharp corners gave me stress singularities. Do i need to model a larger fillet on the edges so my results can converge even though in real life my axle has sharp corners (it is pretty much an M14 screw that had machined flats on each side). I want to get a quantifiable result. 
2. Solutions - To me these are the solutions i came up with. Let me know if you guys can think of anymore. 
   1. Adding a steel torque arm with the same  profile cutout as the axle and mounted to the aluminum frame. 
   2. Machining radius's around the axle to prevent stress concentrations on the axle corners. Also matching the dropout profile to match the axle profile.",AskEngineers,False,Enricoxg,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i5sqkt/help_failure_analysis_on_fork_dropout/

I won't say what industry I'm currently in, but I can say its on the industrial/commercial side of things, not defense. It is a very techie industry that's growing rapidly as a sector.

I've recently designed several innovative mechanisms that my company has initiated the patent process on. In accordance with company policy, I will be the sole inventor on the patent and the company will be the assignee and retain all IP legally. 

The mechanisms I've designed are a big deal specifically in my industry and are very useful mechanical components for a wide range of applications in other industries. They are the sort of thing you could create a lucrative business on by selling a standard set of sizes along with custom work. 

So here's the trouble. My company will definitely be using the mechanisms in several of our systems, but they hold onto IP very tightly to prevent competition from having opportunities to advance. My mechanisms won't ever see the light of day beyond our systems. 

I'd really like to take these products to the next level, either through licensing or a business. I am hoping to strike a deal with my employer to either buy the patents outright or have a long-term licensing agreement. I would be willing to sign a contract barring sales and licensing to any companies in a competing space. The patent applications are about to be filed. I fully expect the patents to go through, but not for about 3 years or so.

Have any of you been in a similar situation? Any advice for how to approach my employer?

40,"Soil erosion in my backyard, no retaining wall options",1596840886,"We live on a lake and our house and two other houses on our street were built concurrently in 2014 on a tall hill that runs down steeply about ten to twelve feet and I estimate the grade to be maybe 35-40 degrees. The rest of the houses have been there since anywhere from the 1920s to 1950s, so the hill was either extended from their lots using dirt brought in, or the house here previous to this (one large lot had an older house on it that was torn down and parceled into three lots) was already sitting on this hill. So at the bottom of the hill is a strip of land that spans all three of the newer houses, one of them ours, that usually gets flooded over in the rainy season once the lake starts to rise. We are high enough that FEMA didn’t designate this as floodplain, but we have seen clear signs of erosion and we are worried that it won’t be long before we have to do something.

The original people here, the builders, or someone planted buffalo grass (or it just grew on its own) for erosion I am assuming, something I recently learned was a thing but this buffalo grass is a nuisance as it grows tall and it’s really tough on weed eaters. Nothing else but weeds grow on this hill, maybe some young dogwoods are trying, and otherwise where there’s a not a thick patch of grass I’m not sure how to handle erosion. 

We had three different companies give us estimates on retaining walls. Only one of them seemed to have sent out an engineer (or at least someone knowledgeable about engineering retaining walls). This was the last company to come out, and the guy said basically that the soil wasn’t good enough for him to build and guarantee a wall. When I asked him why, he said that he didn’t think he’d be able to anchor deadmen, and he demonstrated what he meant by the soil by taking a soil probe and inserting it into the dirt by our foundation. He put all his weight on it and it wouldn’t go down far, but when he went over near the hill he plunged it in a few inches and was almost able to push it all the way down with two fingers. He also said that sure he could build one, but it would cost us a lot of money and he wouldn’t be able to guarantee the integrity of the work given the soil condition.

This may not be the right place to ask, but does soil improve over time? Is it really that bad that we can’t have a retaining wall ever? Are there other options to abate erosion that look nicer than rip rap? My neighbor has rip rap on his part of the hill and I absolutely hate it, but I suppose if it came down to choosing between further erosion and a hill covered in stones, I’d choose the stones? Just hate to think that the builders built homes on this hill and it didn’t seem to occur to them that people living on top of a hill might experience erosion and want to build a retaining wall for that reason or just because. 

Fake edit: I’m concerned about erosion not just because of a couple areas where it’s clear it’s happening, but also because there is more obvious evidence on the side of our home. The thin concrete slab upon which our A/C unit sits just had to be jacked up a few inches, and nothing grows on that side due to shade and some other reason. It’s devoid of vegetation outside of a few tiny unidentifiable plants, and we know we will probably need a wall there before long.",AskEngineers,False,the_paradox_lounge,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i5o1ot/soil_erosion_in_my_backyard_no_retaining_wall/

44,"Design challenge: a small, quiet pinch valve (...nsfw)",1596838812,"I am trying to build a device that mimics real life. Biomimicry, they call it. It… let’s say it mimics sneezing.

So I have a peristaltic pump able to build a head of pressure in a 4mm OD food-safe silicone tube. I want a pinch valve that pinches the tube closed, then opens it up briefly for the… snot… to shoot out.

I’ve already [replicated this design](https://hackaday.com/2014/09/27/automated-watering-system-uses-neat-diy-water-valve/) using a super cheap standard RC servo. It works! But it’s kinda loud and doesn’t feel like an elegant design. 

The “chopper” pinch valve in that article is pretty great because it detaches the rotational torque from the holding force of the pinch. It’s less great that it needs a fairly large amount of real estate, and doesn’t seem to lend itself to getting a whole lot smaller. (I may certainly be wrong.) It also needs limit switches, and it would be nice to remove those components if possible. (My build with a servo does not currently have limit switches; but it really does need them.)

So: is that “chopper” pinch valve the best design? My mind keeps wandering towards something that would use a spring to be normally closed; but then you’re gonna need more torque to open it.

Also keep in mind that the refractory period between close-open cycles will need to be quick, for... simulating repeat sneezes.

54,"Being overworked, underpaid, and favoritism",1596830416,"This is more of a venting post than anything /:

To start off, I'm a Civil Engineering, studying to take my PE this upcoming October. I worked in DOT for a year and moved across the country where I thought I would primarily be working in Water Resources, but in my 1.5 years here it has mostly been soils/construction type work. 

I've done a ton of construction observation in my time here. I've been the Engineer at a large healthcare project for over a year now, driving around a hour each day back and forth from the site. Lately, I've been the engineer on a water project that is in the middle of nowhere, meaning I have to stay in a hotel whilst there. I did that for a little while and learned I am being sent there again next week for an indefinite period of time. Also, the Contractor has decided they want to work weekends so 7 days a week essentially. Now we have 300+ people in our firm, many engineers, and it seems as if I am always the go to guy being sent to these construction observation gigs. I honestly wouldn't mind it, but I tried to speak to my supervisor on possibility having another younger engineer go out there and he basically shrugged it off. Why? I don't know, but I also tried talking to him about keeping me in the Office since my PE is coming up. I talked to the other girl whose a staff engineer and her excuse for not wanting to go was she had her anniversary coming up... All the PE coursework and textbook costs are not being covered, so I'm also going through myself.

Honestly, I just wanna get out of here. It's not the life for me. I'm flying to another state to take my PE early because I thought it would improve my shot at just working completely in water resources, what I really want to do. I get frustrated about the long hours and long travel of this job, having to go somewhere at the drop of a dime and cancel all my plans. The pay is on the low-end so that's not an incentive either for me, there are graduates coming out of school getting paid more.

56,"At this rate, I don't know if I'll ever be allowed to graduate anymore.",1596827376,"So, a couple of students and I have struggled to get internships for a while. We started our searches very early, saught advice from Career Services and Instructors, and are doing everything in our ability to find something. Typically, in junior year, it's recommended to have the internship done by summer. Unfortunately, as you may know, the pandemic has affected all of our lives across the world greatly.

This summer, our program gave an exception to complete a research opportunity to have that count because of the pandemic. However, unfortunately, some of us have either not taken interest, or have been unable to complete research due to health complications (such as myself). It will only be much more difficult to find something next summer. A co-op is out of the question, it would be best to continue completing the remaining courses we have, in my opinion during their designated semesters.

I fear that we will be unable to find anything and will not be able to graduate because of this. After all, this is required for the ABET accreditation. I find it a little silly to be denied to move on in life, and be defaulted into debt from this one thing. If I had this foresight and realized what I was doing before applying, I wouldn't have chosen engineering. I'm too far along though, and I must unfortunately see this through to the end.

Speaking on my own situation, even if I were to get something, I am concerned about my incompetency. I have gained an absolutely terrible impression of the ""industry"" (as my instructor urges), and I fear I will not be qualified enough to meet expectations. Much is expected even from interns, which I already understood, but especially during this time a lot of things are up in the air. I have already shown struggle with working from home.

My instructor told me students in the past did their internship after their courses, and were allowed to walk with their classmates, but only if they had something lined up. Throughout junior year, I even applied to every single opportunity my instructor found and shared with the class. I feel that even without the pandemic affecting normal life since last March, no one would've wanted me anyways, since I never get any replies to applications or responses to follow-ups either (or I'm met with an automated message and nothing more).

I feel utterly hopeless. I don't know what my instructors will do with me and the rest of us who are still trying to get something.

There are 4 engineers including myself and the rest of the company is production staff so I'm already pretty high up in the chain of command, technically.

The downside is I'm pretty underpaid. I'm talking less than 50k a year, as a mechanical project engineer. And that was after negotiating my salary upwards. I was always told never to accept less than 55k and ideally shoot for 65k for my first job. This is in NY, as a registered EIT.

That being said, the other three engineers have been at this company for 15-20 years and all make six figures. They say if I stick around then I will too but I just can't decide how worth it that is when I could easily be making 60k+ at a (probably worse) company.

I designed this welder to accomodate a heater core through the horizontal-through hole, and the plate will move up and down vertically on rods, with bearings (this in an effort to maintain orthogonality). 

My question is: I intentionally undersized the boss via a factor of 0.99545, to account for aluminum thermal expansion in the bosses (L = 1.89 in, T = 350F). I'm thinking the part needs some relief holes parallel to the heater, to conduct the heat more towards the bosses and away from the bearing through holes.

Over the past month or so, we have been talking with folks on r/AskEngineers, r/careerguidance, and r/EngineeringStudents about patent law and patent law careers.

We come from STEM backgrounds but looked for alternative ways to use our engineering degrees. Luckily, we discovered patent law.

The problem? ***There is not a lot of good info out there.*** We wish we had someone to ask about the career, what it entails, and how to get there. Our peers with a patent professional in the family had a huge leg up throughout the entire journey from engineering graduate to landing a job working in the patent field.

We want other engineering students to have that same opportunity.

We don't think patent law careers are for everyone. But, we think if more STEM majors knew that patent jobs can be both lucrative and rewarding, they would choose that path over a traditional engineering route.

So far, our outreach on reddit has been successful on an individual level, but we'd like to have one thread where everyone can have their questions about patent careers answered.

**Check out the AMA thread on monday; we will answer your questions, dispel common myths, and do our best to de-mystify the patent law career path. We look forward to hearing from you there!**

And if you're looking for information in the meantime, feel free to look through our profile and past comments. We have already answered a ton of common questions there!",AskEngineers,False,PCRM35,/r/AskEngineers/comments/i5ed9g/ama_announcement_engineers_turned_patent/

92,I am looking for advice on choosing an Aerospace undergraduate school,1596771739,"I’m making this thread as a way to brainstorm out loud and hopefully someone can give me some advice or a different viewpoint on things. I am about to get out of the military and will be going to school in the spring. I originally wanted to be a Physics major, since that’s the subject I want to learn about the most, but when I think about what I would want to do as a career I see myself more as designing or building something, which leads me more towards engineering, specifically Aerospace Engineering.

I would be interested in a Physics and Engineering double major, but that's a hard core course load and I’m not sure what practical benefit it would have. I’m thinking with my previous college credits and GI Bill benefits I could spread it out and make it more manageable. Outside of that, I am set on going into an AE program, the only thing I would consider besides AE is an Engineering Science or Physics Engineering program, I’m just not sure how a degree like that would work in the job market. With the economic downturn I have thought about that a lot more recently.

My ideal job would be working on rockets or satellites with one of the “New Space” companies, SpaceX being the obvious example but companies like RocketLab or Relativity also interest me. In a more traditional role, I think light jets like the Vision Jet and HondaJet are really cool. So working for Gulfstream or Cirrus would interest me.

My ideal school would be a small tech school in the southwest or California with strong industry connections. I like living in deserts and mountains so I’d prefer to live in the Western US, but my understanding is that when entering a STEM field the most important thing as an undergrad, besides maybe getting good grades, is the internships and research opportunities you have, so I’m mainly wanting to go to a school surrounded by the Aerospace industry.

So far I have got into Alaska-Fairbanks, UArizona and Arizona State, New Mexico State, Embry-Riddle (the AZ campus), Colorado State, New Mexico State, Iowa State, and Florida Tech. I’m thinking I can pretty much disregard Alaska and Iowa State. I’d love to live in Fairbanks, but I’m guessing I would be way too isolated for any good opportunities in Alaska. Same for Iowa State, I know they are a strong STEM school, but I think the Ames lab there doesn't do much with Aerospace.

As far as schools in the southwest, I think I can go ahead and disregard ASU and UArizona for myself as well. Nothing against the schools, but I’m not sure that they would offer anything that Embry-Riddle or NM State would, but they seem like huge leviathans. NM State seems like it would have lots of opportunity close by with White Sands and Spaceport America. I like Embry-Riddle since it is an aeronautical based school. I’m not sure what's going on in Prescott Arizona but they have their main campus in Daytona Beach, right next to the space coast.

Florida Tech is probably my favorite just based on the school itself, but I don't care too much for the humidity of Florida. But the school being extremely aerospace oriented and right next to KSC keeps me interested.

Colorado State doesn't have an Aerospace degree, but they have an engineering science degree with an emphasis in space engineering. It seems like something I would definitely be interested in, I’m just not sure how competitive I would be in the Aerospace industry or for a masters program with that degree.

I have applied to four CalState schools and CU Boulder, and may also apply to Virginia Tech, Purdue, and Illinois Tech. I have a 2.9 GPA my first time in college so applying to CU and Purdue are kind of Hail Marys for me. Are there any other programs I should look into?

Right now of the places I have got into I think Embry-Riddle is my top choice. It’s small and aerospace oriented, I just feel like their AZ campus is relatively isolated from the Aerospace community. Which I’m assuming could be solved by switching campuses to the Daytona Beach one. I really like Florida Tech as a school too, it’s just hard to convince myself to live in Florida when Embry-Riddle and NM State are still options. Colorado State seems great too, I just feel like I should probably get a real AE degree if I want to work in Aerospace.

If CU Boulder or CalPoly Pomona does accept me should that be my first choice? The only reservation I would have about them is they are big schools, but I think that’s probably out weighted by their location and reputation.

If anyone has any advice or thinks I have the wrong outlook or impression on things please let me know. I only have a fleeting knowledge of the Aerospace industry compared to most of you and am trying to make the best choice to set myself up.

94,Is a Weekend-3rd Shift Opportunity worthwhile?,1596770032,"I apologize in advance for any formatting issues, I am using my phone to post this. 

I currently work 2nd shift as a manufacturing/controls engineer. I started in January of this year, just as I finished college. Today, My boss approached me with an offer to temporarily move my shift to Friday-Sunday. The hours would be 6 p.m.-6 a.m. If I were to accept, I would start in the coming weeks and rotate back to my current schedule at the end of the year. The incentive for the move being a significant raise (upwards of 30%). 

My concern is that this seems more like a tech position and it may hinder my learning and growth as an engineer. Since I am still early in my career, interacting with other engineers and learning from them has been extremely helpful. If I were to take the weekend position, I would be the only engineer on site during those hours. I would also have to suspend, or handoff, almost all of my current projects during my new assignment.

0,Never underestimate the value of training your new hires,1596764374,"I transfered to a new role in another company. At the same time, 3 other people started with me in May. I am now being interviewed by management because the three engineers left and they are considering me a flight risk. They want to know what they can do better. Well, here is my gripe with the team. The lead engineer in my  group is terrible at training new employees. While I am more than capable of figuring things out on my own, there is also a balance between providing the right amount of information that allows your engineers to think and frustrating them to a point that they fail, feel incapable and leave. The only training we had, was to RTFM which is 300 pages long. I did, and I eventually trained myself at the risk of damaging multi million dollar hardware. The other three weren't so lucky. They were more hands on and demonstrations would have given them the chance to excel at the job. The lead engineer was ""too busy"" to train them. They were left to do things on their own and failed constantly. A space vehicle is not a joke! You just don't RTFM and expect them to know what to do. Unfortunately he also trained them as if they knew the same amount of knowledge he had. They were so lost, they didnt even know what questions to ask. I couldn't help but think he had no interest in training them at all. 
When management asked why the new hires left, the lead engineer had the nerve to say, they lacked effort because they always hesitated to run the system. I told management they hesitated because they lacked direction and training from him. As a result, they hesitated because they didn't know what they were doing and didn't want to damage hardware. One of them was so stressed out, he couldn't even sleep. The other guy blew up a piece of expensive hardware because he was not trained properly, I know this because the fucking steps on the manual was wrong! I red lined about 25% of that document. The last engineer probably had the worse fate. After a month, he spoke up and told the lead RTFM is not considered training, especially if the manual contains wrong information.  Well, that created emnity between them and the lead engineer made his life a living hell. Retaliation is hard to prove and he wasn't about to play the politics to get what he wants. He left after 1.5 months. The other 2 left a week in between afterwards. Then there's me. I am stuck trying to do the job of the other three people who just left. I dont know how long I'll stay. All I'm saying is, treat your new hires well. The quality of training they receive will eventually help you in the long run.

Well - they might want to throw it out, but me, the cheapskate wants to fix it. The motor doesn't start, come to find out one bearing near the front has about .010"" of shaft play, and the split-phase motor can't start unless the shaft is stable in the center so the starter windings can start some rotation.

They claim that if doctors could be replaced, many other jobs such as engineers, lawyers, managers etc. could be replaced too. But I don't think this is true.

Anyway, I was born in 1995 to an upperclass family. Went to private school and had this project to make just a basic hoverboard with wood, tarp, and a leaf blower. 

             That’s when it all started, my mother at the time owned a big machining company. Well I wanted to take it a step further and build a board that could actually fly with a human safely riding it. Now obviously my designs were flawed and childish, a snowboard shaped board would be incredibly hard to balance on. But what got to me was my idea to make it fly.

20,Have a Master's in Electrical Engineering then dropped out of a PhD in material's science due to major depression. Now unemployed. Need help to figure out next steps for career.,1596740354,"I'll make a really long story short:

I initially wanted to go into academia. I mean I really wanted to do this. I received a Master's degree in electrical engineering (emphasis in EM) and went to do a PhD because I wanted to go into academia specifically studying semiconducting materials.

I foolishly ignored some warning signs about my own mental health (it doesn't help that I'm autistic) and had a huge mental breakdown two years into it, but I was determined to publish at least one first-author paper which I did. However, during that time I really found I hated working in academia and wanted to transition back to industry.

After that I dropped the program, I got a job as a back-end programmer through a friend which I had until COVID hit. During that time I was trying to look into getting an EE job again.

Unfortunately, it's now been about five years since my EE days and the projects I did do are completely out of my memory and I don't have a ton of home-made projects to show for it. The most recent things I have is some semiconductor physics during my PhD and almost all the jobs I can find regarding that want a PhD for it or want a PhD to go along with it.

While I can't afford to go back to school at this stage, is it possible for me to at least get an internship as an EE which could potentially lead into a full-time job which would help me de-rust my EE skills?

If not, what would you suggest I do?

There is literally nothing productive I can do before they solve. The previous guy wrote a majority of the stress reports.

I feel so guilty.

NASTRAN doesn’t run the CPU as hot as ANSYS does. In ANSYS I can turn up the number of processors and my laptop sounds like a jet engine.

25,I'm a (fairly) recent Chemical Engineering graduate with no real clue what to do now re: finding a job. Help?!,1596736325,"Hola, amigos!

As I mentioned in the title, I graduated in December 2018 with a bachelor's in Chemical Engineering from a top 5 public university. And...that's really the biggest thing I have going for me, at least insofar as resume items go. I never worked an internship, my GPA wasn't at *all* stellar (rough start to college), and I really don't feel confident enough to claim many real skills that employers look for on a resume. Sure, I've written a few technical reports, designed lab experiments, worked as a programming tutor, written/reviewed a couple lab SOP's...but is it really honest to claim something as a skill when I've really only been exposed to it for a semester or two at most?

It's also been a year and half since graduation at this point, and I haven't yet found anything in my field. I took a temp engineering technician role in a pipe certification lab back in February, which wasn't renewed after the six-week trial period because, quite frankly, I suck working with hand tools, evidently (damaged pipe samples tend to incur considerable expenses for the company...). Didn't go very well, but I'm very glad I tried. I've been unemployed since April. Let's just say I'm not a dream candidate (which is what most entry-level online job postings appear to be looking for...)!

Of course, I'm not without redeeming qualities. I performed well in my group and lab-based ChE courses (garnering generally favourable peer reviews), my GPA steadily rose over my last few semesters, and I actually won second prize in a creative writing competition (poetry) for engineers in my last year. I worked for my last three semesters at a grocery store, but then parlayed that work into a promotion within the same grocery company (assistant department manager) a few months after graduation. I work hard, I ask questions, and (I hope!) I'm a generally pleasant person to work with. So all is far from hopeless, of course!

I'm just trying to determine what sort of jobs to look for! It feels like most companies which make online job postings want a finished product. Which I'm not! On any given job posting, even entry-level jobs, I rarely meet more than 75% of the required qualifications, and even then sometimes only tenuously. I don't feel very qualified to work as a full engineer right now, since all of my knowledge and skills, such as they are, are classroom-based. And of course we're in the middle of a pandemic, too, so timing is very non-ideal (much like the gases we discussed in thermo! :).

Maybe it's naive, but my ideal scenario is finding a company which is willing to work with me and train me and invest in me. I'd like to get my foot in the door somewhere, work hard, and become a valuable member of a team. I highly doubt I'll be an asset right away, to be honest, although I very much want to be. I just don't have the experience. I have a lot to learn. And it often feels like that's not what most companies are looking for. Honestly, I don't really know what I want to do, what I might be good at, nor exactly what I'm looking for, and yet it feels like I'm expected to have a clear vision at this point in my life. It's kind of daunting sometimes. I just want to try something and see if I have what it takes to make it in an industry. Sometimes I get depressed and I don't even look at jobs because I feel un-hireable.

I'm looking at technician roles in particular, with an emphasis on anything involving quality control or data analysis (I really enjoyed designing experiments and creating statistical models in my program, probably more than anything else). Although I'm keeping an open mind, and I've definitely been looking at non-technical jobs as well if they seem interesting. I'm not at all set on staying in the ChE field. Chemical Engineering didn't excite me in retrospect, but it was a solid major, and if nothing else it challenged me to become a better problem solver.

Money isn't particularly important to me. As an assistant department head at a grocery store, I made like $450/week after taxes (like $15/hour), which is more than enough for me to live on even with $500/month in student loan payments. I value my free time and health far more than I do a salary. I'm very much a ""work-to-live"" person. I work hard when I'm at work, but I like to leave after 8 hours to go home and live my life. I'm sure it's completely naive, but I'd sooner negotiate on time off than salary. I'd take a pay cut to get more vacation time. Like, I don't care if they're all unpaid, give me five weeks off per year at the beginning. Of course, this is the real world, and no company does that sort of thing.

**Here are my questions for y'all**

\- What sort of job should someone like me be looking for (i.e., not much to put on a resume besides a degree)? What exactly would I be qualified for right now?

\- What are job options / career paths for chemical engineering graduates in particular?

\- What are non-traditional/unorthodox career paths for engineering majors?

\- What can I do to make myself more attractive to potential employers? How should I be approaching the job application process?

\- What have been the most useful skills in your own career journeys? How did you develop them?

\- What advice would you give to myself and other recent graduates trying to enter the workforce?

Also, if any of y'all are willing to chat about your careers with me, I'd love to dialogue! I'm just looking to learn and grow, above all else. I'm also happy to send my resume via DM for constructive feedback if anyone's willing to give it a look. I appreciate any and all advice I receive!

28,Investigating &amp; designing a whole new product for my graduation: I definitely need a mentor.,1596735457,"I'm a mechanical engineering student, doing my bachelor's graduation project currently. We have had a couple of projects previously throughout the university, with which I've noticed that despite my hard work, some aspects that define me as an engineer are rather lacking. Think about team management and particularly in the case of unproductive members, project planning, efficiency, straight going progress in the case of taking on a project, proper, confident, and client-satisfying presentation of progress and plans, etc.

For example, the very last project we did, we had tons of trouble. I took on a leading role in the group and I feel very responsible for the ""what I classify as failure"" of the project. We got graded a passing grade, but if I wanna be honest with myself, we did not deliver anything close to what a functional group would have. We had to design a product for an actual client, and it would have been extremely reasonable to finish all of the project, including the research, conceptualization, design, manufacturing plans, actual manufacturing, and testing and recommendations. It would have been very possible to finish all of these tasks within 4 months and still have one month left over. However, we we barely managed to provide manufacturing reports after 6 months. The product was not as challenging as we made it to be. We wasted lots of time on loopholes, calculations and research that were later discarded as unnecessary. We had to iterate so many times over useless details in our reports because we couldn't give our professors or clients the feeling that our work was of good quality. No matter how much effort we would put into it, every time we made a presentation, we would we would get a ton of remarks and have lots of stuff pointed out. We'd end up re-iterating over useless stuff in our 100+ page report which nobody ended up reading.

You may be inclined to say ""You must be underestimating the size of your project."" No, none of us did. We had to make a very simple product. During that period we've seen other students make other, significantly more complex products for the same client, and get their work done neatly in a way which would leave a smile of confidence on the professors' and clients' faces.

This was due to several reasons: our inexperience, my idiot sandwich decisions, the inactivity of lots of team members and the inability of others to get everybody working, our inability to present progress in a good way but rather in one which would the client think along.. last project taught that you really don't want the client to think along.

At the last 25% of our last project, this dude I know started giving me advice on what to do. He knows I'm a hard worker and he saw me struggling, so he started giving me general guidance on what to do and what to avoid. Sure enough, in this very last part, we made, and I'm not exaggerating, 4x or more progress than in the first 75% combined. We weren't running in circles anymore, we were just progressing forward.

Now I am taking a significantly open-ended project at an actual company for my graduation. I have to look into the possibility of, and design a new product. The product is not very technically challenging in a way which would make it impossible to finish in the given time frame, but because I know both the product and myself, I can see myself spinning in circles forever with this thing and not getting it done. Especially that the requirements are not defined yet, I have to define a reasonable set of them myself. There is way too much room for a nerd like me who used to only solve math problems. That damned mentality of working with the very known and predictable.

I have been busy with the project for a couple of weeks now, and I can definitely tell I need a mentor. The dude from the project is no longer around me. I will ask the professor if he'd like to mentor me when the summer vacation ends (I've started with my project within the summer vacation). But even if says yes, I highly suspect he wouldn't be willing to follow up daily with me and be extensively involved. It might work for a couple of weeks, but eventually the flame will die off. He'll have to deal with tons of exams and reports to correct.

I'll still ask that professor for mentorship, but I'm wondering if you'd have any suggestions on where to search for further guidance. On reddit maybe? In a given association? I am of course asking lots of questions at the company I'm working at, but none of them are project management experts. They wouldn't know how to or be able to offer extensive advice on the laying out of a project and the smooth flow from one end to the other.

Obviously systems that benefit fuel economy and safety etc are beneficial for everybody, but there are an awful lot of things on cars these days (particularly American, from what I've seen) that add a ton of cost for not much function. I've graduated in the last year and am working in manufacturing at a tier 1 supplier to the auto industry, and the number of options that they're offering with cars just baffles me. For the sake of confidentiality, I won't go into too many details. 

With one project we're working on, one of the assemblies has 8 different colors, left and right hand. These are overmold parts too so they require very expensive, proprietary equipment. Other assemblies have 5 or 6 colors, and are constructed of more parts than they need to be. Many of these parts are mask painted (so we only paint a certain area of the visible surface)- we mold a mask, manually clip it onto the part, manually rack it onto the paint line, and then manually un-rack and remove the mask. This is a ton of manual labor. All these colors add an enormous amount of work (and therefore cost, which is passed down to the consumer). The final product is beautiful, but it could cost significantly less if there were only 2 or 3 colors and it would still look great. A lot of cars these days seem to be very much form over function.

Sorry if this was a lot of text, and if anybody who's worked in business/sales cares to weigh in, feel free to. I'd expect that what marketing wants to work with butts heads with what the engineers want to work with, and I'm curious how their wants/needs are weighed against each other.

If I was given enough time and more knowledge I could have definitely produced something decent.   


Long story short I've switched to Electrical Engineering, I do really enjoy tinkering with arduinos and doing stupid things with microwave transformers (I don't do it anymore since I've done basic circuitry and realize what 2.2kV actually means lol).

So for background, I graduated from college with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and ended up getting a job as a Project Engineer at a civil infrastructure construction company. This wouldn't have been my first choice, but I did not have a lot of projects/experience by the time I graduated and it ended up being my only job offer. I've been in my current position for just over a year and on most days do not enjoy the work as my passion is in the aerospace sector. The pay is not great for an engineer ($45k) but they do have full medical/company vehicle benefits. I've tried throughout the past year to apply for jobs in the aerospace industry while working, but only have had a few interviews and never made it further than that. 

So for the question in the title. I am strongly considering quitting my job and going to pursue a Masters degree in Aerospace Engineering. This is not only to improve my resume and chances of getting a job in the space sector, but also as an opportunity to industry hop. I've found it really difficult to get companies in aerospace to take a second look at my resume because as of right now the only professional experience I have is in civil construction. This may just be in my head, but I know the aerospace industry is pretty competitive so I definitely see it as a disadvantage. 

Would it be better for me to hold on to my current position and continue to apply to entry level positions or jump ship and pursue a Masters degree?

These are common for say the balancing of rotating equipment or the distribution of fuel loads through multiple engine positions (i.e the fuel nozzles). Essentially what they do is take a data set, sort from high to low and then distribute each data point to a set position for installation on the turbine. This provides an even spread of the data throughout all positions, meaning it is effectively balanced.

My problem being that we have cheat sheets set up for specific numbers of positions and if we needed to tackle anything out with that I'm not familiar with the science behind the sheet itself.

55,"How should I change my career path as an Electrical Engineer to incorporate more programming, modeling, and theory expanding even outside of EE?",1596694385,"**TLDR:**

    How do I set a new course in my career where I can blend my interests in programming, simulation and modeling, with my original field of study in EE plus my interests in things like thermodynamics, automation, algorithms and so much more than EE alone? 
    
    + I like programming more than I like hands-on work. 
    + I like designing circuits more than I enjoy building them. 
    + I enjoy developing closed-formed solutions / algorithms over troubleshooting
    + I enjoy the math and analytics that enable someone to do their job more efficiently. Providing a toolset.
    + I feel too constrained by EE and wish I could be more multidiscplinary and work across STEM fields developing solutions mathematical in nature.

I am an electrical engineer working in analog hardware development for 4 or so years now. The position started as my dream job, but over time, I have discovered I am becoming more and more exhausted by the work and finding very little satisfaction in what I do. My day is comprised of hands-on lab time where I'm either validating or troubleshooting designs, simulating models in SPICE, or rapidly prototyping designs to circumvent issues. Ultimately, the dream job for a hardware designer.

During quarantine and having to work from home, however, I have had the good fortune to not only be closer to my loved ones but also pick up python to develop a flexible GUI test automation environment I had been envisioning for months. I didn't realize I would enjoy programming so much and discovered my focus and draw towards my work became almost an obsession - something I found both exhausting yet very refreshing, which is funny when I think about it. While I had taken classes such as data structures, algorithms, C and java in the past, I never really took programming too seriously since I felt I was destined for analog design while programming served a means to an end. The thing is, this recent work wasn't the first time I had enjoyed programming. I was in a business class during my first year where we developed calculators and models that had a GUI component. I loved it, but I didn't want to go down a path in GUI development and still don't, really.

In my day-to-day, I jump at the opportunity to develop all types of closed-form solution calculators for some problem I'm solving. I love developing closed-form solutions; perhaps more than the problem itself that I'm trying to solve. I like knowing someday I can come back to that calculator and easily pop-in my parameters and spit out a solution. A good example similar to this type of calculator would be Texas Instrument's WebBench online service where you can readily use DCDC designs with minimal fuss for the engineer to implement. Probably why I get burnt out of troubleshooting and design validation because, in my mind, the design was already proven to succeed and I want to move on to the next design problem. Don't get me wrong, in practice, so much can affect the operation of a ""verified"" design. Switch noise, impedance matching and reflections, and CMRR in op-amps, for instance, are all issues I enjoy from the analytical standpoint and not so much the hands-on, ""let's see if this works"" type of lab work.

I have always loved math and problem-solving and when I first started school, I was lost as to what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to solve analytical problems. After maybe switching my degree 5 times, I finally settled on electrical engineering, not for the application, mind you, but exclusively the abstract theory and synthesizing. I felt the math in EE was the most approachable; I hated lab time, but just loved the math concepts, theory, and simulation. In fact, my interest extends past EE as well. I wish I could solve more mechanical-related problems such as in thermodynamics, for example, and wish I could have taken more classes on the subject. Doubly so, while I was taking my relativity courses, I just loved the math involved. My point is, I feel so restricted in what I can do and I wish I could expand more on math concepts that I apparently now want to apply programming to both solve and present to a user. I have considered going to grad school to hone myself in a particular direction, but I'm not sure if school is the answer or even a practical means for accomplishing what I want unless there was a practical outcome. 

How do I set a new course for my career where I can blend my interests in programming, EE, simulation and modeling, thermodynamics, and so much more I haven't even yet explored? I have looked at Data Science programs available, but I wasn't sure if this is specifically the industry I would want to enter or is necessarily checking the right boxes. Hell, perhaps I don't completely understand all what data science encompasses. Sounds like this degree primarily focuses on statistics unless you can find a program that weighs heavier towards comp-sci and mathematics.

80,Graduate school or Bootcamp?,1596662815,"Career trajectory question

I need help figuring out what career path to take. 

Background:
I have a degree in mechanical engineering and upon graduation landed a contract position at a large automotive OEM. I’ve been there about a year working as a process engineer helping with new program launches and have really enjoyed it and learned a lot. However, I can’t help but notice the direction the job market is going, i.e. big data, AI, software engineering, etc.  

I am in the process of applying to graduate school for a masters in electrical / computer engineering with a specialization in controls with the idea to work as a robotics / controls engineer. Although the pay is higher than a process engineer, its not much higher. Given that, I have begun to look into data analytics bootcamps seeing the numerous job postings for data analytics type jobs. The bootcamps require significantly less time and money than graduate school, and based on google searches seem to have a good job outlook for entry level roles in the data analytics field. 

My question: 
I have been talking with my family and they suggest considering going the controls and automation route, as I would gain a masters degree which may impact promotions down the road, and it’s a more established field. Would I be limited in my options in going the Bootcamp route in jobs? I know in the engineering field if you have a degree in engineering technology you can be limited in your job search, so I was curious if there is a similar limitation with bootcamps. 

Bottom line: 
With a degree in mechanical engineering I have two choices:

A.) Masters in electrical/ computer engineering ($20,000, 18-24 months, Purdue University) 

B.) Data science Bootcamp ($10,000, 7 months, Vanderbilt University)

I understand that I can calculate the flow rate for the fluid leaving the vessel through the 3"" diameter nozzle for any instant but that flow rate will change as hydrostatic head decreases.

87,My roles and responsibilities have far exceed what they were when I was initially hired and I feel that I'm being underpaid. Unfortunately now is the worst time to discuss it because of Covid. I could use some advice,1596658160,"I graduated about 2 years ago and was hired by an appliance company right after. The product we make at my facility is going through a complete architecture overhaul and a huge investment from corporate was made to make this happen. Without going into to much detail the product we've been making had a lot of parts and had a very manual assembly process. The new product uses a third to half of the parts and was designed to be assembled with automation.

My job when I started was to be a 3D designer and CAD guy for the team. I would work with the various subproject leaders to turn their ideas of how a robotic cell or assembly line into something that could use as a base for suppliers that would eventually build it. It wasn't a difficult job and was fairly straightforward. Over the first year I spent time learning the product and different assembly techniques and was given more freedom on design. To the point where a project leader would email me an idea with no drawing and I would model and simulate it.

In November of last year we had two project leaders leave and the project engineers that were under them were promoted to take up the work. I was asked by the global director of manufacturing to take up responsibilities for one of these projects and help another one until replacements could be found. They replaced one of the engineers for one project, but not the one I was responsible for.

Since then I have seen my workload and responsibilities grow exponentially. I'm now not only acting as a project engineer for two additional projects, but I am running two of my own as well. One of the projects I inherited, but another I started from day 1 detailing the scope of it and I just had the kickoff for it last week. 

The issue is that I am still responsible for all of the cad work for all projects and at any time someone could message me and ask me to fully develop a 3D model or something else in line with my original job description. It's beginning to really hamper my development because I can't focus as much on my main projects where my decisions and judgement could serious impact the results. 

My boss is in charge of the whole manufacturing side for this project, so I barley see him let alone talk to him. I feel like a lot of the work I do goes unnoticed by him because of it. He's given me praise and says that I've met the expectations of the tasks I've been given, but I feel I've earned an increase in pay and ideally a change in position to project engineer.

There is another person on our team who has a job similar to mine, but he deals with laying out the new factory and such and is only a few years older than me. About a year ago I discovered that his salary is about $12,000 more than me and I know he is not involved with the projects the way I am. He does have discussions with them to see if there are any updates to machine layouts, but that's about it. No real project management and engineering.

Engineering being my first option though I am not sure I'll enjoy it as much. I have done A level Biology, being the subject that intrigues me the most and I find the most interesting, however I enjoy maths as well.

I have heard there is a possibility to change courses during the first two weeks. I am considering Biomedicine but I have some doubts.

Engineering provides a greater range of job opportunities than Biomedicine and the Biomedicine ones don't appeal to me as much either, specially since I don't see myself in investigation, or at least not yet, which is what I've heard the largest proportion of grads and up doing.

This is why I thought I could do engineering and then specialize and do a masters in something more biology related but I am still not sure this is the best idea or if it's worth taking the risk.

I am a recent graduate from the state university’s college of engineering, holding a BS in Civil Engineering. For our senior design project, I worked with a team of 12 others on creating a mixed-use development plan for a large parcel. As part of this, I did the site layout, storm water management design, sewer design, and utilities layout. 

Tomorrow, I have an interview with a local firm that works on a variety of commercial and residential development projects. They are looking for someone to do CAD work with a focus on stormwater management. I have been informed that I will have to take a CAD test as part of the interview process. 

They were ideally looking for someone with 2 years experience, but I got my foot in the door with the help of someone working for a global recruiting firm.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Finance about 10 years ago and worked as the accountant at a small local hotel for a few years post graduation. I didn’t love my job and I was very young, the pay wasn’t great and I had worked as a bartender while in school and made more money and had more fun so I just went back to bar tending. Fast forward a few years and I’m getting married and trying to settle down and bartending just isn’t conducive to that lifestyle. A satellite campus of a major state university that is local to me started an engineering program so I decided to go back to school. I graduated in May with a B.S. in Industrial Process Engineering, top of my class Cum Laude. I continued to work as a bartender while in school, full time, and was unable to obtain any internships while in school. Mostly it was impossible for me to find the time to add an internship in with full time school and full time work and I could not give up my job. I needed the insurance it provided and also the income. I’ve spent all summer applying for jobs like crazy. I’ve had one company contact me and I went through the interview process with 3 separate interviews but was eventually told they went with someone with experience. The large chain hotel I have been bartending at the last 5 years offered me a position as the accounting manager, and with the current state of the food and beverage industry I decided to accept that offer as it’s more stable income. I was contacted last night by a local production company to interview tomorrow for a production supervisor position. I don’t know if I will even get the production supervisor position, but is that a good move to further my career? Any advice on how to land this job and really excel at this interview?

31,How do home solar power sale systems avoid grid backfeed hazards?,1596602568,"I've been wondering a bit about grid safety.

Here's my understanding: the customer's power grid connection is usually a single system, with each customer being connected through a breaker.  Customers generating their own power without proper precautions can be dangerous, because if the customer connects their own generator and the grid to the same system (e.x. plugging a generator straight into the wall), the generator will power their house, and the house will power the grid, and that might be a danger to line workers if the power company needs the grid to be electrically dead in order to do work, and has activated all of their own interlocks.

I know that the simplest solution, is a safety interlock - a special switch that connects the house either to the grid or the customer's own backup generator, but never both.

But I'm also aware of systems that don't do this.  For instance, some grids will buy power from home customers (e.x. solar systems / powerwalls).  This requires connecting a customer's generator to the grid.

Hopefully I'm good to post this here!   
For a project I'm working on (im not an engineer) I need to utilise a working mechanical animal skull.

It wouldn't need complex motion, just the ability to come down and then back up again, preferably in a pivot from the back of the jaw.   

I can provide the skull that would be used, so really I'd be hiring somebody to rig it up with something (hydraulics?) to give it the motion. About 10 tons of pressure. The weight of said skull shouldn't matter, I just need it moved with the specific amount of pressure.

33,Current position has nearly 0 workload and I’m worried my employment isn’t justifiable,1596597028,"Hi, r/AskEngineers,

I’m a junior engineer working for one of the larger defense firms on a pretty high-profile program. I came on board with this company earlier this year after leaving our larger competitor for higher pay, and to that end I’ve been well satisfied in this position (the switch came with a promotion and 33% bump in salary). 

Unfortunately, it seems like management overestimated how much work the team had ahead of us when they posted the req I was hired under, and now I’m finding myself spending ~9 hours a day checking stocks, studying for grad school, or reading the news because I can’t scrape up enough actual work to do. I’ve brought this up to my boss multiple times but I’ve been told this is the way things are at the moment. I’ve floated the idea of taking on stretch assignments from other teams, and have even reached out to other managers explaining my situation and asking if I can take on some tasking from them, but that’s gone nowhere as well. I’ve asked other members of my team if I can take over some of their tasks, but nobody has anything they’re willing to pass along to me. Even our summer intern is more engaged at the moment than I am. Nothing has helped, and I feel like I’m running out of options for keeping myself occupied and (quite frankly) justifying the salary they’re paying me. 

I’m not exactly in a position to leave the company as I’m obligated to stay on for a couple of years to pay back tuition assistance and a sign-on bonus.

41,What adhesive or technique (welding?) can I use to permanently bond / fuse a plastic lid strap to my plastic cooler?,1596589320,"[My cooler](https://www.coleman.com/all-coolers/hard-coolers/70-quart-coastal-xtreme-series-marine-cooler/col_3000001845_pr/COL_3000001845) didn't come with a lid keeper ([like this one](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717dOM7XA6L._AC_SL1500_.jpg),) and I can tell that the hinges are going to fail without one.  Since there are no built-in mount points meant to accept screws, simply screwing a lid keeper into the thin plastic will not work well.  

So my options as I see them are:

1. Just use it until the hinges fail; how very un-DIY.  This isn't an option for mean - it'll bother me too much.
2. I could attach a strap of some sort using glue on the outside.  The force, instead of pulling the strap away from the cooler, would pull it against the cooler, or, at worst, along the cooler, both of which are less stressful than pulling away from the cooler, as the inside mounting would do.  The issue is that the strap would likely snag people or things as it is being carried, walked by, shifted, packed, etc, and would be extremely unsightly to boot.  I would rather avoid an outside strap.
3. I could drill clean-through the cooler and use bolts, washers, and some... idk, probably Amazing Goop to try and keep moisture from getting into the holes I create.  As you all know, fighting moisture is usually a losing battle though, and this could eventually result in the cooler getting water inside the walls and growing mold.
4. I could try to find a plastic strap [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Igloo-Plastic-Length-Coleman-Coolers/dp/B00076WOZ6/) and glue it (or weld it) to the cooler.  If I can figure out a way to permanently weld or fuse a strap like this to the cooler, I believe it will be my best bet.  I foresee several potential issues though.  First, I'm not sure that any glues would actually stick to the cooler for any appreciable amount of time.  Second, I could probably get a wood burner and try to melt the cooler a bit, and the strap a pit and then put them together, but I'm not sure if they'd even bind to each other, since they're obviously different plastics.  
5. This is an extension of #3, but I've read about glues that essentially melt plastic and allow the attachment to happen by two pieces of plastic melt into one and then re-solidify.  My concern is similar to #3, and most of the discussion I've seen on those types of glue are in model building forums - not exactly as strenuous as the conditions I'm talking about.
6. I could try some sort of double sided VHB tape.  I use a popsocket on my phone and I'm always amazed at how aggressively the VHB tape stays good for regardless of my constantly playing the with the popsocket.  That's a plastic to smooth TPU case, and although it's not as difficult to bond as the cooler is likely to be, it's still perhaps a consideration.  Maybe even a combination of VHB to attach, and then perhaps I could form a shell of some sort of glue, epoxy or cement around each attachment point as reinforcement?

My preference is choosing option 5 or 6, with option 4 coming in right behind those choices.  The issue is that plastics have low surface energy, and naturally repel any sort of bonding.  I know some stuff like Scott Weld advertises the ability to bond, but from what I've read that may not be all that accurate, and I suspect that the repeated impacts of pulling the mounted strap away from the surface would cause it to fail relatively quickly.  Then again, who knows - like I said, the 3M VHB that popsocket uses (not sure what type it is) is incredibly resilient.

I'm honestly pretty out of my depth here, and really need some suggestions about adhesives, plastic fusing, and so on.  If you have an alternative suggestion outside of 1-6, that's fine too - I'm open to other solutions.  Any help is appreciated!

45,Medium range high frequency/accuracy distance sensor,1596580185,"Hi,

I am looking for a distance sensor, but I can't find anything suiting my needs : - Measured distance has to be between the sensor and a reference point (for instance with a radio emitter and receiver) but the sensor should not have to be aimed at the reference point. - Range of distance : below 1m - Precision : &lt; 0,1mm (if line of sight is not obstructed) - Measurement frequency : &gt; 10kHz 
Ideally, I would like to be able to test it first on an arduino board for prototyping.

I looked at LIDAR, ToF, IR, ultrasonic, RFID transponder, but nothing seems to fit my needs. LIDAR needs to be aimed precisely, ToF, IR and ultrasonic will fail if there is anything close to line of sight (even if line of sight is not obstructed) and RFID seems to require much closer proximity.

I am not really constrained by power requirements as it's not wearable per se.

Use case would be to get precise positionning of the hand of an operator along a fixed dimension (with high frequency)
- regardless of the rotation of the hand
- even without long term line of sight availability from any practical point in space (the operator might move)
- in outdoor and strong light settings

I have a 10-32 STI that I’ll be needed to plug.
I am no longer using this threaded hole in my aluminum plate and I’ll be needed to plug it up to cover it.

I plan to reamer the hole out (threaded hole) then using the same material as my plate to use a rod to perform a press fit to plug the hole.

47,Are the Egyptian pyramids just a grain elevator?,1596575326,My family just finished the wheat harvest a short nit ago and I couldn't help but wonder if those pyramids and their chambers are just like these older grain elevators. When you look at the diagrams of the interior..the shafts are slanted and their is even a slanted shaft underground that looks likes a slanted floor with a grain hopper coming out of it. Egypt was known for it's wheat and they found boats buried by the one pyramid and the sphinx reminds me of a dog protecting the golden treasure of wheat. The boats could float the wheat out for trade on the Nile. Perhaps later on they were retrofitted with fancy tombs? If ya google old grain elevator diagrams you will see the similarities when compared to the pyramid shaft diagrams. So maybe the chambers stored different types of grain or types of wheat? One article says they have found voids which is what happen when wheat is partially emptied from below and those voids are a suffocation hazard. Maybe they stopped using it to store grain when defeated in battle or others started to grow their own?

Also, why would smartphones use Quad Bayer sensors?",1596573830,"I know the latest smartphones use Quad Bayer sensors. They create confusion among laymen. I know smartphone users often complain about insufficient dynamic range and low light performance. I observed that some digital cinema cameras from Panasonic, Sony, Red and others have two base ISO settings. I noticed smartphone makers market around ability to collect light efficiently while cinema camera makers market around looking great at high starting ISOs like 800. Smartphone cameras generally have a low starting ISO. I know the Red cameras have one gain setting (with one exception) while the tones are remapped after the A/D conversion. The RAW numbers stay the same on Red. A compromise I thought of was to have the analog gain and output tone mapping adjusted in real time.

What's stopping smartphone camera makers from using Dual Gain Output (DGO) and dual base ISO? What's stopping having a hybrid system where the ISO is one thing then ""push/pull"" factor is applied automatically or manually? Does the base ISO and gain applied affect power consumption? Why would they instead use Quad Bayer sensors? What are some reliable sources that talk about digital imaging? I'd like to avoid popular beliefs that are not accurate.

1) How do I find the figures specifying the yield strength of a plastic pipe with a certain amount of backfill on top of it

I'm adapting a PC case to my specific needs (I like big fans). 

I've got a case with 2 front mounted 200mm fans, and I want to swap these for 2 x 240mm fans. I'm going to have to build a duct between the top fan and the original hole for the top fan. 

I'd like for the duct to offer minimum air resistance, in order to maximise airflow for any given power setting on the fan. I expect the total length of the duct to be 100mm. So far, my plan is to devote a quarter of this distance at the front and back of the duct as straight-tube, then the middle half as curving and reducing. In my mind, I imagine that having a straight section before any adjusting section will stop the air buffetting into or out of the adjustment, and stop unnecisary turbulance. Is this correct? I imagine the end product to look smooth and nice, like the intake on a static turbine engine.

How would you design a duct for this situation, or do you know of an off the shelf component that's within a dremel-session of these dimension? Also, am I overthinking this problem? Would a box with two holes in it be fine for this application?

Is there an affordable meter (or form of calculation) I can use to determine this measurement?

- Our client wants some form of sensor to validate this % compaction, so calculations alone are not sufficient for them.
- We will be burying irregularly shaped rock samples under the sand, buying sand in bulk, and the planter boxes are quite large.  Thus, it's not very practical to measure the weight of the sand, meter it out, or assess the remaining volume left in the planter box.

82,Why doesn't Fusion 360 worm wheel mesh correctly?,1596539274,"I'm trying to insert worm gears from the Mcmaster-Carr insert tool in Fusion 360 but the gears don't mesh correctly. 

I chose both the worm and worm wheel to have 12 pitch and a 20:1 gear ratio (picture shown)

From [https://khkgears.net/new/gear\_knowledge/gear\_technical\_reference/calculation\_gear\_dimensions.html](https://khkgears.net/new/gear_knowledge/gear_technical_reference/calculation_gear_dimensions.html) I see that the center distance between worm and worm wheel is (worm pitch diameter + worm wheel pitch diameter)/2 (picture shown)

85,High refresh screen vs power consumption,1596530545,"Hi. So we are seeing more and more High Refresh Rate (HRR) monitors in phones, smartwatches, computer and such. Its mostly in mobile units I am thinking of as we only have a battery to be dependent on there. But how does HRR effect the power consumption? 

From my POV there are 2 things this affects:

1) More demand from CPU+GPU which is the biggest impact as going from say 30-120fps needs to draw 4x as pixels in the same amount of time.
2) the screen controller which needs to update faster.

The brightness wont change consumption because of refresh rate as the same amount of power is used because the diaplay needs to have the same backlighting on the same amount of time.

These are just my thoughts/hypothesis. Its important to note that I dont know anything about these things as I am not an engineer. Just tech/STEM interested). So plz educate and correct me :-)

I see fx Apple using LTPO display in their Watch series 5. Which is at 60hz/fps but then will go down to 1hz when you arent looking at it.

But does the controller really take that much amount of power? Isnt it mosly the CPU+GPU power you save on as you only need to draw 1 frame vs 60 frames?

I need the opinion of experienced engineers who can tell me which specialization might be more interesting and also the job oportunities within Europe (or the world) as I want to move outside from Spain, where I am right now.

My first internship was in a Glass manufacture within the continuous improvement area, doing Lean Manufacturing, helping technicians, Kaizen... it was interesting, I learnt a lot a bout the plant and I kind of miss the days right now, as I am on a office job. I am now doing the maintenance manuals for aircraft, although it is interesting I miss some action or even, creativity. I want to change paths.

In the Uni I was involved in a Motostudent team (Like FSAE or Formula Student but for motorbikes) managing the Fairing area, where we designed and manufactured the fairing and I loved it. CAD, 3D printers, milling machines, carbon fiber... I really enjoyed it.

In resume: In my very short experience, I am in between Design/Manufacturing or Maintenance. Both I like, I guess design more, but I am not sure about the number of opportunities in each area. I am not sure how many design oportunities are, or which pays more.

For example: All other things being equal, do two, 150hp engines on a boat produce the same experience as one, 300hp engine?

By same experience I'm talking things like top speed and acceleration.

I cannot find a clear answer to this anywhere.

It seems to me that they're not equal and the single, larger engine would go faster.  But I just watched a YouTube video where the guy seems to think they're comparable.

Here's my thought process: if a 150hp engine has a theoretical max speed of, say, 45mph, having two engines shouldn't magically increase your top speed.  I can see acceleration increasing, and, maybe due to drag and other mechanical inefficiencies I can see that maybe you'll get closer to the theoretical max of 45mph.  I don't see how adding x amount of 150hp engines will get you faster than 45mph, unless I'm completely missing something, or I just don't understand how/what horsepower is measuring.

Also, it seems like a 300hp engine would have a higher max speed (all things being equal) than a single 150hp engine. In that case, my above argument should apply, and additional 150hp engines don't increase your max speed.

Again, I can't find a direct answer anywhere, but many YouTubers seem to heavily imply at least, that these would be equivalent boats.  But I've not found a direct answer one way or the other.

5,(Crossed) Gage R&amp;R and Linearity &amp; Bias study - Am I interpreting my results correctly?,1596498095,"Tagged mechanical because there isn't a ""quality"" tag, and I think mechanical would be the next closest. Last paragraph is pretty much a tl;dr, while the main body gives details on what combinations of results I got. 

I'm working on a Gage R&amp;R and Linearity and Bias study to check the performance of our instant measurement system - using measurements from an optical comparator as the reference dimensions needed in the linearity and bias study. For these, I used 30 parts, 3 operators, 3 replicates, and checked eight different features on each part. I made a separate file for each feature. 

My results are kind of all over the place, with five of the eight features showing high variation in both repeatability and reproducibility. They also show large min/max bias (large enough that it would pass parts that are out of tolerance). Of these five, one has an R² value of 80%, but still has a large bias. The rest have very low R² values and high bias. 

Of the remaining three:

One has low variation in both repeatability and reproducibility, but also a low R² value and high min/max bias. The other two have low variation in reproducibility, but high variation in repeatability. One of these has an R² of 83%, and the other is low. Also, of these three, two have high min/max bias, while the other has a decently low min/max bias of ±0.001.""

All 8 have a P value of 0, which Minitab's website tells me means I can't use average biases, and have to look at them individually. They also all have slopes ranging from -1 to -0.35.  Finally, when looking at the gage run charts, none of the bias appears to be limited to a single operator (none are consistently biased high or low, or have a greater frequency of outliers). 

So, since none of these show a combination of low variation in repeatability, reproducibility, high R², and low bias, my conclusion is that the instant measurement system is not an acceptable measuring device for any of these part features.

Am I on the right track? Is there anything else I should be looking at, or am I overestimating the importance of any individual result?

14,Mechanical Engineer Career Difficulties,1596487670," 

Long story short, I took all my classes in undergraduate level and passed with semi-flying colors 3.5 gpa. I'm still struggling to do design work out of college and was wondering if someone had resources.

1.) Asked me to design a small bridge using 2 rectangular sections orthogonal to each other with dimensions 2""x12"". I used the 2"" on the ground and 6"" in the vertical direction because the section modulus would be significantly higher with stiffness and reduce the stress in the top and bottom of the rectangular section more than just increasing the area and going horizontal since the I = 1/12bh\^3 it would cube the height for reducing the stress in the bending equation omega = Mc/I. Also this is what I was taught in my statics classes. PE laughs, reports me to my boss and says I'm not competent while I was already feeling imposter syndrome as it was my first project with the company. What am I missing that I ""should've known"" in this situation? Transverse shear stress also wouldn't be the likely failure based on my class exercises. Teacher had recommended just looking at the allowable stress in bottom and top of plate with a safety factor of 3+. 

2.) Struggling to develop with motors and have very limited experience. Trying to understand how to go with multiple unknowns and spec the right motor. School had no mention of the RMS torque, intermittent and continuous torque on the charts. PE in above situation would also think less than they did based on the other interaction and I feel like absolute shit and mocked in the company. I was really looking for a mentor but no one in this company is supportive and seem to act like the PE. Right now I've designed the load and hand calculated the mass moment of inertia of the system and will add in the motor inertia. I wasn't sure if I can use parallel axis theorem for the gear train shaft and loads... Can you get the data in solidworks for the mass moment of inertia(Wasn't sure if this was just polar moment of inertia in mass properties) and then can size the motor + gearbox through a recommended website or some formulas. School was too equation fed where everything was known except for 1 variable. It seems significantly different than sizing and designing everything myself and I'm struggling where to start. All I can reference is T=alpha\*mass where alpha is the acceleration rate and I could derive the necessary velocity for the application through calculus though I'm a bit rusty. I would have to size it through operating torque and power correct? I forgot how to convert the load I've found into a power requirement for the motor. Looking for references and guides on this as I really didn't learn how to do this properly in school. 

3.) Likely switching companies as I don't think engineers should act like this PE.

Daily job alerts, customized cover letter for each application, working on a jet engine project to continue learning 

Networking with managers at companies via virtual meetings (however I’m at a loss on how to follow up without straight up saying give me jobo)

Hello guys,

So I tried to install Abaqus student version 2017 (and later 2019 when the previous one did not work). I do everything demonstrated in the “Installation guide” and the installation seemed to have gone okay. But when everything is over, I can’t see the software or the software icon no matter how I search. I don’t know what I have done wrong or maybe I’m misunderstanding something as I am new to this.  
I have attached some screenshots…

I’ve always been interested in mechanical engineering because I love figuring stuff out and I’ve always liked math growing up. My main question is, is it worth it to get my bachelor’s and start at the bottom of the ladder somewhere and work my way up to a manager level (I’ve lead and managed people before so it’s something I’m interested in doing too). I’d expect the whole thing to take a decade or so depending on the company. The other consideration I have is, of course, the pay. Where I’m currently at, it’s not difficult to hit six figures as a technician. In a few years I can definitely make well into that every year since we are basically commissioned based and we have the work flow.

At the end of this semester I have to decide my major. I am torn between Electrical and Mechanical engineering. I absolutely love tech and would like to continue in it. My only apprehension with EE is I want to be able to build things. For example, in my off time I’d love to be able to tinker in my garage and build something, let’s say a robot, or a drone. Shoot if my son runs up to me and says dad your an engineer let’s build a friggin iron man suit!! I could turn around to say, “son there’s only one response. To the lab!” This leads me to think that ME would be more useful but I can’t seem to let go of my joy for electronics. I would love to be able to build something, design the electronics, program this object and watch it come alive.

32,Question about grounding for off-grid solar generator,1596467782,"Hi all.  I'm installing a solar generator at my father's property and had a question about grounding.  He lives in the mountains, so the soil is pretty rocky, so I'm guessing I should probably run more than one ground rod to try to get better conductivity.  Also, I was going to install an electrical outlet that will be powered from an inverter and was wondering if simply grounding the metal shielding of the outlet fixture to the ground rods would be okay.  The reason I'm piggy backing off of an inverter is because this outlet will be controlled by a relay to automatically turn stuff off and on.  Do you run into the same safety hazards by running an outlet off an inverter that you would with daisy-chaining power strips?  The outlet comes in a pre-built outdoor enclosure that just happens to have an outlet in it with a typical 15 amp power cord that you would normally plug into an AC wall receptacle.  


And as far as the solar generator grounding, would just hooking the negative terminal of the battery bank to the ground rods be suitable?  I'm more of a low-power DC electronics guy, so I'm somewhat familiar with working with it, but by no means an expert so I was hoping to get some feedback here.

It's a solid job, but I want to keep learning and find something I enjoy the day-to-day of more and that isn't too stressful.

The thing I enjoy the most is designing injection molded parts, considering how the tool would be made, where the gates/ejectors would be located, materials, surface finish, designing around sink marks etc. I really enjoy the finer details that go into these parts. The problem is, my job doesn't give me a lot of opportunity to do that. I don't design a ton of parts, it's usually just paperwork and making slight adjustments to things for marginal improvements.

During my job I work a lot with the suppliers for our injection molded parts. The people I talk to are usually ""project engineers"" or similar. They are the ones that design the tool to make our parts, design any fixturing necessary, fine tune processing parameters, and often suggest design changes to our parts to improve them for injection molding. I have always thought a job at a place like that would be really enjoyable. Does anyone have experience in a position like that? I'm curious how the career path looks from a work-life balance and career progression standpoint.

As a side note about myself, when I graduated two years ago I had strongly considered working towards a masters degree for polymer science because I enjoyed the undergrad classes.

I love what I study and I know with every fiber in my being I want to be an engineer. However, I have no idea what my life as an engineer after university will actually look like.

My university offers several ""concentration areas"" that would carry over to my Master's Degree. These concentrations are:

Signal Processing and Communications - I actually have very little interest in this

Biomedical Devices - same, little interest 

Power and Energy Systems - classes like Energy Conversion, Power Electronics, Control of Electric Power. To my understanding this would push me towards a career in power grids and possibly green energy. 

Energy Fields and Devices - classes like Applied Electromagnetics,  Energy Conversion, Integrated Circuits. To my understanding this would push me to work in the design and testing of ICs and transistors to work for companies like Texas Instruments. 

Computer Engineering - classes like Software Design II, Computer Architecture, Operating System Design,  Microcontroller Applications. This would push me towards a career as a hardware engineer for companies like IBM, Intel, AMD.

I have a better understanding in the courses and  have overall more interest in the Computer Engineering path but I don't want to easily dismiss the other two.

What about cars? Could a hybrid gasoline and passive steam engine utilize carbonic acid for greater efficiency and higher fuel efficiency with lower carbon dioxide fuel emissions because the co2 is harvested and used for the steam?
