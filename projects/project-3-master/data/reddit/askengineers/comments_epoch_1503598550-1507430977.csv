0,Rectifying DC from AC Mains for Motors.,1507421584,"Hi!  

I have a project that requires 75-90V DC unregulated at ~6-8A.  6A is 150% safety factor, 8A is 200% SF at 75V.   The simplest way I've come up with is just half-wave 120V60Hz with a single high current diode to ~85V peak with a 33,000uF cap to get 5% ripple, 80-85V DC at 8A.   This is acceptable.  

My question, should I have a 1:1 transformer from the Mains side to my load to prevent any feedback?  If so, would I be better off to do a 2:1 stepdown and then Full-wave rectify it with a 15,500uF cap?   Both would give me the same voltage with 5% ripple at my current requirements.

I'm under the assumption that any feedback would be blocked by the diodes anyways and if not, would feed back across any transformers I have anyways.

My Load will be Servo motors, 3 @ ~125W @ 75V.  ",AskEngineers,Matraxia,/r/AskEngineers/comments/74yjkc/rectifying_dc_from_ac_mains_for_motors/

2,What are the challenges to tethering 2 modules in space to each other and rotating to simulate partial gravity?,1507417304,"Having just read about the terrible effects of micro gravity on Scott Kelley's body after 1 year on the ISS, I started to think about what partial gravity will do to the human body, and that this is the data that we really need before sending folks to live on other bodies in the solar system.

In the book Seveneves, Neil Stephenson describes a fictional system where 2 modules are connected via tether, then begin rotating around the center of the tether, thereby simulating gravity.

Thanks to [this stackexchange thread](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/1445/what-minimal-radius-is-needed-for-rotation-to-simulate-gravitation-without-avers) - I found this calculator: http://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/SpinCalc.htm

To simulate 38% G (Mars) 25.8 meters radius seems to be pretty comfortable.  This will rotate at 3.6 RPM though, the tangential velocity might be too high for comfort according to the calculator.

However, this is just a tether so expanding the diameter is relatively cheap.  A 100 meter radius gets the RPM down to 1.8 and puts the tangential velocity into the green.

Given that data, what are the structural, or other, challenges to building such a two module system in low earth orbit?",AskEngineers,Consumer451,/r/AskEngineers/comments/74y5af/what_are_the_challenges_to_tethering_2_modules_in/

Basically, the part pointed to by arrows A,C,E, and G (not sure what it's called) broke off. As a result, the plastic edge pointed to by D stays in that position (the pencil point retracted). Normally, point C stops point D so that the pencil may stay extended. Ideally, point E and F would be jointed together real firmly (without interfering with the springs inside) however, I don't know if anything can hold these two points together real firmly. As of now, point A, which is a tiny little edge, can be held against point B, but I'd like to strength it somehow.

Why not build a wire-ECM machine since the ECM process does not eat away at the cathode. You could essentially build a WECM machine that has one wire that lasts forever, allowing  you to make that wire out of something like tungsten-copper or the like.

Is it mainly that the material-removal rates are even slower than WEDM?

How can I become a better communicator to my internship supervisors as well as my peers?,1507364845,"Hey guys, I'm on a throwaway because some classmates know my username. Anyway, I am in my third year of Mechanical Engineering and I sometimes feel like a total dumbass. I have decent grades at a 3.4 and I have an internship at a local aerospace company but sometimes I feel like a total idiot to my peers and the engineers at work. Although I make decent grades and do my best to help others in my classes, I often find myself fumbling over my words or making stupid mistakes when it comes to work tasks or asking questions and giving answers when speaking with supervisors and peers. I am not sure if this is due to sleep deprivation (average roughly 4-5/night), if I have too much shit going on in my brain to remain focused, or if I am just a straight up idiot.
The thing is, I am a moderately social person and I don't have too much trouble striking up conversation in any other topic, but when it comes to attempting to ""display"" my intellegence (being asked about something at my internship, being asked a question by a classmate), I often find myself to be a fumble fuck and I sound like a complete dumbass. Plain and simple, I feel as though I don't come off as an intelligent person when I am trying to talk to peers or my supervisors at my internship. I want to be able to speak accurately and with confidence, so that my boss or my peers will trust in the fact that I understand what they are asking for and that I know what I am communicating with them about.

20,Will the byproducts of peroxide decomposition corrode a 316-SS / Cu system?,1507316361,"I have 90% hydrogen peroxide undergoing catalyzed (Pt) decomposition in a chamber made of 316 stainless steel.  The peroxide is forced into the chamber at ~200 psi, and temperatures commonly exceed 800 F.  The stainless steel has been passivated with sulfuric acid and dilute peroxide.  To counteract leaks around the chamber's seal, it's been suggested that I add a copper gasket.  
  
I know that copper and 316-SS will undergo galvanic corrosion in a conducting medium, that superheated steam is generally quite corrosive, and that the presence of lots of oxygen (due to the peroxide decomposition) also contributes to corrosion.  It's not clear, however, if steam constitutes a sufficiently conductive medium to cause galvanic corrosion.  I'm also uncertain if the combination of high pressure, temperature, oxygen, steam, and dissimilar metals will create a perfect storm of sorts.  Can anyone help?  
  
Thanks!
  
edit:  Replacing the copper gasket frequently is not a problem, if it comes to that.  If the steel is corroding, though, that's a major problem.

21,When heating up a material with low thermal conductivity does the thermal conductivity of the heating element make a difference?,1507310560,"Context: I operate 3d printers and on occasion consider design aspects. In a 3d printer there is a block with a heating cartridge that shall heat to roughly 500K to 600K, attached is a nozzle. At the end of the nozzle is a hole usually about 0.4mm, and there is a larger path above the nozzle that is meant for 1.75mm filament.

The filament is a plastic usually PLA with a thermal conductivity of 0.13W/m-K and the block and nozzle combination most commonly used (product: e3d v6) are aluminum block (205W/m-K) and brass nozzle  (109W/m-K).

The question is directly related to the option of picking a copper block and nozzle (385 W/m-K).

If the copper option would allow the plastic to heat up faster, it would mean I can print faster (assuming the mechanics allow it) and thus make a business case for investing in the copper option.

So would copper allow heating up the plastic faster? Are there other considerations that I am not considering (heat capacity?). What formulas/laws/physical properties would go into such a calculation?

41,Thermal transfer in a paint oven,1507238367,"We have an older paint line and it has been brought forth that the parts come out too hot to work with. I've been tasked with finding a solution for this.

I haven't done thermal calculations since early university to determine how hot the parts are getting to be able to find out a method for cooling. First instinct is to go with an air system to provide additional cooling. The only other solution we've considered is reworking where they remove/load parts to put them further from the oven.

Some data:
60ft of oven
Internal temp is 235f
External is ~70 in winter and 80-90 in the summer
The largest part is 8x8x.375 x 18ft long. We also have frames that are the equivalent of 200ft of 4x4x.250

How would I go about determining how hot the part gets before it leaves the oven and then use that to find how much airflow to cool it down to a reasonable temperature?

About 2 years ago, I hired a product design/engineering firm to design and engineer a consumer product. I've been on the hunt for a manufacturer for about 18 months and have been told repeatedly (by 4 manufacturers) that the design as it stands now is not even ready for prototyping.

I'm not an engineer by trade, so I don't have the skills to analyze this from a technical perspective and I don't want to just go by the manufacturers' word as they have a financial interest in doing a redesign.

45,Surface Finish on a Hard Coat Anodized Aluminum Cylinder,1507228813,"Ok Reddit, I need help determining how to test surface finish (Ra, Rp, Rz) on a hard coat anodized aluminum cylinder. This cylinder is used in a steering rack for a high performance vehicle so the surface finish needs to be right in order to prevent premature wear on the seal. 

Currently we are using a Hommel T1000 profilometer to measure these parameters. The current testing setup has the profilometer taking one long measurement and the data it provides is the data we use to pass or reject the part. However this strategy provides inconsistent results in different spots for the same cylinder.

 I am planning on taking more 'short' samples across the part and averaging them to get values more indicative of the surface. This should help remove outliers (larger scratches visible to the naked eye) as well as remove influence of the part not being perfectly perpendicular to the measuring probe. 

Does this seem like a better test strategy? If not, what do you see wrong with it?

79,Best way to accurately mount a tube?,1507095902,"For an upcoming design, I need to mount a 2.25"" OD 2.0"" ID tube at one end so that its location is controlled within about .010"" over its entire 18"" length. Assuming it's perfectly straight (it will be ground on the OD so pretty dang straight), what's the best mounting method? I have considered something like a one piece clamping shaft collar, or having a stepped area turned on the OD (maybe with threads?) so I can force the shoulder against something known. I'd rather not weld on a flange (mostly because we don't have a source for such welding) but I will if I have to. Rather not use shims but again whatever works... The mount can be either parallel or perpendicular to the datum - I'd prefer parallel. Got any ideas? Thanks!

edit: The tube is OD ground so nice and straight and round. .010"" isn't exact - I just didn't want to use up my whole tolerance budget here.  Please see my drawing.

I'm trying to calculate the amount of angular tolerance between axes of internal/external threads given their class (major/minor diameter tolerance) and pitch. How much does my fastener wiggle

My approach so far has been to calculate the amount of radial play (based on diameter tolerances) and the amount of axial play (based on diameter tolerances and pitch). My brain fart is getting the angular tolerance from this information. I am thinking about it as a square inside a square, with the clearance between them being radial play and axial play on respective sides. How much can i rotate the smaller square within the larger one -- thats the number I'm after.

Does that make sense?

90,Looking for a solution to periodic water tank evacuation. Does a special valve exist?,1507079359,"Hi.

My problem is that I have a tank of water that is continually being filled. At a certain level, I would like for the entire take to drain and start filling again.

Some constraints:

* My current solution (which works but is flakey and routinely needs human interaction) involves siphons
* No floater allowed (for reasons), so a toilet-tank type solution would not work
* Hopefully minimal moving parts
* I would like it to run on the potential energy of the water and not any additional power source. 
* I would like it to fully drain and the trigger level (pressure?) be adjustable if possible
* I would like it to be pretty reliable and not need a lot of human intervention (like my siphon solution). You can assume that the water is filtered and has not debris or contaminants to cause any problems.

So does there exist, for example, a flapper or reed valve-type component that might do this? For example, wait for the pressure of the water to get to some (hopefully adjustable) amount, then evacuate the entire container, then re-close?

All google searches have been unfruitful. Frankly, other than a general problem description, I am not sure what to search for anyway.

I'm writing a novel and in this novel, there is a tall tower with copper plating as the only outside.

The idea is that the characters are running down the stairs as the tower is struck by lightning; however, I'm not sure what would happen to the tower at such a moment. I assume the electricity wouldn't jump between the walls and that inside the tower the characters are safe, but I'd like to be more sure.

6,How naturally smart do you have to be to be a good engineer?,1507003563,"For reference, I'm a third year engineering student, and I've known that I'm not naturally smart for a while, but it's become even more apparent in the past few months. A lot of the classes I'm taking this year have relatively new material and the concepts are just really hard to grasp for me. For example, I'm learning about frame rotations and rotation matrices in one of my classes and it might just be the notations, but stuff is flying right over my head. My aerodynamics class is pretty similar in that I'm not retaining a lot of information. Same goes with a numerical analysis class I took last year (think ODE solvers w/ MATLAB). It takes me a while to process information. I can't remember the last homework assignment that I was completely confident in without looking at the solutions or asking for help, and this dates back to probably since I started college. I can spend hours on just a few problems at times, and still not truly understand what's going on. My grades aren't bad (around 3.3 GPA), but I honestly don't think that's a reflection of my intelligence. 

Outside of academics, I can also see this. For example, I'm a pretty slow thinker. I don't like improvisational situations and I'm not super witty. I watch a ton of Youtube videos about different engineering systems from Learn Engineering and other channels like that, but I forgot how stuff works within a week maybe. I have to constantly refresh my knowledge and have a hard time retaining information, like I've mentioned before. 

I think to compensate for my lack of natural intelligence, I work really hard. I live by the proverb: ""Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."" I study a lot (probably more than 75% of my classmates), but I'm not excelling. This has recently affected my mindset when I'm looking for internships. I really want to work at a big company this Summer (SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Spaceship Company) but I just don't feel qualified. Especially when they're asking for 3.5+ GPAs (and in SpaceX's case, 3.7+). I think that they do this to weed out students like me - hard workers, but not necessarily the most naturally intelligent. 

I don't feel dumb necessarily because I can tell my classmates are struggling just as much, if not more than me. But I don't like comparing myself to others. It's hard for me to truly grasp concepts and I'm worried that my brain doesn't have what it takes to be a great engineer. I know people in industry that complain about bad engineers (I'm not sure if they're dumb, or just lazy), so I know that it's not that hard to actually become an engineer. But how hard is it to become a great engineer? Does natural intelligence matter? How far can you get with average intelligence and a strong work ethic?

Im looking for some ideas on how to get a blind persons cane to track his or hers speed throughout a said interval of observation.
I made a post about it earlier this week and wanted to add some specifics that would help my question get better feedback.
Background:
The cane is going to be used to track a blind students 'speed' throughout certain times of his day at school, to see when and where his walking increases, decreases or stays the same. 
(the student has become recently blind and the researchers helping him want to gather some data like this that could come from feedback through the cane itself or perhaps his body if necessary. 

Initially:
We have brainstormed a lot of ideas.Everywhere from trying a wheel attatched to the bottom of the cane that would spin as he tapped the ground and attempt to track how fast it spins, but that was a very clunky idea we determined.Now we are mainly looking into accelerometers and arduino based products that we can code, but drift as mentioned in my first post is a big problem with any type of project of this sort. 
Outside the box:
I was told maybe RFID's could be placed around the school but our professor would be happier if we could make it based on the cane or body itself for reasons unsaid.
As well we wanted to use a gps tracking system that could work indoors but either gps indoors is too unreliable or the really good gps tracking systems are patented or draw too much power. I personally think this could be the best answer if someone has a good gps tracking idea that doesnt draw a lot of power from the battery.

Any ideas on where to get started looking are even great,were basically starting over becuase we had to scratch our first idea. Our professor and fabricator instructor keep saying there are a lot of ideas that can work we just have to put in the time to find it, but Im not sure there are soultions with really clean and accurate polling on walking speed that arent pedometer based which leads to problems for us, but I am truly unsure on what to use so here I am looking for anything really. Thank you to anyone who can help!

Also I have probably unintentionally left out something important so please let me know if something obvious is being left out of my question ill answer is as soon as I can!

20,[Careers] Would you go to an interview after already accepting an offer elsewhere?,1506952937,"Hi, I am currently job-hunting in aerospace/defence. 

I submitted a lot of applications around the same time in July, attempting to have all the interviews close together, so I could simply decide which offer was best and go with it. In reality this hasn't worked out as planned, i.e. I'm still receiving invitations to interview but only every 2 to 3 weeks or so. 

Around start of August I accepted an offer in engineering higher education, but then got invited to interview at a major aerospace company. So I went and accepted this new offer, regretfully turning down the first role. I haven't signed a paper contract or agreed a start date yet only as they are currently carrying out my background checks.

In the mean time, another employer has just called me, offering an interview for a potentially more interesting and lucrative job in defence. My current strategy seems to be to go to interview, negotiate the best offer, wait as long as they let me to accept it (a week or two), but if another offer comes along at any point that is better, to negotiate using my existing offer and to turn down the one I've already accepted. I am concerned that if I do not accept in a reasonable amount of time, the offer will be lost, and if I do not remain open to new invitations to interview, I will almost certainly be settling on a sub-optimal job.

21,CFD boundary conditions of submerged vertical pipe connecting two stacked tanks [x-post from FluidMechanics],1506949244,"To elaborate on the title, the configuration I am modelling is essentially two filled tanks stacked on top of each other with a pipe exiting vertically out of the bottom of the top tank. The pipe is submerged in the fluid of the bottom tank. Both tanks are open to the atmosphere and filling/draining from/to other places to keep the levels constant. I will only be modelling the length of pipe.

I know my inlet pressure at the top of the pipe to be the static pressure at the bottom of the top tank. I figure the boundary condition of the outlet should be the static pressure at the submerged level in the bottom tank. However, my boss is suggesting to cut off the submerged part of the pipe and use the new ""exit"" as a boundary outlet with atmospheric pressure since it is at the same level as the fluid in the bottom tank. This feels wrong but I don't know how to prove my case which is the main reason I am posting. I would very much appreciate help with this.

The main reason it feels wrong to me is that with my boss's logic, the pressure of the pipe at the level of the bottom tank should also be the pressure from the top tank plus whatever extra distance down in the pipe. It seems like he is only considering hydro-static forces but I feel like with a moving fluid, the pressure will not balance out like presumed. 

If any of my assumptions are wrong or you need extra info to help answer, please tell me.

23,What is the best design for these metallic parts - Digital Piano Extension,1506942455,"Hi there.

I hope this is the right place for this kind of posts. I have no background whatsoever in engineering, designing, or anything along those lines. I merely can hold a hammer.

That's why I come to you with a little question regarding a project I'm thinking about. I'd like to add metallic extensions to a digital piano, in order for me to be able to enjoy both a healthy posture when playing the piano, and when using my mouse and keyboard. 

[Here is the concept](https://imgur.com/a/uHI50).
[Here it is with the plank](https://imgur.com/FweqEa4).


The structure would have to support the weight of a wooden plank (the dimensions of which you can guess looking at the pic above), mouse and keyboard, and the weight of my resting arms, like a regular desk. 

I was wondering mainly about the shape of the metallic parts. What would be the sturdiest/cheapest to have a company manufacturing it for me. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/ShEGXyt) are the ideas I came up with.

So what do you think? Is there an obvious one? I'm mainly concerned about the angle that the dotted line runs along. I guess the stress would mainly be on there. But maybe most metals are sturdy enough for it not to be a concern at all?  

Also, ideally, I would like the horizontal bar that the piano rests on to be as thin as possible, to maintain a correct height: my drawings are not that precise (literally just downloaded and discovered SketchUp just for this one thing), but would you be able to tell from them, if going thinner is a bad idea?

Lastly, is there any kind of metal that would be better suited? 

Thank you for reading this quite confused and  scrambled up post!  [Here is the final concept](https://imgur.com/sZuh0Ua) (it's nice to be rich in the virtual world of sketchup!)

So this is a bit of a light-hearted question, one which should amuse all the armchair engineers and perhaps the more well qualified ones as well.

I'm a member of a RP group set in the mid 20th century, and we're all directing countries and whatnot. I want to build a railway bridge across a 7 mile long body of water, the average depth being about 250 feet, with a minimal silt level due to the intensity of the currents. Based on the era and the tech available, this is a bit excessive admittedly, but hell--I'm The Man here, and if I want to, I will.

Ultimately, I want to draw up rough plans for the bridge via MS Paint, which in and of itself is going to be an ordeal given the scale, and will probably take a few months given the RL classwork I have to attend to. What I want to know though is what would be the best kind of a bridge here? This project reminds me of the Gibraltar Bridge proposals, but I don't know what designs, if any, were seriously considered.

Given the depth of the water, this seems like caisson territory, which is pretty darn expensive so I should probably have as few pilings as possible. I had a small thought towards a multi-tower suspension bridge arrangement with a tubular deck a la Brittania Bridge for extra strength. However, having seen one or two suspension bridges IRL I recognize that there's a bit of an arc to those between their towers, and I'm not sure the up-down arcing is a good idea for railway stuff.

Would this power brick even if its not from the same manufacturer only provide the exact about of draw needed to keep the device powered on but not push out more wattage than the DVR needs?

Does anybody know hot to find yield strengths of stainless steel?
I thought Grade 316 Stainless meant that it was 316 MPa, but apparently that's not the case.
Google seems to think it could be anything from 205 to 600, and my local supplier doesn't provide mechanical properties.

55,How can I estimate the true level of effort of a software engineer?,1506804142,"I recently ran into a problem where a software engineer on my team left unexpectedly for another company.  His part of the project was suppose to take 2 months, but its already 2 months late at this point.  I am beginning to suspect that he didn't put a lot of work into it.  

Is lines of code a decent metric?  I took a look into the code he wrote, and in 2 months of work, he wrote about 300 lines.  However, he was working with a new toolchain, and from the looks of it it was complicated, and rather difficult to learn.  

I spoke to him about it, and he did explain what he was doing, how it worked, and said he was working hard, and had to do a lot of learning and reading.  

The work is new to my group, so is the tool-chain, so I don't really have a basis to compare his results, or if the original schedule was realistic.  All I really have is my gut telling me either not much effort was put in, or a lot of effort was put into reading and researching, and little effort was put into actual coding and making the system work.

FYI - I do programming as well, but on a different toolchain.  True effort to me is spending 1-2hr reading and researching, then 6-8 hrs writing code and banging my head on the keyboard trying to figure out why something doesn't work, then repeat.

I'm 24 and going back to school as a freshman in community college where I'm getting an associates in civil engineering and then transferring to a university afterwards. I know its pretty early in the game still, but I've been thinking about universities that I'll have the potential to get into. My SAT scores in high school were really low, something like 1100 out of 1600, and I know I can retake them at any time if a particular school required it, but I know realistically getting into those schools (ie MIT) is a one-in-a-million shot as a CC transfer. I have some extended family members who attended Yale and Brown, so getting into a very reputable school has been something that has highly motivated me since getting serious about my education.  

Setting the financial aspect of these schools aside, is deriving motivation from the thought of attending one of these highly reputable universities foolish? If I was to go through the process of retaking the SAT and possibly the ACT to show improvement of my academic commitment, do I really stand a decent chance, and is it worth it?

64,Internship with a promise of becoming permanent,1506762579,"Hi all.

Just wanted to take your opinion regarding a situation I am in right now.

So I've recently graduated with an engineering degree, and was looking for some jobs. One of my friends in currently working (more on that later) in one of the big Oilfield services firms and the manager of one of the departments (who also happens to be from my university) asked my friend if there is anyone free at the moment who could join them, since an audit is coming up and they needed some extra help. He referred me to him and now I have been working over there since a week, working on maintaining the databases, getting some other office work done, and also working in the shop along with other personnel (hands on work). I can't go to the fields ofcourse, at the moment.

My boss told me that initially we'll take you on for one month unpaid internship, and if things seem promising, you can be given a 1 year contract and maybe even permanent. My friend has been given a contract in the same manner as this, internship for one month, and now working on the contract, and probably he will become permanent as well. Similarly, a couple of other guys over here are working on these unpaid internships as well, and some have become contract employees as well. There is another guy who did this internship last year, got the contract, now is permanent and on a training course in the US. But some people of course, do not get the contract as well.

The work is of a full employee sometimes, with everything being done on the company systems, and full timings. From what I have gathered, this firm does not take fresh graduates in the traditional 'Trainee Engineer' programs, rather it hires like this, through internship -&gt; contract -&gt; permanent.

So what is your opinion on this? Worth doing it? Ethics of this practice? Future promise.

I have a closed volume, and some black powder charge will go off, adding a certain amount of J to the system. Is there an equation for the change in pressure? I believe this is an isochoric process.

EDIT:

I believe I found the equation I would need: 

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/cvpro.html

So this is basically my problem. I have a volume, I have a force I need add to the top of the volume to break it open, and I need to find the energy needed to do that, and from that I can get the amount of black powder I need: (https://imgur.com/a/yYytL)

So to solve this problem. I calculated the amount of force needed to shear some shear pins, right. It came out to 64 lbs. So, from my limited knowledge, I would simply need to increase the pressure in this supposed volume enough so that there is an [extra 64 lbs distributed across the top](https://imgur.com/a/yYytL). So basically, 64lbs/Aₚₗₐₜₑ. So it came out to a ΔP of 20460 Pa.

So basically I have an equation of Q = Cv/R * V * 20460 Pa. With a volume of 0.008513 m^3, Cv = 12.5, and R = 8.3. And I'm getting 262 J of energy required.

* Graduated with a BS in MechE 3 years ago

* Did a couple of MechE internships with Defense Contractors

* Got a full-time job as a computer-networking consultant for the last 3 years

I've done very well for myself in my job, but I'm looking at my next step(travel is killer). My favorite part of this and other jobs has always been the technical part. So I want to be able to use my more software side experience (networks + scripting) with MechE.

So far I've mainly applied/looked at Test Engineer roles since they seem to combine a lot of Hardware+Software skills. Are there other roles out that would be a good fit?

I've also been putting together my MS grad school application to different programs with the main goal of learning more controls/robotics.

I know all of this will be even tougher since I've been out of the strict engineering world for 3 years now. I mainly took the networking job to learn more software skills and improve my business/project sense which was lacking when I graduated, and I've been able to lead projects for the last 2 years.

86,How to determine input power required to perpetuate flywheel generator for period of time,1506703434,"Im working on a project where pedaling a bicycle causes a 12"" flywheel to rotate a 300W permanent magnet, 3 phase AC generator shaft. This generator is rectified to DC 12V then inverted to 110V single phase AC for grid tie.

  The generator makes full power @ 400RPM and has a startup torque of &lt;0.3 NM. The flywheel mass is roughly 7 kg. The gear ratio is 1:8 (for every rotation of the bicycle crank, the flywheel turns 8 times). Lets say the crank arms are each 12"" in length

Questions:

1. How much energy/force must go into the system (i.e. pedaling the bike) in order to keep the flywheel/generator @ 400RPM for 10 seconds? Can this be done with one 'burst' of energy into the system as opposed to constant pedaling of the crank?

2. Once flywheel/generator is at 400RPM, how would you calculate the time until it slows down to 100RPM? 0 RPM? 

3. If the goal is to get as much energy out of the system, for as long as possible, from one or two pedal cranks, what does the math look like for this setup? How do we get 300 watts for 10 seconds? Or would this look more like 350 watts for 3 seconds @ 450RPM, then 300 watts for 3 seconds at 400RPM, then 250 watts for 3 seconds at 350RPM, until the flywheel slows to 0RPM?

Also, I've noticed that upper management prefers a basis in one of those fields for some management positions.

* Hoping that it will give me more job options in the chance of major changes - buyouts, layoffs, and heavily cyclical business are all common to find in technology industries.

* I want to better understand the details of the projects I am involved in.

* I want to be well-positioned to lead engineers.  IE is great for management and efficiency and EE would provide a better technical basis.

* I get bored and want to learn something new.


I'm looking at online EE degrees such as the ones at Purdue or ASU.  I also looked a bit at ME or ChemE but don't have the same level of interest and probably not the right level of ability in those.  The school ranking isn't very important to me anymore - I just want to gain some knowledge and have a record that I did so.  Honestly, a school that is a little on the easier side may even be preferable - I have a full time job and a family and getting put through the ringer at something like my alma mater isn't really that enticing now.

I'm looking for any comments or suggestions regarding going from IE-&gt;EE, whether getting a MS EE would be worth it or not, recommendations for programs, or if another degree wouldn't be as helpful as some other path to learn more in the EE area.",AskEngineers,gtm_r,/r/AskEngineers/comments/738yr3/bsms_ie_to_online_ms_ee/

1. How might this be achieved without the use of explosives?

2. If one vertical half of the building was destroyed before the other half, wouldn't the 'crushing' portion of the building fall off to the side, taking the path of least resistance?

Now, I've opened up the tables characterizing the appliances on the market and I see very different results. The 5 measured parameters are NOx emissions, Particulate, Organic Gaseous Compounds (OGC), CO and efficency. The last 2 are pretty obvious to interpret.

But the other 3 confuse me a lot. I see particulate going from 5 to 22. OGC from 0.6 to 12 (in mg per unit of standard fuel, at 13% O2). NOx, on the other side, is pretty constant within a 10%. How can particulate and OGC vary so much? I mean... It's the same fuel burning at approximately the same temperature  in a chamber.

I received my bachelors in International Business and Chinese Studies and have worked for the last 5 years (primarily in Sales Operations at a genetic screening company and a health technology company). 2 years ago I decided I wanted to return to school for neural engineering to be involved in building brain machine interfaces and am finally pursuing this decision this fall with taking on some fundamental science, math, and engineering courses. I'm still wrestling with a couple of questions that I have not found a 100% clear answer looking through Reddit and online, so I thought I'd post and ask! 

General engineering question(s):
1) I have a concern that if I aim to get a degree (masters or ph.d) in neuroengineering and I gun for a role in management, I wont have the opportunity to be more hands-on in the design of the technology. Can anyone share from their experience if they work in management, but are still able to get their hands dirty? This doesn't haven't to specifically be in neuroengineering. 

Specific to neural engineering:
1) Any advice from current neural engineers around what expectations you had coming into the industry that were dashed? (e.g. pace of tech development is slow, product release to market hits a lot of road bumps, etc)
2) Do you know of any companies that are currently combining AI to develop brain machine interfaces and the how these bmis read data from our brains?
3) What specific job roles in the field have the most say over the strategic direction of the technology?  

Thanks in advance to whomever has some experience and perspective to share. If I'm thinking about these questions the wrong way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

0,Depressed About my Job. Is it Me or the Job?,1506658609,"Hi All,

I have been increasingly stressed out and getting depressed about my job and need some feedback.  I have been at the position for almost 1 year and am starting to develop panic attacks.  I have 4 years total experience.  

I joined a small company a year ago because they were growing and it seemed like a good learning experience. I am only one of two engineers working here out of 30 employees.   The pace is fast and I have gained a tremendous amount of experience and knowledge since being here. I am very thankful for that. It started out well but things quickly reversed.  

I am trying to do my best but the constant berating in front of others and high workload is wearing me down.  I am given 60+ hours of work a week and cannot keep up.  When I first started I worked weekends to finish out my project assignments.  I have asked for less work or more resources but have been ignored and have only taken 3 vacation days since starting with a lot of weekend work mixed in.  It is creating friction in my personal life and making me uncomfortable.  

When I go to work, I work in constant fear of making mistakes and getting yelled at by others in the company (not my manager).  I think part of the problem is I am still learning and my manager (the only other engineer) is busier than I am and doesn't have time to QC my work. I hate getting yelled at so I will double and triple check everything, which slows down the process. I am beating myself up about this and getting depressed that I am not able to keep up with the workflow and be successful here.  I am afraid to go to the office in the morning because someone will inevitable come up to me and scold me for not having a project done. I try to sit down with them and explain the reasons why the project isn't done but most of the time I don't think they listen or care.  I don't know if I trust anyone here with helping me or if they even care about me at all. 

I feel I cannot keep working here and need advice.  Does this sound like a normal work environment?  If yes, do I need to suck it up or is it reasonable for me to want to quit? I am more assertive now but I get worn down and tired.  The stress is making me lose hair and constantly sick.  I need the money unfortunately to pay the bills so I feel trapped.

It's really not a big deal though, and I don't mind. After 10-15 minutes most of the black lines resolve themselves, but one or two may hang on for 5-10 more minutes.


The thing is, I can tap the front or bottom of the bezel to make them go away. Even when it starts up with the blotch of them I can tap and sometimes get lucky and fix half of the pixel lines.

The work, however, was highly experimental and I wasn't able to gain any simulation/computational experience. My prior internships have all been more general mechanical engineering positions and I feel that I was very under stimulated and wasn't rigorously attacking engineering problems.

I feel that going down the computation road will give me more difficult, in depth problems. I have taken multiple numerical methods classes in undergrad and grad (solving ordinary/partial DiffEq and using different methods), but I feel that my backgound is not as solid as someone who did research using these methods. I decided not to get a PhD since I did not see myself doing 4 more years of experimental work. I would like to get a PhD eventually but I needed to get out and do something new.

So that being said, I have a job offer to a small start up in January and I have time to apply to other jobs and learn different skills. I wanted to try and land a computational/simulation job but I feel I must expand my background.

I have an abundance of Matlab experience and some Java from a class a long time ago. I was thinking that C++ would be very valuable but are there any others I should look into? Also is CodeAcademy a good place to learn this language?

The washers and c-clip should work, however, the buttons I've found online are usually too thick/long (our rotor is only .1 inches thick). Does anyone know of sources to buy these buttons that aren't much longer than the rotor's thickness so it can fit snug? Or would it be better to just machine these?

25,Pilot Operated Pressure Differential Valve alternatives?,1506571661,"I have a small student operated project that I am running but have run into a snag. I am looking for a valve that can open when a somewhat specific pressure differential is created such as 9-11 psi. I have found quite a few that do this such as this [singer valve](http://www.singervalve.com/pressure-relief-pilot/81-rpd) or [this](http://www.singervalve.com/differential-relief-pilot/106-rd). However, these type of valves cost well into the hundreds of dollars and I am looking to stay under $150. The pressure differential will be increasing as a vacuum is created on the outlet side of the valve. Once it gets near 9-11 psi, water needs to flow in by the valve opening. I am running a 1/2"" PEX Pipe. The problem I have is that the pressure difference is created by a vacuum at the outlet and does not affect the inlet pressure.

I'm a sophomore in Electrical Engineering and have been invited to interview with two defense contractors for 2018 summer internships. I'm having difficulty choosing between the two though.
I need to choose one to interview with as the hiring events are on the exact same days :( 

 Also, I don't want to sever any potentional future working relationships. 

Company A:

* In the Northeast (where I live, so I wouldn't need to relocate far for the summer. However, I 100% will still need to relocate.)

* I've only spoken with HR people over the phone so far, so I'm not entirely sure if I'll even get the position here. My main credentials are software, but I want to be involved with hardware in the future. 

* From what I've read, experiences at this company highly depend on the team you work with. 

* I don't know 100% what the job is yet, so I'm waiting on an email from them. 

Company B:

* In the Southeast, meaning I'll have to relocate further. They are also paying for my flight down to the event.

* Summer heat 

* I spoke with an engineering manager on the phone. This position would be working with electrical components — something I certainly want to get into. I was upfront with the manager, emphasizing my strengths are software as I'm only in my 3rd semester of school. He said not to worry, and that there'd be things for me to do. This manager is an alum of my school and I got the vibe that he'd ""take me under his wing,"" if that makes sense.

Company B is already asking me if I want to attend the hiring event, even though company A hasn't gotten back to me yet ( it's been &lt;6 hours lol). I'm not sure if I should RSVP to company B without hearing from company A. 

Were these hiring events intentionally scheduled like this? Do I gotta choose lol. Also worth noting both companies are top 5 contractors, but company A is a bit ahead of B.

Where does this experience fit in and where should I go from here? I suppose an obvious answer is go back to school and get a masters in engineering, but where can I go now?

I'm not sure what kind of device or motor I should be searching for.  I stumbled across linear actuators, but I really have no idea if I'm headed in the right direction.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

**Edit** (copying response from below to add additional info):

I apologize for not being more specific.
I'm trying to build a grid of pins that could be used to apply dynamic amounts of pressure on a flexible surface. Imagine something similar to [this toy](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41pABlB2jzL.jpg), but where the pins are controlled via electronics rather than by human pressure.

Cost: I'm trying to estimate cost, so I don't really have a figure in mind at the moment.

Size: The pins themselves would be thin--like sewing needles (perhaps a bit thicker), but not sharp. The travel length of the pin would only need to be 6mm or so...maybe less. Just enough to apply distinct amounts of pressure on a surface.

Speed &amp; Accuracy: The pins would need to be able to adjust to a few significant lengths. The greater the precision the better. Ideally this would happen very quickly. In a perfect world, a single pin could have mm resolution, and would be capable of adjusting to different lengths 30+ times per second.

I have no idea how achievable this is. I'd be really interested in understanding how possible it is to get close to these requirements.",AskEngineers,vegasje,/r/AskEngineers/comments/72kn9n/what_would_i_use_to_move_a_small_pin_or_needle_in/

99,How to use KRL and how is it different from G-code?,1506296845,"So long story short, I'm a ME undergrad beginning a new research project involving KUKA robots. my ""supervisor"" wants me to learn KRL (KUKA Robot Language) well enough to give him a crash course on it, as well as write a simple program using RoboDK.

The punchline: I know absolutely nothing about coding (i have a minor background with G-code from operating a CNC machine but i couldnt tell you what a block of code meant without seeing the operation being performed in front of me) and am completely lost on KRL.

6,Steel Viaduct Possibilities,1506265901,"Hello all, 

Someday in the future, I'd like to develop my own power and utility company, and introduce truly modern and reliable electrical infrastructure to the nation. I'm hoping to do it without government money, but given the exorbitant costs of infrastructure, that may not be possible. 

My question pertains to elevated rail. The point of elevated rail is that it eliminates grade crossings and competition with ground traffic. It is generally safer, and can operate faster and more efficiently as it is not bound by as many speed restrictions.

However, it can take up the same amount of land as a normal, ground-level system would, due to the spacing of its support pylons. 

The only systems I have found that have considerable distance between support pylons are steel arch bridges and viaducts, but these are massively expensive and probably not the solution for a system that could stretch 500 miles or more. What is attractive about these steel arch bridges is the massive arch length. The current largest arch is 552 meters, with bridges in planning or under construction that will have arch spans of 600 and 700 meters. 

How could something similar and cheaper be done for a 2-4 track elevated system? The idea being, that you would only have to own the earth where your pylons are planted, and people could still own and develop the land underneath the rail.  I'd like this system to be as disaster proof as possible, able to withstand everything from hurricanes, to blizzards and extreme cold, to earthquakes. 

The aesthetics of the architecture is required to be eye pleasing for the long term, as one of the many reasons people do not like elevated rail is because it normally is an eyesore.

However, I don't intend on staying in this field for the rest of my life. I'm coming up to 5 years, and I've been exploring my options. Knowledge and skills that I have can be a huge asset to refineries and energy company, but I've been having trouble conveying this, despite my cover letter opening with how much reliability I could bring to them. I'm concerned that people reading resumes in large corporations are just HR staffs instead of technical people, and they just have a check list.


I've been consciously improving my market value by joining the ASME standards committee that writes national standard for our industry, co-authoring papers, and learning FEA. What else should I be doing? I have a decently written LinkedIn profile, but since my industry is so niche, I rarely get profile views, and definitely no offers. Technical department of our company is small, so promotion opportunity is rare if not non-existent. Although I know I would be first in line if anything comes along based on my performance. I've considered going back for MBA, but I would rather do that with a company that I plan on staying with long term who could provide some financial support.


What else should I be doing? Going to seminars? More networking?

I'm slightly panicking that my years of experience are wasted due to small industry, or that I have to start as entry level if I want to switch industry.

&lt;begin small rant&gt;

I've been dealing with tons of assemblies, parts, drawings going back 20+ years located in one single folder on a shared server drive. These files have non descriptive alpha numerical names, often out of order from their parent assemblies (project A has numbers 1001jk to 1058jk and then Project B picks up 1059jk to 1157jk, then A picks up again to 2000jk). More than often those projects have completely different assemblies using the same parts (often custom parts, not just screws). The only location of a description of what the part or assembly is is located in a **handwritten stack of paper**- now into the 8000's of line items. 

This is incredibly frustrating to the other engineers who have not had a hand in the hundred or so projects the company has done. Try to go find a main assembly? Either search through the preview tab to see if the file is the one or ask the senior engineer what the number is for the project (good luck if he isn't there or doesn't answer his phone, which is often). Trying to make a package of drawings for a customer? Better hope the numbers in the assembly aren't split up for another project in the middle. 

The location of this holy grail of mess is a split server file, three folders down. Also in this sub,sub,sub folder labeled CAD. Client files, pdfs, old build procedures, pictures and random other files. 

This can't be the norm? Right?!?! HOW THEN? please dear lord help me in this unorganized mess. The sole reason for this is that the Senior Designer doesn't want ""double dipping"" where two part numbers could be the same if located in separate folders and relies on windows catching the two parts named the same.

29,"Could you improve a cars efficiency by ""flipping"" the downforce it generates?",1506132282,"As you sometimes do I was thinking about ground effect. If you've seen cars like the [Chapparal 2J](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTQFoybyrac) or the prototype Redbull X2010 from Gran Turismo you know how powerful the aerodynamic forces can be. 

My question is: If you flipped the fan so instead of creating a vacuum it made a 'cushion' of air, would it make any noticeable improvement if efficiency?

EDIT: [More info about the 2J](http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a32350/jim-hall-chaparral-2j-history/)
&gt; The Chaparral 2J is powered by an aluminum Chevrolet ZL1 engine, 427 cubic inches and producing 650 horsepower at 7000 RPM. It is paired to a clutchless semi-automatic three-speed transaxle. With a fiberglass resin body, it weighs hardly over 1800 pounds. The auxiliary engine, mounted behind the rear wheels, is a Rockwell JLO 247cc two-stroke, two-cylinder, 45-horsepower engine, usually found powering snowmobiles. At full power, it makes an ear-splitting, high-pitched drone, like the buzzing of mechanical wasps from hell. The two rear fans are lifted from a M-109 Howitzer and capable of pushing out 9650 cubic feet of air per minute at 6000 RPM. With the Chevrolet engine off, rumor has it, they can even push the car forward at 25 to 40 miles per hour. The fans draw air from the bottom of the car and send it—along with dust, debris, oil sprays, and the occasional grass clippings—to the back, presumably into the faces of other drivers. These drivers inevitably raised a stink to Hall about it: we can't see when you're in front, we're getting sprayed with all of this debris. ""Well,"" said the taciturn Hall, ""why don't you pass me then?"" There's more. To create a negative pressure vacuum that would suck the car to the ground, the car featured skirts around the rear three-quarters of the car. Hall approached General Electric to use its relatively new invention, Lexan: a polycarbonate plastic material that was light, flexible, strong, and most importantly, unbreakable. The skirts moved up and down through a system of cables, pulleys, and machined arms that were bolted to the suspension. The result was a near-constant alignment to the road surface. With the fans on, the car would hunker down by two inches.

39,I'm early in my career and my employer continues to move me further and further away from the technical side of things.,1506101402,"After getting news this morning that my next project (after 6 months of pure drafting work) will be documentation, I got frustrated and called a meeting with my manager. I explained to him that I really want to move more into the technical side of things. He seemed sympathetic but told me that we need to go where the work is, which I understand. We're a contracting company so we live and die by our projects. I've been pretty unhappy with all of my projects for the past year or so because my bosses kept promising all this ""interesting"" work was just right around the corner but it inevitably didn't show up. I don't know if they were lying just to appease us all or they legitimately thought that. 

My frustration with the lip service I've been getting from everyone here has been growing steadily over the past year. Like I mentioned, 90% of what I've been doing is drafting and drawing work. I'm 3 years out of school now and have completely stalled in my technical career. I'm not learning anything at this point. 

Its reached a boiling point for me now. I've been talking to recruiters for the past few weeks and have gotten a few promising leads on new jobs. I was hesitant to pursue any of them too hard because I kept thinking this job would turn into something great but now its clear that is not, and will not, be the case for the foreseeable future. I'm considering submitting my resignation and taking some time to explore opportunities in different parts of the country, in places I'm interested in living.

43,Low pay in an industry I want to get into?,1506095916,"Hey all,

I'm a ChemE at Ohio State graduating this December. I've been applying for a few months now with only a few callbacks and have an interview coming up with Regeneron near Albany, NY. The position is Biotech Production Specialist and is intended for life sciences and related majors and is kind of technician work. They're saying hourly pay is $21.50 per hour which is $43,000 per year not counting overtime (which Glassdoor says is pretty likely and they offer an extra $200/weekend shift worked) along with benefits liike 401K match, relocation assistance, etc. 

I realize this is on the low end for ChemE pay but I would really like to get into the biopharmaceutical/biotech industry to eventually become a process engineer at one but lack the direct experience.  I have had two internships, one at a synthetic pharmacuetical plant in their EHS department and one at a plastics plant in a jr. process engineering type of role, but neither were super in depth on manufacturing let alone biopharm manufacturing. I also have worked in a research lab on campus for two years part-time. So my experience is decent but not amazing.

If I do receive an offer from them, with no other offers on the table yet, should I take it for the experience and then try to move up to a process engineering position in 1-2 years? 

I am also slightly concerned with moving out to New York just because I would like to stay near Columbus or Cincinnati if possible. I have other interviews coming up including a textile company in Cincinnati for a quality engineer position but I don't really have an interest in textiles and worry about industry health (similar to how the plastic plant I worked at was struggling due to competitors in Asia among other issues like problematic management and high turnover). How valuable is it to stay in an area where you have connections vs. a fresh start?

I'm looking for advice on how the components you would use to achieve this.

Here's a graphic outlining the plan
https://imgur.com/a/2Sd42

- There is a outer square pole, around an inner square pole, that can slide up and down on the shaft.
- The outer square pole is attached to a ring that is holding a payload of around 75 lbs roughly 8 inches out from the shaft.
- The ring will be held at tension for long periods of time (~2 hours) in the raised position.
- The ring needs to ""drop"" via a remote signal (I don't need advise on remote controlling the electronics, as that is covered)
- The ring then needs to ""raise"" via a remote signal back into it's stationary top position.

Both the RAISE and the DROP need to be predictable, repeatable, and be able to be done multiple times without risk of binding.  I would like to know the technical mechanisms you think might work best for this.  Winch?  Solenoid?

66,Do satellites have preprogrammed thruster responses to counter spin caused by actuators?,1506014342,"For example, the Hubble has a big door on the end of the telescope. Opening and closing it must create some kind of spin, even if said spin stops once the door stops moving. I'm sure the designers can calculate what moving each actuator on a satellite will do to it's attitude, so they should be able to figure out what the thrusters (or gyroscopes) need to do to counteract each actuator based on how much and in what direction they move. I'm sure some fine tuning needs to be done because the math is never perfect, but it would have to do that anyways because of solar winds etc.

So if they know opening the door changes the attitude at least 0.5 degrees, will they program the door opening routine to include a thruster firing that covers the minimum movement expected and the let the computer fine tune it from there? Will they just program the computer to counter any attitude changes and let it deal with actuator-induced changes on it's own? Or do they manually command a thruster/gyro adjustment every time they command an actuator?

67,How well would addition of electric motors improve throttle response of jet engines?,1506012920,"This is mostly just meant to be fun discussion thread.

I know jet engines have an issue with slow throttle response, both for acceleration and deceleration (turbo props get around this by running the engine at a mostly constant speed and varying the prop pitch). What if they had an electric motor coupled to the compressor or turbine shafts that sped up or slowed down (with regenerative breaking) the shaft when the throttle differed from the actual power output?

Some questions to get the discussion going:

How heavy would the required motor be and would the weight be worth it?

How complex would it be to add this system?

Can an electric motor be designed to withstand the environment inside the engine, mainly the heat? If not, could the motor use a belt drive running behind one of the shaft supports with a protective cover (to reduce airflow restrictions) and be mounted elsewhere?

How would it be powered?

How well would this work in different applications (small civilian planes, airliners, military planes, etc)?

Could the motor also serve as the engine's generator when it's not being used for acceleration? The plane would run on batteries and the computer would switch the motor back into generator mode when the batteries reached 75-50%.

Could the motor be used to provide thrust in the event that the regular air-breathing engine functionality failed? Would the compressor or turbine be the better shaft to use for this?

What shaft should the engine be connected to for best acceleration performance?

74,Touch Latch with low depth,1505991153," Hello Guys!

Im a product-designer (yeah i know, its alaways the same between designer and engineers;) from germany, and currently i am developing a new product, for which i need a touch latch/push to open mechanism.
I did a lot of research before tried to developing my own touch latch, but in view of production and coasts i am currently at the end of the line.

The problem is that in our product i have only a very limited amount  of installation space, especially in depth. Most of the touch latches on market are very long/depth and have only a really short hoisting capacity (i hope its the right formulation) . Like this one used in furniture:  https://www.wwhardware.com/media/catalog/product/cache/image/400x400/beff4985b56e3afdbeabfc89641a4582/b/9/b956a1004.jpg
I  have only 25mm of depth, and the the hoisting capacity should be as big as possible (like 15mm would be great).
So, i thought about the same mechanism like a pen, but in my case, the outcoming element shouldnt twist, because it will be filled with some kind of pad (like coffee pads). 

I tried to develop my own mechanism (i did cut the back so you can look in it):
https://imgur.com/fvOhSnr


So, i hope you can see what i wanted to do, but the problem is, that the parts (i tried to 3d print it several times and versions with the form2) are very small and  are to easy to break when i do push the button.

I would be very thankful if someone wants to discuss my project and have some tips how i could make it work, may it be a complete new beginning or some general tips.
Maybe there is yet something on the market i could use also, that would be great!

(i apologize for wrong words and formulations, its hard so write abut something like this for me).

Within my year here, I was part of a two man project that took an idea from concept to completed product that customers are now using. More than just engineering and designing, a lot of my time was spent making documents, from testing procedures to slide decks. I took on varied roles here and there outside my project as well; like designing tooling and fixtures for other projects in the company, or troubleshooting manufacturing or testing issues.

As I finish this project, I am thinking of moving onto different companies in the same industry. But to a specialized type of engineering that was not what my role currently is. There simply isn't a role available for me in the company that allows me to do that specialized type of engineering.

78,How much aluminium/aluminum do I need to replace a length of pine?,1505977724,"So I built an apple cider press. I have a 22mm acme screw, lead screw that I use press down on the apples. The lead screw is sitting in a flanged nut **in a piece of 90x90x650mm pine** which means there is a 36mm hole through the middle of the wood.

A diagram of which is [here](https://i.imgur.com/c48xjdY.png)

And a video of it going is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzmBJQYUwnk)

A crack has started to form in the pine cross-member, and when your torquing on the lead screw as hard as you can, as you're starting to hear creaks and snaps from the wood and now you can SEE a crack opening up... well it starts to get pretty scary.

So I want to replace the timber cross member with a piece of aluminium (I know stainless steel would be better, but it's expensive, and hard to machine). But what wall thickness/dimensions do you think I'll need to withstand the force of the lead screw?

I reckon the peak force is on the order of 40,000 Newtons (with a bit of a safety factor)... or 4 metric tonnes/9000 pounds.

Bolt force (kN)=Torque (Nm) /(Diameter (mm) * k (unitless))
= (0.35m arm * 400N force)/(22mm lead screw * 0.15)
=140/3.3
=42kN

I know that seems pretty high, but I'm confident I get at least 1 metric tonne of weight.

I've got access to some 100x50 mm rectangle section aluminium tube (6060), with a 6mm wall. Will that stand up to the challenge (Again, after a 36mm hole has been cut through the middle)? If not, how thick a wall will I need for a 100x50mm section?

85,Is a gear a polygon?,1505950266,"So, I have been having a little bit of a mindfuck during the last days.

I am trying to understand very simple gears and how to construct them if they are of different sizes.

So, we have gears like this: http://www.leonardo-da-vinci-models.com/da-Vinci-Models-Odometer-p5.jpg (So, just sticks sticking out of a plate, on the front, on the side, whichever way).

Now, let's say the end-point of the stick is the reference we need to work with. For an 8-tooth gear we have 8 sticks/points, for a 16-tooth gear we have 16 sticks/points.

Now, what I don't understand is the distance between each stick. They obviously need to be the same for every gear so they fit together. Let's say the direct distance between each stick/point in the 8-tooth gear is 5 cm. Is the direct distance between each tooth in the 16-tooth gear the same or is it actually MORE because it is actually the circular arc-length between every tooth that needs to be the same?

I saw a posting for a job as a manufacturing tech at a precision optics manufacturing company, that only required a high school diploma, so I figured what the hell and applied. 

I met with the production manager and he conducted a very informal, but very interesting interview. We spent nearly all our time on the shop floor with a lot of back and forth on the what the processes were and the different methods to achieve spec. For some of it he talked to me as if he was training me. The company is expanding and bringing in more instrumentation and inspection equipment ( My dad works in R&amp;D focusing on optics and he said he uses the same equipment in his labs) which I think would be great to learn to use as technician. I asked about why they didn't required any college degree or previous experience and he said that there are just not many opticians in the area, and he made it sound like the other workers didn't have any prior education before hire. 

The manager told me that he had been conducting interviews all week and as of now, I am on the top of the list and he doesn't see that changing with the other interviews he has lined up. They are supposed to call me on Monday and he said to expect good news. So, considering the is literally the first ""real"" job I've applied to, I'm feeling very good about all this. The position is sounds interesting, challenging, requires a high attention to detail, pays well (I think), you can have a strong sense of pride in your work,  the company is small, I get along with my supervisor, and they're likely pay for any further education . Which is like all my dream job requirements.

One of the most important things I've learned from this subreddit is that your first job sets the pace for your career. This job would give me experience making military grade optics and training on industry grade testing equipment. But my education has been more geared towards working with metals, although I'm comfortable learning about working with glass. As of right now, my two main concerns are that I don't know what else is out there, and that taking a position like this would make my education irrelevant. I have a relatively impressive resume for my age so I think I could find another company with interest in me if I looked around more, but I'm questioning if it's worth looking since this seems like a great opportunity.

So would it be a bad move to take this position without looking around more?

Steel belt carrier.

Heater is right now, 12"" above surface, could be lowered.

Material is 25-125um thick. Heater is between two sets of nip rollers. A feed in, and a compression out-feed set, where the material is heated, and then compressed.


So far: I tried long focal length IR thermocouple (Smart IRt/c from Exergen), but always had a problem of it actually reading on the control PID (Red Lion). It's always several hundred degrees off from my wire t/c. Be it on a steel plate, or a sacrificial production material piece. I aim it at the material at a 45deg angle, from about 8"" away....but it's never right. At temp, I can be 200deg off from my wire t/c.
I know, being at an angle isn't good....but I can't get the IRt/c closer, else the ambient gets to high for it to work. I've even gotten 3 different readings using a FLIR camera, the IR, and the wire t/c. I have tried getting the material to processing temp, using the wire t/c as a guide, noting the IRt/x reading on the PID, and then changing the offset/gain on the PID. However....I'm only allowed -99 offset, when I need over 150 unit offset!!! Do I just need a new PID?

So, I guess...how the HELL do people measure hot materials, from a distance, accurately, without buggering up the sensor? I can't add a floating/wire t/c anywhere except on the bottom of the belt, but that is not accurate to find the material temp (thickness changes, intimate contact between material and belt, etc)...... Why are wire t/c's so accurate when plugged right in, yet IR t/c's are so inaccurate along it's scale, and needs to be calibrated AT the process temp?

0,Calculating pressure in a boiler,1505919621,"Hi everyone!

One thing I've been trying to figure out, is how to determine pressure in a boiler mathematically. 
So for example, lets say I have an isolated boiler, 60% liquid inventory and 40% air, at 0 psig. I shut the vents, and start adding heat at some rate. I expect pressure to rise, as I add heat, probably due to liquid expansion along with the initial formation of steam voids. The pressure rise is going to be held at or around the saturation temperature of the steam/water mixture. 

So, for this system I am guessing that pressure can be found by looking at enthalpy added to the system, and looking on where that would put me on a steam table along with how that impacts specific volume of water, and then checking the pressure of the air bubble using a compressible gas equation for the remaining volume? Is that right? (Generally speaking I expect the gas bubble in the top of the boiler to 'control' pressure)

And this kinda leads into what I'm really trying to understand. If I can create a mass energy balance for a boiler how do I figure out what the resultant pressure is? Is the pressure a result of all the other parameters and you then look up a table to find out what the pressure must be to have the balance you have? Or is there a more direct way? Obviously this is complicated but not impossible as software models can do this in relatively real time.

This isn't for any type of work I'm doing. I was just learning a little about how our reactor's simulator does some of its modelling and was trying to figure out 'how' it comes up with pressure.

1,Question on heating a building,1505919477,"If you have a source to put heat into a relatively large  (4 stories, extra wide, three classrooms thick ) building that uses a central heating system,but you only put in that heat at a single location somewhere in the building, say the bottom floor where it is the coldest, will the heating cost saved for the building be approximately equal to the heat input?  
    
The problem is we're working on a way to save on heating expenses. We have a source of heat, but designing a system to evenly distribute the heat over the building would without a doubt ruin the project cost-effectiveness, unless we scaled way up which probably isn't possible. 
    
Say this system is running constantly, 24/hours a day for months. Since it is such a long run time, can the heating expenses saved be approximated as the energy input? Or is it going to be far less than that?

6,Question about floating brake rotor?,1505881686,"Hey everyone, I am a new engineering student at michigan and part of the formula racing team.

One of my tasks is to work with a teammate on the brake rotor design. I have very many questions, and I'll start with the most important one.

I will use this video as reference a lot https://youtu.be/R9YXDcLR_5w?t=5m3s (the first question I have is relevant to 5:03 and beyond)

1) older teammates gave us a task of creating a floating 2 piece brake rotor. So in the video linked above, can anyone explain how the red buttons/cylinders keep the center piece and the outer piece together? It seems to me that it's just a cylinder in between two half circle curves. I'll try to draw it out from bird's eye view but essentially it is just (o), and I don't get how the ""o"" is holding together the ""("" and the "")""

2) I don't know much about cars so this question is mainly about terminology. What exactly does it mean to be 2 pieced or floating (also, does 2 piece mean the same as floating) especially in regards to fixed? For example, if the rotor in the video was fixed, does that mean those red cylinders/buttons would not exist and the center piece and the outer piece would only be one single piece?

3) why floating? can someone explain to me in an eli5 way why we use two pieces in this case? Furthermore, if my assumption from 2) is correct, a one piece fixed rotor seems like it would be like the floating rotor in the video just with all the parts fused together. Wouldn't that be stronger?

4) Is there any video/diagram of an actual brake rotor in action and how it fits with everything else? I can't really picture how it works in my mind right now. For example, I know that the pads press on the rotor to create friction to stop. But is the rotor a part of the wheel and it rotates or is it the brake pads that rotate and the rotor stays stationary?",AskEngineers,michstateuniv,/r/AskEngineers/comments/718pzl/question_about_floating_brake_rotor/

This is a desperate search for a product I have used several years ago. This was a 2 part epoxy that I used (and had been used by others) to pot electronics for deep water immersion (on ROVs, so very deep)

Here is what I remember about it, in no particular order (sorry if I sound like a madman)


I THINK it was from 3M

As I recall the name was simple (like DP40 NOT SR3124), but I suppose the name could have changed since then

Came in 2 parts (in cans)

When mixed together it was grey

Had relatively long cure time (set in say an hour?) 

Relatively thick when mixed (around the constancy of honey) 

Had an odd (not 1:1) mix ratio 



Sorry if this is outside the bounds of this sub, but have spent many hours searching online and cannot seem to find the same stuff, just really hoping someone out there has worked with it before and remembers the name and runs across this post, anything you can offer would be extremely helpful!

22,Pro and cons of having a tire (for city bikes) pumped less than required.,1505847529,"In /r/bicycling I read that tires not fully pumped may produce pinch flats. Anyway it is also true that on /r/bicycling many have road bikes that have relatively small tires.

see https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/X9Z0/HD4VDS9B/FU1X9Z0HD4VDS9B.LARGE.jpg

Instead city bikes have quite a large tire therefore I think that even with a tire a bit less pumped, a pinch flat is way less likely.

see http://sc02.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1.s2bLFXXXXX1XVXXq6xXFXXXm/3-0-fat-cream-tire-city-bike.jpg

In my experience (city bike) I observed that, when I am lazy letting the inner tire pressure falling from the recommended 300 - 400 kPascal to 200-300 kPa, riding the bike seems way more comfortable. I have a bit more friction with the road so I have to put a tiny bit more energy in the riding action, but in contrast the comfort raises a lot.

So I was wondering, on a technical side, is it only that? I trade more friction for more comfort, or are there other factors?",AskEngineers,pier4r,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7158d2/pro_and_cons_of_having_a_tire_for_city_bikes/

I'm trying to convince management (in particular finance) to purchase a piece of test equipment (specifically a HALT chamber).  I keep getting turned around in the business case because I really need to prove two things

1. The reliability testing is worth doing and will save us money (less failed units in the field)
2. It is better in the long run to Buy the equipment ourselves instead of outsourcing it to a test house (where we won't have the equipment to properly monitor health during the test).

I also am having difficulty putting hard numbers on the savings because its hard to come up with an accurate cost for replacing failed units since we repair them and my data on root cause is not that good.

The question still remains standing. 

Probably for large vertical axles they used stone-nuts? (And there, how did they ensure the wood would not work itself off too fast and still spin relatively smoothly).

For horizontal axles, if they used metal half-rings (I don't know the exact term) the wood axle would slowly start digging into it, which would not be a good solution as well.

So, how did they do it? How did they make machines work, just with mostly wood?

Additionally, with the materials and possibilities they had back then, do we now know of better methods than they had?

EDIT: The method for vertical axles seems to be already answered, but the real question now is how exactly they did it with vertical ones, as this problem seems to be way more difficult to actually do in practice.",AskEngineers,WPLibrar2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/713iyz/what_methods_did_they_use_in_medieval_times_to/

My question for you guys is: how valuable are personal projects to potential employers? And how do you go about telling an employer about your personal projects. For example, I had an idea today to use a Raspberry pi or Arduino to make an Inertial Navigation aid for when GPS goes out or something as a project. Perhaps similar to how Aircraft keep navigation with inertial systems I guess. Do employers really care about stuff like this? I'm going to assume someone has done what I want to do before since it doesn't seem like a new idea, does that fact diminish the ""experience"" I'd get by doing a project like this?

42,Dealing with engineers,1505789210,"Does anyone have advice or experience on how to deal with engineers or engineering politics?  Or in all seriousness, do you have ideas for other career suggestions?  I'm in a pickle.

I've ended up becoming brilliant in my ~9 yr design engineering career and it's a burden.  Every engineer has an idea of the ""best design"", but I am continually stuck on programs where I have 0 control over what's going on and just have to watch the imminent train wrecks recurring over and over again.

I went to a new company to try to alleviate the issues, but it's even worse to the point where it might even be unethical, e.g. no design documentation/verification like trade studies, mathematical models, quotes for competing designs.

The subcontracted engineers have no experience in this field and their design decisions are based on half-baked off-the-cuff speculation.  I was hired as an engineer, but functionally I am a consultant.  I am not involved in the design process, so I can only speak my mind.  Everyone ignores that, because engineers are stubbornly espoused to their ideas.

I tried to get an experienced company involved for the testing of a component to help highlight a design point I had, and I was told ""no"" for dubious reasons.

So, I tried to prove my point by designing one component better.  My simplifications (eliminating the wildly unnecessary features) would save $10,000 or maybe 20% per unit.  I have historically avoided FEA, so when I was showing my results I mentioned I wanted to learn / apply Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain to confirm my results and I was told ""no!  there's too much else to do"".  I know enough about Roark's to know that it's easy to do in this case.  I am also concerned no one else knew.

Then they asked me to work on this spreadsheet.  I have almost 2,000 hrs of experience managing these from my last job (part of the reason I left, boring).  I added and filled out a column of information because not tracking it caused pain at my last job.  Someone goes in and deletes it without telling me.

Even more frightening, the higher up I look on this program the more it seems like a jobs program; i.e., trying to raise my concerns with upper managers won't be very effective.

47,Do I need a graduate degree to have the career I want?,1505783615,"I'm sorry for how long this turned out to be.

**Career Goal:** Medical device industry at a site from 100-1000 employees on the west coast of US (California ideally, more on location later). Ideally in R&amp;D, but I find manufacturing fairly interesting as well. I don't want to get stuck in quality. I want a big emphasis on creating marketable products and w/ a timeline and project deadlines and such. Eventually wouldn't mind moving into a managerial role, but one where I don't completely lose any technical/lab aspect of my job, but just that I would also manage the project (maybe people? I'm not sure yet).

**Background:**

* Education: BS in Bioengineering from a state university in the midwest, graduated in December 2016 with a 3.79 GPA

* Experience: 

 1 summer internship at a government contractor in life sciences in the aerospace industry 

 1 summer internship at the corporate headquarters of a large medical device company in an R&amp;D group (midwest)
 
 1 summer internship at a smaller site of the same company (~200 employees) in the R&amp;D group (west coast)

 4 months as a contract employee in the R&amp;D group at the same company &amp; site after graduation

 2 years in a biomedical signal analysis lab (10 hours/week) at my university

**Current Situation/Dilemma:** I planned to go to graduate school in materials science (with an emphasis on med device applications). I wasn't sure when I was applying whether I wanted a master's or PhD. Most of my mentors pushed a PhD since I want an R&amp;D role. I am primarily trying to make up for my poor choice in undergraduate major (seriously kids, do a traditional engineering major) and I have a special interest in materials science as a subject (but perhaps not a career?). Most of the people at the midwest site of the medical device company seemed to think both those reasons were logical, and many of them in the group I worked in had either a master's or PhD. Most of the people at the west coast site of the same company seemed to think that I definitely do not need a graduate degree to have the career I want, and only one out of the team of ~15 I worked on had a master's (neither of the manager's had a higher level degree). One of the managers told me they would definitely not hire me with a PhD because the budget isn't there to hire someone with that qualification and they don't see it as a necessity in the field. This is the reason I bring up location--I'm finding key differences, perhaps in culture (?), between the locations, and seeing as I want to get back to the west coast (maybe not that exact site, though I wouldn't say no), I'm wondering if my currently pursuing a PhD is wasting my time and energy. It's worth mentioning that my manager from the site on the west coast all but told me that if they had a position available and I was searching, that I could come back full time. They'd also be a really good reference if I asked.

I am enrolled in a PhD program in materials science on the east coast currently. I recognize I'm only over a month into this, but even the breadth (not depth) of knowledge I'm gaining in one of my classes is just....I'm not into it. It's not that it's that difficult, I just am having trouble caring or motivating myself to learn to pass a test and I don't find the material that interesting. Additionally, I don't really like the melting together of work/school and life that I see among my peers. I want separate and a good work/life balance where I could take the dogs out for a walk after work for example, and I don't want to compete about who stayed in the lab the latest, etc. The strive for prestige and publications in academia is something I knew I'd dislike, since I knew I didn't want to stay in academia, and I definitely do dislike both. This is probably more of a personal problem, but I see myself devolving into a really anxious and stressed person during a PhD, when normally I'm pretty happy-go-lucky. I'm not sure the sacrifice is worth it, still working that out.

The reason I mentioned in my career goals that I want deadlines is because there's always a division of work among engineers and you come together to (hopefully) complete a part of the project before a deadline. It's so much more fluid in academia, very loose deadlines and very much at your own pace, and I don't like that either (maybe a reason I have a hard time finding motivation). And while my project in my PhD would be cool, I'd be an expert in that very specific field and I'm afraid that nobody would want to hire me knowing I'm an expert in x because that's probably not what they're working on and I'd have high salary expectations. I'm asking about this now because I feel I could justify in an interview why I haven't worked since May but if I continue longer than maybe December in grad school, I think I'd have to talk about how I dropped out of a PhD program, and I'm not sure of the nuances of that or how a hiring manager would see it (being a quitter/incapable? I have no idea).

TL;DR: I just want to create medical devices. I don't know if my BS in a mediocre engineering field + a bit of experience in medical devices can get me to the career I want. How would you approach this?

I want to replace it with stainless or aluminum, but cost is an issue, and I have a few questions. 

The trailer is about 30' long. I have been told that with an aluminum frame this size, the amount of welding may compromise the integrity. I have absolutely no clue how I could change the design to bolt together. I've also learned of galvanic corrosion, and I still am clueless as to how much of a problem that may pose.

Stainless is very expensive, it seems especially so when formed or manufactured into structural shapes.  I'm afraid I don't know enough to deviate too far from the original design. My plan was to copy most of the materials exactly, but substituting stainless steel. I would like to know if I could use a more affordable option such as I-beam, smaller square or rectangular tubes(perhaps stitched together), or C-channel. I work in a large welding/machine shop which also gives me the option of forming my own tube, or channels in maximum lengths of 12', so the would need to be spliced as opposed to the material I could get cut to length.

I have looked at Boston gear's helical gear catalog trying to figure out their Transverse DP and thus their center distance from their list but nothing is making sense. Using a caliper I measured the Outer diameter of the 12 tooth gear as close to 33.5 mm and the pitch diameter close to 30 mm which gives me 1.2 inches as the Pitch dia.

But for the 41 tooth gear, I measured an OD of around 94.5 mm and assuming pitch diameter close to 3.5 inches (88.9 mm). However, knowing that gears have to be off the same PD to mesh, a 40 tooth gear from their catalog has a PD of 4 inches. So... it then means that a 41 tooth gear has a different DP than 10, that off the 12 teeth gear.

76,"Converted a 3 phase hoist to single phase, need help with pulleys and torque",1505709568,"Hi all, apologies if this isnt the right sub, i looked around and it seems fitting for my questions.

Anyways, I have a 2 post screw type hoist that i got for an absolute bargain, so i installed it in my backyard. It had a 3 phase 4kw motor fitted to it, but i have replaced that with a single phase 3kw motor. I went single phase as it was going to be stupidly expensive to get 3 phase connected to my property, it was also too expensive to get a VFD or phase changer. those 3 options were more expensive than buying a brand new single phase (hydraulic) hoist.
I went with the 3kw motor as i was able to get one that had twice as much torque for half the speed.
Its a 4 pole 1200rpm motor with a 80mm drive pulley on it. The other major point of the 3kw motor is the peak start up load is 21A, which makes it a lot more feasible to run of my current house wiring without needing to run a complete new circuit.
It'll run fine up and down with no load, but with my tiny car on it (900kg) it'll struggle once its half way up.
Im looking at changing the driven pulley (200mm) for a larger one (upto 400mm) but im trying to understand how it'll go before i start buying parts.
I found a calculator online to bang some numbers into and i know i have the space to double the driven pulley size, which should in effect halve the lift speed but double the torque output of the motor yea? Im not too concerned about it taking longer to lift, its only for my hobby cars, not a business.
My big question is, and this is the bit im struggling to understand, If i put a bigger driven pulley on the hoist, will the motor still require the same amount of power? Or will it run better because its not under as much load because there is more toque being applied through the pulley ratio?
Currently the load is causing the motor to bog down, drawing too much current and tripping the breakers.
I guess im kind of thinking of it like driving up a hill, you can do it in 3rd and it'll struggle and bog down, or change gears into 1st, crawl slowly but effortlessly to the top.",AskEngineers,m34tbag,/r/AskEngineers/comments/70srfo/converted_a_3_phase_hoist_to_single_phase_need/

Sorry if this isn't the place to ask this kind of question.

When I apply KVL around the outer loop, I get:

Vdep -10i +10i = 0

This can't be right but I don't see how it's wrong. The current has to be going through the negative terminal of the 10ohm resistor on the top because of the current sources, making the voltage drop negative because it's going from a low to high voltage. This would also make the current through it negative from ohms law, how is this even possible?

So I'm a sophomore looking to build what will basically be an automated mini press machine, kind of like [this](https://goo.gl/images/iKdShb)

I'd like to build it from the ground up creating everything in solid works and then send it off to the machine shop for the parts to be fabricated. I'm hoping to control everything with an arduino and possibly integrate other thing in as well. I don't really want to make something serious products with it, just as a fun hands on project that I think will help me learn the practical aspects of both mechanical and electrical (I'm a mech - so the electronic stuff might be a challenge but worth learning). 

The problem is I've never done anything like this before, let alone machine design. I've only just become reasonable at using solidworks and I don't even know how arduinos or electronics work, and I don't have much hands on skills beyond the basics. In fact I'm pretty useless at everything I will be attempting! 

So my question is where can I find some reference material on this? Am I biting off more than I can chew? Mcmaster has some good drawings, are there any other resources like this that deal with these types of mechanisms?

But I feel that 34k is a little rediculas. Maybe not in missisipi for a starting grad because you can rent a 1 bedroom for extremely cheap but after taxes it's only like 2k a month if that. 

And this whole time I've been in school I've been told to expect 45 to 55k as a starting salary with 45 on the conservative and 55 in the middle.

Can all of you clear this up for me. I really want to set my expectation properly because those are absolutely key to having a happy life in my opinion and I don't want to be blindsided by somthing as big as that I mean I won't even be able to comftorably start a family with that.

24,(Graduate) Technical work or Project Management?,1505505538,"MEng graduate in mechanical engineering currently employed as a graduate mechanical engineer on a 2 year grad scheme working for a large construction company in the UK. The scheme is accredited by the IMechE and encourages working towards chartership as you complete 2 x 1 year placements in different projects within the business.

My questions is; is my role technical enough?

Currently working on site I am at the forefront of the installation of mechanical technology (pumps, penstocks, pipelines, screens) through managing subcontractors and liaising with other teams (civils, finance, SHE). However I feel that I am missing out on technical aspects of engineering which I studied for 5 years at university. The role feels more project management related with some design work, but is mainly geared towards implementing designs and problem solving throughout the install.

At this early stage in my career I am worried that I will end up with expertise in project management, which isn't a bad thing, but in my mind having technical expertise developed early in your career allows you to develop into a more well rounded engineer so when/if you move into project management you are more clued up on what is going on.

My current plan is to complete the grad scheme and make a more informed decision at the end whilst working towards chartership throughout. Will this narrow my options into only project management type jobs in the future?

33,What is the best way to increase the inertia of a flywheel in a drivetrain?,1505454280,"I'm working on a project, hybridizing a car and have recently run into a snag. It is a P2 architecture with the engine, followed by a motor, followed by the transmission, all directly coupled. There is a torque converter located between the motor and the transmission but there is no dampening mechanism between the engine and the motor, which I am worried will ultimately cause the shaft coupling the engine and motor to fail due to torque oscillations (the engine is an inline P4 with a single mass flywheel).

The obvious solution would be to toss out the single mass and stick in a dual mass flywheel but due to packaging constraints (about 2 inches total) there is no way I'd be able to fit that in there along with the adapter for the splined shaft. I've gone through a number of different dampening ideas but the only one I think is viable in the given space is increasing the inertia of the single mass flywheel. Of course to increase the inertia I need to increase the mass and I can do that by changing the density or the volume. I am currently using stainless steel with a density of 7800 kg/m^3 with the flywheel being about an inch thick

So I suppose that I have three potential questions. What alternative materials would be sufficient to change the flywheel to? Are there alternative ways of increasing inertia that I am overlooking? Are there alternative ways of introducing dampening that I am overlooking?

38,Getting a career back on track after a lengthy hiatus due to illness?,1505440743,"**tl;dr:** Had to leave my PhD program due to illness three years ago, have since recovered, now trying to get some semblance of a career going again.

Hey y'all,

I'm at a difficult point in my life and I'm hoping for some professional advice from people on the other side of things.

6.5 years ago I finished my MS in aerospace engineering at a top public research university.

5 years ago I was making solid progress on a PhD at the same school. Then I got sick. Almost overnight I went from being in the best physical condition of my life to feeling constant fatigue like I'd never known and feeling like I was passing broken glass through my intestines every day. After a ridiculous 5 month process I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. 

I thought I could continue with school, no problem. Things seemed good when I got on some strong meds soon after diagnosis, but they eventually stopped working. This would happen over and over; start a new drug, feel okay for a while, then relapse within a month or two. After 2.5 years of trying to make it work with school, I just couldn't do it anymore. I was sleeping 10-12 hours a day because of the constant fatigue but I had research, teaching duties, and my own classwork. Something had to give, and it was my research. It was at a stand still for almost two years, and although I'd somehow managed to pass my written PhD qualifying exams, I just felt like I was spinning my wheels and wasting what little time my university allowed me to be funded as a TA or RA.

I took a medical leave, hoping to get my condition under control and return within a year. I latched onto the only way I could still earn money to keep a roof over my head -- it's creative work I started doing freelance (totally unrelated to engineering, comes from a hobby). It was never meant to be a career move, it was just an act of desperation because I had no one else to turn to; no family or spouse to lean on in my time of need, no disability insurance, etc. It worked because I could do it on the good days, and suffer through the bad days without getting fired. It is not sustainable as a career, however, nor do I want to do it for the rest of my life. 

Today, around 3 years after I left my program, I'm finally feeling great again. About 10 months ago, after a ton of BS with my doctor's incompetent office staff and my stingy health insurance company, I managed to get on a drug that actually works. I feel almost normal again, and I've been ready to try to get my career back on track for months, but it has been difficult. 

My resume has a huge void of engineering work -- my MS was in 2010, my last engineering job was an internship in summer 2012. After that the only thing on my resume is grad school stuff -- teaching and doing research, which ends in 2014 with no PhD. After that it's basically just ""worked for myself on a freelance creative thing,"" which means nothing to anyone looking to hire an engineer. So far I've been getting zero response on job applications (unsurprisingly). Even the only aerospace company local to me totally ignored multiple applications to different positions I believe I am qualified for, even with two employee recommendations (friends I have who work/worked there). I know they are in a hiring frenzy across the board, and the fact that an interview would cost them nothing but the time someone would spend talking to me and they still couldn't be bothered is very disheartening.

It has been very frustrating, and I'm rapidly losing hope that I'll be able to pick up anything from my previous life to move forward with.

I've thought about going back to grad school to finish, but my adviser retired, and even if I found a new one who had an interest in my niche research topic, the university has a limit on the number of long semesters I can be funded as a grad student through teaching or research. I only have 2 semesters left because I burned through so many trying to make things work while fighting the worst years of my illness. Realistically it would probably take me a good 3 years of work to finish my PhD assuming all these other factors magically lined up. I did not grow up rich, and I have nothing right now but hand-to-mouth level income and a lot of debt because of my situation, so the prospect of taking out a ton of loans when I could just find myself in this position again is beyond terrifying.

**My question is this** -- how can I pitch myself to employers, given my circumstances (being out of the game for so long), and have them actually give me a second glance? I can't (and feel reluctant to) put anything about my past illness in my resume or on a cover letter, because I feel like if I go half-way and say ""I left my PhD program because of illness"" the natural assumption is ""this guy had a nervous breakdown, i.e. he is unreliable, HARD PASS."" The full truth is not much better: ""this guy is probably gonna get sick again at some point and just cause problems, let's make up some other rationalization that's not illegal so we can hire someone else.""

39,Any Biological Systems Engineers on here? What type of work do you guys do and how much do you enjoy it?,1505430895,"Hey everyone so I'm a 27 year old male at somewhat of a career impasse. My original undergraduate was a B.A. in Environmental Studies and a Minor in GIS and Spanish. I'm a huge idealist and I got into Environmental work trying to save the planet. Unfortunately because I had a B.A. and it wasn't very heavy on Science I've been pigeon holed into boring jobs where I don't really feel like I'm making a difference and just pushing paper, I also have ADHD and thrive on high stimuli. I've done some research and some people suggested I look into Engineering as a profession where I could make a bit more of a difference. My state university(UW-Madison) allows non-engineering undergraduates into their Biological Systems Engineering M.S. program as long as you complete the prerequisites and of course have good grades and test scores.  The specializations available in the M.S. are Natural Resources, Food and Bioprocess and Machinery Systems. I was just wondering if anyone had a degree in this type of Engineering or something similar and would be willing to share if they liked it, how they enjoyed their job, and if they feel like they are making a difference and not just a paper pusher.

1. Probability and Applied Statistics - I haven't taken a course on this in 8 years and don't remember a lot about stats.

2. Large-Scale Neural Data Analysis - PhD level special topics course on analysis of neurological signals. Unsure if I have the stochastic processes background for the course, the instructor believes I'd be fine considering some of the BME students in the class don't have very strong technical backgrounds, but I'm unsure, hence the above course.

I have 11 years experience in the oil and gas market and had a very good salary in the US, living in Chicago, and a very comfortable lifestyle. I married a British woman and we moved to the UK. I was able to transfer with my company and maintain about the same salary converted USD to GBP, however this took a lot of negotiation, as the initial offer from HR based on my ""job title search"" gave me a salary in the UK that was less than my initial starting salary in the US in 2006! I basically laughed at them....and we got it sorted out to something more realistic (HR was not understanding what they were surveying and the managers had to tell them what was up). But I have not really been thrilled with my job and have considering looking elsewhere...the problem is....UK salaries for engineering jobs look terrible. I'm assuming part of this is the oil and gas adder, but in general engineering jobs in UK look to pay well below that in the US.

I've seen some threads on here discussing this, but is it really accurate that a degreed engineer makes like £30-35k? If so it looks like I'm stuck in my current career because i can't justify a 40-50% reduction in salary due to the cost of living here.

Something about the numbers in the UK just doesn't make sense to me...average household income vs housing prices, and yet every other car on the road seems to be a BMW/Audi/Jaguar/Merc.

I'm one year away from finishing a 3-2 program at an Ivy League, which will earn me an ABET accredited degree. I've just earned my physics BA.

My answer involved surveying the area during peak time to see how many people are going through the area, and what % of those people are using the restroom.

This answer would be in terms of gallons per minute, which you can directly relate to the diameter of the water main for the restroom.

And the software does this all automatically.

This is some of the optimization you'll start and then end with when using some of these tools:

http://1xoh014blkn1d5wlbgjf846u.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/solidThinking-Inspire-300x191.png

 Anyways, so this is all good and fine for certain specific industries where weight is very important (aerospace and some automotive), but let's be honest here, most aren't.  So have you actually used any of these automated tools and put any of the parts generated with these programs into production? 

I see many of these parts and any minor savings in material usage has to be offset with a *ton* more machining. We usually try to minimize machining as much as possible, and yet these usually wacky looking shapes generated by an algorithm have very organic curves and lots of hollowed out spaces meaning they'll be spending a lot of (expensive) time on some fancy 4+ axis machines.

I also fear that like with most simulation results, it's garbage in, garbage out.  You might have a part that meets the loads specified in the simulation, but *only* those loads.  If a part is being used in an orientation not expected or in a situation where the forces weren't fully understood , this FEA generated part will fail dramatically.

51,Having Issue With Rotor Balancing Machine - Need Some Mechanical Engineer Insight (Decreasing Speed Issue),1504995344,"Hi everyone,

I hope someone can help me out with this issue I've been having with my rotor balancing machine. I purchased a balancing machine to balance turbocharger components (turbine shaft and compressor wheel assembly) a few months ago. The issue I'm having is that the speed on the turbine decreases when under tension with the belt. With no belt tensions on the motor pulley the speed remains constant. When taking readings with the including software I'm pretty sure the speed of the rotor needs to remain constant as well so that the results given for weight correction are consistent. 

I've already had the manufacturer send me a brand new speed controller and have had the same result. They just recently shipped me a brand new motor and I was hoping that would've solved the problem but unfortunately I'm faced with the same dilemma. I've tried adjusting a lot of things on the machine but can't seem to figure out why the turbine speed is decreasing. I've tried using less tension on the belt (as loose as possible without risking the rotor flying off of the supports). 

I've ruled out the speed controller and now the motor itself (unless this model motor simply can't maintain speed when under a load). It's a 1/6 HP Dayton motor (model # 4Z528D). 

Any thoughts? The manufacturer's tech support isn't that great and I've contacted them numberous times trying to figure out what it is that I'm doing wrong... Thanks in advance!

52,Vision Checkerboard Calibration Question,1504994221,"I have a system that is utilizing the PatMax &amp; Find Circle, but sometimes the system will need to be calibrated. So, I talked to Cognex support to understand the SDK to learn how to calibrate when a variable is equal to 0. I also realized I have to grab the calibration image. However, when I grab the calibration image the calibrated origin may move a little due to movement of the plate (I'm using a plate with fiducial marks, and it is Cognex supplied). This leads to the main point…

Does anyone know a way I can Grab the calibration image, and offset the calibrated origin to the center of the frame, but instead of it giving the position of 0,0 in millimeters (size of our square tiles are 3.175 in both X &amp; Y), we would like the calibrated pixel position, or even better, find a way to put the origin in the center POST calibration.

Our problem is that we're measuring a circle’s origin and it needs to be to the thousandth position in accuracy, so that is why this is so important. I've using the Find Circle tool to basically serve as a corrected positioning system for a system later in the process. So offsets are EXTREMELY important. I'm aware that I can use the uncalibrated point, but that isn’t acceptable for this application, as the entire point of calibration is to correct any distortion. I just need a way to get the Raw Calibrated Origin point every time in Pixels.

This is essentially the same thing that has to be done with Robot Guided Vision, and Cognex is the leader in respects to that. So, it must be a common action. I'm using Cognex Designer 2.6 (with Vision Pro libraries)

One solution I thought of was telling it to calibrate with no fiducial even though there is one, because I saw in the Cognex knowledge base that it could be a potential solution. I'm trying that now, but I've tried everything else, to no avail.

I'm curious as to if anyone else has had this issue, or if someone has figured it out. Thank you all!",AskEngineers,Landon22,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6z4i44/vision_checkerboard_calibration_question/

I know this question has been posted before, but I have a slightly different experience than the other threads I've found, so I thought I'd ask.

I'm about to start my final year, and will be graduating at the end of May/June 2018 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I haven't had an internship, despite genuinely wanting one, due to other commitments.

I keep hearing that it will be difficult to get a job without having done an internship. I wish I could have done one, or planned everything out better to make time for one. Despite that, I personally think I have some good things on my resume, but I'm just worried that they're not *relevant* enough. I was wondering if someone could look at the basics of my achievements. 

- 3.84 GPA (Dean's list nearly every semester, etc.)
- Exchange in Australia (six months)
- Exchange in the UK (one year)
- One year of physics-related research (was originally studying physics)
- Teaching Assistant (Differential Equations, one semester)
- Other activities, and jobs like grading and tutoring

I hope I'm not worrying about this needlessly. Despite what I've already done, do you think not having done an internship will impact me negatively? What do you think? Does anyone have any advice or a similar experience?

So here’s my situation. Recently graduated with a BS in a STEM field. Job hunted for a few months due to poor networking and no internships. Only a few school projects and some freelance work. Well, I finally got my big break by getting not 1, but 2 job offers. Problem is, I have no idea which one to choose, and I’m hoping that the denizens of Reddit can help me out. So here’s my offer in greater detail:

Offer #1 as Electrical Engineer

-	I work for a private electrical installation company. It’s in the top 10 in North America, mainly concentrated on building projects in the east coast.
-	They plan on training me ASAP – both on the field and on the computer.
-	Pay is…decent for an entry level position with no experience whatsoever. $18, with increases per good performance every 6 months.
-	I interviewed with them. I must’ve worked my magic with them, because the very next day they offered me the job.
-	Commute is 3 hours in total.
-	Full-time permanent position, complete with overtime possibility and benefits.

Offer #2 as Automotive Technician

-	I work for an international Fortune 500 company that manufactures in automotive parts.
-	They plan on training me ASAP, teaching me car mechanics, testing, and whatnot.
-	Pay is $25, with more money upon full-time position.
-	I got this job from a recruiter. After walking in the recruiter’s office and handed my resume, I get a call from my recruiter 3 hours later saying that the company wants me to work for them ASAP. So…no interview. In fact, I haven’t even talked to my future boss, or went to the place I will be working. They…just wanted me after seeing my resume &amp; LinkedIn profile.
-	Commute is 2 hours total.
-	Temporary full-time position. 1st 3 months are basically a trial period. However, my recruiter said that there’s a very good chance that they’ll take me in full-time (90% of staff has been filled by my recruiter's company, and they have a good working relationship). Then overtime and benefits kick in.
-	Strangely enough, the job itself isn't posted on their website/LinkedIn/Indeed. However, they are hiring plenty of other engineering positions. You think I can move my way up into the company?

84,Wind turbines?,1504849629,"Still in college for mechanical engineering, and electrical is my weak area, but still wanting to learn so bear with me.. If I understand right, In class we learned that induction generators work according to Faraday's law of induction where voltage generated depends on area of the coil and rpm. But looking at wind turbines I see the power output is dependent on air density, wing area, and wind speed. So assuming they have the same amount of current, why isn't it better to have a small wing that rotates at higher rpm rather than a large wing rotating at low rpm? Are there different generators that do work at higher rpm, say like 50,000? And also, if the goal is to push the roater faster than it's inputting, is there a limit as to how much faster you can go? Does faster = more power?

With closed throttle compression ratio is low, with throttle fully open compression ratio is high. Efficiency depends on compression ratio. The higher the better. A motor is most efficient at full throttle.

I'm working with small models of pile foundations and to see if they are similar to real life pile foundations I'm trying to predict certain properties. I have tested these in a simulated environment with sand simulating the soil as well as a press to simulate the load of a structure and I've recorded settlement of the pile foundation. 

At first I tried to look at ultimate load capacity but due to test limitations it's impossible to compare without repeating every test. 

So now I'm looking at how to predict/calculate the settlement of a pile foundation which I can then compare to my results but I cannot for the life of me find an equation or method of predicting settlement. Maybe I'm just blind and/or tired but I've been searching for 2 hours now and haven't gotten any results.

16,Why do you believe hiring practices and evaluations have not standardized in software jobs as they have in most other STEM careers?,1504734140,"I'm an experienced software developer curious about opinions from other perspectives. There's been an interesting discussion of the CS Careers subreddit about what the future of technical interviews and evaluations would look like. Even though the title ""software engineer"" is ubiquitous in the programming industry, in the US we are not engineers legally speaking. But comparisons have been made to traditional STEM jobs at least a few times in the topic.

Some programmers there stated that they have gotten so sick of the convoluted interviews with little rhyme or reason that they plan to change professions to something more grounded and ""respectable"" including other STEM jobs. Programming *can* be a lucrative career (not always) but interviewing is filled with too many uncertainties.

Heads up: long thread / semi-rant ahead.

**The problem**

The general consensus there is, which I agree is on the following:

The difference in computer science/software interviews, and interviews in pretty much all other STEM-related fields is fascinating and sometimes unsettling.

In software interviews, you have to jump through hoops, algorithm problems within a time limit and in general be ready to cover everything (on-the-job training to fill in skills gaps is a dying trend).

In engineering, they ask you mostly personality questions, and sometimes test you only on relevant things to your job. 

Communication skills are required all around. But, at least in software engineering, there is no single indicative test that is being used as a standard for evaluating the technical skills. It's all over the place, and that's a problem for many experienced people that feel insulted by some of the interviews.

From my own personal experience and hardships of finding a new jobs (in spite of software careers being the current ""hotness"") I can agree at least on the former. Practice for interviews is like another skillset all of its own and orthogonal to what is actually done at work.

An anecdote: I have years of web development experience but have recently gotten a short contract job that involves optimization of a game engine and graphics development. Game dev (in particular graphics) is much more complex than development of most web CRUD apps. In a recent interview I was given a coding test which took too long in my opinion. Despite having a few years of web MVC framework experience, they also wanted code samples of said web MVC code.

I get the feeling that interviewers are a lot less trusting in your skills and background, and want to be 99% sure that you can solve any software-related problem on your own, without any provided training.

**What some suggest for a solution**

Ideally, it would be better if programmers could just take one license test- be it periodic, every 5 years, or every year, etc. and that's it, rather than having to literally pass a highly opinionated and different test for EVERY job. Sometimes the job just makes you implement a data structure while talking over the phone. Sometimes they will give you an whiteboard test. Sometimes it's a take home test where you code some throwaway web app that could take 6-8 hours.

In short, there's too much time spent on preparing and re-focusing and that wastes time on both ends. The average interview process- not counting any take-home test projects, is 5 hours, longer than a standardized test, requiring study of algorithms, studying of framework trivia, that takes longer than the GRE. A lot of people don't tolerate this anymore.

If we are to call ourselves software engineers, we need to be held accountable to quality standards to the level that other engineers do. But code quality is like, well, all over the place. Unless we pass the PE are not yet *professional* engineers.

And speaking of PE, I have recently been aware of PE examination for software developers, but the volume of participation there is very low compared to other PE's. More telling, though, is that I have not come across any employer that takes this exam into consideration for their hiring.

**Back to the main question**

Why do you believe standardization hasn't caught on in software jobs? Could it be a high fault tolerance in company interviews (okay with rejecting many false negatives as long as it weeds out false positives)? I personally think it has to do with how quickly the field grew and evolved. There's probably so much ground to cover it will make the heads of regulatory organizations spin.

I am interested in learning a great amount about the realities of a problem that is very well known globally, which is that potholes and road cracks/wear &amp; tear can be found on concrete/asphalt streets across Colorado, and in some cases can cause significant damages to motor vehicles when those road damages are driven over.

20,Protecting a SPDT relay driving a reversible inductive load.,1504720359,"I have a PLC controlling an electric ball valve (120VAC, 0.5A). It uses a PLC's output with an isolation relay (automationdirect 781-1C-12D) to ""Call to Open"" when energized, and the lack of output from the PLC uses the NC contact of the relay to energize the CLOSE winding of the motor. While it's not a problem during normal operation since the valve uses limit switches to interrupt the windings, I have had backfed spikes/regeneration kill the contacts of a relay after the customer abuses the ability to manually override the valve with a HOA by changing the direction while it is in motion. I have been looking into LC&amp;RC snubbers, but I'm unsure if this will provide a reliable fix. And if so, would it be best in parallel with both inductive loads or bridging the OPEN and CLOSE windings with the snubber?

It is like a pedal car that is propelled by moving a handle forward and back.  I need a way to convert the back and forth motion from the handle into a circular motion to drive the wheels.  

My current idea was to use a child's bike rear wheel as the rear wheel of the cart.  I thought a crank and slider idea would work.  I'd connect a piece of metal to the bottom of the handle and connect the metal to the chain ring from the bike to act as a slider.  So the handle would go back and forth and move the slider, slider would move the chain ring, and the chain ring would move the chain attached to the tire a la a regular bike.  

I built a model of the crank and slider using cardboard to test out the idea.  It will spin about 180 degrees, then reverse direction.  Is there a simple way to have it continue in the circle without reversing direction?  Would a spring or elastic work?

35,[Geotech] is anyone here familiar with Optum G2 and the Bolton Model? Specifically deriving the Bolton Model parameters.,1504692364,"Apologies for the title but I was trying to be somewhat concise.

Ok so, Im working on my honors thesis and my supervisor has directed me to derive the Bolton model parameters that I will use in my Optum model.

To do this he has provided me with two plots; one is a normal stress vs. peak friction angle (with line of best fit equations) and a normal stress vs. peak dilation angle with the same equations.

He has also directed me to the Bolton model section of the manual and told me to use the equations there. I can provide these equations to anyone willing/able to help.

To start I have set up a spreadsheet where I have plotted the normal stress (from 1 to 100) against the friction angle and dilation angle, using the line of best fit equations). Now I need to determine a way to use the Bolton Model equations to make the same plots and edit the parameters (Q, b, R and beta) until both plots are as close to one another as possible. Whatever final values I have will be my input parameters.

I have hit a wall, the parameters I need (Q, R, beta and b) are functions of Ir (relative dilatancy) and from that I can calculate the friction angle and dilation angle. However I am unsure how to relate the mean stress in the equation to the normal stress in order to come up with a range of values not just a single value for a single mean stress.

38,"Help, will working for Federal Government kill future career possibilities?",1504668822,"I'm a federal government employee within a branch the Department of Defense as an electronics engineer. However this is by title only as my official title is a ""cyber systems analyst"". The catch is I'm a hands on engineer, meaning my passion is building electronic devices, working in CAD, composing BOMs, testing, soldering, programming MCUs, FPGAs, etc. My job as a fed is writing reports on reports, I kid you not, that's it (two to three reports a year). Also, the starting salary is WAY below the private industry.

If would of been properly briefed about the nature of the job I would of turned it down and found a job in the private sector (I was mildly led to believe the job was actual engineering). However, I am here now and due to various circumstances I am in the position for at least another year, likely two. My question is how is this going to effect my future career prospects. I can't imagine finding a hands on type position when all I can show on my resume is a few reports (they are not even technical reports!). What about salary, how am I going to be able to negotiate any semblance of a decent salary when I have low grade fed salary for two years?

OK, yes, I wanted to rant a bit, but my concerns are growing daily as my creatively dwindles from the stereotypical bureaucratic trappings of government (I did not think it was going to be as bad as it actually is!) My current stop gap is working personal projects like making an Android app to control WS2811b lighting, 3D printing electronic enclosures, and building RC cars. But non of that is engineering work on a professional level.

Before I explain my situation I want to make it clear that I am not saying that I am too good for my current job, nor better than anyone else because I have a degree. I am just hoping for some advice from people who are/have been in the same situation as I am. I graduated in my with a BSME in May, and I joined the engineering world full time at a company that supplies engineering services to other companies that are typically in the machine design sector. The work that I have been doing feels like it's mostly grunt work which is understandable as I just started. My major worry is that it doesn't seem that the workload gets much better, judging by the work that the veterans here do. My current workload has almost no technical challenges, and there are several employees that do the same work as I do who are interns and individuals who went to school for their associates degree. I would like to have a career that challenges me and puts my degree to use which doesn't seem too probable at my current company.

41,Should I ask the President of the company for a letter of recommendation?,1504659682,"Hey everyone, tomorrow is the last day of my internship at a machine shop and I'm wondering if I should get multiple letters of recommendation. I worked mostly under a supervisor that ran a subdivision of the company who I interacted with multiple times every day the whole summer. I'm definitely going to ask him for one. My only question is, should I ask for a recommendation from the President or the Vice President of the company? I'm hesitant just because I didn't interact with them a whole lot and they don't exactly know what kind of work I've been doing. The President, in particular, I rarely saw or spoke too. The Vice President, on the other hand, was the one I emailed to get the internship. He saw me out in the shop a little more and saw me design some parts on SolidWorks. I didn't speak with him a whole lot over the course of the internship, maybe once every two weeks (not counting passing ""hellos""). Looking back, I'm probably should've stopped by at his office to update him on what I've been doing. That'd probably not be a weird thing for an intern to do. 

Anyway, that's my predicament. The President and the Vice President have a much more powerful influence and voice than my supervisor, running a well-respected machine shop with around 50 employees that makes parts for the biggest aerospace companies in the world, but they didn't get to see me work everyday. Whereas my supervisor really got to know me and can probably put together a solid recommendation. Should I maybe list the things I've done during the internship so either the President or Vice President can reference them? Or maybe write a letter myself and have them sign it?

45,Should I be concerned about this offer letter...?,1504639977,"I have just been given a job offer from a company but was disappointed in the level of detail it provided.  I'm wondering if I have a leg to stand on... I was sent the offer via email after two face to face meetings.  The position requires extensive travel (2-3 days per week) to interface with their main client.  My remote office would actually be within their main client offices.  During the face to face meetings, the company mentioned that lodging, a per diem, and travel expenses would be covered, but that the details were not yet worked out.  When I received the offer letter, none of this was even mentioned.


The offer letter had statements such as ""salary $XXXXX with possibility for annual bonus based on individual and company performance.""  It did not, however, list a target bonus value for the position or describe how that bonus was calculated.


It also stated ""company pays 75% of medical premiums with options available for purchase for spouse and family members.""  It did not, however, have any information about the medical plan or an estimate of what I could expect those premiums to be.


These are only a couple examples out of probably 10 that left me with questions.


The job seems exciting and challenging;  it's also associated with a field I'd like to be in.  I also really like the people I've met from the company so far.  The company is small, however, and it concerns me to receive an offer letter lacking so many crucial details.  The salary being offered is already on the low end, so I need these details in order to even effectively evaluate the offer.


Should I be concerned?  Or is this level of ambiguity common in offer letters?

46,Any way to create a hydrolic or pully system to allow deadlifts to be lowered in silence/quietly?,1504635533,"So, long of the short, I live in a townhome. I like to lift weights and can quietly lift with squats and benching in a squat rack. However, to deadlift, I would need to ""control drop"" the bar. Basically, where you hold onto the bar, but allow the weight to fall without resisting against that fall.

This obviously leads to a loud bang if I do that. I can't do that and not piss off my neighbors. I also can't lower gently due to most injuries with that exercise happening in that part of it.

So, with that said, I have thought of a few work arounds. One workaround would be to have a ""platform"" that had hydrolics below it. The platform would hold the plates part of the bar and as you lifted, the platform would rise gently to eventually meet where the plates are at the top of the lift. Then, you let go of the bar, and the platform is lowered gently by the hydrolics to the resting part of the lift.

At no point does the platform actually help with the lift. It rises gently and only resists with force when the weight is put back on it. Then, it lowers itself. Similar to the way a car jack lowers slowly with a car. 

Is there a way to do this or create this or build this? Is there something in the industry world that exists that could maybe can do this? Maybe a pully system could do something similar?

I really want to deadlift again, but can't do it without some solution. Local gyms won't let you ""drop"" the weight either. Anyways, I would appreciate any help with this.",AskEngineers,christianhelp1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6y9vdm/any_way_to_create_a_hydrolic_or_pully_system_to/

65,Question for Canadian Electronics Engineers - Is pursuing a degree worth it after already completing a Technologist diploma.,1504536969,"I just completed a Electronics Technologist program with two co-op positions that gave me a really good idea of what the Technologist path has to offer. 

I had intended to bridge into a local University which would be an additional 2.5 years and I would have completed my bachelors. In the past year, they extended the program to be 3.5 years. At this point, I thought I might as well move back to my home province and attend a local University and complete a 4-year program closer to my family. 

I've frequently checked job postings in this province and it seems the majority of the positions are asking for Electronic Engineering / Technologist backgrounds. From my experience Engineers got to work on some amazing projects with R&amp;D and other groups, where as a Technologist, I worked on mainly maintenance service and production. These current postings are telling me they are one and the same background requirement.

I have a strong foundation of Electronics and Computer Engineering which lead me to want to complete my degree, but I can't decide if it's worth the four years. I can't tell if its pride of wanting to be an Engineer or genuine interest in the field of wanting to learn more. There is another question about working on projects that I would love to see grow into a possible businesses so I don't have to worry about working for people/companies in the first place, but I think that's just me processing every possible avenue and I would have to work regardless even if I tried working on my own business goals. 

At the moment, I have two thought processes. 

1. Go to University, and spend the next four years learning and working on all the side projects/business ideas I've been tinkering with and graduate knowing that I gave the self-employed idea an honest shot. 

2. Accept that a degree isnt required for these positions, attempt to apply and work and maybe on the side work on self-employment projects.

98,Structural question: Will adding two more layers of plywood subfloor put too much weight on a second story?,1504371548,"The advice I got for reducing sound transmission was adding two additional layers of 3/4 plywood subfloor with Green Glue between each sheet. Two different companies who recommended it said the additional weight wouldn't be an issue for a house built to code, but I have had some people on Reddit tell me they think it would be too much.

Here's what one of the companies said:

L/360 is a measurement of Deflection - how flat a ceiling is. We want flat ceilings so the International Building Code sets standards for ""Ceiling Sag."" We want nice, flat ceilings so we want to stay under the L/360 calculations. Note that the actual failure point of a ceiling framing (crashing down) would be several times the weights listed here. For a nice, flat ceiling a very standard wood floor framing system is built to accommodate at least 40 pounds per square foot of ""Live Load,"" and 10 pounds per square foot of ""Dead Load."" The ceiling is rated for this 40/10 Load across the entire floor / ceiling assembly. So a 10x10 room = 100 sqft x 40 = 4000 pounds capacity on the floor, and another 1000 pounds on the ceiling.""
If this is correct then 40 pounds per sqft is allowed. Each sheet of 3/4 plywood is 2.13 pounds per sqft - if this is all correct then it would seem that adding another 4 pounds wouldn't make a whole lot of difference. The entire area is about 450 sqft which would mean total weight allowance of 18,000 pounds. The total of all three layers of plywood would be under 3,000 pounds.

 Am I missing something, though? I was concerned about it, which is why I checked with them and researched it as best I could.  Should i spend the money to have an engineer check it out?  Is that even an option without them having to tear into walls/floors/ceilings to see the framing?

2,Small electronics insulation with room temperature on the outside.. will this work and any advice on design?,1504343261,"Hello, I need to insulate certain electronics for a period of time(~7-14 minutes I think). By insulate, I mean that the electronics will be covered by insulation with the goal of keeping the surface of this insulation at room temperature. You should not be able to feel any heat from the electronics, or see any excess heat with a thermal camera for example. 

The electronics to be insulated are: LiPo battery, somewhat low powered transceiver, electric motors with gears/gearbox, and some other stuff of similar size or smaller.

Obviously insulation will be necessary for this, but I'm also considering some kind of cooling for the electronics like fans or something.

The insulation should be as compact as possible but can be somewhat thick if necessary.

Some electronics will share a housing, possibly all, or some electronics like motors/gears, wires will need to be insulated separately.

This is what I'm currently thinking:


* item 1  airflow+electronics  (heated air vented somewhere)

* item 2  -------------------------- (non permeable insulation layer)
* item 3                                  (air gap, maybe even with airflow and ventilation here)
* item 4  -------------------------- (second insulation layer, room temperature)

Maybe another insulation layer?

What do you think, will I be able to keep the outer surface room temperature? Is there any better design? What insulation material do you recommend?(price should be no problem)

How thick will the insulation need to be?

With that in mind, I decided to take a geology intro course this semester since geology is obviously very relevant to energy/oil/drilling companies and it'd be nice to learn and gain a different perspective. However, the catch is that this geology class gives no credit at all for my ME degree (maybe it does something for a minor/certificate but I haven't checked).

Really I'm asking this because it boils down to a question of the best use of my time. For example, I am taking courses such as statics, thermodynamics, and differential equations among other classes and maybe geology might eat up too much of my time or maybe it might not and will end up worthwhile for any benefits it may have, which is pretty much what I'm asking.

17,Is it feasible to have 2 USB-C port on a smartphone PCB?,1504277523,"I see there's a trend of ditching the headphone jack without providing a replacement; Yes, no replacement; When you replace, you put something else in its place, here they are just straight up removing them. This question has been on several people's minds as well as mine for quite a bit now. I understand while manufacturers may be doing it with saving space being one of the objectives, is it just feasible to have 2 USB-C ports on a PCB? I don't know the technicalities of the spec, but I imagine it would be possible to have the phone ignore one, if some idiot decided to plug in two charging cables at once;  One challenge I'm thinking here is the possibility of power draw from both port being used simultaneously to charge the phone and drive headphones, or charge another USB-C device. 

I also saw someone bring up the issue of the beauty and simplicity of the headphone jack; how it had no orientation, and you plugged it right in. Made me wonder, is there a way to securely protect phones from ""?wrong?"" voltage if instead of parallel pins (like on the current USB-C connector), they were laid out as rings like the 3.5mm jack?

First, we'd have to redesign our modern sewage system (increase the decline angle), the price of digging must drop dramatically, then design a turbine that can handle the sewage. Then we'd have to develop an easy access door to replace the generators (or at least this is my approach). But what if we could take advantage of the moving fluid in the pipes? What if each building/house had a generator in their pipes in a highly populated city? Would that be enough electricity for it to be worth it? Also, every time a new building/house is built, they'll generate more electricity. I've been thinking about this idea a lot.

23,Need two water tanks to fill at same rate - what size connecting pipe?,1504245450,"Hi everyone,

I have a practical problem I need some help with. I have a boat which has two water tanks (port and starboard tank). The setup is:
- Both tanks are the same size (125ltr each)
- Both tanks are at the same level
- A deck filler pipe (~50mm I.D.) allows filling into starboard tank
- A connecting pipe (~19mm I.D.) goes from bottom of starboard tank to bottom of port tank to allow water to flow through and fill both tanks
- Both tanks have breather pipes

The problem currently is that the port tank fills much more slowly than the starboard tank. 

Eg: if there is good water pressure, I can fill the tanks to ""full"" - meaning the water level in the starboard tank is at the top - yet the level in the port tank is typically only half full. So then I have to wait 10 minutes for them to level out, fill again to the top of starboard tank, wait again, etc etc. 

I have checked all other possibilities (blocked breather pipe, blocked connecting pipe, etc) and everything seems fine. I have also spoken to other owners of the same boat that have the same problem. So I am sure that the issue is the connecting pipe it too small. 

I would like some help in figuring out what size to make the connecting pipe to ensure both tanks fill at the same rate. Ideally this would mean filling a full 250ltrs within 5 minutes. 

Can anyone help with sizing the connecting pipe correctly?

Thanks!

Edit: the point being made by many about stability issues caused by the water moving too fast between the two tanks is a good one! I hadn't fully considered that and will look into it further. That being said, I should clarify that's it's a mono hull sailing boat weighing about 8 tonnes, so a very stable vessel. 

Intuitively, I feel like the movement of water from one tank to the other couldn't be more than a crew member moving quickly from one side of the boat to the other. In the case of the crew member, the boat does not perceptibly move. I have even loaded one side of the boat with 150ltrs of water in jerry cans to be able to carry more water - it has no noticeable effect on the list and handling of the boat.

Perhaps in the case of the tanks, some kind of weird harmonic could get going which causes problems (as someone suggested)? ",AskEngineers,dunafrank,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6xcoiz/need_two_water_tanks_to_fill_at_same_rate_what/

Our property borders a 100-year floodplain and the existing wall pretty much follows its boundaries. The current wall ranges in height from 2.5 to 3.5 feet and is about 130 feet long.

Because the neighborhood requires that garages be facing the side or back of the property, and I assume the builder made the wall is far out as he could without entering the floodplain, we're left with a pretty tricky U-turn to get in and out of our garage. We would like to move the wall into the floodplain so that we may extend the driveway and give ourselves a little more room. (We're targeting 12 feet, but would settle for 8.)

See a crude drawing [here](http://imgur.com/a/q3vOE) that shows our current setup as well as the proposed new wall. 

The city needs an engineer to sign off on our plans to state that we won't be changing the flow of any floodwaters. They directed us to a water resource engineer at a large national firm. They want $5,000 to do this. This seems excessive to me (and to my contractor). The contractor's usual structural engineer charges $1,000 - $2,000 for retaining wall plans, but he apparently doesn't do floodwater stuff. I was expecting the quote to be in the same ballpark.

I'm in the DFW area and I've tried to find some local engineering firms that can handle this, but haven't been able to really find any by going off of the two terms the city gave us: ""hydrology"" and ""water resource"".

41,I need some ideas about how to verify lube delivery and line integrity on a PLC controlled lube system.,1504208429,"I am working on adding lube delivery verification and line leak detection to a machine at work. Currently, the lube is fed into two solenoids at constant 200psi. These solenoids then open/close to deliver a shot of lube though two 5ft lines to an orifice and onto the work piece inside the machine.

My idea is that I can add a check valve between the orifice and the line that cracks open at 75-100psi then allows the lube to flow. I can then send the line pressure data to the PLC.

1.  If the line never pressure never reaches the crack pressure due to a failed pump or a tear in the line, the PLC will see it as a fault and stop the machine. 

2. If the line pressure goes over the crack pressure, the PLC will know there is a blockage.

3. When not being cycled, the pressure locked in the line by the check valve shouldn;t drop. A drop in the line pressure below the cracking pressure would also mean a leak.

Overall this seems doable, but I am having a hard time finding the right valves/fittings. 

Check valves I have in mind are $200/ea (I need 20 of them!)

This may turn out as a long post because I've got a lot of career-related things that have been on my mind- it's making it difficult to sleep, so I'm posting this at 5am. I will definitely include a TL;DR.

Here's my backstory:
I'm 23/F and graduated from college with a degree in Urban Planning and Policy, and a minor in business. I took a particular concentration in transport planning, because I absolutely love mass transit. Aviation, trains, buses... 

My dream career is to be in operations or management for a major international airport. That is what I can see myself waking up and being excited about everyday. However, I know that the path to getting there might be complicated. 

Anyways, I secured my first career position as an entry level associate in project management for a small but successful transportation engineering firm that specializes in rail transit. I was brought in at $35k a year, as ""project support"". I picked up a lot of valuable skills in the short 3 months I worked in that office. 

At the end of April, my boss asked me if I'd like to pick up a contract working in Chicago in a support role for a major engineering corporation we do work with. I said yes! A week later I was on a flight from D.C. to Chicago to start my new job. Upon taking the job, I was given a salary increase from $35k to $56k.

I've been put in the Systems Engineering team to help them with the installation and implementation of a huge safety system for one of the big passenger rail services up here. It's a multi-million dollar contract, and the corporation I'm contracted with has at least 50 of its own employees working on this project. Most are being paid a LOT to do this job because they've been relocated from the Los Angeles area and elsewhere. 

When I signed on to this contract, it was my understanding that my duties simply included managing a couple databases to improve workflow and make sure that all of the requirements of the project's contract were accounted for and completed. Sounded not so bad! 

I've been here for about 4 months now. Everyone says I'm doing a great job, and the higher ups back home in DC regularly email me and send gifts to thank me for the hard work they hear I'm doing. Now here is where my dilemma sets in...

Having completed the initial work for one of the two databases I was originally responsible for, my bosses have given me some documents to create on their behalf. One document will end up being about 500 pages after I source and input all information, diagrams, schematics, etc- the other is not as involved but needs to be completed quickly. This was all given to me without much notice. More of an ""oh, you have some free time now, so can you create this document I was supposed to do?"" They make it pretty obvious that I'm taking work off their hands, which is fine- they're my bosses. But I was not originally hired to sit and write huge documents all day. I'm supposed to be working on the second (and a lot more involved) database I'm responsible for.

It's come to my attention over the past month that these extra duties and tasks I've picked up are not what I was hired to do. In fact, my contract was supposed to be for just ""a couple years"" to kinda help catch the team up on things. However, now I hear people saying that I'll be needed for the remaining duration of the project if I stay on, which should finish up around spring of 2021... 

The second document I am to create was supposed to be done so by someone who was hired for their expertise on the particular model of locomotive that this document is about. However, for some unknown reason, this guy quit and disappeared a week after he was hired, leaving no one to do the work- except for me???

Along with this, I have also recently been chosen to manage yet another database, since one of my coworkers has needed to shift his workload and doesn't have the time to work on it himself. To accurately take care of this one, I have to go to some of the train yards and shops and regularly meet with the foremen and managers to get reports on work that's being done on the locomotives. This means I will be shifting between working in the office and working outside in the train yards throughout each week- even through Chicago winter. 

I have no prior engineering knowledge or experience with any of this. As I've said, I am an urban planner by education. But I have been picking up a lot about the industry and the equipment used in the 7 months I've worked in the passenger rail industry.

With all of that going on- I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by my duties all of a sudden. I know I can take care of everything on my own, but I've gone from feeling like I was overpaid to now feeling like I'm being underpaid for everything that I've agreed to do for this contract. I have no PTO accrued- I had to ""use"" two days of it to move into my apartment (which I thought they'd knock off due to the circumstances of me moving on *very* short notice), and have taken a few days here and there for sick leave, and just a couple days for actual vacation time. Meanwhile, other people on my team seem to take a day or two off every other week or so, many go back to Los Angeles to work from home while they visit their family. 

Am I justified in feeling like this work is worth an increase in my salary, or at least a renegotiation of benefits? There really isn't anyone else on my team that *doesn't* have experience or expertise, but I am expected to keep up with everyone and learn enough to be well-rounded and able to provide support in all areas of the project. All while getting more and more work given to me. But, I also feel like maybe I haven't been there long enough to even bother asking... I don't know.

What would be the best way to go about asking for a raise or reevaluation of the contract? I've been keeping a running tab of all of the tasks and projects I've been given to do, and taken note of those which don't seem to fall under my intended scope of duties. 

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you to anyone who took the time to read all of that... haha


**TL;DR: Took a contracted position in a different city for a support role in systems engineering. I am only in my first year of career work. Supposed to just be managing a couple databases. I've ended up authoring large documents for my bosses, taking over the work for someone else (an expert on a particular vehicle) that was hired but quit, and also for someone that has no time to manage another database. I have no prior engineering experience but am expected to keep up with everyone and I keep getting more work to do that's outside of my scope of duties. Am I justified in wanting a raise? If so, how do I approach doing so?**",AskEngineers,boardingtheplane,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6x664z/am_i_justified_in_wanting_a_raise_soon_apparently/

58,Handling first engineering job offers || Am I locked in the industry?,1504155539,"Hey all,

This is my first time posting so hopefully this goes well.  I'll try to give some back story and then pose my question.  I just graduated from university with a BSME with high marks (~3.75) for a top 30 engineering school.

I worked in the HVAC consulting industry last summer and had work experience as a production technican assembling parts in a warehouse before.  After my summer internship last year, the firm made me an offer which I later declined because I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay in that industry.

Now I am talking with a smaller HVAC consulting firm which we will call company A.  I like the people (some I know) and it seems like a good culture (profit sharing and friendly small team).  I am also talking with three other companies B, C, and D.  All of which are in different industires: power generation, electronics, and research.  It seems everything is happening at once and Im afraid I will hold out for an offer that wont come.

A major worry I have is that the HVAC skillset doesn't transfer over well.  It seems like all other industries use Solidworks and apply more higher level engineering than what I did over the summer.  Revit and AutoCAD aren't used in most other industries and I am worried that if I start my career in HVAC I will be trapped.

My questions are 1) how long do you think I can appropriatly ask for to respond to the offer from firm A and 2) have any of you moved out of the HVAC/consulting industry to become more technical?  I also worry that I wont be paid as well in HVAC as opposed to the other industries.  I know one company is going to tell me yes or know in ~3 weeks but that seems way to long to sit on the offer.

I don't want to be foolish and let a good(ish) offer slip through my finger tips but I am also worried that if I accept firm A it will be out of fear of not finding something better not because I love that industry.  I got declined by 3 companies I was really excited about already (Tesla, aerospace company, and HP) and am starting to worry that I don't have what it takes to land a (cool) job I want.

Anyways, I know this isnt the worst thing in the world but I am really struggling with the choice.  I don't have much social capital with experienced engineers and don't know who to talk to about this.  Thanks everyone!!

59,How do meshless simulations work?,1504154758,"I would say I have a fairly basic understanding of FEA and FEM, but this really baffled me. I found a software called SimSolid that claims to have meshless simulation capability. [This article](http://www.engineering.com/DesignSoftware/DesignSoftwareArticles/ArticleID/11313/Structural-Software-Claims-Better-Accuracy-without-Finite-Elements.aspx) explained it a bit under the ""How Does Simulation without Meshing Work?"" section, but I'm still a little confused. From what I'm gathering, it still divides the model into pieces (isn't that what meshing is?) and iterates through after solving one. I don't understand how ""the geometry can be analyzed directly."" Yes, for simple models like a supported beam with a point load, you can analyze the whole beam with mechanics of materials formulas, but how does it work with more complicated geometries?

I just passed the university exam and was placed in an electrical engineering program. Now first of all, in Turkey, electrical engineering name doesn't stand for what it does in Europe and U.S (and probably some other countries as well?). So we have some universities with Electrical-Electronic Engineering programs but when you look at their curriculum they're only teaching electronics and almost no high voltage and power electronics. But my school (Istanbul Technical University) has electrical and electronic engineering programs separately. And my program (Electrical Engineering) is mostly about power engineering and high voltage stuff. Here's the link to all my classes so you can see what's it about: http://www.sis.itu.edu.tr/eng/curriculums/plan/ELKE/201210.html

Also my school is said to be the best university to train engineers in Turkey and also reputable in international companies.

So, after taking all these classes, I wonder in what industries can I work and in which field should I specialize, and also what can I do to improve myself while still studying in college that'll help me find better jobs. I searched the internet for electrical engineering career paths and they're always the same copy paste paragraphs that give too general information.

Also it would be awesome if you could inform me about what can I do if I decide to work in automotive industry. It really picks my interest and I think of getting a master's degree in automotive engineering but it also requires so much mechanical engineering knowledge.

89,Are there any advantages to being at a local/regional/national early in career? Or is it more about where you fit better?,1504033735,"Currently looking to make a career move.  I'm a PE in Civil Engineering.  A little over 4 years of transportation experience and spent the last few months in Site Development/Site Utilities.  
  

Most of my experience is working with Kentucky DOT, so I have a very similar relationship with all private firms in area.  Mostly professional interaction, everyone trying to be on good side of DOT for the projects, so it was tough to get true details.  All seemed to have ups and downs over past few years.  Transportation has taken a dive recently, but starting to get some traction again.  Smaller, local firms went through tough time a few years back when this started.  Most of them diversified their services and leveled out, some even growing.  Larger firms are now running out of work sharing with other states, and if projects don't start flowing they could be facing tough times.  
  
**Was wondering if anyone would care to share their personal experiences, in regards to comparing pros/cons of local, regional, and national firms?** 
  
I like the idea of working for someone like Stantec or HDR.  They each get in to some very progressive transportation projects.  However, they're so large I'm not sure if I would have any role in the ""cool"" stuff.  I'm not opposed to going to work for a local firm, but am afraid of feeling like I'm not ""stretching my legs"" as an engineer by only working on projects for the sake of keeping the doors open.  Afraid I might miss out on opportunities to work on something big.  
There are some firms in the area that I would say are regional (5-12 offices, multiple states).  One in particular seems like an interesting prospect as they have been on the design teams of many roundabout intersections that have been designed in this region.  Kentucky is still lacking in the progressive intersection game, and it is something I'm very interested in.  
  
Any personal experience is appreciated.  I have contacts in the area, but many of them are very biased for or against certain firms.  Many based on negative experiences with a select few personnel that they just didn't mesh with.  I'm sure all firms are the same in this regard, and there is a chance that a personality conflict could occur at any size/location firm.  **Any advantage/disadvantage between the sizes of firms and navigating a potentially toxic colleague?**

90,Engineering Culture Questions (Career),1504033202,"Hi All,

The purpose of this is twofold:

1) I'm looking for advice, because despite the very cool work I am involved with, the culture at my current work place sucks enough that I am leaving.  

2)  I hope that my personal experiences can shed some light on how shitty it can be to be a female engineer.  Most of my coworkers are great wonderful people, but they are woefully oblivious.  It's not their fault, I was blindsided as well, we all just want to build cool stuff.

I'm a female mechanical engineer who has spent the past 6 years working in an industry that is very... old school.  I'm not sure if my troubles are specific just to my company's work culture or if this is an industry wide problem (especially in light of the uber/google memo debacle).  I love engineering, but if this kind of culture permeates throughout engineering, regardless of industry... I'd like to know sooner rather than later.  Maybe I will open a dog sanctuary and spend my days building automated pooper scoopers.

---------------------------The Event

I was sexually harassed (because it doesn't count as assault if there's not a penis invovled!), tried to defend myself, was threatened, reported it, and ended up uncovering a lot of underlying nastiness that permeates through all levels of my work's management.   
The harassment went on for over a year and climaxed during a work trip in which another male coworker attempted intervene (props to that guy) and protect me.  The creep continued despite being called out.  I ended up having a nervous breakdown and resolved to try one more time to ask the perpetrator to stop the grabbing and the forced kissing and ugh.  I was stupidly hesitant because I believed speaking up would damage my career prospects (sadly, it did) .  The person became angry, but stayed away, so I foolishly believed all was well in the world.  Then the stalking began.  I found myself being followed by the creepy bastard--he would be waiting in the warehouses when I was alone, he'd mysteriously appear upon exiting the lone women's restroom.  Glaring, radiating hate, always a couple steps behind me.  I started carrying a pipe wrench and spoke to two other female employees about the issue (neither were engineers and both were older than me).  Surprise!  He had harassed them, and was still doing it! 
 
We went to our supervisor who took it seriously and reported it.  At the time I was very pleased that he handled it so professionally, but I later found out he advocated for the perpetrator arguing he was harmless (my boss later quit after the perpetrator was transferred).  HR sat on the case for over 3 months despite the independent investigator advocating for his immediate removal--I later found out both my boss and the higher-ups personally stepped in and kept the bastard employed.  For over 3 months myself and the two other women lived in a weird limbo, questioning whether the crazy deranged man that smelled of alcohol (and had nothing to lose--wife left him and took all the money) was going to go postal.  Our concerns were continually hand waved, we were made to feel like we were foolish and cruelly tormenting a ""harmless old man.""  

I received threats, HR did nothing.  He finally was transferred to our sister department, where within a couple months the two young women there expressed their concerns about his behavior.  They were ignored until one threatened to call the police, the higher-up (who incidentally is my boss' boss) threatened her job.  I still occasionally have to interact with the creep from time to time and the unfortunate thing is most of my peers are aware of what went down (not allowed to discuss the case, apparently transfer cases are sealed--the new supervisor is unaware of his past actions).  So of course they invite him to department events.

---------------------------The Aftermath

I have spent the better part of year assessing what I should do and trying to heal.  My work suffered during that time period, there are entire periods of time I have no recollection of, but do have my work journal showing what I had accomplished each week.  It's strange to review something that you've written with no recollection of.  After those three months, my immune system was shot, I had little to no-sleep (I really started questioning if I had been wrong to report it and if I had ruined someone's life), nightmares, oh I was a mess.  (Turns out the guy was 100% creep, my conscience is clear after I found out he wrote a confession admitting it--of course HR didn't tell us).  I took some time off and decided I would try to see if I could ""fix"" the culture from within and if that failed I would leave.

As a result of the event, I've noticed I'm picking up on more negative things in my immediate environment than I would have previously noticed.  I know some of them are me being hyper-sensitive, the last thing I want is to spend my life as ""that engineer with a chip on her shoulder,"" but others I believe are out of place no matter who you are.

--Showed up for an interview (inter-department), was told there was no interview, but they really wanted to ask me out on a date and they might be able to work something out if I agreed (holy guacamole batman, hell no!).

--Had a coworker tell me I shouldn't be on work travel because women make him uncomfortable, same coworker made some nasty remarks when I went on travel with another coworker.

--Had a coworker tell me I couldn't help him on a project because his wife would not approve (?!).

--While on work travel, was asked by higher-up guy if I was just there to ""pick up a husband"" (as I'm waist deep inside one of our machines).

--I've noticed I tend to get pushed out of conversations and presentations--even the ones that I am leading (I don't think it's intentional, it's just what happens when you're 5' 4"" and everyone else is a giant).

--Had a coworker explain to me at length that women's brains are ""just different,"" and not meant for engineering, but I'm an exception (thanks, I guess).

--Not ill intentioned, but mildly insulting if I'm struggling with something the younger guys get all excited about how easy it is and how they will explain it to me.  Cue five minutes later as they slowly back away from my calculations and discover they are waaaaaaaay out of their element.

--Asked if I'm the secretary (not insulting, but really, it happens far too often?)

--I'll make an assessment of something and be ignored, only to have my male coworker say the same thing and be praised.

--Not a sexist thing, but a shitty work culture thing (IMO, maybe it is normal and I just am unfamiliar with it, but it felt wrong): old guy retiring turned to me and my coworker and told us, ""Two of you is too confusing, one of you needs to be in charge, decide right now.""  We had a stare off for a couple of minutes and I reluctantly suggested the other guy (I still kick myself for that concession--I will never do that again) despite him being less experienced.  The funny things is, the other guy is gone so often I end up in charge anyways, my boss also does not recognize the decision despite personally telling him I am not the lead.

I must have had an excellent poker face during the entire event (perhaps it was just shock), I still have coworkers tell me how extremely lucky I was to not be near that ""weird guy"" and the ""terrible rumors"" they heard.

---------------------------The Research

Based on my conversations with the few other female engineers I have found at this company (there's less than 5% in STEM, even less in leadership positions here):

-Highly skilled electrical engineer was relegated to secretary upon moving to this location, because she ""had a nice face"" despite over a decade's worth of technical work.  She has since quite and gone onto greener pastures.

-Highly skilled comp sci was disqualified from position for being ""problematic"" (she stood up for herself when her technical work was questioned) despite numerous certifications and ten years of experience that fit the exact position, they instead selected the husband of someone in leadership... who had neither the certifications nor the experience needed for the role!

-Management at the national level denied there were any problems related to the treatment of women during a panel designed specifically for addressing the low matriculation of women (cue the yells of a couple hundred telecoming women throughout the US--it was almost funny--I believe the feed was cut after that).

-One of the few women in leadership received hatemail for trying to initiate a program focused on increasing female leadership by providing training resources.  The program succeeded despite the outcry, I'm in it right now (and it is awesome), but my (new and much better) supervisor had to go fight for me to enter the program because higher ups decried it as unnecessary and irrelevant.

-Another female engineer commented that ""We (woman) aren't like that, we aren't meant to lead"" after I congratulated a coworker on his presentation (I nearly choked on my drink).

-Every single woman I talked to had been harassed at some point in their career.  Few did anything about it because ""that's just how it is.""  The most senior of the people I spoke with stated ""If you aren't a bitch now, you'll be one by the time you're my age"" (yikes).

--Other woman denied travel because her presence might be inappropriate (despite having gone multiple times for the same test event). 

-A few women stormed out during a company sponsored presentation (it was terribly old school sexist and pretttty racist).

---------------------------Summary

TLDR;  Busted serial sexual harassment guy at work, independent investigator suggested firing him immediately, company instead moved him to another department after 3 months of making him work near me despite ongoing investigation, treated me (and the other women) like I was crazy.  Discovered this nastiness was everywhere in this company, I was just one of the few women to speak up.

---------------------------Questions


1) Is this the kind of behavior I should expect for the rest of my career, regardless of company?

2)  Can I insulate myself from this by embracing higher education and leaving the industrial world behind (PhD)?

3)  My current supervisor is a great guy, I feel bad leaving, but everyone and everything above is nasty.  There are also very few opportunities for growth within my department.  Is it better to have a good immediate supervisor and poor overall culture or a better culture overall and a potentially bad supervisor?

4)  I've attempted to reach out to our SWE equivalent and ethics office and have been ignored.  They are only interested in increasing the amount of women at the company, not addressing cultural issues.  Who should I reach out to?

5)  When I resign should I address the work culture issues?  Or would that burn bridges?

6)  If I do leave, I would like to somehow call attention to the things that need to change, but without throwing my current boss under the bus.  Any suggestions?

7)  Any suggested reading for inspiring tales of engineering ~~females/minorities in the engineering work place~~ (or business I guess)?  I just finished Hidden Figures, slow read, but very interesting!

8)  Any positive stories or advice for young engineers in general?


My personal morale is at an all time low, all the things I enjoyed about my job feel like they are shadows of what they used to be.  I'm tired of fighting to be heard and seen and just want to do my work and enjoy it.  Female, male, fuck it man, I thought we were all just engineers striving for the same goals, to learn, build, and (sometimes accidentally) destroy!

Thanks for reading.  

Edit:  Thanks everyone for all your input.  I feel more optimistic about the future and will begin pursing the avenues suggested.  Let's all just be decent to each other and the world will be a better place.  Signing off with a lot of appreciation and love for reddit.  Peace.  You're all good people.

92,Trying to create an Automatic Sliding Pocket Door mechanism that will stop when the door encounters a person/object. Any ideas on solutions I could look into?,1504030677,"I am currently designing an automatic pocket door system as a co-op project. I am in the early stages of the project and I'm trying to plan out how I want to do things before I start prototyping. Currently, the idea is to use a dc motor driving a rack and pinion system to open and close the door. My problem is figuring out how to automatically stop the door when it hits a person or an object. Some current ideas I've had are as follows:

1. Active IR sensor mounted above door. One problem I see with this is the need for 2 sensors to cover both sides of the doorway.

2. Overcurrent trigger for motor. Once the door hits something and the motor pulls more current to compensate for the obstruction it will trigger the overcurrent protection and shut off. My question with this is how will I differentiate between the motor start-up surge current and the overcurrent due to a force on the door? Will the surge current even be high enough to reach the overcurrent range? Motors are currently on their way so I haven't gotten to test them yet.

3. Pressure pad on the edge of the door. Just started looking into this today, so I don't really have and ideas/questions about it.

4. A system similar to a garage door auto reverse sensor. When a garage door hits an object on it's way down, it will automatically stop and reverse itself once the force exerted by the door hits a certain threshold (I believe this is how it works, not really a garage door specialist). This is adjustable on most modern garage door systems. How could I utilize this in a sliding door system? I've tried looking into how this force limit system works on garage doors but all I find is how to adjust them, not how they work at an engineer's level.

If anyone has more information on the ideas listed above, or any new ideas for me to think about it would be greatly appreciated. Also, I would like to keep it as cheap as possible.

93,How to calculate the change in angle of a hole once it's position changes.,1504029380,"I'm a high schooler so I want to apologize as I do not know all the proper terms.

The problem:
There are two panels that need to be joined, the bottom panel is horizontal and will stay that way, the panel on top does not completely fit flush with the bottom panel, there is some angle. However the holes for the fasteners are drilled with a shim in between the two panels. When they're drilled the hole is flush with the panel, and completely vertical.  I know that once the shim is removed the hole will be at an angle I'm just not sure how to find out what that'd be.

Having just recently attended my 10 year reunion, I've had some time to reflect on my choices since attending college. I'm wondering if, at 27, it would be too late to restart a path as an Engineer?   
  
A little backstory, I was attending University in 2007 for a BSE in Aerospace Engineering. Fall of 2010 rolls around, I lose my job, fiance and subsequently get a DUI. The combination causes me to withdraw from the program. I was bartending from then on until 2015 when I got a job as a mortgage broker.   
  
I've been able to save enough for a house down payment, but I was thinking instead of using that money to obtain a BS in Computer Science. As it stands now, I only have a rudimentary understanding of programming languages; with an even lower understanding of systems and architecture.   
  
I've been auditing just about every course available on MOOCs on statistics, linear algebra and economics, trying to refresh myself on topics I haven't touched in a decade. I understand that none of my previous credits will transfer, so I'll need to retake rudimentary courses like Calculus and English.   
  
That being said, I'll be able to enter the workforce at 32. I have no family or expenses at the moment besides rent, so I should be able to manage some form of apprenticeship or internship (if that's still applicable for my age) during my last two years.   
  
Am I putting myself at a disadvantage by entering the workforce at 32? I'm interested in block chain technology and information security.      Would a more efficient method be to continue auditing MOOCs and just build a git or similar portfolio?

15,Taking the FE as a non-engineer,1503938822,"Hello guys,

I'm a Civil Eng major turned to Physica after being forced to transfer. I have take up to Fluids and Structural Analysis in my Civil courses. I was planning on taking the FE this October and April with the hopes of passing. 

I'm going to have a B.A. In Physics at the end of December so I just wanted to ask how I should study for this exam outside of the books and etc.

Is this a smart idea taking the FE as a Physics major after switching from Civil?

Also is it worth it to take an extra semester just to get the B.S. rather than B.A. In Physics? I have some experience with construction projects in my resumé and want to have a career in construction

My university offers a “fast track” to masters (ME) program, which allows students to skip the application to the graduate program, and take 9 graduate level hours in place of the electives.

18,"Hi /askegineers, could you help me with my transcript of a biomechanical engineer expert? (terminology)",1503932797,"Hi everyone,

I am a court reporter who is working on a transcript and there's a few things I'm unsure of/can't find online by Googling. I'm not very familiar with engineering terms because it's not my usual area. The case is about a hunting tree stand where a man climbs up and falls and became paralyzed. There's a few spots I'm having a lot of trouble with. I put in capitals the word I cannot understand/find online. If more context is needed, please let me know :)

1. ""So you can tie those -- I think they're called ""shoestring ties,"" whatever they were called -- and you can apply tension to those, but the -- you know, obviously if the buckling is trying to move the ladder toward the tree, then that shoestring really isn't going to matter, right?  What's going to matter is the NEURO/AL (?) knob that maintains the length of the stabilizer bar.""  
I know this obviously isn't neural or neuro but that's what it sounds like to me.

2. ""the ladder stand's designed is that when a user beginning climbing the ladder stand based on the design, the EQUALLER is pushed towards the tree so in other words, the ladder stand's pushed in towards the tree, the top portion?

3. ""That would be highly unlikely because if you -- it's basically an area of quasi-stable equilibrium so it's like balancing a chair on one leg.  That's quasi-stable equilibrium.  You can do it, but any small PROVERVATION is going to cause it to move to one way or the other, such as either it's going fall over or it's going to fall on to the legs.  Similar situation here exists.""

4. ""Do these propose or suppose that the friction is eliminated or reduced to the point where the ladder stand can begin to bend because it's no longer in contact with the tree or in sufficient contact with the tree?  
A. Well, the friction force is up there on Page 24 that's  F SET F. (is this a math term?)
So it can have any value; it can have negative value, it can have 0.  So what I'm showing is just literally the free body diagram.

* Large sheet made of material #1.

* Solid object that should slide across the sheet. Material at the base is material #2.

* Solid object that should stick to the sheet, preferably maintaining static friction under normal operating conditions. Material at the base is material #3.

I've done what I can with most relevant parameters (normal force etc) but I need experienced input for friction.

Material #1 should be available in very thin sheets (~1/16"" max). It needs to roll up or fold without appreciable hysteresis or tearing. It should not scuff or tear under impact by materials such as plastic and fingernails.

Material #2 should slide as freely as possible against material #1 (low kinetic friction coefficient). It should be available as a thin film or, less desirably, as a firm, machinable plastic. It should resist abrasion from fingernails and plastic, but aesthetic scuffing is acceptable. Currently I'm using PTFE film.

Material #3 should exhibit strong static friction with material #1. It should be available as a coating, film, or very thin sheet (&lt;=1/32"" is ideal).

40,[Electrical][Automotive] LiPO vs LiFePO4 Batteries and how they tolerate tempurature,1503852780,"I am looking to get a compact jumpstarter for my Jeep and while LiPO based packs are fairly common, I found a few LiFePO4 based packs that I wanted to consider because of their saftey factory or so I have heard. This jump pack is going stay in my Jeep pretty much all the time and due to the temperature ranges a car can see year round I am wondering which battery would fair better. 

 I would say my Jeep sees from about -20°C at the least during the winter to sometimes over 35°C on a sunny, hot day and the interior could get to 50°C. As far as I have read this isnt really ideal for either cell but the LiFePO4 would be more resilent to such heat and is consdered more stable than the LiPO which we all know can be picky and fail spectacularly. Considering the iron based cell supposedly holds charge better is also appealing but I would expect to pay $60 USD more for said cell over its polymer counterpart. 

For anyone interested in the products they are the AntiGravity XP-1(Polymer, community favorite), the Schumacher SL1 (Iron, popular counter part), and the QuickCable Rescue 400 (Iron, lesser known, better features).

Reading through the manuals they all claim to operate in ambient temperautres about -20°C to +60°C but the battery its self will operate when its between 0°C to 40°C and should be stored between -20°C to 50°C. I might be answering my own question here with that information but I'm just wondering if I have leeway. I do have a Lead Acid pack that I could swap out on the hotter days but I'm trying to cut down on some weight and space with these other packs. 

At the very least I would like to know the temperatures the cells can tolerate realisticly before they see damage.

62,Causes for voltage spike when turning on hot tub?,1503768366,"I'm working on a hot tub for a family member that runs off a 240V circuit. There's 1 particular motor in it that keeps burning out starter caps and the only reason I can see for it is some weird voltage behavior. 

The wires running into the main control board are labeled Line 1, Neutral, Ground, and Line 2. My multimeter says that Line 1, Neutral and Ground are shorted together. Should this be the case? 

When I first power on the tub I've seen peak voltages of 450VAC across Line 1 and Line 2 for a split second before it settles to ~240. Is this typical or is this far too high? 

Strangest of all, when I turn on the tub, but don't press any of the controls to start the motors, I see a similar voltage spike and a stable 238V across the motor's power leads, but the motor doesn't turn, and when I press the button to activate the motor, the voltage only jumps 3-4 volts. Why is the motor sitting idle at 238, and what changes to make it start running (or rather stalling once the cap is blown)? Is something allowing more current to flow? I hear a relay click on but the voltage is weirding me out.

I've checked to make sure there aren't any obvious shorts in the motor and the little centrifugal switch seems to be working properly, but this strange behavior is still there and the motor keeps blowing caps.

I went to three career fairs before and it's basically a 5-8 minute talk about my resume (although, at those times, I did not have an internship experience so there wasn't much to talk about). The career fair at my school is huge, so there are long lines, recruiters get tired and just take resumes and skim through it; and then at the end they just collect resume and tell you to go online and apply! Does anyone have success stories from the career fair?

What all should I bring to a career fair? Resumes for sure, but do I need to bring cover letters, references, or a portfolio of projects? Although most projects I've had were only those assigned in class and I haven't done senior design projects yet.

Aside from the career fair and friends/family connections, where else could I look for a position? Is it worth searching on job sites such as indeed.com and such? I heard it is useless because they get thousands of applications per job post.

   On the first day of orientation this week, I learned that my school has stopped offering the M.Eng (ChemE) degree I was accepted in on and now only offer these M.S. in a few different flavors (thesis, non-thesis, and coursework based). I originally planned for this program to take 1 year, and if I decide to go the thesis or non-thesis route it will take at least 2 years. I’m paying with loans right now so my debt would go up considerably.It seems they are advising people not to pursue coursework only unless it’s absolutely necessary as staying the extra year for research appears better on a resume, especially abroad. 


   So now I’m obviously a little conflicted. Is the extra year for research worth the extra debt? Is the difference between what is an effective M.Eng degree (M.S. coursework) and the other two options that jarring? I know this has been answered a lot but the answers always seem to be changing. My expectations for pursuing an engineering degree was so that I could find more opportunities in technical fields than what only a B.S. in Chemistry (what I have) could offer. Would that expectation seem reasonable if I pushed to finish this program in a year or am I selling myself short of greater opportunity?

  For the first semester I am going to take the same courses regardless of what I end up choosing, and I plan to meet with a faculty advisor as soon as I can, but I wanted to hear your guys thoughts on this. 

TL;DR : School got rid of 1 year M.Eng program, could be stuck going for 2 in M.S.. Is the extra debt worth it for an M.S., or should I focus on finishing up in a year in what is an effective M.Eng?

All my coursework so far has been solid STEM, with nary even a group project. I have no formal training in management. What should I be reading in the lulls between semesters to prepare myself for the pivot to management when I get to the graduate level?",AskEngineers,markjo222,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6vvvd6/what_management_booksresources_should_i_be/
94,Need to non-permanently attach two flat surfaces. Also is there a mechanical design book with names and uses of common hardware parts?,1503626732,"Catch a man a fish:

I am attaching a battery box to a bike frame, and am planing to use the associated hardware from the water bottle holder to mount the box on. Because the water bottle mounting hardware protrudes from the tube, and the bolt is too short to use for anything other than sheet metal anyway, I can't simply drill a hole through my box and attach it directly.  I think I need to have an intermediate bracket shaped like this:

&amp;nbsp;

  Battery Box

\\----- &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;-----/

  Bike Frame

&amp;nbsp;

In order to attach it non-permanently with two bolts on each side. Is there a better solution, or a specific name for this bracket i'm looking for?

Teach a man to fish:

Also I'll admit, I know little about common hardware used in Mechanical Design. I'm in school for AE, and I don't think this is covered in our curriculum. Is there some book out there that goes over common hardware and explains to you why it works and what to use it for.

96,Powder coating over painting?,1503608229,"I'm trying to powder coat a part, while making sure a certain section isn't powder coated but this section is difficult to mask/cover throughout the pre-treatment and curing process. Is it possible to paint this particular section, powder coat it, then remove the paint with a solvent or something and thereby remove the powder coating on the paint? or will the powder coating stick the section even after paint removal?",AskEngineers,salahelbat,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6vttay/powder_coating_over_painting/
97,Can a powder or slurry of fuel or oxidizer be used like a liquid for a rocket motor?,1503604014,"My thought is that if a powder (or concentrated slurry) could be fed in a similar/analagous manner to liquids in a rocket motor, it would allow for a wider variety of options when choosing propellants. One example that came to mind is aluminum hydride, which has a higher hydrogen density than liquid hydrogen, and wouldn't require cryogenic tanks (it would also be more storable). 

For a dry powder or thick slurry, my thought is that a screw feeder could be used to ""pump"" the material around. This would actually be assisted by all of the vibration of the rocket, which tends to fluidize powders and slurries. I've done some googling, but couldn't find any such designs. Could this work, or am I missing some serious technical challenges?",AskEngineers,Hydropos,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6vtc1s/can_a_powder_or_slurry_of_fuel_or_oxidizer_be/

1. Any of your favorite, time-tested favorite blogs or reading material that will help me navigate engineer lingo, trends and culture?
2. Any resources you especially love that are aimed for marketing in the engineering field?
3. Tips for a non-engineer who will be working heavily with engineers? (Any of your pet peeves or Anything that will earn me some extra brownie points?)
