Looking for some assistance, not much info found online.

I'm looking to support/moor a 7000T vessel in place. The area has extremely mild wind and currents. How do I calculate what sized anchor would be required? Or would a 3T anchor be suitable for this purpose?

3,"Had a weird dinner interview, some red flags popped up.",1584255854,"Had an interview that ran later into the afternoon last week, so they decided to skip lunch and go with a dinner interview. It was me and 2 other engineers in the dept.

Immediately they went in on me and grilled me. They asked a lot of tough questions. Some technical related, almost like I was back in school taking a mechanical engineering class. I got a few wrong and they pointed it out, and kinda poked fun at me. I was mainly stressed out because I expected the interview to be more lax and they hammered some tough questions. 

They also asked weirdly personal questions. Like, my stance on gun control. My stance on abortion. If I had a good relationship with my parents. Which one of my parents I liked more. A whole bunch of weird stuff like that.

Finally, the worst thing was how rude they were to the waiter. He looked rather young and he was just trying to do his job, but they would bark at him for this and that, not look him in the eye, and they also kept continuing conversations when he would come over to ask for our orders. It was embarrassing and I hated being a part of it, and i tried my best to be as pleasant as possible to the waiter.

Now....I’m not an idiot. I’m aware that at least some of this was probably some sort of “test”. However, I’m wondering.....does that matter? Should I not accept a job offer from these people? They’re the farthest I’ve gotten with a single company, and the dinner interview was our third official interview. (Including what we talked about during the day earlier.)

My only issue is that I’m entry level and have been interviewing for several months now with absolutely no luck.

8,"How much side loading (force, not dimensional essentricity) can an O-ring withstand?",1584243689,"How much side loading can an O-ring withstand and still function? I have an O-ring roughly 2-4 mm in width and 12 mm in diameter that might be side loaded due to essentricity. The essentricity is limited to a maximum of 300 N absolute worst case (the bore can slide with enough force, it’s not rigidly fixed, think of it as being connected to a spring in one direction). I’m not sure what the “stiffness” of the O-ring is as essentricity increases. So if it was designed for a uniform 20% compression but it’s now assembled and side loaded, depending on its stiffness one side should be 25% compressed but the other is now 15%. It isn’t feasible to have very tight concentricity of the grove and bore diameter in my situation but the O-ring might be able to pull the bore to center depending on what kind of lateral stiffness it has. Going with a high durameter and the largest width possible should give me the stiffest O ring and minimize the range of compression from the side loading (22%/18% compression with design intent of 20% when no side loading vs 25%/15% with a softer O ring).

So I’m wondering if it’s possible to consistently seal if the o ring is unevenly loaded and the gap is large. Just rough numbers here, the bore is 12 mm, the lead in chamfer could still leave a max gap of 0.4 mm, and it needs to seal against about 25-30 MPs, and the maximum possible side load force on the o ring when installed is 300 N, the o ring diameter will be something like 2-4 mm.

29,Potential career paths for B.S. In Biological engineering currently in R&amp;D,1584198177,"Hi all,
So I graduated in May 2019 with a B.S. in bioprocess engineering with about 2.5 years of engineering (intern) experience (energy engineering at power plant, distiller at winery). 

I had a couple offers before graduation and one was a project engineer at a microbrewery owned by big beer company and other was process development for gene therapy at big pharma company. The timeline for microbrewery didn't work so I couldn't accept, although both salaries were the same ~65k+bonuses+benefits.

I decided to work for big pharma company as an upstream process development associate scientist (although everyone on my team has engineering background). I do experiments, analyze data, provide recommendations for scale up (mammalian cell bioreactors for gene therapy), communicate with vendors and troubleshoot reactor issues, and I'm currently authoring patent examples. 

I like the work I'm doing but there's no upward mobility in R&amp;D which just a B.S. Also, I'm doing the same things that Ph.Ds are doing. I don't want to do this for the rest of my life lol.

I recently passed the FE, and in my state I can take the PE anytime after passing the FE. So I was considering starting to study for the PE (Chem E)... But also many people tell me there's no point for Chem e/ bioprocess engineer. 

I have always been passionate about Cell-based meat and there are startups that reach out to me, but I don't want to stay in R&amp;D. Another company, a large engineering consulting  company, is looking to get into consulting for lab grown meat manufacturing facilities which is something I'd be interested in as well. Most people have their PEs there as mainly civil and oil/gas.

 I also have dabbled with the idea of getting my MBA in a couple years to do strategy either at consulting company or for a smaller business (lab grown meat), but that's expensive and a year or two without any income.

I don't want to stay super technical forever, but I'd like to work for a biotech/ engineering solving problems in some aspect. 

Sorry for this ramble, I just need for career insights. Not sure how long I should stay in my current position before leaving... I've been here for about 6 months. 
After 2 years, I get a promotion to senior associate scientist and after 3 years of work, we get an additional retirement account which will have 3 years worth of 10% of my salary vested since I started (~20k).

48,[Chemical] Optimal method(s) for engineers to safely create and store oxygen gas for use in the treatment of the flu (e.g. COVID-19)?,1584141179,"Hello everyone.  I've been sitting here trying to think about how best we can apply our engineering skills to help fight against the alarming mortality rate associated with this pandemic. To that end, I think there is potential in the method that I'm asking you about here. 

Severe flu cases are commonly treated with oxygen therapy. As someone that works in the healthcare industry, I'm already hearing the reverberations of healthcare professionals fretting over the scarcity of breathing gas and associated equipment for such treatment during this pandemic. Now, I know how to create oxygen gas through the simple process of hydrolysis (place two electrodes in water with an electrical potential over 2.4V and voila, H2 and O2 gas is produced). What I don't know is if there are toxic byproducts that should be avoided, what common household materials are most effective as electrodes, how to verify O2 concentration with common household materials, how to avoid oxygen toxicity, if there's are reasonable means for people to increase storage density (I'm thinking of CO2 tanks used for carbonation as common pressure vessels, though that obviously needs evaluation) etc.

All that I really know right now is that we all have the ability to generate O2 gas, that oxygen therapy is highly effective at saving the lives of people with COVID-19, and that we're all about to be - if not already - highly motivated to find some way to save those around us.

75,"It's my ""dream"" job but I am getting a lot of red flags",1584071250,"Hey guys,

I am about to graduate soon (July) and so I have been trying to secure a job before I graduate - for security reasons, motivation for the last exams etc. 

I've been doing alright, I've had lots of interviews, invites to tests etc. Not all of them went well. 

Where I stand right now is that I am currently in the final round for two firms, I hope to hear back from them soon. These firms are abroad (Japan).

Another firm however, which is local to me, invited me for an interview just by looking at my resume. (I'd like to think my resume is pretty good, inter ship experiences, lots of relevant and ambitious projects etc.). 

The interview happened earlier this week, it was pretty short, just under an hour? And they offered me the job on the spot. 

The company seems pretty small, maybe less than 20 or even 15 employees. A mix of financial, management, marketing, and then the software peeps. I'm being hired as a robotics engineer. 

I was pretty shocked to get the offer on the spot. Especially since I was interviewed by the CEO himself and someone in finance (so no one on the software side at all). I did not even get any technical questions at all. Mostly situational questions. The CEO then said I'm perfect for the job.

So this is where I am feeling some red flags:
1. During the interview the finance guy said that working with the company is like a second family (I always see online how this is a red flag)
2. I was offered the job on the spot with no kind of tests or technical questions
3. The salary I'm being offered is low. Especially for an engineering role with a lot of software engineering elements. I'm being offered £24k and a £500 month rent allowance (no contract yet) so essentially it's almost like I get paid £30k but I'm in a lower tax bracket. They also said that there are bonuses once milestones are reached. (The company is relatively new so I can possibly understand this kind of salary? Idk, my industry experience isn't heavy)
4. The CEO has a few companies, but they all fall under the same kind of product. Idk if that is a red flag but why doesn't he just own one company and have all the products under that name ? 
5. I can't seem to find any reviews about the company at all. It's relatively new (maybe two years now) and small so that might be why

I have managed to find one of the software engineers currently working with them and I have sent them a load of questions - so hopefully that should enlighten me once I hear back from them.

I have no other job offers at the moment which is why I'm a bit hesitant. I am in the final round for a few firms as me ruined before so I'm hoping they go well and give me some kind of comparison. 

 And it is my dream job/industry so it seems like a place to set my foot into my career.

Any advice is helpful, I didn't want to mention any names just in case.

82,Another get out of defense post. Would really appreciate some help. I feel stuck and dont know what to do. SAP story inside. Clickbait but would appreciate thoughts,1584062705,"I recently posted something that just made me realize I really dislike my job more than I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work in Aerospace and have not learned a single (not trying to be dramatic) thing. I have a clearance and the groups I have been in are just really badly structured, no management, people leaving every other month, etc, to the point that no one knows anything and I am left alone being transferred from one program to another playing on my phone. 

(Hey, Ive tried to be proactive but when youre waiting on documents and being allowed to see stuff there is not much you can do. Also, every computer is different so I dont have access to what I would like. If you know you know. If you disagree feel free to call me out. Suggestions are what I am asking for.) 

**I am asking, how can I make this situation better but I would prefer to leave this field as a whole.**

Upper Management kind of knows and I guess they just cannot do much. Idk, I feel like Ive wasted the last several months at my place. I really relate to all the ""get me out of defense posts"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am not trying to belittle this field. I know the field is not a monolithic environment, but from my personal experience I do not have one single good thing to say from a jr engineering perspective starving to learn. This FOR SURE I have made clear to management and overall I dont know how to transition to other jobs when I feel I dont get any support. 

The reasons I dont feel like I get any support:

We're hiring like crazy but dont have any structure on onboarding. So every time someone new joins the group there is a large confusion on what to assign them/where to place them. In other words, they're trying to accommodate new hires quicker than they can process them(???). Not sure but this is my understanding. 

No one is available to get me up to protocol.

Management is new on all the programs I have been on so they're learning too and dont really have time for me. (Tbh, this makes me sad because I want to learn. I want to do anything ""technical"" but if I have a question no one replies to me- and I KNOW Im not rude or weird to be around because people like to chat with me when they're free, but again everyone is time strapped )

I \*consistency\* reach out and see if there is anything I can help others with to no avail.

I read documentation and try to learn anything by being a fly in the wall in meetings and  I have to ask to go to them although I should (???) be invited since I am technically part of the team and meet the classification level. 

When I ask questions privately, I get dismissed until I get authorized to view that information but eventually get moved programs. 

Engineers who have been here longer are also confused on what to do with me although they have ""too much work"", yet they dont have time to train me to help them although they ""want to"".

Also, if I am giving myself credit, I know I am not dumb and only inexperienced but I feel like no one is available to train me (aside from read this large document that we dont even adhere to and its not what we do).

 I feel uncomfortable sometimes working in a closed environment, so I think it would be good for my mental health to get out of aerospace as a whole.

More specifically this degree is a M.Eng. Furthermore, I am looking for ways to leverage my current work experience, licenses, supervisor experience, and educational background. However, I have been having an overall difficulty getting my foot in. 

To summarize my experience I have a B.S. in Physics. From there I went to work in a hospital clinical lab. In that position I was able to obtain a clinical tech license and at the same time started my degree in Biomedical Engineering. In that time I was given the responsibility to be an acting Lab Supervisor during management transition (~6 months). My work mostly now entails working in clinical/lab administration. Additionally, many times advising clinicians on reseach samples. The lab is also clinical research.

When as the acting supervisor I moved away from the lab bench but, now with a new manager that I am partially training I notice I will be going to the beach more and it is something I don't want to fully return to. Through my research I have found an interest in moving towards a consultant role. In the past months I was thrown quickly into a role where I had to take hold of ongoing or new projects and continue them or get the ball rolling with limited information.

12,Simple cam-follower mechanism loading up spring - what am I doing wrong?,1584011579,"Hi all,

I'm designing a super simple cam follower mechanism which loads up a spring over 270 degrees of its rotation and is then powered by the spring over the last 90. Rough sketch of what I'm talking about [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/oMGpHep).

What I want to find out is what the torque vs degree plot for the camshaft looks like.

My thinking is a simple energy conservation equation i.e. work in = work out.

Torque * angle (in radians) = elastic potential energy of the spring.

So from 0-270, work is being done by the cam shaft via the applied torque to store energy in the spring. Then from 270-360, work is being done by the spring to generate torque in the cam shaft.

However my confusion comes as I consider the intervals of 0-270 and 270-360.

The intervals are different sizes (in terms of the angular displacement) so presumably the average and therefore peak torques for each of those two intervals must be different? How can this be? Is this what actually happens? The cam generates more torque on average over 90 degrees than what was required to drive the cam over the first 270?

I must be missing something out of my energy equation but I don't know what. I was neglecting friction and kinetic energy of the cam but maybe these are not valid assumptions?

Personally i'm not for or against it anyway, I just figure if we pay for something already we might as well use it to get our money's worth, but whatevs.

**Anyway, I'm looking for leads on a decent Document Management System**. I work for a very project oriented engineering company (&lt;50 people) in the renewable energy space that interacts with a lot of EPCs, Manufacturers, Vendors, etc.  We're looking for some solution that will keep us and interested parties up to date on the latest documents. It should track quotes, track submittals, and track internal drawing revisions &amp; comments.

I've noticed a lot of our counterparts, competitors, third parties, etc. use Bluebeam Revu and Bentley Projectwise.  Anyone have experience with these? Is it too ""heavy"" to implement? Is it too much $$$?  Is it the right solution? WTF is BIM anyhow?  Any other recommendations? Any good resources to look up DMS solutions? Any good implementation examples that don't involve me wasting my time with a half-assed vendor with their sorry excuse of a lunch and learn? (Don't get me wrong I love lunch, I just hate learning nothing).

Right now we basically use Dropbox &amp; Excel spreadsheets to share/track our documents.  It's a chaotic mess as people will edit a Rev B. titled document after a Rev. C has been posted.  There's a constant ask of ""hey can you send me the latest document?"" Lots of time wasted here.

Note: It's preferred any recommendation is a SaaS solution as we don't like onsite management of stuff.

Using the 'Pipelines' stencil, I can add a pipe which has embedded properties. However, I'm not seeing something what I believe should be a very basic piece of information about a pipe; namely, it's length.

Since I set the drawing to have the dimensions of the facility, I'm using the actual dimensions of the equipment, so the pipes should be fairly accurate as far as the footage lengths.  (I'll round up and over of course.) My problem is that I cannot seem to get the length of that line from the information in the ShapeSheet. There's a whole lot of info in there for sure, but I can't seem to figure out how to pull that information out.

I've searched around the web but have failed.  Perhaps I'm using the wrong search terms.  I can't be the first person to ask for something like this.

Here's an example (sorry I couldn't get the images to change order after I uploaded). I drew a pipeline and added the dimension stencil to it. Total length should be 182.5'. When I go into the ShapeSheet, I see lots of dimensions but I can't seem to collect those dimensions together easily to add up to the same length. I added a 'Length' property to the Shape Data in the hopes of being able to expose that information but that's a stretch goal for me; I'm obviously not educated on how to use Visio beyond simple drawings.

Is there a way to find this information or produce it somehow? What I'm trying to avoid is having to add dimension shapes to every part of these pipes to figure how how long they are.

47,Portable peltier refrigerator efficiency,1583954236," Like many others, i'm thinking about building my own custom refrigerator. The main idea is to make it portable for camping or festival. I am aware that peltier coolers are very inefficient - they can consume a lot of current (4A to 10A).

The box should be around 6-10 liters. The interior will be built using thermocole and maybe covered by heat reflective tape. You can open the refrigerator only from the top to prevent cold from escaping.  

I'm trying to make it as efficient as possible, because i'm going to use batteries for the power supply. Currently i'm thinking about 4x Li-ion 18650 batteries (2500mah or 3000mah).  Would you suggest to use something else for power supply? 

I understand that one side of peltier will get hot while another gets cold. I need to extract the heat using a heat sink for keeping cool side at low temperatures. I would prefer not to use big heat sink ([https://imgur.com/EtTAjKe](https://imgur.com/EtTAjKe)) because it would require more space, but in order to be as efficient as possible I might have to go with that.

Now I want to use a specific API which offers me the option to retrieve hourly W10m data of a typical meteorological year based on longitude and latitude, but I want to be able to move that around (relating to wind turbine hub heights). 

I can do that using a roughness length, this is quite trivial (just a mathematical expression, nothing to do there)

However, I would need a roughness length (z0), and I can find no databases on that. 

NASA kindly offers an API which gives daily averages of W10 and W50, so that could be useful. I could extract n values of W10 and W50, solve for z0 and take the mean of all z0's I find. Then I could move my hourly wind profile to the correct height.

An alternative could be to use the height adjusted wind speed database by NASA to obtain W\_hub and just calculate my Weibull parameters from that, then calculating my wind speed occurrences. (I would have to abandon my source of choice). However, this is historical data an not a TMY so I would either take several years an take the mean of that, which seems like a fair approximation. ^((I don't know exactly how a TMY is constructed, but I guess I would select months that have the smallest eviation from the mean of all of that month?))

I graduated in 2017 with a diploma (a level below Bachelor’s)
1st job - The part time cadet job I had during study, the company told me they didn’t have a full time opportunity when I graduated.
2nd job - I then found a full time role at a concrete precast plant as a quality assurance technician, mainly ensuring dimensions of our products were correct as per drawings and checking concrete quality used.
I left that job after finding out about their cheap tactics ( I was underpaid because they altered my contract and also was made to work 12 hours continuously without lunch break) regarding my employment and then stating that if I don’t like it then the door is always open to leave.
3rd job - Working at a consultancy now for a change, employed again as a tech and drafter,but for past 11 months have not done any projects.
The company has undergone changes with new ownership (employee owned business now), managers being moved around and let go, meanwhile the work hasn’t increased so I haven’t done anything worth noting other than menial tasks for the sake of busyness.

I can’t leave current employment due to immigration restraints and have to stick around until I get another visa.
Meanwhile I feel I haven’t used any of my uni learning at all, and have basically forgotten all of the things I have learnt.

I’m more worried that if I change job now, the new employer would expect a certain level of work readiness that comes with experience which I don’t have.

I have thought of going back to uni to get Bachelors and at the same time I’m unsure if that would change anything, especially after the cost and time invested.

All this has resulted in a very poor mental state with lack of motivation and initiative.

What’s the best use of my time at work? ( I’m not allowed to learn skills outside the requirement and mostly looked down upon if I’m not doing chargeable work)

Job searching right when I graduated was pretty tough, I wasn't hearing anything back from employers. I was most interested in a mechanical design position but found a majority of those postings required masters so I just looked for more entry level Mechanical engineering positions. After a couple months I broadened my horizons and started applying to sales/application engineering positions.

I then quickly found and filled an engineering inside sales position at an electric heating company. After doing well for a year I was promoted to applications engineer (basically a front end design engineer; you need to heat something and I figure out all the technical requirements and provide sales a quote). I don't use CAD/Inventor/solidworks anymore, I haven't much since finishing school. Just use Excel and certain heat exchange flow programs. Now 3 years later I really feel as though I'm not doing what I want to be doing and feel stuck. 

I don't seem to really match many of the local job postings due to the somewhat niche path I took to start. I own a house with my fiance so moving really isn't in the cards either. Continuing my education on my own some at this time is also not really an option.

Say we have a pipe that then splits into two other pipes arranged in parallel.  Lets assume pipe 1 has a smaller diameter than pipe two.  Lets also assume after some length L in both pipes, that they rejoin and return to the pump.

I know from electronic circuits that the higher resistance branch receives a smaller current, and that the total voltage drop between the two parallel branches must be the same.

How much of this holds true for the analogous hydraulic circuit?  On the one hand, resistance dramatically increases as the radius shrinks, but on the other hand I'm recalling bernoulli's law, which would dictate that the fluid in the smaller pipe must move faster and therefore, that would increase the volume flow rate through that branch.

Right now I'm just looking at variable humidity. In my [current setup](https://imgur.com/a/YJar2VP) (top) I have a dry nitrogen tank going into a T-joint with the outlets going to motorized needle valves. One line goes into a 100% humidity chamber and the other stays dry. They recombine with another T-joint and then go into the sample chamber.

Do I need check valves before the final T-joint (bottom image) ? I've been getting really long settle times when I change valve positions. I thought this was because I needed to flush out the sample space, so I added a solenoid and small vacuum pump to cycle the sample chamber, but I still see long settle times.

I'm also expanding this to a  variable gas flow setup with two separate gasses, a carrier gas (likely nitrogen) and a analyte gas. Since these are two different sources will backfill still be a problem?

30,Problems with today's engineering school curriculum and my proposed solution (let's have a discussion!),1583846844,"Now that I am graduating in May, I wanted to throw this idea out here that's been brewing for the past couple years. This is just for the purposes of interesting discussion and sharing experiences, at this point I have no intention of attempting to implement this. As a mechanical engineer, it will be somewhat geared toward that, but I think its applicable to other engineering disciplines. Yes this is long, but I am really interested in people's thoughts, and if they have had similar ideas. 

It starts here: How many of you heard a professor, or industry person, or recent grad say something like, ""Even though I'm not using much of what I learned in school, that's OK because what engineering school actually does is teach you problem solving""

Now that sounds nice, but whenever I heard that I thought, ""Are you kidding me?"" So you are telling me all those countless hours grinding out rote math and physics practice problems, and studying for exams, and doing projects, really wasn't that important? If the goal was to learn generic ""problem solving"" then we might as well have done puzzles and played chess for 4 years. What was the point of that specific study of engineering topics? And it does seem based on what I have learned (including the job I will be starting in May), that many many engineers don't use much of the specific knowledge they learned in school. 

So this frustration led me to think of how this discrepancy between what engineering students learned and what they did in the field could be fixed. For engineers, this seems like a pretty inefficient education solution, right?

1.) As one of the older engineers said at my internship this past summer, ""They basically train you for grad school these days."" The first part of this proposal is to offer a grad school tract and an industry track. If students choose the grad school track, then the structure of everything would stay exactly the way it is. The ""industry tract"" is what I am interested in.

2.) The main purpose of this plan is making sure to teach students actual skills that will be useful in the workplace, not just knowledge. Though engineering is more practical than a business degree, you still don't come away with any specific skillsets, just a bunch of generic knowledge, most of which you forget anyway (except that 10% of super smart people out there). 

3.) So the big change is that every class would be totally project based. All learning of the concepts of the topic would be done through carefully designed projects. Why? Because this mirrors the workplace. Few, if any, engineers in industry will be doing practice problems and timed tests. Unfortunately this is the actual ""skill"" many students come out of school with. But I have never seen that on a job description. If the skill we want students to have is ""problem solving"" let's design a curriculum that actually reflects that goal. 

4.) Now because of this format, less material of a particular subject matter will be covered in a semester. Instead of getting through 7 chapters of the thermo book (and remembering none of it) maybe you would only get through 3-4. But who cares? If the goal of engineering school is problem solving then it doesn't really matter how much thermo material you walk away with (again most people forget 75% anyway in the current model). Plus only a small number of student will end up in an industry where its necessary. And its definitely true that learning through practice leads to greater retention than uncontextualized random information. So students are more likely to remember what they do cover. 

5.) Additionally, things like machine shop skills, 3D printing, and actually building stuff would be a required part of the curriculum/projects, etc. Not just extracurricular things. As a mech. Eng., how many companies have a I seen who want experience in machine shop? But I never had to do it, and I didn't realize until too late how important it was. 

6.) So, the projects would have to be carefully designed to force students to learn the req'd concepts in order to do well on the project. In my experience about 10% of the class actually pays attention in lecture. The rest are sleeping or on their phone. So let's eliminate lecture! If it doesn't work, throw it out. The professor might spend 1 or 2 intro lectures to introduce the topic, give relevant textbook chapters, and textbook problems. The rest of the class time would be workdays. The textbook problems would be given with solutions so students could reverse engineer what they specifically need for their design to work. Again, the point of engineering school isn't to become good at practice problems, but to problem solve and apply knowledge. 

7.) I have a previous degree in fine arts. One thing that I think would be very useful in the spirit of developing actual skills and not knowledge, would be to have fine arts style critiques of each project. The team would present the project, and then the class/professor would give feedback. How to improve design efficiency? Cost? Simplicity? Functionality? Aesthetic qualities?

8.) Overall, I think this structure better prepares students for industry. It recognizes some of the inefficienies and flaws with the current system and seeks to fix them. Yes, students will cover less material, but again, most students forget 75% of what they learned and this is expected even be employers. Through hands-on learning students will retain more of what they do learn. If an engineer needs to get more knowledge in thermo or materials science, they will get that on the job, as they do now. So I say let's stop wasting student's time and money, make employers happier, and use our engineering problem solving skills not just for our work, but for our education.",AskEngineers,False,comptonrj,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fgdskt/problems_with_todays_engineering_school/

35,Wondering if an interconnected air/liquid suspension system is a good idea for a rover.,1583832031,"Rules say no homework so I promise this isn’t for my homework because our rover budget is $10 apart from the kit and 3D printing and it’s not enough for a single lego shock absorber. I just thought about this in class and wanted to know if it was an good idea.

A suspension system with one shock absorber at each wheel with a large throw distance. It’s set either with air pressure or with water so that when the rover is on the ground the shock absorbers are halfway in. There is tubing connecting all of the shocks together, so if a liquid is inside the shocks they will always have the same average distance poking out. If you push one shock in, the liquid previously in the shock is pushed through the tubes and pushes the other three out each by a third of the amount the shock was pushed in. 

In my brain this means that if four wheels are 50% out when it’s on flat ground, then if one wheel starts hovering, the weight on the other shocks will be greater and there will be less/no pressure from the hovering shock to resist it, causing the shocks with traction to lower and the shock without traction to extend downwards, hopefully allowing the hovering wheel to touch ground.

39,How can I map out the curvature of a pool table?,1583824331,"For some background, I'm a physics PhD student. Our department has a pool table that everyone loves to use, but it's notoriously not flat (it has some minor curves and troughs in the wood below the felt that cause the ball to deviate if you hit it slowly).


As part of the requirements of our PhD, we have to give a project talk later in the year to the department. This doesn't actually have to be about your research, it can just be a broadly informative talk about a topic of your choice.
What I'd really like to do is give a presentation on the curvature of the pool table, I think it would be fun and I could apply some differential geometry, best strategies for compensating etc. and generally improve my data visualisation skills and learn a bunch of different things.

I have many ideas for what to do with the data if I were able to collect it, but the trouble is that (classic physics student) I have no idea what would be the best way to carry out the physical measurements.

Ever since I can remember I have always been interested in technology and hoped that one day I would be working in a field where I would get to build new gadgets and technologies (I had a particular interest in robotics). When it came time for college I was told by my teacher that physics was a great stepping stone to any field of engineering. Throughout college I was also told by various physics professors that one could do anything with a physics degree. So I decided to pursue physics instead of engineering without doing much further research on the matter (looking back, this was my mistake. I definitely should've done my research). However, since graduating I've realized that physics has taught me a lot about how things work at the very fundamental level (which is cool), and how to solve problems. But that knowledge doesn't extend much beyond academics or ideal situations. For example, I know quantum mechanics but I can't design a laser or a transistor on my own from that knowledge. I know solid state physics but I can't build a microchip or a semiconductor device on my own from that knowledge. I learned how to code a little bit in Matlab but only towards applications to physics problems. I don't know how to program embedded systems or robots. I know electromagnetic theory but I can't build an electric motor (If I took the time to read up on all these things then I could probably do them but that's beside the point). Essentially by choosing to do an Undergraduate degree in physics I missed out on all the hands on building, application, and design work that I would have received from an Engineering curriculum.

Since graduating with my first degree I got a job as an entry level ""design engineer"" for a utility contractor but it's pretty much sitting at a desk all day looking at a computer, it's pretty boring and not exactly the kind of work I'd like to do for the rest of my life. I’ve also had a lot of time to explore the field of EE and computer programming. I’ve been doing a lot of hobbyist circuit and robotics designs using arduino and raspberry pi, and have been learning from various books and YouTube videos. These resources have really only increased my enthusiasm for electronics, computers, robotics, and engineering, and have made me consider going back to school for a second bachelors.

One reason I want to do a bachelors as opposed to a masters is to get the opportunity to participate in engineering clubs and internships where the knowledge is generally a bit more practical than in classes, and to collaborate with other passionate people. Another reason is that I heard the time it would take to complete all the prerequisites and grad classes for a master’s program would be the same as that of a bachelor’s, so it doesn’t provide a time or cost benefit. Also, since little to no masters programs are ABET accredited (as I understand it), the bachelors would serve the added benefit of accreditation. Another thing is that I’ll probably go back to the same university I did my previous degree in so the prerequisite math, science, and gen-ed courses are taken care of. I also don’t have any student dept from my first degree so that's a bonus. Lastly, my problem with going for a masters is that it seems to be more specialized than a bachelors and I would rather have a well-rounded knowledge of ECE than specialize in one area.

Thanks a lot if you made it this far! Given all this info, my question is would it be wise to go back and earn another bachelors degree in engineering if my end goal is to get into the field of Robotics and/or embedded systems? or should I look for a Master's program in Engineering? I'm hoping someone who has been in a similar situation can offer some insight.

TLDR: I majored in physics but really have a passion for electrical and computer engineering, I enjoy robotics and embedded systems. Would it be wise to go back to school for a bachelors in ECE or just go for a masters?

Talking a look back a century (1920 - 2020), a lot has changed since BC (Canada)  passed the first Engineering Professional Act. In 1920, there were only about 500 - 600 Professional Engineers in BC, all men, and mostly Civil Engineers. It grew to 850 members by 1930, and 4000 by 1961. 

I'm not sure about the US, but back then over, people here used to actually say professional engineering was only for Civil Engineers. 

That all took off and especially in 60s and 70s when traditional ideas about engineering expanded to new disciplines like Aerospace, computer, software, and biomedical engineering. Here in BC for example, Dr. Carolyn Small was the first person to register as a professional biomedical engineer in 1980 and worked at the Vancouver General Hopsital (VGH). In 1990, Geoscience officially became a regulated profession too. 

Of course today there's registered Professional Engineers in all disciplines including Software, Environmental, Chemical, Computer, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical, Mining, Biomedical, etc. This continue to be a win-win for the public in terms of good design and safety, and also the engineering profession. It also carries a lot of respect and responsibility like medical and law professionals who are also registered and undergo professional practice reviews for checks and balances. Moving forward things will only get better and more diverse in the engineering industries.

1,I need help transitioning out of MEP Engineering,1583717952,"Engineers of reddit, please help.. 

I have a BSME, graduated in dec 2017, 3.3 GPA, 24 years old, and have been working in the MEP industry as a Mechanical designer/staff engineer for just about a year and a half. I took the first job I was offered out of school at a consulting firm in the city that was just outside of my college. Despite being good at my job, I absolutely hated the work &amp; the industry and found no motivation to learn and further pursue a career in MEP design. I didn't mind so much the consulting side of the industry.. more so that the work was boring, not innovative and that the final design didn't provide me with a fulfilling feeling. The issue.. I knew I hated MEP Engineering, but I had no idea what engineering industry I wanted to work in... or even continue engineering at all. I knew the work I wanted to do would contain utilizing my knowledge in thermo, fluids, and heat transfer (my favorite topics in college) but was a bit confused as to what I really wanted to do in life and ended up staying at my company for 1.5 years to find myself.

After 1 year I was completely down in the dumps and took a week vacation to visit friends and family in NY. While driving back home to NY, I noticed the Linden Cogen Plant in New Jersey and absolutely could not take my eyes off of it. I was blown away at the size and marveled at the idea of the dedication the engineers put in to design that monstrosity. I began doing a little research in powerplant engineering and learning about the different types of power generation stations/processes in the US. Specifically nuclear power plants fascinated me the most and I would often research about the design process and fundamentals during work. I would research companies that would be involved in this type of design work and was comforted by the fact that some were consulting engineering companies. Designing or retrofitting a nuclear power plant seemed extremely exciting to me and the end result of delivering power to cities and local communities gave me that fulfilling feeling I was looking for. It felt like it took so long.. but I finally knew what sector of engineering I wanted to work in.

At this point in time, I was comfortable leaving my job, taking sometime off, moving home to NY, and committing to looking for a job in power plant/nuclear plant consulting engineering. I spent about 2 months of CV updates, sending out resumes, reading power plant design texts and began getting a little nervous due to not hearing from any companies. Money in my family has been tight.. and because of this I figured that I can get a temporary MEP job locally, live at home and save money until a company from that industry contacts me.. It took me a week to get a local MEP job lol.. and currently I've been at my new company for 1 WHOLE WEEK.. The company is a significant upgrade to my last company, I get paid a lot more, and noticed that I'm actually just as smart in the field as my project managers.. It's nice to be able to pay the bills.. but I still hate the work!

I need help staying on track and continuing to pursue achieving my dream job in my dream industry.

Living in New York.. there obviously isn't a lot of job opportunities in nuclear consulting engineering as say.. well the south, middle of the country.. and although I'd love to remain living in NY, I know that I can't be picky about the job location.. I'm willing to move along the east coast maybe out west to Chicago but honestly can't see myself living somewhere like Alabama.. 

I'm not sure what else to do.. Engineers of reddit, what do I do to stay on track.. I feel like continuing to solely send out resumes isn't enough.. What more do I need to do or learn in order to land an interview in the industry? Have any of you made the switch out of MEP engineering? If so how did you go about it? Do any of you work in power plant consulting or maybe a construction company involved in nuclear design?

Ok so I’m currently a US citizen who graduated high school and I’m considering going out of country for college. The only thing is I want to major in aerospace engineering and I heard that can get tricky if I want to come back and get a job in the US. I just think it would be cool to do because of the lowered tuition and I love to travel as is. Since I would already most likely have to go out of state because there is only one college in my state that offers aerospace engineering, I figured I might as well go out of country as that is something I have thought about and dreamed of doing for a while. The only problem is I know the US is one of the best countries for aerospace engineering for college, so I’m worried about lack of job opportunities particularly if I want to come back and work in the US, or if my degree would even be recognized. I’m also worried about less opportunities just by simply going to a lesser known or recognized university. If anyone has any experience working in the aerospace field or anyone that has gone to college out of country that would be able to give advice on if this is a good idea or not it would be great. I have already been accepted to a few decent programs within the US, it just seems so much smarter to go out of country for tuition purposes as well as the fact that I love to travel anyways. The idea of college in general has been a bit nerve wracking, and thinking about going out of country has been the only thing that has made me excited about it.

4,Advice on negotiating start date for entry-level/new-grad position?,1583712891,"I'm about to graduate with my BSME and am currently interviewing for entry level jobs. I've put myself into a bit of an odd scenario, so I'm looking for advice on how to proceed. 

Last November, I accepted an internship offer from a reasonably well-known company in the oil and gas industry. At this time, I was applying to graduate schools in the hope of continuing my education in this field. 

Now, after really thinking about things, I've decided that I no longer want to pursue graduate school as I'm tired of school and not really interested in this industry as a career. I've already spoken to this company and the offer is still on the table if I don't go off to do a Masters. In addition, they would be able to convert it to a full time position. So, I'm basically set with this company. 

However, I'm in the process of interviewing for what is now my ideal job in my ideal industry (composites tooling/manufacturing engineer) with a very well known company in the aerospace industry. Furthermore, it is closer to my ideal location. I recently realized that I am happier in a manufacturing environment as opposed to a design or analysis focused one. I don't have an offer on the table yet. However, they seem very eager to hire me. 

The only issue with this new position, however, is that they would like for me to start in late July, while my internship with the former company would still be occurring. I feel like negotiating my start date to late September could raise eyebrows at this new company, but I don't want to lose this opportunity. On the other hand, I don't want to burn bridges with the former company.

Saving space, costs and complexity would be pleasant, so I'm thinking of a single Li-Pol accumulator at 11.1 V, 20A. But what would be the means of providing the power to voltage regulators and farther? 

I can't see myself designing a PCB, though it would be brilliant. On the other hand, servo controllers seem quite sizeable and packing all that with an Arduino and separate batteries on a robot sounds rather hilarious.

Hi Reddit. Firstly, I think it's amazing that there's people out there willing to help struggling strangers online. I figured I might as well give it a shot to see if I could find some advice on my current situation. I figure that I'm doing at least a few things wrong but I'm not sure what exactly.

**Description:** It's been 3 months since I've graduated (from a good school but no one seems to care about that). The search has been really slow (5 phone interviews, 1 decent on-site interview that ghosted afterwards). I'm confident that my abilities are on par with any new graduate but I put myself in a bad situation while in school (poor GPA, no internships, no networking).

**Location:** Currently in Georgia but willing to relocate anywhere. Would actually prefer to relocate so I can get away from my relatives.

**Application Strategy:** I've tried both spamming applications and crafting personalized cover letters. I've seen a lot of people recommend focusing the resume to the posting but is there a way for someone like me to do that with so little experience? I've been finding postings through LinkedIn, BioSpace, and corporate websites. Is there a better way to be searching?

**Positions:** It seems like most engineering positions are looking for Electrical, Mechanical, or Chemical engineers. So as a Biomedical engineer without those technical skills, I've mostly stuck to applying to biotech companies. And entry level positions in biotech companies seem to mostly be some form of Quality Engineer.

I took a plant engineering job since it was moving closer to an engineering role like I wanted and they said there was potential for me to get back into CAD (which I wanted). 

Here we are three years later. No CAD and any mistake I make is heavily scrutinized and often disciplined. Plus I'm supervising maintenance in addition to running the plant. The job is making me a nervous wreck. I can't eat, I can't accomplish things outside of work because I feel so nervous. 

I looked at job postings and started to get even more nervous because the postings that had to do with design list all these calculation duties which I have roughly a year of experience in and haven't messed with in 4 years now. Have I basically locked myself out of engineering for the rest of my life? 

This post might be a little bit scattered because I'm pretty worked up at the moment. I have gone back to my college notes and some spots are good and I understand. Other spots are a bit too vague to make anything of them.

This can be in civil or any other form of engineering industry. I'm even open to suggestions for if I diversified from engineering into finance or management one day.

I'm coming up to my final year before I graduate with a BA CivilEng from a mid-tier UK university and I really want to stand out from the crowd when I graduate.

I thought that was pretty impressive, given I have attended a university course full time for the past three years ( four once graduation) and will only be 22 when I graduate. 

However, when applying for engineering work in my university city on a part-time basis during term time, to gain more experience, I found that no one was interested in taking me on. Not one.

Say we have a slab, 9m x 9m, consistent depth, with columns at every corner, and every 3m, so we have 16 columns under the slab supporting it. As there are no beams, how would tributary areas look for these columns? Would each column take that half the span to the columns around it? (So basically a 1.5x1.5 square for the middle columns). Now is this a two way or one way slab? 

Now what  if there is a 10kpa load, 1.5x1.5 between 2 middle columns, such in a way that half of it covers half the 1.5x1.5 tributary area of one column. Would that mean half of 10kpa goes into 1 one column and the other half goes to another column? What force would that column experience? 10kpa\*area of that load in the tributory area? (10\*1.5\*1.5\*0.5). Would other columns experience this weight?

46,"Some questions about thermal battery usage. Case study of a suburban home, and energy grid impacts when use is wide-spread.",1583652614,"Context: My aunt recently installed a masonry/thermal mass stove. She only lights 1 big quick burn fire each day, and that does most of the heating in her (huge, very cold climate) home.

This got me thinking: In cooling dominated climates, instead of all of a suburban area turning on air-con when it's needed, all the houses have a thermal battery,  which is charged continuously, then used as a heat sink when needed. E.g. a ""normal"" family might have a series of insulated 200L water tanks buried in their back yard. You can sequentially cool each tank to, for example, 1C. I'll do back-of-the-napkin math at the end, on what this effect would have.

The questions that are on my mind: 

 * Effect of smoothing demand variability: everyone getting home and running the air-con on high. Instead of air-cons running high from appx. 4-8pm, they charge the thermal battery (i.e. bring down the temps in the buried water tanks) with a longer, more ideal time window such as at night. 

 * Suitability for smart-grid: Could this hypothetically be connected to a grid control system where a user can opt-in to supply-led scheduling? E.g., if a grid is dominated by wind generation, and forecasts anticipate an over-supply shortly followed by an under-supply, homes can adjust when they will charge their mass to stock up on cooling.

 * Heat-pumps benefiting from diurnal variation: I'm guessing that a heat-pump could ""store more cold"" if its hot side is in a cooler environment. If the variation is 10C (e.g. day is 30C, night is 20C), and you charge the battery at night,  are you essentially getting a free 10C cooling, thus reducing energy used?

 * electric grid engineering: Supposing enough residential systems to smooth out the demand spikes, and a system to couple the charging schedule with variable supply renewable energy grid, what might be the predicted benefit to the energy grid? E.g. the weather forecasts an over-supply due to high winds before a forecast under-supply . Connected thermal batteries automatically kick in to get as much charging done as possible during this over-supply.

 * could you improve the heat capacity of the system by having vessels with a higher freezing temperature immersed in the main fluid with a lower working temperature? Idea being you thus store a lot of thermal energy in the latent heat of the freeze/thaw cycle. E.g. 30% Ethylene Glycol to water as main working fluid. water as latent heat storage. giving a lower-bound range to about -20 or more.

 * to what extent might large buildings benefit. For example, a high-rise office building uses this at an industrial scale. It's heat-pump requirements are reduced (run at 100% 24hrs instead of the same heat-pumping ), and shifts some base-load demand to night-time. 

 * Is my back-of-the-napkin math reasonable?

Water has a specific heat capacity of [4190J/(KG * C)](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/sensible-heat-storage-d_1217.html). 1000L gives 4190kJ/C, and with a target environmental temperature of 20C, that gives you an operating range of 1-20C.  19C * 4190kJ = 79610kJ in a 1000L system. allowing for about 5% fudge-factor, this simplifies to 80mJ of thermal storage.

Let's say we have a house that calls for 5kW cooling capacity air-con unit, and runs at an average of 80% capacity (initial cool-down, then maintenance cooling), we now have a model to go by: 4kW of cooling delivered from 1000L of 1C water of thermal storage gives you 20,000 seconds of cooling  of about 5h 36m of adequate cooling. For simplicity, let's fudge-factor that to 5h and call it efficiency loss.

Recently I've been particularly enamored with ""wandering hour"" watches, timepieces composed of three wheels that rotate independently to track hours.

My latest obsession in this category is the Gorilla Fastback GT Drift, the reason why being that  unlike other wandering hour watches the Drift is actually built on top of an existing, fairly common movement.  The wandering hours component is actually a module that just goes on top of the standard movement.  Video here showing it in action:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQe-J8FhN9g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQe-J8FhN9g) 

Can anyone explain to me how they might have gotten this to work?  Specifically, how are they getting the wheel to rotate as it passes the normal six o-clock position?  I've noticed that as that wheel passes the bottom middle of the watch face it does a quick 90 degree rotation regardless of whether the time is being wound forward (clockwise) or backwards (counter-/anti-clockwise).

I'm currently doing a petroleum engineering program, (undergrad) student. The thing is when I joined this program, I was in for the money however as years progressed, I became more interested in the aeronautical related stuff because I find it cool and it thrills me and just imagining me making rockets, planes that fly alone hype me a lot.  Therefore, my motivation for joining this program was gone.

Now the issue is that this happened while I was already in the program. So it's like now I'm in a very weird position myself. Like both fields i.e. petroleum and aeronautical are so far away. But I mean, there is still a lot of stuff that is common such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, the strength of materials, statics and dynamics, C programming, Solidworks etcetera. 

Because of this, I have this tiny bit of hope that I might be able to make it in there. The issue is that I haven't found anyone online or even in my circle of my friend's circle who has made this kind of jump. And that's why I'm asking here because all of you here are professional engineers and you would know more about the nitty-gritty stuff that will be involved. 

Below is my skill level just so you guys can help me out in a better way.

Rating criteria is as follows: Noob (0-1) - Bad (2-4) - Average (5) - Good (6-8) - Awesome (9 - 10)

\- C programming (Extreme noob, logic sucks)

\- Solidworks (Bad, can't find the time to practice it cause involved in my typical studies).

\- Strength of materials (Average, need more practice)

\- Statics and Dynamics (Bad)

\- Fluid Mechanics (Bad)

\- Thermodynamics (Bad)

\- Arduino (Extreme Noob, because haven't done anything related to Arduino so expected to be this)

\- Matlab (Extreme Noob, don't have the time to learn it).

\- Eagle (or anything related to circuit boards, I'm an extreme noob in them also, cause no time to practice them)

Hmm. Besides this, I can't think of anything technical related.

So based on my skill level and the position of it in. What can I do to land myself a job as a rocket engineer?

Before you tell me to use a full bed CNC I would point out that these generally don't come in 5+ meter long versions for a startup.


There must be a machine that you can set up to drill/route holes in, where you feed in a length of stock and it moves it along inside the machine, cutting the holes as it goes. 


Even just a name of what to search for could be enough.


Failing this I will take the standard belt driven CNC router design and clamp the stock to the belt so it's pulled under the machine for cutting. This makes for a compact solution rather than a 5m long Y axis which seemed like the initial solution...

26,"Decision on RF Protocol for Two Way Star Network, Incorporating Contention Based Medium Access",1583498876,"Hi all,

I am in the process of brainstorming a plan to implement a radio protocol for a set of GPS modules. The scope of this project and reasons for posting are outline below.

**The Scenario:**

The GPS system is configured in a ""base-rover"" or ""master-slave"" set up. There is a single GNSS receiver, that is in a fixed location, which acts as a base station. This station (the master) broadcasts ""correctional data"" to all ""rovers"". This correctional data allows rovers to calculate their position to an high level of accuracy. In a general application, the base does not require to hear any response from a rover unit, and this system can be configured in a one-way manner. My application requires rovers to reply to the rover at certain times, and hence I must make modifications to my current implementation to allow this.

**Data Transmission:**

The base sends 4 messages, 3 are transmitted once per second, the other once every 10 seconds. These messages range from 6 - 130 bytes including headers &amp; CRC. They are fed into a serial buffer and sent over the air by UHF.

The rovers will be required to transmit a response upon the occurrence of a specific event (they cross a line), with packet size no more than 15 bytes. The reception of the rover data is not time critical, and the percentage of rovers that will want to transmit at any given time will be less than 5% of the total number of rovers (approx 200-300), that may be active. The rover will only have to transmit its data once during the course of this scenario.

**Current Implementation:**

Currently, my implementation supports only one base and one rover, in a point-to-point configuration. I am using HOPERF HM-TRP radio modules with a variant of SiK open-source firmware. I wish to expand to a multi-rover configuration as detailed above, and these radios will not be sufficient, so a change is required.

**What I need:**

I am looking to implement a two-way star network (1 base, N rovers), as well as some method of contention based medium access. Considering the lack of time sensitivity with the reception of message, I had considered Slotted ALOHA or similar. Similarly a range of 300+ m and a data rate of 50+kbps would be desired

I have considered two protocols, one on 2.4GHz (ZigBee) and one on 433MHz (LoRa), these protocols allow more flexibilities in terms of configuring star and mesh topologies. Each have their own respective advantages in terms of range and bit rate. Similarly, zigbee seems rather rigid with its underlying MAC protocol using 802.15 and CSMA.

If anyone has any suggestions to point me in the right direction for an appropriately flexible protocol, to allow me to implement a contention based MAC such as slotted aloha, it would be greatly appreciated!",AskEngineers,False,CNolo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/feczl2/decision_on_rf_protocol_for_two_way_star_network/

40,Is there a Design Standard for Steam Handling / Process Control? (Safety Related),1583470678," So here's my dilemma:

Our machine has a singular Steam Control Valve that controls steam to an injector, which heats a tank of water. The tank does have a lid. Personnel can access the top and are at risk of direct steam exposure if the valve were to malfunction.

The Valve is controlled electrically (24VDC + 4-20mA), and actuates pneumatically (compressed air). If the electrical controls were to fail, the valve would fail-close. If the air supply were to fail, the valve would fail-last (remain in its current position). The simple solution would be to replace the current valve with a comparable one WITH a Fail-Close characteristic, or add a dedicated Fail-Close valve in series with the existing valve.

As you can tell, I am concerned with the air supply abruptly failing, and harming an unsuspecting Operator. I explained my concern to My Chief Engineer (who is a designated professional engineer, and designed this system), along with the aforementioned solutions. He responded saying ""the probability of the compressed air supply failing is too low for us to change the design."" He also requested that I cease spending anymore time on this topic.

I took this issue to my boss (who is also a designated professional engineer, but not as familiar with process design). He suggested finding a design standard or guideline that specifies our issue, and suggested starting with contacting the supplier/manufacturer of our Steam Valve.

If anyone has recommendations, can point me in the right direction, or would like to give their opinion, I appreciate any and all of it. I've done a broad search through OSHA, but came to realize my question/topic is very specific, and might be buried deep inside an existing standard or professional practice guideline.

For those of you who want more context:

The system design used to have an Angle Seat Valve, which has the Fail-Close characteristic. These valves were not great at sealing the final bit of its travel, and tended to leak when fully closed. The Chief Engineer replaced the Angle Seat Valve with a V-Port Ball Valve. These offer a great seal when fully closed, and resolved the prior issue.

I found that the Chief Engineer didn't do his due diligence and perform an FMEA on this engineering change; there is zero documentation con record. Right now, he is likely too embarrassed to admit his oversight.

88,Standard for Mechanical Engineering Drawing Signatures?,1583422124,"Hello everyone. ME here. 

I searched the reddit and didn’t find an answer to this so I apologize in advance if it’s already out there.

We do drawings per ASME Y14 and with that, also have a drawing signature block. Signatures can include Designer, Drawing Check, engineered by, engineer check, supervisor/manager, QA etc. 

Does there exist a good standard for what those roles should/could be and what the roles and responsibilities of these are?

An argument broke out and a committee formed on what a drawing check is and what it includes (completeness of drawing vs. tolerance, etc)

We can develop this, but if I have a ASME/ISO/etc. standard to fall back on, it would go a long way to ease this trial. Thank you all in advance!",AskEngineers,False,Tankgineer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fdwu3e/standard_for_mechanical_engineering_drawing/
89,What concepts do you recommend as the most important in a product engineer/design position at a furniture company?,1583422069,"So I’m still in school (my final year) for mechanical engineering, but was hired on last October as a engineer in the product development department of an office furniture company. I was hired with only one other engineer (Lead Product Engineer) who is leaving at the end of the month. He’s always been the person that knew exactly how to solve a problem or question that was brought to him immediately, and I’m just not like that. Because of a myriad of factors, they’ve decided to wait until later in the year (possibly never if I do well) to hire someone to replace him, so I’m now going to be assuming both his and my position. I’m starting to really panic a bit, because I just don’t know if I’ll always be able to answer questions that are brought to me quickly, or ever. People come and ask me all the time can I put this size and weight table top on this base? How do we prevent this column from sliding around when it’s in place? Etc. I’ve already taken Statics/Dynamics/Strength of Materials, etc., so I feel like I know the basics of everything I need to know, but am just not always able to make the ‘connection’ of a real world problem and the similar textbook problem in order to solve it. 

What advice do you have of topics/books/etc. to look over that might help me with this? I’m looking both for the topics that you think might be relevant in a position like this, as well as any advice on how to make the connection between school problems and work problems, so that I can find the solution. I’m starting to feel like an idiot, because I feel like every time I recommend a solution, the guy that’s leaving just says “nope, that won’t work.” I just really want to do the best I can do, and I know I’m more than capable of getting there, with the work out in. Right now, I’m going about actually building the table in question and physically testing it, which I know isn’t an efficient use of my or the company’s time, and soon with just one engineer in the department, I know I might not have the option. 

Thanks in advance for any help or advice!

Will this base &amp; table top configuration tip? Will this base support this table top weight and size? How do we prevent slipping between a column and base?

7,Do most engineering managers have more aggressive personality types?,1583382264,"TL;DR: Last two engineering managers (and only ones I've had so far) have been total dicks to me and I'm wondering if this is a common personality type amongst extremely competent engineering/business types. 

I have been working since I was 16 at various jobs, and finally did an engineering internship while studying for my bachelors and am currently 1 year+ into my first full time engineering role (at a different company than my internship) after college. I have had about 20+ managers during the time I've started working, and about 4 of them have been total assholes. Most of the time I get along with my managers and have been promoted many times.

However my managers at the last two (and only) engineering companies I've worked for seemed to have been especially difficult. At my internship, my manager would display behaviors toward myself and other coworkers such as (slamming hands on desks, screaming at people, yelling at interns in meetings in front of everyone, intimidating smaller older women, blaming interns for his mistakes, etc.) He wanted to hire me, despite the way he treated me, but I took an offer at a different (current) company. I made great friends that were fully employed there, and one of them told me how he, and basically everyone else, fled his department after I left.

My manager at my current company has an eerily similar temperament. The only difference is that he is an extreme micromanager. He will manage every minute of my time, up to and including spending hours at my desk, watching me do 3D modeling or physics. He doesn't have an engineering degree and will often argue with me about the physics or tell me every move to make when 3D modeling. He does similar things such as shouting at employees, staring them down, giving extremely unrealistic workloads (telling you that you're doing the job of 3 people), controlling every aspect of your work, and then blaming you when things dont go perfect. He keeps his own stool in my office so he can sit at my desk and told me I need to keep a spot on my desk clear for him so he can come in and work with me there. 

I've also noticed he wants his employees to basically exist in some kind of superposition while they work. I've watched him tell 9 employees to work on 10 different tasks, that each take a full day to complete if dedicating all their time, and demand that all 10 tasks get done. It drives me, the floor supervisor, and the lower level manager insane. I will go back at him and say:

Me: Ok, who is going to work on task #10? 

Manager: Employee # 3.

Me: Ok then who will work on task #3? 

Manager: Employee #3

Me: Both tasks take all day though.

Manager: It doesn't matter, they need to get done. 

My main job is managing these 6 month engineering projects. They require mountains of discussion with engineers from vendors and customers. purchase orders, quotes, sales orders, proposals, submittals, shipping and receiving, 3D modeling, physics calculations, etc. I do all of it. My boss spends all day with me, micromanaging the whole way through, then weekly, he will assign detailed 3D modeling projects for separate projects that take 20+ hours of modeling to complete (I'm talking modeling 15 different assemblies that each contain 100+ detailed parts/subassemblies which cannot be imported from somewhere else). I can't emphasize how infuriating this part is. He basically assigns these tasks in passing, as he walks by. ""By the way, I need all these things modeled by Friday."" Meanwhile I don't even have 20% of the information available to me to begin working on it.

Then daily, discuss with me and make me do heat transfer/themo/fluids physics for new projects that I haven't seen yet, while also daily taking me away from my desk to help him do administrative tasks, all while demanding I facilitate sales calls, manage the shipping of industrial parts (requires being on the warehouse floor for 10 hours a week), and do side build projects for customers. He will literally sit in my office with me, making me do physics calcs for new projects all day, and then berate me about why the 3D modeling projects didn't get done. My response is always ""You were with me all day, when was I supposed to work on it?"" and his response is always ""There's time. It's your responsibility to get it done."" To me, his expectations are unreal. I feel like I need to be superhuman to get all this done.",AskEngineers,False,ObjectiveBig6,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fdpsmi/do_most_engineering_managers_have_more_aggressive/

It tore off the thin rubber part of the cord and now there's about two inches of what I assume is copper wiring showing. 

I assume that touching that part of the wire would electrocute me now.

No harm since I wouldn't accidentally touch it and could just unplug it once it was done.

What is the difference?,1583369874,"Hello /r/AskEngineers , I am having a hard time deciding which route I want to go in terms of my career. My issue with mechanical engineering is that I have to take another semester of chemistry. I absolutely hated it the first time around and actually enjoy my Physics class. I have heard really bad things about the next level Chemistry from peers who have taken the course, which also adds to my apprehension in going the ME route. However, I looked at Mechanical Systems Engineering and it only requires one semester of Chemistry and two semesters of Physics and seems to be an easier load than straight up ME. Also, for those familiar, I am planning on transferring to ASU (currently in CG) and MSE is offered at their polytechnic campus (which I have been told is more hands-on and project-oriented in terms of classes), while ME is at the main Tempe campus (since that campus has more theory heavy classes regarding each major). So the notion that I have got from advisers and the heads of the engineering department at my Community College is that I should avoid the hands-on route and pursue the theory heavy route (avoid systems related degrees and go into ME) as it opens more doors even while being harder.

The company isn't exactly what I see myself doing in the future as I want to go more into bridge/skyscraper design and this company does more site engineering, however I don't know if I'll be able to find any entry level position that does exactly what I think I want to do. Basically, I'm very unsure on what to do. This has been my only interview so far although I probably should have been applying to more jobs (I've applied to about 50 so far). I'm currently considering a few options so far:

1). Counter with an offer closer to $65,000 and stay with the company for about a year while I gain some experience and then start looking for jobs 

2). Take the offer and start working there part time while I continue job hunting and hope I find a more appealing job in the city with better pay (not sure how ethical/ ""okay"" this would be considered, or if it even matters)

3). Decline the offer completely and hope I get more offers

22,How to deal with highly expectant honours supervisor,1583361821,"Context:

I've just started my 4th year of Engineering with honours and found a project I'm interested in pursuing. My honours supervisor has spoken to me about the project, what it will involve and what the main goals are. All of this is something I can probably do throughout the year, but the more I've looked into it, the more there is to it.

The supervisor mentioned past projects that had failed and made it seem that if the project didn't end up how the supervisor wanted it, then the student did a very bad job. My project has a crazy expectation and although I may be able to meet that, it would be at the cost of no personal time throughout the year due to prior commitments and work. If I don't meet the expectation, I'm unsure of how this will all end up due to the supervisor's attitude towards past students and their expectation of the project.

23,Calculating total head from a pump,1583361470,"Hello all,

I am working on a school project where we are designing a water reservoir for a facility. Currently my group is calculating if the amount of water delivered to the facility will be adequate when the reservoir is being filled by a water main (and that water main is also supplying the facility simultaneously.)

I have calculated the pressure in the water main when the tank is being filled, now I want to know what the pressure in the main will be after the water goes through a pump station. The pump it will go through has dimensions of 1.25""x1.5"", 120GPM @ 150' head, and 7.5 HP. I thought that I could look up performance curves for pumps with similar dimensions, and estimate how much head would be delivered to the water (i.e. my flow rate is 300 GPM and this lines up with 100ft of head, then add the 100 ft of head to the existing head prior to the pump). I have talked with some people and I don't think my problem is as simple as I initially thought, one person said I would need to determine the headloss in the entire network to accurately quantify the head gain.

27,"Possible Career Change, Advice Appreciated",1583354735,"Hello everyone. I'm an EE working at a small power utility, where I worked as an intern in my undergrad years and accepted a full-time position upon graduation.  I obtained by BSEE in 2014, my MBA in 2017, and my Professional Engineering License in 2018.  My job currently has me wearing a lot of hats, but a general synopsis of my duties includes managing the metering and substation department (one department for both groups, all technicians), setting up SCADA programs and communication backhauls for various devices, coordinating with construction crews for projects, and maintaining existing infrastructure.  I love my job, but the work culture is deteriorating due to questionable leadership.  Also, my wife and I are about to have a baby, and we would like to live near better school districts and have more amenities available to us.  Our current home (a starter house) cannot boast the same, and while the housing market is booming in other parts of the country, I can't speak for our area.

I had a recruiter contact me to discuss an opportunity opening up with a contracting/consulting firm.  He seemed confident that with my background, I would meet at least an Engineer III position and would likely be classified Senior Substation Engineer IV.  This position would manage other engineers.   
He strongly encouraged me to apply (which I guess is good, as that's his job).  As we discussed the position, I recognized that I did have at least some previous exposure to the job requirements listed if not outright proficiency, and this opportunity does have more upward mobility than my current position.  In short, I'm interested in discussing further.

As we were discussing the opportunity, the recruiter mentioned some details on salary (in broad terms, nothing specific) and with relocation assistance.  The salary range was comparable to my current wage on the low end, about 20% higher on the high.  I'm not sure how different the overall benefits package is from my current one, but I know how to estimate that if presented with an offer.   
When I started my current job, I didn't know I could negotiate salary and was not offered a relocation package, and I'm the only engineer here besides my boss, so I was hoping from some input from this sub to give me some pointers.  I would appreciate any advice on negotiating salary, what a ""good"" relocation package looks like (especially since it's possible it'll take close to 6 months to a year to sell my current home), and how managing engineers differs from managing technicians.  Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!

37,How to look for my 2nd ever job when I don't have a lot of technical skills from my (1st) full-time job?,1583343231,"The way I got my current job was a fluke: after graduating in mechanical engineering, I spent several months of applying before I found a posting that specifically was looking for new graduates. I managed to get on because the hiring manager liked my personality after 1 on-site interview. No technical questions were asked, only behavioral. Fast forward to now, I'm trying to look for a new job because the company is not doing very well.

1) I fear I have fewer skills than other engineers who similar to me, being in the 1-3 years of experience range. For example, I've seen several entry-level (1-3 YoE) job postings that looked interesting but then asked for proficiency in a skill I don't have or knowledge I was never exposed to. For example, I have not touched CAD for several years, and my company gives CAD software to only a select few, to save money, so I've had to skip postings that ask for CAD proficiency. My current skills are mostly just summarizing other people's engineering reports into pretty charts. How do I find jobs that I would have a decent chance of getting a phone call back?

2) How do I use LinkedIn's Job Search function more effectively? If I just click on the ""Jobs"" tab at the top ribbon, it takes me to a default sort of ""recommended"" jobs. The algorithm always recommends repeated postings from the same dozen big corporations in my area. I also tried typing in my job title and a few keywords into the LinkedIn search bar but a lot of results are for jobs that do not match my experience at all, such as the wrong engineering discipline. How do I find jobs that are related to what my current job is? Also, how do I find more ""unique"" companies that aren't the same repeated corporations? (not that I have anything against working for a big corporation).

2.5) About 1/3 of the postings I see on LinkedIn are for Staffing Agencies that don't mention the hiring company they are recruiting for. I've read several annoying/negative experiences about these types of jobs. Should I still consider them?

3) I am concerned about my current job pigeonholing me. My company is in a niche industry in which its employees have spent their entire careers being shuffled from one company to another.

So I have a general application question about 3D printers and the best approach to linear rail selection... Oftentimes, many of our printers are made up of an assembly of aluminum extrusions to form a cube or similar shape. On one of the axis (usually Y), some people use a parallel linear rail system which carries the X gantry for the print head. Since the two parallel linear rails are mounted to separate extrusions that are connected using perpendicular extrusions and corner gussets, the parallelism of the mounting surface certainly won't meet the specs outlined for most linear rails in parallel. Obviously some sort of adjustment must be made to try and make them as parallel as possible. What is the best approach for this sort of adjustment? I usually don't see reference shoulders or pins, or fine adjustment screws... it looks like most people just mount them directly to the extrusion slot with t-nuts or something? 

Based on the article I read it would seem that it would be recommended to select linear rails with some clearance in this very not precise mounting application to prevent binding and unfavorable wear conditions... However, if there is too much clearance it seems possible that some amount of ""slop"" will show artifacts in the printed products due to the play in the bearings. Would it be advised to externally preload the X gantry by introducing a small but constant force on the X gantry perpendicular to the Y axis linear rail to pull the ganrty to one side and take up that play? Or introduce a small moment on the gantry to take up the play in the Y axis? Would doing this end up causing more bearing wear? Or would it be more ideal to remove the parallel rails altogether and use a single rail with bearing carriages farther apart (to handle the moments on a single rail and eliminate the parallelism problem) and the opposite side of the gantry just have it rolling on flat surface unconstrained?

I have seen this done once before with what I believe was a modified proportional valve / servo valve but it was so long ago I can’t piece together exactly how it was accomplished.

The idea is to have a self-regulating system that would ratio the chemicals in a volumetric 1:1 ratio.

61,How to deal with someone asking for my calculations for free?,1583293251,"I'm working with some quite experienced engineer doing some hvac calculations. He's been using older standard, but I've been using newer one.

Yesterday he called me if I could share my excel spreadsheet and modify it in a way it's easier to input data because he needs it for some project in Ukraine. However, he asked me to also translate it in croatian language (we don' t speak croatian here) which makes no sense. Additionally, calculations needed should be for halls, but he would give me office for test. Nothing makes sense.

I've spent fair ammount of time working on my spreadsheet (thesis + additional work on each project adding something new). Right now is at stage of combining calculations of 3 different standards, is quite user friendly and is doing much of needless work by itself.

I kind of don't want to give my spreadsheet, more or less because explanation doesn't make sense. Additionally calculations could be done by me, without having to change many things and wasting too much time on changes - and would, normally, charge for such work (one could ask for a favor, but since I'm short on time because of college, I'd rather get paid for my work).

63,Engineers in Aerospace: How do I land an entry level position?,1583289032,"I am a mechanical engineering student at the University of Georgia and I will be graduating soon.

65,Some Tips on Landing That Job You Want,1583284233,"I wrote a post over on r/EngineeringStudents a while back about finding a job, and how to use LinkedIn.  It was well received, and I seem to comment a link to it here fairly often, so I figured I'd post it up here.

TLDR; LinkedIn is a great tool to help add a personal touch to your job search process. Use it to send personal messages to a recruiter to attract attention to your application. Modern day equivalent of pounding the pavement.

 There are a lot of posts on here regarding jobs. People want to know whether they’ll ever get a job with a 2.6 GPA, or whether it’s possible to switch fields from quality engineering to manufacturing engineering, or switch industries from automotive to oil and gas. They want to know why they’re having no luck with getting interviews after having sent out 100 applications and resumes. I try to respond to these posts where I can. I’m no expert, or recruiter, and I’m not in HR. I’m just an engineer. I have about 10 years of experience, and I’ve seen a fair bit in my career so far, and have had luck with multiple job switches, career switches, and moving from one focus area to another. I wanted to share some of the tips that worked for me, and hope that they can help someone else.

This information is largely catered to new grads or early career engineers, but others may find it useful as well.

The Goal The first, and most important thing you need to do is figure out what you want to do. Think carefully about this. Talk to people doing different roles at the company where you work, talk to friends, or professors. Read job descriptions, visit salary.com, read about what the different roles within a company actually do. Someone that may be a great fit for a design engineer role may not be such a great fit for a systems engineering role. It is vitally important that you concentrate on finding out what makes you tick, and what type of career or job you want to do.

The Resume Make a resume, and make it one page long. There is usually no reason for you to have a resume more than one page if you’re early in your career. When you apply for jobs, make sure that you are modifying the resume to include specific skills, keywords, and requirements from the job you’re applying to. Each resume you submit should be a personal petition for why you want that specific job; not blinding submitting a ‘regular’ resume to every job you’re applying to. Make sure you’re actually reading the jobs for which you’re applying and make sure your resume mentions your qualifications relative to those job descriptions. Does the job require CAD experience? Make sure and clearly state that you have XXX hours of CAD experience with Solidworks. If your GPA is below 3.0, just omit it. If you want to get creative, and your upper level courses would have a higher overall GPA, you can calculate that GPA and list/label it as such.

Your resume should be a blend of showcasing your specific skills requested/required on the application, and communicating your interest in the role itself.

In most cases, the cover letter is not required or necessary. People are barely reading your resume, they aren’t going to have time to read a cover letter. There are exceptions to this of course. If you’re applying in person, or to directly emailing your resume to someone, a cover letter could make you stand out as a candidate.

Once you have your resume up to date, make sure that you update your LinkedIn profile with the same information. Take a look at what others have done.

The Search LinkedIn is where you need to be. It’s a good idea to make a spreadsheet with a list of the companies and jobs you’re interested in an apply to through their online portal. Make a note in this list of the confirmation number, so that you can share it with the contacts you find on LinkedIn. Your goal with LinkedIn is to find someone in a position to get you an interview, or at least read your resume/application at a specific company. There are a few ways to go about doing this. The first, is to just search LinkedIn for the appropriate people at the company you’re looking at. For example, if you want to be a design engineer at GE, the kinds of things you’d search for are “GE Technical Recruiter”, “GE Talent Acquisition”, “GE HR Manager”, “GE Hiring Manager”, “GE Engineering Manager”, etc. These types of searches will give you specific people at these companies, many of whom are on LinkedIn for the very reason you are: matching talent to jobs.

Once you have some people you’d like to contact, there are two ways to message them. One, is buy a subscription to LinkedIn Premium (not sure on current pricing, but they often have discounts). Using premium is a good way to have your profile show that you are serious about looking for a job, and there’s a flag you can turn on which will indicate to hiring personnel you’re interested in opportunities. The advantage of Premium is that you have a number of “Inmails”, which allow you to “cold call” recruiters via LinkedIn message without them being in your network. This is important if you’re not in the industry that you’re currently looking at, or don’t have many network connections in that industry.

The other way to do directly contact recruiters on LinkedIn is to expand your network, connecting with many people in the industry, until you are able to directly connect with the recruiter you’re targeting. If you do things this way, it may take a bit longer, but it is free. You don’t have to pay to message someone in your network.

Once you’ve found the recruiter or hiring person you want to contact, you need to craft a message to them. This message should be a brief, 4-5 sentence note; enough to show you’re interested and took the time to find the recruiter and reach out personally. In this note, mention the following things:

\-Which job, if any, you’ve applied to -Tell them you’re passionate about what company X is doing. If they have a YouTube or social media page, look at it, find something interesting to you, and mention it in your message. It shows you’ve expressed some interest in what the company is doing. -Directly tell them that you would love the opportunity to interview -Mention that if they aren’t able to help now, that you would appreciate if they could refer you to someone else in the company that may be able to help 

\-Thank them for their time",AskEngineers,False,testfire10,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fd51w8/some_tips_on_landing_that_job_you_want/

72,What is wrong with me?,1583273753,"I am a 36F, with master in engineering, speaking 4 foreign languages and living bg away from my home country.

I started my career only 4 years after actual graduation because of moving to other country. I moved because of my foreign boyfriend, spend first 3.5 years learning tge local language and working as a waitress to make our ends meet. 

The thing is, my career as engineer is a failure. From the first job I was fired after 2. 5 years, after being put on performance plan. Before there were no problems and no complaints, then I got huge load of work and a new colleague to help and all hell broke loose. The guy didn't do good job and when when I pointed that outhe complained to our manager. He added a lot of made up stuff and somehow I ended up a bad one. OK, this stuff can happen, I was being young and naive. 

Second job I got was in the consulting company. I did 3 projects for them but eventually I decided to quit due to next project being way too far away. 

On these 3 projects I got good reviews but later I found out that when someone called for reference my former manager said my language skills were low (different language than English) and my technical knowledge was lacking - what the hell...? 

After that I moved to another job, was much closer but even with all this experience I was unaware of the mission impossible part of this. It was not possible to design what they have asked for and my contract was not prolonged. I also didn't like working there due to loud and annoying colleagues in the room. 

After 6 months, I got a job as designer and first two months things were great, got an awesome performance review, like employee of the month and three weeks later had an argue with my colleague about him calling me ""stupid, bleeding for a week every month machine"". He didn't share important information with me resulting in loss of two weeks oc work. I had to start over. Ultimately I got fired for poor performance after 3.5 years. I was devastated and wanted to quit engineering. 
At the end I heard I am not a designer material. 

Somehow I got another mechanical designer job but it has suddenly ended duw to project being moved to another country. I did quite good, put a lot of effort into my job and got along wiyh with the manager very well. But it was only half a year. 

My last job was a shift in responsibilities. From designer I moved to project manager position and after nearly 2 years got fired. I didn't even have like a warning or something. My first performance review was OK and then one day my manager came and tols me he has to let me go due to me not being a match to the company culture. The thing is, he hiredme exactly for that reason. To set up a project management process because the company lacked such. 

The 2 years was continuous war on every front, especially with people who felt threatened because of the new way of working. I managed to achieve some level of project working but definitely didn't move fast enough. Could I have done better? Yes. Could I have done better without support of my manager? No. I realised now that he blocked me in every possible way: delayed important decisions, missed the information, removed me improvement projects that I defined from zero and generally didn't support me. 

When I had a conflict with a new guy who harrased me verbally, he decided to give him one of my projects ""because he was asking for this"" and I had to start over. Later that new guy picked the cherries I planted. 

I feel horrible now and I want to switch fields but I don't know what to do. But i want to be absolutely sure I did everything to stay in the field.

83,Does it make sense to try and transition from biology to (mechanical) engineering?,1583262479,"I graduated from undergrad about a year ago with a degree in Biology (BA, the BS not offered where I went to school), and training/a research thesis in classical microbiology. It turns out that while I was interested in biology when I started, I mostly kept it up to meet expectations and to graduate on time. By about my junior year of undergrad I had taken a couple of engineering classes (Environmental engineering and digital electronics), and rediscovered my main passion in general: making things. Each class had small design and implementation projects, and convinced me that the next time I had a chance I wasn't going to do biology research. I took a couple other engineering classes later on (bioengineering and software design), and continued to find that I really appreciated the practical problem solving of engineering. By that point it was too late for me to switch to engineering (I would have had to recognize by late freshman year to make the change and graduate accordingly).

Before that I'd realized some of what I was interested in, i.e. since I could drive, I ended up doing a lot of my own car maintenance, starting due to lack of funds, but then realized I loved tearing apart things and figuring out how wheel bearing hubs were assembled or how hydraulic brakes worked for example, and then just understanding how things around me were designed.  I picked up some construction jobs where I had the chance to learn about sustainable home design and construction, and worked on some weird projects that gave me a better understanding of building envelopes, off-grid structure design and energy efficiency. I've worked jobs where, in my free time, I'd disassemble broken equipment (many broken two-stroke engines, which sometimes could be repaired). I'm currently a microbiology technician, and actually most enjoy when there are random equipment failures and I get the chance to troubleshoot instruments and find/make repairs. If a friend asks, I generally try and fix anything I can for free (think bikes, simple car problems, plumbing/appliance issues), just so I can get time to tinker with things and tear it apart/put it back together. I enjoy woodworking as a means to make functional pieces, such as furniture, and have been taught some and self-taught the rest of what I know. My background with this type of stuff has been somewhat informed by technical information, but up until now has been largely intuitive. Basically, any chance I can get to learn how a physical thing works, fix things, make things, or design things is when I am happiest, and I want to learn how to do this as a job. 

I understand that there is also a lot of math involved in engineering, and although I didn't do spectacular in my university's Calc II (B- in Calc II freshman fall, tested out of Calc I with almost perfect marks on the entry exam though), I believe it was mostly for lack of trying, because I had no reason to need it at the time, and was taking the class just for the hell of it. I can usually understand mathematical concepts if I try. 

I have friends that studied engineering, and whenever I hear them talk about the kind of things they are doing, I feel like I missed out on some really cool opportunities, and wish that I had the chance to take more of those classes as an undergrad.  A number of these engineering friends have been shocked when they learned I wasn't an engineer, partially because I was often surrounded by engineering students in my friend groups, but also due to my constant desire to make things and solve problems, which is probably more than half of what I do in my free time, and almost all of what I think about all the time. 

So at this point, is there a reasonable route for me to try and get into engineering? I like learning about machines and energy systems and making things, and think mechanical engineering is probably the best bet for something like that, but please correct me if I'm wrong. I don't have a ton of money backing me, so I find it might be difficult to afford programs such as BU's LEAP, which I've just started looking at, but it sounds incredibly attractive to someone like me, who has an interest in engineering, but a  background in the natural sciences and is looking to make a change. Or is there another way that I could take this desire to design and make things and use it in a practical way? I mostly like the excuse to build things, and feel interested in the practical applications of this type of work, and would like to design and create new things whenever possible.

Right now I'm mainly applying over there, but being in a different state I've only been able to go to job fairs here. I have two job offers here so far, one is much better than the other but I'm not sure about a couple things.

I want to keep my options open with the ""worse"" offer so that if things don't work with the better one I can go with them. I don't want to string them along, but I also don't want to tell them ""yeah if things don't work out with company A, I'm definitely gonna need that job""..

Furthermore, like I said I'm trying to really get to that area sooner than later, and I don't want to work my first job for too long. However, I think letting my potential employers know would jeapordize my chances in getting a job (clearly). Otherwise, I must definitely plan on being a great employee while I'm around, because that's how I am in group settings I always want to make sure I more than pull my weight.

Right now I only have a couple of interviews lined up for internships in Maryland, but I'm getting a few full time offers elsewhere closer to me.

2,Coil winding change to gain proper resistance,1583241265,"Good day.  I have a coil winding job I'm trying to design.  I'm running a MCS1 Model 115 coil winder that requires only 4 variables to wind; total turns, length of the bobbin area to wind, pitch, and spindle RPM.  The customers recommendations is to run 34 gauge copper wire, .0065"", with a total of 1160 turns.  The recommended resistance of the coil should be 33 Ohms +- 5%.  I built the winding arbor and have a test bobbin that has a winding bobbin length of .595"".  I used the following formulas to find my pitch;

&amp;#x200B;

Turns\*Wire Diameter=Min distance of travel

1160\*.0065=7.54

Min Distance/Length=Min Layers

7.54/.595=12.67 Rounded up to the nearest positive number to stop the winder in the same spot as starting, recommended by the winding machine manufacturer.

Min Layers\*Length=Total Distance

14\*.595=8.33

Total Distance/Turns=Pitch

8.33/1160=.0072

&amp;#x200B;

In my program I utilized the variables Turns (1160) Length (0595) Pitch (-.0072) RPM (2500)

The length must be specified in thousandths, and the pitch is negative because I'm winding from right to left, as opposed to the systems standard winding direction of left to right.  

After winding twice now my resistance for the coil has read 36.8 ohms.  Which is out of my recommended percentage value of 31.35-34.65 ohms.  

My questions are, am I performing my calculations correctly for pitch?  What variables must I change to gain the required 33 ohms using the wire diameter and turns recommended?  Is it even possible to make changes with the recommendations specified and gain the ohms required, or does my customer need to change their requirements?

If anything could someone please confirm my equation for pitch?

I'm thinking that I may try the same same pitch formula without rounding up to the next positive and trying my winder at that variable.  I;m not utilizing a spindle brake on this coil so the operator can easily spin the arbor to their cut/tape position without adding another layer and a half, approx.

Some people have been explaining this to me, and I think they are explaining it wrong and I don't believe them. 



The claim is that you can just connect phase 1 and phase 2 to a bulb, and it will work at 380V. That you can connect the measuring device to phase 1 and phase 2, and it will show 380 V.


I think that it makese sense that 2 phases are parallely connected to a device which also has a null chord. Then they act basically as two separate circuits, but the voltage is increased. Which is fine.



But saying that you can just slap phase 1 to a theoretical light bulb, and also phase 2, and that it will work correctly is weird. 


For one:



1. why is it 380V, when a single phase is 220V? This implies that the effect of sine waves being shifted by 120° is somehow in effect.


2. Since the sine waves are shifted, do then the phases connected to the theoretical light bulb somehow sync, or do they always work with their sine waves, and if one is giving the max amount , then another is giving less? 



3. And finally, they told me that if you connected phase and null/zero, or phase and phase directly, that the electric box thingie will click and cut off the circuit. That's all nice and dandy, but how does it know when to plug out, between 220V and 380V ? is it set to snap at 218V? I mean, how much resistance can a measuring device between phase 1 and phase 2 have? Not very much I assume. That's way more above 220V

We are nearing the time we can move to contract manufacturing and the firm we were working with has become uninterested in our small project since they got a much bigger contract so we are thinking of moving on sooner than later as they have not been able to work on the project in the last few weeks setting us back among a number of other things that have made it clear to us we should move on with our project sooner than planned- that said we want to do so as amicably as possible. Our planned CM offered to handle the molding phase and finalize stuff but they looked at the drawings and BOM and associated files and said the engineering firm had marked everything proprietary so they would need a release from the firm or the files without the stamp. I have never been involved in the development of the device so forgive my lack of knowledge but is it strange that our engineering firm would label our files proprietary at all? Or is it standard? Will I be making a rather benign and typical request to receive the files not stamped or for a release or is this something that is going to make people angry? I just want to know what is standard or not and how to proceed. The CM made sort of a big deal and it freaked me out- I assumed it was all standard but if it is not then I guess I need to understand that. If for instance having unfinalized designs usually has a stamp but when handed off it is removed anyway then it seems like something that should not be a problem.

I'm looking for the best steel for small rigid slim tools. 

For context, I'm part of the lock sport community and want to make my own picks. With picking, the more rigid the pick the better and having a slimmer tool is better than a thicker tool. Typically 25 thou is standard for American locks and 18 thou or 15 thou are best for Euro locks. Sometimes you need a bit of flexibility for tough keyways but rarely and you can get flexible picks fairly cheaply anyway.

I've been looking at steel and trying to compare yield strengths but can't find a good resource to compare all of them. 

The other consideration I suppose is corrosion resistance. Most picks are in stainless steel. However, I don't think it's a necessity as you can, with care, keep them dry and lightly oiled. As these will be custom that's not an issue for me.

The strollers that are being marketed for the highest speeds and for traversing the most precarious terrain are also the least stable?  Not only that but from my limited background knowledge in 3 wheeled vehicles I understand that the 2-front configuration is generally more stable than the 2-rear configuration and every single three wheel stroller I could find on the market uses the less stable 2-rear configuration.  So even if having 3-wheels gives strollers an inherent advantage in the aforementioned activities, then why use the least stable wheel configuration? I could see cost being a factor but the upper price range for strollers is well into the thousands of dollars and I find it hard to believe that a 2-front 3-wheel stroller or a 4-wheel stroller with better rough terrain/jogging features wouldn't be marketable.

Thoroughly confused as to why this might be I set about researching. To validate my concerns I experimented in the store with a weight to simulate real life conditions and found that in a breaking turn at a brisk walk (such as swerving to avoid an obstacle on a trail) did lead to the 3-wheeled strollers tending lose stability more so than the 4-wheeled ones. Concerns validated I started to find more in depth articles on why 3-wheeled strollers are better for jogging and all-terrain activities and why they all use the 2-rear wheel configuration.  Unfortunately every article I could find just highlighted features such as bigger wheels and better suspension that could be applied to a 4-wheel stroller but are only common on 3-wheeled strollers and seem to just ignore the wheel configuration entirely.

Whenever I encounter a product that doesn't make sense to me or that I think has a glaring flaw that could easily be remedied it's normally because I simply do not have experience in that field and am missing a major design consideration.  Normally, I can do a little googling and maybe read a few Wikipedia articles to figure out what I'm missing but in this case I'm honestly stumped.",AskEngineers,False,patchez11,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fc45dn/why_do_3wheeled_strollers_prams_all_use_the_2rear/

75,How to go about switching fields within Mechanical Engineering,1583109790,"Hello everyone, I graduated back in December 2018 and worked as a CAD Draftsman in the MEP engineering field for a rather small consulting firm (1 PE, 3 Draftsmen). I was laid off in January due to the entire office closing down.

However, I don't fulfill any of the expected requirements for the entry-level positions for these other fields. I did not have any internship experience during college and the only hands-on experience I have is through the MEP consulting firm I worked for.

How would I go about to applying for the entry-level positions not relating to the MEP field? I feel kind of lost as I haven't gotten any replies to applications since I've been laid off. I can't really see myself in the MEP field in the future as I was not particularly excited nor passionate about the work I did at the MEP firm.

78,Autodesk inventor workflow for designing a roller &amp; pin?,1583105814,"Hi everyone,

I'm a mechanical engineer that's primarily worked as a plant engineer (not a design engineer by anymeans) and i'm relativley new to using solidworks.  I'm trying to design a small roller used on a scissor lift application . The roller will rotate along a stationary pin. A bearing will be press fit onto both sides of the roller, which then gets inserted into the pin. I have a few questions about the design process I was hoping to get answered.

&amp;#x200B;

1. When making my 3D model of the roller, is it better to draw in any chamfer or fillet in the inital sketch or is it better to make my 3D model and then use the fillet or chamfer tool to put these features in later?
2. Do you model the roller and shaft to their nominal dimensions and then add tolerances in your drawing file? For example, my pin diameter has a nominal OD of 1.5 in. I choose a SKF RLF 12 bearing with a nominal bore diameter (d) of 1.5 inches, an outer diameter (OD) of 3.25 inches, and width (B) of 0.75 in. I plan on press fitting the bearing in to the roller and then slipping the pin through the roller/bearing assembly. Obviously the pin needs to be smaller than 1.5 inches if it's going to be a sip fit (i.e 1.497 in) and the I.D of the roller needs to be smaller than the OD of the bearing (i.e 3.245). Do I draw this into the model, or make everything nominal and then use the DWG file to add my tolerances there?

Here's three questions that are quite easy to write down:

1)

Water flows through a horizontal duct of diameter 0.3m with a velocity of 0.5m/s. If the friction factor is 0.002 calculate the pressure difference between two points 13.3m apart. Assume the density of the water is 1000kg/m³. Answer is in Pascals.

2)

Gas is flowing through a pipe of diameter 0.04m at 7m/s. If you take the gas to have a density of 1.8kg/m³ and dynamic viscosity of 1.47 x 10^-5 Pa s, what would the Reynolds number of the flow be? Round to the nearest whole number

3)

A horizontal pipe has 3 smooth 90° bends before it exits into a reservoir. The velocity in the pipe is 2.0m/s. Given that the loss factor (K) for each bend is 0.21 and for the pipe exit 1.0. Calculate the total frictional head loss in the pipe due to these features.

31,Environmental Engineering Degrees should be Elimnated fully I guess?,1583009649,"I will be approaching some Environmental firms in Finland but I know the answer in advance I have tried before and years passing by it seems to me to be a useless degree, I wish It is not true, I will still approach these companies and try my luck, I have nothing to lose except time and self esteem.

1) It was incredibly easy to get in (no exams except reading one book about sustainability and almost all if not all classmates graduated. I kid you not some cant even solve that x +2 = 50

2) There is zero real life skill and application such as GIS, matlab, calculus 1, 2 and 3, no structure Engineering, no Civil Engineering. Just basic Environmental Technology, auduting, Env. Chemistry, Env. Physics, Waste, waste water management, quality assessment, Environmental law and Economics among others....The problem with these courses is there is little real life transferable skills, I can garantee you, you wont be able to design or plan anything or manage anything...A lot of people who graduated made some jobs totally unrelated to it, including bus driving, massage therapy, even being bums or unemployed like me

3) I dont want to give up and not planning too but it seems that in theory it is nice, who doesnt want to produce electricity from wastes or bio wastes, or desgin water treatments, or work on renewable Energy etc.... Seems noble in prinicple but it is not in demand and we dont have the necessary skills.

4) Most of our jobs can be competed from Civil Engineers(which I always prefar to Env. Eng) or Chemical Engineerings or even mecahnical, physics majors, or electrical engineers at times can do out job MANY times better...The only SMALL tiny edge an Env. ENg. has over other branches is maybe chemisty and biology which are not as practical in real world.

5) Since we study a lot less math, less finance, less baiscally everything, I wouldnt consider this Engineering besides the fact that EVERYBODY in the class graduated, the fact it was SO easy to pass along my Masters in Aquatic Sciences makes me realize that maybe these degress were not that good...Good degrees that actually can get you the money are not easy to get in and not easy to graduate because they are very demanding.... My degress required Investments there was lots of school work, lots of laboratory work and computers so I dont want to undermine somethings that I have done but when I see what other branches of ENgineering study it is a lot more practical and far more intensive.

This in conclusion I didnt like my life being ruined, so I thing and I HOPE I AM WRONG AND SPEAKING NONESENSE, but it seems Env. ENgineering SHOULD NEVER be a stand alone degree, it should be a specilization of Civil Engineering, because you literally ruin peoples lives.

50,"Looking for experts with knowledge about street lighting and presence technology, for guidance and validation for my bachelor project",1582984947,"I am studying product development and technical integration on a bachelor in Denmark.

I am working on creating a more intelligent smart LED streetlamp that is able to reduce the power consumption to a bare minimum when unneeded and deliver proper lighting when it is needed.

Copenhagen is currently using dimming profiles, that will determine when and at which dim setting the lamp should be at, at any given hour. They will dim the lights to 50% during the night, 70% in the early morning and evening and only run at full capacity during rush hour. 

I wish to create a system where the lamp will turn on and determine at which dim setting it should be at, based on light sensors that monitors the environmental lighting, and account for weather and the brightness of the night. So on a bright moonlit night, the lamp will deliver less light, than on a dark cloudy night where it will provide more to account for the poorer environmental lighting.

For my exam i plan to build a functional prototype, with an Arduino Mega + Wifi acting as both the GSM relaying commands to nearby lamps and control them over WIFI, but also as the control unit in a modular solution where modules can be connected. 

I will also create separate modules using either a Nano or UNO, that will serve their own purpose and output a variable to the Mega via serial communication. The Mega will then based of the variables it receives from the external modules determine which state the lamp should be in.

So I am looking for an expert with knowledge about the zhaga socket and GSM Node used in streetlamp to validate that it is possible to connect the control unit and modules that i wish to use either stock, with modification or by developing of a new Node and/or sockel which will allow for the connection of more sensors.

I am also looking for experts in presence technology, that is able to separate a pedestrian/cyclist and cars, to create different lighting patterns, since there is no need to illuminate the entire street instead of just a few lamps on the sidewalk if there is no vehicles on the street, but only pedestrians. But on the hand if cars are detected the entire street will need to be illuminated since the car is moving much faster.

My initial thought is using camera and image recognition to differentiate betweens vehicles, bicycles/scooters/moped and pedestrians and trigger different lighting patterns. But I am looking for alternative solutions, since Copenhagen is pretty anti surveillance camera and won't care that it is only used for street lighting.

68,Design Input/Suggestions - Rotary to Linear Motion,1582945435,"So long story short, I have been working on a project that is slightly outside my knowledge base. I would like to hear about any suggestions for the following issue at hand. My background is in electrical engineering and the problem has heavy kinematics/statics involved. 

***Setup:*** Let's say there is a rubber pad on the floor, and the piston is a couple of inches above it (4-5inches). I need to get the piston to hit the rubber pad at 500N, roughly once every half a second. Yes, it is very intensive in terms of power consumption, but budget is not the primary problem right now. 

***Math:*** After some basic math and torque calculations, roughly \~300W of power needs to be supplied to my motor. (Accounting for 60% efficiency) I have decent understanding of my motor functionality, and is currently controlled via PWM. 

***Problem:*** I have scoured the internet, contacted suppliers in industry, and much more. I cannot seem to decide on what kind of physical setup would get the motion I need. Linear actuators are a no-go, at least commercial ones, since the device has an extremely high stroke speed and requires a large force upon impact. Since most commercial actuators are designed to move a heavy load and not just require momentary force in one direction, they do not seem to be the ideal choice. I was thinking of a ball and screw, but I feel like that would require a lot of braking, causing a lot of wear on the motor and the driver. 

***Details: (Feel free to skip this)*** 

The motor is brushed DC that has 5600RPM, at 24V with 0.6Nm of Torque. Current set up is using a crank and piston, but there is a lot of inefficiency since the device needs to go up and down with similar torque, whereas only half the cycle needs it (During the downward stroke upon impact). The piston is \~1lb and that's the only force it needs to overcome during the upstroke. 

I would love to hear any suggestion on how you might approach this, and I can provide more details if needed.

It seems ABS generally needs a plastic welding based adhesive but that is only good for plastic-to-plastic.

I am a freshman aerospace engineering student currently in the process of trying to source some 304 stainless steel round bar for an amateur rocket club at my school. I've been doing some google searches for locally sourced 304 stainless steel round bars and came across a company that has 6-4 Grade 5 titanium in the dimensions that we are looking for, which are pretty wonky and understandably no one has in stainless 304 (6""OD x 36""Length). 

So my main question is, how difficult is it to machine titanium vs stainless steel? My first impressions from what I've been reading is that it's definitely more difficult to machine titanium due to its increased strength properties. But how much more difficult is it? If we wanted to machine titanium, say, with a lathe, would this be out of our scope, or would we just need some specialized cutting tools?

One of the main reasons I'm considering this titanium over 304 stainless is the price. One place I called said it would likely be $3000 for the 304 we are looking for, and the place I found for the titanium is listing it at $1270 for nearly the same dimensions. 

Secondary question: This application is for a combustion chamber on a small liquid rocket. I've read that titanium has good heat resistance, but I haven't found any numbers to compare it to 304 stainless steel (still google searching). Are they comparable in their heat transfer properties?

This is a little tid-bit I found about the 6-4 Grade 5 titanium I found locally:  Ti-6AL-4V (or Ti 6-4), this designation refers to its chemical composition of almost 90% titanium, 6% aluminum, 4% vanadium, 0.25% (max) iron and 0.2% (max) oxygen

I’m a second year student pursuing a bachelors degree in civil engineering technology (environment). Throughout high school I did subjects pertaining to pure science (biology, chemistry, physics) with no prior engineering basics or knowledge. Decided to take up this degree because I was/am keen and interested in topics like environmental health, water quality etc. However since my ‘major’ is in civil engineering (technology), we’re currently learning subjects like structural analysis and design, soil mechanics,.. none of which I have any basics about. Sometimes I feel like I’m floundering in these subjects because we have assignments and projects which require us to do in depth calculations, make site visits, search up and analyze architectural/ structural plans (the works) and I can’t help but feel lost because I’ve got no idea how to even start them. My lecturers seem to assume that all of us have engineering basics and tend to just overlook students like me who sometimes have no damn clue what’s happening. My mom suggests doing my own reading but honestly I get super anxious and beat myself up (mentally) when I attempt reading on my own online because half of the things I come across are super complex to me...

I'm doing a project on a steep hillside with steep soil and I want to learn more about soil engineering.

I don't get that yet... but

does depth count more than width?

 is it better to put a 1"" piece of rebar 6 feet into the soil or dig a pit 4 feet down, fill it with concrete and have the rebar in that? 

it seems to me the concrete cylinder will have more width to provide resistance against the soil, but since the top 1 foot of soil is loose we only have a 3 foot penetration and resistance on that concrete- which then becomes a large boulder ready to come out and roll down hill.

 but the rebar obviously is much thinner, if we're using just rebar that's only 1"" of with vs. about 16"" of width for the concrete. if that rebar is penetrating another 2 feet in does that compensate? which is stronger for a load applied laterally down to the hillside?",AskEngineers,False,urge3,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fapx96/soil_and_anchor_strength/

additionally the forces might come at an angle. It doesn't matter if the plank moves along the x-axis but it also shouldn't wedge itself along that axis.

46,"Making a standard doweling program for a Koch machine, but severely limited on conditions.",1582830354,"Trying to make a standard doweling program at work, but Koch machines are fairly limited. I can only use basic mathematical operations for the variables (no rounding, comparators, etc.). I can use a total of two simple comparators (only &gt;, &lt;, or =) in the if/then statements (connected with an AND) to get the output of each “macro,” but those values aren’t stored, they’re just used to determine if a macro is or is not active (asked the company that makes the machine and that’s all it can do, otherwise this would be much easier).

Basically the parts are getting dowels, with the dowels on each side 32mm from the edge of the part and the program filling in any dowels in between. I was able to do it with other programs using: 

N = round\[(Length - 64mm) / (2\*96mm)\] 

A1 = Length-64mm-(N\*96mm\*2)

1. If 12mm ≤ A ≤ 96mm   Then X1=96mm
2. If (A+64mm) ≥ 12mm   Then X1=64mm
3. 3. If (A+64mm) &lt; 12mm   Then X1=32mm 

Since I can't round values, A1 just spits out 0 every time so that doesn't work.

What I need to have it do is for any part length &gt; 160mm, dowels in between the outside dowels (mirrored on both sides). The inside dowels have a 96mm spacing \[Xn\], middle dowels have to be between 32mm and 96mm apart \[A1\], the priority offset \[X1\] from the outside dowels is 96mm&gt;64mm&gt;32mm, and 96mm spacing between subsequent dowels.

So in the [diagram](https://imgur.com/a/SVq16US):

X0 = 32mm (outside dowels to edge of part)

X1 = {96mm, 64mm, 32mm} (first inside dowel to outside dowel)

Xn = 96mm (space between subsquent dowels)

A1 &gt; 32mm (minimum space between middle most dowels, max 96mm)

I've tried taking the long route and just plugging in a macro for every possible range but the program maxed out at 49 programs, so that's not even possible.

56,Should I take a pay cut for more technical growth in a smaller company? (Crosspost on mobile...),1582816487,"Hey all, 25 year old electrical engineer here (RF engineering experience for 3 years) based out of CO, USA. My current role (Fortune 500 company) has devolved to mainly the paperpushing side of engineering (specifications, configuration management, arguing with multiple teams over parts/design issues as a representative of a actual design engineer) and I am not learning anything, have low motivation to come into work, and management is not looking to give me more roles outside of this project due to project management/executives liking me (got moved onto the program after taking care of heritage project deliveries and a rotation in another group doing similar but unrelated work). Large point - due to the industry, design periods are far shorter at this company vs the production support/paperwork side, so there is not much work I am interested in that I have the ability to work (ex more mechanical stuff vs electrical currently).

I received an offer from a smaller company, in the same industry/geographic area. The new role would require more varied tasks in both technical and soft skills (hardware, software, systems engineer, testing, prototyping) and enable more technical skills development in a R&amp;D/startup environment (company is about 600 ppl total and has been around 25+ years but this division is new).

The catch/my holdup - the up front salary is lower, and my take home CASH savings will be hit (by about 40%) due to the salary offer being 10-12% less than what I make now (110k+)

At the larger company, 401K matching is a 75% of the first 8% I contribute (14% total) plus some profit sharing (about 3%). 

At the smaller company, I was told I get a flat contribution to an SEP-IRA of AT LEAST 12% regardless (so if I contribute 3 it is 15%+). 

Benefits are cheaper at the smaller company for similar cost (2500 health at the large for a HDHP at 2K vs 860 for the same HDHP level at the smaller, both through Cigna, dental and vision about the same cost). 

I am in the process of trying to negotiate at higher salary/signing bonus with the smaller company, but from what I can see they just don't have the same cash flow as the larger company to afford matching my current salary. They are a stable and profitable company (I have done work with them before in my current role) and show raises and benefits on paper of at least 3%/year in their benefits package. The culture there seems to be better, and it has a very ""family company"" feel, but there are advancement opportunities and they have enough market control to grow stabily for the past 5-10 years. I would get to advance skills in digital and software design as well as polish my current RF design skills, so I see value in that. I think I might be happier in the new role, and it is more in line with long term career goals, but I am not sure if it's worth the immediate cash hit.

One pump that stood out in the test was one of these 10HP gear pumps, which ran loud; not as loud as a grinder at work, but loud enough we have to almost shout at each other.     
Within a few seconds after I start the pump, there would be a whirring sound that rises and then falls in pitch (similar to what I'd hear on planes sometimes) for a few seconds, after which the dominant noise would be similar to what a colleague described as similar to the ""chiller room pumps at shopping malls"".    
This was all after we were suspecting a bearing problem somewhere, took the pump set apart, looked around a bit inside, and put it back together. All we found that time was a somewhat rough turning pump shaft which seemed to smooth itself out after a couple rounds of turning it by hand following the direction indicated on the case, and a small but visible misalignment on the coupling that joins the motor to the pump. Before that, it made a bit of a banshee screeching noise on top of all that racket described above.

77,What other steps can I take to try and find a job?,1582790939,"Apologies if this isn’t the right place to post this, as I don’t use reddit much, but this seemed worth a shot as I am pretty desperate at this point. I am in the US and no matter what I’ve done, I cannot get a job and I am running out of ideas of what I can even do, and I am extremely discouraged at this point. 

A little background: I graduated the end of last May with a BSME. I graduated with a strong GPA, but I did not get any internship experience in college because I spent the summers taking classes to catch up from transferring. I realize now that was a big mistake, as I am assuming that is a big reason I am having no luck. It’s been almost 9 full months since I’ve graduated, and it’s been well over a year since I started applying to jobs. I’ve done just about everything I can think of without any success. I use every major job site, and spend several hours a day looking for jobs I am qualified for. I’ve directly gone to company websites and checked their career sections. I’ve sent in my resume to countless recruiting agencies. I’ve reworked my resume. I’ve tried applying for internships/co ops, as well as offering to work for next to nothing just to get experience. I’ve applied to probably over 500 jobs and it reached a point where I was applying to any job I was qualified for regardless of my interest level in the company/job. Even with all of that, I still only managed to have one company want to interview me, and they did not offer a job after that. I am extremely disheartened at this point. It feels like there is nothing I can do that will end in me being employed. I apologize for basically whining about my situation, but I was wondering if anyone had any tips or advice that could help, or even just tell me that I am probably screwed.

Is there anything you would advise I try that I might not have already? Should I just keep doing what I’ve been doing and just hope something changes? Is this a situation I basically can’t do anything about?

84,Role at work is changing and trending the wrong way. New manager wants to push the group into project management.,1582774946,"I've been working at a medical contract manufacturer as a manufacturing engineer for five years. Prior to this, I was in the same role at a smaller medical contract manufacturer. I was there for three years.

In the past year and a half, we had the director of our division, the quality manager, and the engineering manager all retire. Our management group got a lot younger in a short amount of time. All were replaced with internal hires, so everyone is also learning and adjusting to a new set of responsibilities.

My new manager has a resume filled with project management. I have no interest in that.  I like to work on technical problems. Figuring out a system issue or building and fine-tuning a process is the part of the job that I enjoy the most. 

I used to oversee the laser marking of our parts and fixtures. When the area became too large and took up too much of my time we hired a person to manage the employees, which I did not do, and do the process development. I helped regularly in the area while he got familiar with our specific parts and processes. He ended up not being a good fit and left the company.

I applied for his role since I could do the technical end already and managing a small group of operators wasn't going to keep me from trying at least. They passed on me because I asked for too much money to take that position. I was making $87k and asked for $96k. The previous guy in the role was making more than $90k when he left but I don't know the exact amount. The part that rubbed me the wrong way was after we ended the interview with no deal, I was asked to help and handle the process development in the interim. It took the managers four months to find a replacement. It was a long four months. 

Since then my manager has hired an engineering technician to keep the regular engineer's time free. If we have a process that needs to run samples to prove out, we should hand it off to the tech so we can move on to more ""high-level"" stuff. It is nice to have some help with that stuff but I don't want to give it up entirely.

The icing on the cake was this week we had a staff meeting to talk about the status of our projects and wanted to brainstorm ideas for how to be better at project management. I had to tell my boss politely that I'm not interested in that. Obviously I should plan my projects and organize myself but I don't want to be annoying people I have no authority over for deadlines and status updates. If we need project management, we should hire a project manager (we have none).

To summarize:

* I applied for a technical position and management wasn't comfortable giving me a raise to take it.
* My manager is trying to keep engineers out of hands-on process development.
* The engineering group is being strongly encouraged to be better project managers.

------
All of this to say,

I've been racking my brain for solutions and I'm drawing a blank. I have a feeling that this request to be a project manager is only going to become more and more intense. Despite that, there really isn't any urgency to this problem. If things keep going the way they are and I'm not a fit at my current company anymore, I want to have an idea of what my options are.

I'm sure that a technical, solution-based role exists, but I'm not sure what that is or how to find it.

Then I got to thinking, could an engine be made that used compressed natural gas (possibly Biogas?) that could use the energy from the gas expanding as well as the combustion of it? The little I've been able to find about CNG vehicles seems to suggest there is a pressure regulator of some kind that lowers the pressure before it gets injected into the cylinder, but I don't know how that works/if it preserves the energy of expansion (it seems to use a spring to open and close a diaphragm, I'm guessing it must lose some energy to flexing that?).

&amp;#x200B;

I was imagining something like an expansion cylinder feeding into a combustion cylinder, almost like a compound steam engine has cylinders with decreasing pressures. Does this make sense?

96,Will an induction heating coil heat up fine metal particles?,1582761402,"I am curious if I can heat up very fine iron particles using an induction coil, or if all of the metal must be in one piece for the induction forces to heat it up.    


Experiment: I tried sprinkling some iron particles on top of an induction stovetop unit but it didn't seem to heat up. The cooking unit would not turn on without sensing a sufficiently large pan, so I had some water in a pot sharing about half of the cooking surface with a ziplock baggie of iron particles. 

The water boiled no problem, but the iron didnt seem to heat up. 

I was wondering if perhaps it was because the particles were finely ground whereas the pot is all one piece, so when the magnetism flows through the metal, it might cause more stress given that there are more iron atoms locked together, bumping into each other?

Firstly, I’d just like to thank everyone for taking the time to try to help me before I go on about my problems! As well as some abbreviations I’ll be using to type quicker since I’m writing this off my phone. 

SE - Software Engineering
IET - Integrated Engineering Technology 
ET- Engineering Tech
MECT - Mechanical Engineering Technology 


So I’ll start off with my junior year of high school. During my junior year, I did a program called College NOW which was a program allowing high schoolers to satisfy there high school graduation requirements, as well as earning a Integrated Engineering Tech (Associates) degree at a local community college. I went through this program and earned my degree, and now I’ve gone on to a more major school and I’m now studying Software Engineering. And I’m enjoying SE so far, (although it is extremely difficult) I recently attended a job fair in which I was talking to potential employers about opportunities and they seemed to take a much bigger interest in my IET degree. So this got me thinking, about whether or not I should go back and get my bachelor’s in IET or ET or MECT. I then went on to look for jobs, and so nobody mentioning anything about an engineering tech degree, and software engineers pretty much have a necessary requirement of being able to relocate across the US. So this just leads me to a few questions that I have, that I figured nobody would be able to answer better than practicing engineers. Firstly, what is the major difference between an Engineering degree, and an Engineering tech degree (despite the main differences of a tech degree being more hands on rather than theoretical) ? Secondly, what kind of jobs are available for somebody with a ET degree? And how does the salary/compensation of this field compare to somebody with an engineering degree? And lastly, what are your guys’ opinion on me switching from SE back to ET?

44,"Struggling as a engineer new-hire, straight out of college. Are my employer's expectations unreasonable, or am I simply not a good fit?",1582693609," I just graduated with my master's - moved to a new city - started a new job - entered into a 1-year lease - set up a 1-year contract for internet service - registered my vehicle in this state - etc, etc. This past week has been a blur.

I've been at this job for only one week now - started last Tuesday - and I already have a sinking feeling, which is getting worse with each passing day. I start my mornings with dread at the thought of going into work.

The firm that hired me is small - just 10 employees in the office. Consulting work. On the first day, and part of the second day, I was preoccupied with new-hire paperwork. Lots of HR things to take care of. Then, mid-way through my second day, the office (and hiring) manager shared with me a project folder on the network drive, and instructed me to study up on the current state of the project. In short, the project (a bridge crossing for a state DOT) is at the preliminary stage of design. For that preliminary design, a report has been written, based on results obtained from a numerical model. I don't have experience with writing this kind of report, or dealing with state DOTs' design guidelines/manuals, or really, a lot of what's entailed in this project. It's taking some time to come up to speed. On top of that, I haven't used the software program they use to generate the results for the report. In grad school, I took courses on computational fluid dynamics, numerical analysis, etc ... but the user interface of this program is quite a learning curve ... at least for me, in the past week.

I was told that if I have questions, I should ask one of my coworkers, who was previously working on this project prior to me being hired. She and I have the same title/position, although she's been here for a few years, and during that time has gained experience doing other, similar projects.

She seems more than happy to pass this project off to me, with very much of a ""here you go, you poor shmuck - good luck!"" attitude. She has admitted, she's very eager to shift her focus onto newer, more interesting projects.

In terms of learning how to use the software program, I've been instructed, by her and by more senior staff at the firm, to use free tutorials online as my primary means of training and learning how to use the program. After going through the (very contrived and basic) tutorials, I tried jumping into the project model, but I'm having a hard time correlating what's in the tutorials with what I am expected to do with the project model. When I sit down with her, and try to solicit direct help/guidance from her, she gives me an attitude of, ""if that's how you want to do it"" ... ""sure, that could work"" ... ""yup, you'll figure it out"". I get the sense that she is setting me up for failure, although this isn't exactly something I feel comfortable expressing to the senior staff, being a new hire.

The expectation at the end of last week, was that I would adjust the geometry within the model, and begin making changes to the preliminary report, to move it toward the final design. Yet, I'm still struggling to accomplish the first task I was given at the end of last week. I keep going back and forth between the tutorials and the project model .. and soliciting (unhelpful) advice from her in between - and I feel I'm spinning my wheels - bashing my head against the desk each day.

I asked a senior staff member if direct training for new-hires was an option. Currently, there's one other new-ish hire, who's been at the firm for about a month. Although, I was hired on within the engineering division, and she is doing GIS. It seems the GIS division (just 3 of the 10 employees at the firm) have a direct training program - and for the month she's been here, they (the 2 other GIS people) have been walking her through tutorials. Though, with me, it seems I am thrown to the wolves, and expected to single-handedly take on a final hydraulic design.

I am at a total loss. I've expressed my frustrations, and lack of progress (although somewhat indirectly) over these past few days. At this point, I think they see me going back to the tutorials, and they're asking themselves, ""WTF is he doing with his time??"".

There are, apparently, training courses offered by the developer of the software program, although they're scattered throughout the calendar year, and the next one is over a month away. By the time that course is offered, this firm has a laundry-list of project deadlines to meet. It seems everyone here (except perhaps the GIS folks?) is stretched thin, and is swamped with their own deadlines/obligations.

I'm reluctant to go to my new boss, and say, ""I can't do what you require of me"" ... but, after speaking with my father (who is himself a senior engineer), as well as other college grads, it seems I am missing out on the sort of new-hire training that most other people receive.

Does this sound about right? What exactly is my recourse? I'm making very little progress. Tomorrow morning, I think I should try sitting down with the project manager and having a heart-to-heart with him - express my frustrations, and extent of my efforts ... I even tried studying up on the program over the weekend, with little/no success.

In any case, as of recently this is not so true anymore due to some economic measurements the new government has taken which have scared away some very big investors.

Most of our impact wrenches are of Hikoki brand, with a max torque of 200Nm and variable impact speed. My understanding is that, while speed can be varied, if the trigger were to be held indefinitely, the torque applied to the bolt would still reach max torque regardless of whether impact speed is on the lowest or highest setting. This means that impact speed is not an accurate measure of torque control. Is this correct?

64,How to create a joint strong enough for this problem,1582676325,"Hello,

So I am part of a student design team that is creating a robotic arm for a school project.

Our arm is mounted onto a stationary platform. Our first degree of motion (in the xy plane, z is height) is a rotation at the place where the arm meets the base. Attached to the arm is another arm, which has another rotation in the xy plane.

We are planning to do the rotations using a servo. We 3D printed a joint to attach the first and second arm, however the problem is that the joint was not good enough, and it meant that the arm was at a steep descending angle when we put it onto the base, hitting the floor at the end.

Now, we are looking into using a door hinge to attach the two arms, though for this the attach of the hinge to the arm is not strong enough (using a bolt and nut), and it is not vertical due to the moment being caused by this.

This top view of the situation might help understand  - [https://imgur.com/b8Fz5b2](https://imgur.com/b8Fz5b2). The third joint is a very small arm that extends.

Each long arm is 0.6-0.7m long. We need to be able to attach a servo to control the rotations of each arm, and for it to not tip over when it is to the right/left and not descend that much going forward.

76,Icosahedron made out of wooden dowels - which edges should I reinforcing?,1582659878,"Hi everyone,

I am making an art installation consisting of an icosahedron made of wooden dowels (36 inches edge length, half a centimeter thick ) - as a frame - draped with canvas hands. I need to carry around the resulting contraption like a lamp shade. Pics below.

But for the safety of others and myself I want to prevent the dowels snapping and the whole thing collapsing. So far with reinforcing the top I have been able to carry it around even with one hand. I want to reinforce and make it more sound structurally without making it much heavier - I want to be able to carry with one hand ( with effort ) or both hands. More details below.

The vertices are drilled at the ends - tiny holes - and fishing line 60 lb threaded through the holes. This is a prototype and the hands will be sewn instead of taped. By trial and error ( wooden dowels snapping ) I figured I would reenforce the top side triangle and join the vertices of this top triangle with fishing line and suspend it from a pole to carry. All light enough so can carry it with one hand just like a lamp shade ( I am strong ).

I won't have to carry it long distances but I need to be somewhat mobile, once at setup, and eventually... in case NYPD complains so I may have to carry it like 300 feet to the nearby park. The installation will be stationary for the duration of people interacting with it - I will construct it on site, move it a few feet and place it on the ground. 

The way it will function is there will be brushes and paints in tubes with negligible weight - like a few ounces - hanging from the top vertices and people will use them to paint the hands. No one will be jumping or pressing from the top. This will last a few hours,  8hrs at most, and I will dismantle afterwards and store so no long term handling or needing to be roughed by people. I will be standing in it - in the middle- I won't allow people to ""rough it"" or otherwise interact with it improperly.

Which dowels do I need to reinforce the most?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.
