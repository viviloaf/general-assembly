2,Can't Find Job as Aerospace Engineer,1553258118,"Hi guys,

So I'm graduating this May with a degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (I'm getting a certificate for aerospace since I took a bunch of electives for it). I've been applying to jobs since December and have had no luck. I've changed up my resume a few times in hopes that it would help but still nothing.

I know it's hard because I haven't had any internships - I would apply every summer but wouldn't get those either. I did do some aerospace research and then joined another research lab this year just to keep up with some kind of work experience. My first research was in CFD and I really thought that would help since it's directly applicable to Aero jobs. 

Anyways, I need any advice I can get! I've been applying to all kinds of jobs - aero, mechanical, quality, for big and small companies, not just top ones. 

If you want to take a look at my resume that would be awesome!

7,Can anyone explain to me if there is a difference between civil / structural FEA and geotechnical FEA?,1553249232," 

Hi everyone,

I'm currently conducting marketresearch with regard to the FEA industry and structural + geotechnical FEA software in particular. I understand that most FEA requires some form of cad / geometry input to function. Is there a difference in the process between civil / structural FEA and geotechnical FEA? Does geotechnical FEA also need a CAD or geometry model to work with? Are linear vs. non-linear softwares different between civil / structural and geotechnical FEA?

I would be really glad of anyone of you could give me a quick and concise rundown of potential differences (or the lack thereof) since google searches are driving me mad and not giving any fruitful results.

8,How do you manage your stress to avoid career burn out,1553245963,"I want to preface this with some info that I am not exactly over worked. (40hrs a week) The company I am at is great and the benefits are amazing.

I’ve been in work about a year and three months, in that time a director and senior engineers have left meaning there was a lot of work floating around and I stepped up and manage it. I took a back log of around 150 jobs and have managed to get it down to twenty on average but they always keep flooding in. I’m worried that although I am coping and the average turn around has gone from over a month to around 2 weeks that this just isn’t sustainable. I feel that I should be learning the fundamentals still and exploring and developing myself as an engineer. My work is no longer checked, I now check other people’s work so I am signing off on projects without anyone reviewing my work unless I feel it’s beyond my capabilities. 

The stress of being the guy that everyone turns to for help is starting to get to me. I may be able to do a quick project in two hours but it takes 5 due to everyone needing my input.  The phone rings around 20 times a day for me and the emails pour in constantly. I have to make decisions after 1 minute of thinking but I lack the experience to make meaningful decisions other than just regurgitating the same solutions I’ve done before (some of them haven’t even been built yet so they may not even work).

I feel like it’s only a matter of time until I make a big mistake, already I’ve started to make minor mistakes that if I just had more time to reflect I wouldn’t make.

I am managing three engineers two which have more experience than me but they don’t seem to actually strive to understand more. They would rather just ask me than do their own research which I don’t mind but I feel like it’s all coming to a head where I need someone who has experience to step in or just more people to share the workload out with.

Is this normal? I mean it was supposed to be temporary but I am doing well in this role. My pay doesn’t reflect this, I am now the face of the company to a range of clients that make up to 50% of our revenue. At the same time I feel like if I can just get through this it will make me a far better engineer with my ability to manage clients expectations. Forecast work and planning it accordingly.  I also produce quotes and invoice them.  Working half my time on the business elements and the other half on the projects too involved and time critical to give to someone to learn on.

The clients that I have met are all impressed and they actively say I’m doing a great job for them. I have got a much deeper understanding of what I am doing than when I started this role but I am terrified that I’ll be stuck doing this work until I decide to move on.

Most other  graduates I speak to don’t have this amount of responsibility which is both an ego boost but also possibly a red flag that my company is struggling to recruit experienced employees.

Essentially my question is how do you cope with stress and not let it spill into your personal life. I am sick on waking up on days off and my first thought is about a problem at work. I spend more time solving issues for work on my days off because it’s the only time I can give problems actual thought.

11,"Can you run a brushed DC motor on AC, without conversion?",1553236606,"My dad tried to tell me that the brushed DC motor in our handheld tilling machine runs on AC. I tell him it's impossible because you can't run a brushed motor on AC, because of the way it works. Then he tells me: ""but I couldn't find the ""gretz"" connection"" (whatever that means). 




So now I'm going on a quest of finding a part that might be some kind of converter. I plan on going to the brushes and following the cables from there. If it runs directly to the AC connection, then I know I am wrong. If I find something, then I need to first identify what it is or he might try to pull a fast one and tell me it's something else. He actually went to electric school 40 years ago, and has been fixing stuff all the time. I'm supposed to be the amateur here.




So yea, I dunno. Can you run a brushed motor that looks exactly like a brushed dc motor, (and isn't the ringed type induction one) on AC?

13,How to get an engineering internship in 2019,1553231855,"So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here’s a video I made covering these topics:

[https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng](https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng)

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - “friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey.",AskEngineers,False,mattupham,/r/AskEngineers/comments/b411u9/how_to_get_an_engineering_internship_in_2019/

23,Excavating canals to fill the volume of space below sea level that isn't occupied by water,1553214595,"So this started as an interesting idea between me and some friend and blew up into some complex math that was beyond us, but also aside from that math, it's going to include a lot of more practical engineering questions about costs and whether things are actually possible, and will probably also require answers from someone who knows more about that side of things than the theory side.

It occurred to us that if canals were dug from land areas that are below sea level such as Death Valley, the Caspian Depression, Afar Depression, Lake Eyre basin, etc. etc. towards the nearest sea, but a sea wall was left in place at say, five to ten meters above sea level, then if the sea rose those five to ten meters the water would first have to drain into those basins before rising further, potentially saving many lives. However, for this to work there would have to be a huge and potentially long term commitment of time and resources into the projects, and so the question contains two parts -

Firstly the math heavy part: what volume could each of the examples above absorb (Death Valley, Caspian Depression, Afar Depression, Lake Eyre basin) and would it even be worth doing? If it's just going to lower the sea level by centimeters then there's no point in going further.  
And secondly (if it turns out to be worth the effort): a rough estimate of the kind of commitments these projects would require. We tried to look at some similar large-scale canal projects but they were mostly built quite a while ago and I presume methods and technologies have improved a lot since then. So, taking the examples above (Death Valley, Caspian Depression, Afar Depression, Lake Eyre basin) could someone tell me if such a project would actually be possible, taking into account geography and such, and if so, give ballpark estimates for the time and resources each would take?

I've also [posted this over in AskMath](https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/b3y7ex/excavating_canals_to_fill_the_volume_of_space/) to get their take on things as I feel like this might require a collaborative effort (specifically the first part).",AskEngineers,False,Judean_peoplesfront,/r/AskEngineers/comments/b3ybdf/excavating_canals_to_fill_the_volume_of_space/

I’m a 2nd year engineering student currently working and finishing off my second internship experience (electrical).  I really count this internship as my first real experience with engineering as my first internship was more of a QA/validation role.  

At this internship I’ve been doing design, design reviews, validating concepts, and a lot of embedded programming, which was all new to me (platforms, tools, environment).  It has been a really great experience and I have really appreciated it and learned a lot.

30,Is my employer trying to pull one over on me and my fellow contractors?,1553206350,"I am currently employed via a staffing agency that placed me as a mechanical engineer on a three month contract. I have a couple other coworkers who are employed through the same agency, and we are all Mech E’s doing the same job in a company recently bought by a private equity, but they have been there slightly longer than me. Our company we are working through our contract with said in the beginning we will either be hired or let go, but a 99% chance of hire (nothing in writing, our fault). We slipped through the cracks in HR and didn’t have to sign any pre-employment paperwork including NDA’s, background checks, etc. Well, our contract is up at the end of next week, and we have yet to receive any job offer or anything in writing about if we are being hired on by this company so we are no longer “temps” with them. When we asked our bosses, they get uncomfortable and try to assure us that we are gonna make our “goal” (it started as a value on the bottom line for us to target as a team to earn our jobs, then it turned into just a number in *sales* dollars that was determining our chances of being hired). 

Well, today HR is trying to get us to do all of our pre employment paperwork at the end of our contract. They are claiming it is to “get the ball rolling” for when we get hired.... we haven’t been given any job offer. Nobody has talked salary, benefits, official job description.... nothing at all. The best we have gotten was a painfully awkward meeting with our boss’s boss dancing around the subject avoiding telling us we don’t have confirmed jobs until we directly asked about it as he was dismissing the meeting. 

Should I sign this paperwork? Everyone is trying really hard to get us to fill this paperwork out for pre employment... but we aren’t even sure of employment yet. Why would they waste money on background checks and drug tests without being sure they were going to hire us? If they were THAT sure, it shouldn’t be out of the question for them to draft a job offer in that case. 

I am thinking it is one of several things. My leading theories that people are telling me are:

31,Input on Traffic Engineering,1553205286,"Hey all, 

I posted this in r/Engineering but figured this might be a better place for it. 

I just came across a job posting for a Transportation Engineer and the company also specializes in Traffic Engineering. As much as I hate to admit it, these are two areas of engineering in which I never knew existed until today. With that being said, I am very interested in a possible career in one of these two fields and would love to learn more about what you do  on a day-to-day basis. Is this career fulfilling for you? Challenging? Is the PE designation a must have? Is not having a degree in Civil going to be a deal breaker? Any input would be greatly appreciated. 

A little background: BS in Electromechanical Engineering in 2016. Worked as a Field Engineer for an electrical infrastructure company in their transportation sector for about a year and have been working as a Project Engineer for a GC for a year and a half. 

TLDR; Not a Civil Engineer but interested in Transportation or Traffic Engineering. Looking for tips, advice, and personal input on your job. ",AskEngineers,False,wiillrus,/r/AskEngineers/comments/b3wl2q/input_on_traffic_engineering/
32,Is the motor of dishwasher's pump dead?,1553205260,"Hi there, so I'm trying to decide if I need to buy a new motor or not. It's an AC 220-240V 50hz motor for a water return pump. The dishwasher is about 15 years old but in great condition from what I can see, I don't know if the motor has been replaced in the past but I doesn't look any newer than the rest of the hardware inside. 

When setting the dishwasher in a mode where the pump is supposed to be running, I read a steady 226V AC on the power cable of the motor (unplugged the motor for this measurement).

Here a 960fps video of the motor detached from the rest of the pump and running from the dishwasher.

38,Is this a worthless degree?,1553200248,"Hi everyone I am a uni student in Australia and im curious about your thoughts on the degree i am currently enrolled in


A quick note on the structure of engineering in Australia degrees: you have the option to choose 1 major and 2 minors OR 2 majors. The majors are the standard civil, mechanic, electrical etc. But the minors can be specific, things like computational science, manufacturing, steele design, auto racing to name a few. 


So using this you can tailor how you want your degree, having broarder knowledge in 2 areas (2 majors) or more specific knowledge in a narrower range (1 major 2 minors)


My question is this: I am currently enrolled in 2 majors


1. Mechanical engineering 


2. Applied financial and economic science


How applicable is having a second major in business in engineering, would this throw up any red flags if you were looking at hiring someone with this degree, and what are your thoughts one this?

41,BSME in HVAC looking to maximize income.,1553193557,"Hi everyone,


I graduated 9 years ago with a BSME. Did a lot of different types of entry level engineering jobs, from component engineering to facilities engineering in a semiconductor facility, to transmission line maintenance engineering support. I've never really developed one specialization or distinctive career path. Rather, I've been content with jon hopping, trying out different industries to see what appeals to me, and taking time between jobs to travel and lead what I consider is a fulfilling life to date.


I'm beginning to settle down a bit more now (I'm 30), and landed a job at a massive engineering firm doing HVAC design engineering on projects for major clients with complex facilities (semiconductor, pharma, data centers etc). I actually find it pretty interesting even though I'm essentially starting as a newbie and have tons to learn.


My personal goals, however, do not include dedicating my life to becoming a top HVAC engineer. In the last couple years I've realized I am more motivated by money than I had previously caeed to admit. I don't want a lot of it... Just enough to be financially independent and, possibly, retire in 10 or so years (FIRE). But that means maximizing income now.


With that in mind, I'm looking for some guidance:


1. In the realm of HVAC engineering, it seems like the real earning potential is in sales. Am I correct in thinking this? Yes, I know the life isn't for everyone, and your earnings are commission based. I actually like that idea. My pay is directly influenced by my effort. That motivates me. I also like interacting with people, meeting new people, and helping them solve problems. I thrive on that. So is technical sales something to try to get into for someone who is driven by optimizing income?


2. If sales is the way to go, I'm not going to find that at this company despite how much knowledge there is in the people here. However, I'm not going to get into an HVAC sales role elsewhere without some sort of related experience. That IS something I can get here. What sort of things should I be looking to absorb maximum knowledge from while at this company in order to give me a good baseline for an entry commercial HVAC sales position in 2 or so years?

     My confusion arises from the fact that there is no power stroke  over lap in an in-line 4 cylinder engine. If I understand that the formula HP= (torque x rpm)/5252, and that the torque is the force the crankshaft is experiencing at the particular rpm when the measurement is taken, wouldn’t this only account for the power one cylinder is adding? Again, relating this back to a 4 cylinder having no power-stroke overlap, means that the crank only experiences the torque one cylinder adds to it at a particular time. This is in contrast to engine with  more then 4 cylinders where power-stroke overlap occurs.
  
     Another way to look at it is that if only one piston is adding force to the crank at a time, what would be the difference of calculating the horsepower of a 4- cylinder and a 2  cylinder ( hypothetically lets say they have the same efficiency,) and each engines per cylinder displacement and stroke are the same.

69,Am I able to become a Embedded System Engineer?,1553128929,"Hello guys, recent graduate in Electrical Engineering here. Hope it's the right sub. I just graduated last month in Electrical Engineering in Brazil.  There is no such thing as GPA here, but of course there is a scoring system, which is based on the average of all subjects we take on college ranging from 0 to 10. Mine is pretty mediocre, 6.8. Honestly I'm not worried about it itself, but it shows a lot about my work ethic and my ability to cope with subjects that I don't like.

**I'd appreciate any advice on career choice based on two aspects of my background:**

**First aspect: college experience**

The point is, I really enjoyed some subjects I studied in University, such as Signal Processing, Control Systems, micro-processed Systems (which should be called micro-controlled in my opinion) and programming logic. I could say that I aced these subjects, which was not very common in that University. I wasn't very good with electronics in general but I'm getting better at this as I am studying again. My real issue was with Electrical Facilities(Wiring Projects and Engineering Standards), Energy Generation and Transmission. These two subjects held me back in the graduation course and I feel I couldn't trick my brain to learn it although I'm trying hardly to become a more realistic and practical person.

&amp;#x200B;

**Seccond aspect: Work Experience**

The other thing I'd like to say is about my work experience. I made an internship on web development with ruby on rails and it didn't go very well. I had the opportunity to get to know Agile and Scrum methodologies, work from home, work in a big and meaningful project, make a decent salary even for an intern, etc. But I couldn't learn everything on the fly. Today I work with electronics repair, consumer goods mainly. At this company I worked with code again, with Python and C++/Qt on Raspberry Pi. In summary it didn't go well like before. I finished the project, got it running, but I had the impression my boss wasn't satisfied with the product and he didn't make any use from it. 

Some points on my work experience. I've never worked for a software company. Although I've worked with software, my bosses and  colleagues were always busy with other jobs, most of them had no idea of what I was doing. In the last experience with software the ""features and functionalities"" were not very clear and it changed several times along it's project time and maybe it is the reason he didn't look satisfied. My hand skills with hardware(like measuring, assembling, prototyping, soldering etc) are getting better due to my current job as an electronic repair man.

I took tons of biology and chemistry before I transferred into engineering, so I have a great background for it. I'm just not sure how to go about getting into the field.

*Datum C is a hole parallel to Datum A that is used to fix/locate the part onto the assembly. REFERENCED: Position - DIA 0.2 to A-B.

Therefore my primary datum reference would be the axis created by measuring bore of DIA 100. This conflicts with my understanding with my understanding of the 3-2-1 Datum precedence rule which states that the Primary datum feature is obtained after measuring at least 3 points, therefore not possible to obtain PD with a bore axis. **Shouldn't current DATUM B be the primary Datum??** Followed by A and then C.

86,"In a normally aspirated engine, why is there no reverse flow during valve overlap at partial throttle?",1553106275,"I understand that at anything less than full throttle, pressure in the intake manifold is substantially below ambient, as the volume the pistons are pumping per stroke is constant, but the throttle plate is putting a restriction on the volume of air being sucked in. Now, say the manifold pressure is 15 inHg. Towards the end of the exhaust stroke, there is still more pressure than ambient in the cylinder, forcing exhaust gas out the exhaust port. Now comes the time where both intake and exhaust valve are open at the same time (valve overlap). It intuitively makes sense to have valve overlap in an engine with a positive displacement supercharger, so we can flush the burnt gas out while we are introducing fresh gas for the next cycle. But in a normally aspirated engine at partial throttle, during valve overlap, the pressure in the intake manifold is maybe 15 inHg, while the exhaust side is ambient or probably more than ambient because of resistance in the exhaust (cat, muffler, etc). Wouldn't that cause the exhaust to flow back into the cylinder, and gas come out the intake valve, as long as both valves are open?

95,Using a submerged evaporator coil to chill drinking water,1553096416,"I'm playing around with building an automated water cooling system, similar to a water fountain.  However, I need to get the water temp. down to very close to freezing.  As far as I know, most drinking water fountains use a typical refrigeration cycle and cool the water with the evaporator coil wrapped around a water tank, with the whole assembly insulated. Most water fountain literature that I can find claims to cool water to about 50F at the lowest, which is not cold enough for me. 

I think it would be more efficient to build the evaporator coil from stainless tubing and submerge it directly into the drinking water.  The evaporator coil to water interface should allow for good heat transfer out of the drinking water.  Any ice that forms on the coil will serve to buffer the cooling cycle and keep the entire reservoir right at 32F during compressor off cycles, which is what I'm looking for.

My concern is that I can't find a system like this where the water touching the coil is used for drinking.  I am concerned about a possible pinhole leak in the evaporator coil causing contamination of the drinking water with refrigerant and have a feeling that this may be why I can't really find this type of system anywhere.

2. If things get tough (which they will since we're just undergrad students), I'd imagine many ""dropping off"" to other things after a while (internships etc.) leaving me back at square one. I'd like to avoid a revolving door of people in and out to minimize premature exposure but that's a variable that can't really be controlled.
3. As students, none of us would really know whats going on so we'd be all just trying to figure it out which is great and all but I feel like time is important, the sooner it's complete better.

Given the above concerns, part of me feels that I should just go ahead and jump into it all by starting the company, hiring people that are paid/invested in actually seeing this through and who may have experience in the field(s) needed to get this thing off the ground. This means many other issues like gathering funding, sourcing and attracting talent, etc. All of this would need to be done following the completion of a small scale version anyway so it can't be avoided.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also thinking that this may just be too much for me to tackle and that I should just give up. After all not all ideas are attainable.

30,Tuned Mass Damper for Parkinson's Tremor,1553026559,"This is a repost from r/engineering

Hello, I'm a high school junior and last summer I went to a university to work on an engineering project. My idea was to create a tuned mass damper bracelet using a closed and hollow copper tube filled with ferrofluid and several small cylindrical magnets. The magnets would be placed so that the poles facing each other would be the same. The repelling force between magnets would act as the spring in a tuned mass damper. The magnets would be the mass and the vibrations would come from the arm.

However, I was unable to accomplish much out of confusion. I didn't know how to reach out and ask questions and I didn't know how else to find answers. Also, with only two years of high school education I was very unfamiliar with everything I researched. (There was also a lot of procrastination) . There are several possible problems. 1) The vibrations of the hand/arm are not necessarily parallel to the bracelet. 2) Vibrations vary at several frequencies, making a passive tuned mass damper likely unuseable.

There are probably many more issues. Anyways, I'm wondering if this project concept is plausible. I'd really like to make it work out. Sorry if my description is unclear and let me know if you have any tips.

Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to take these as my electives since only computer science students are allowed to take them. I've thought about going for a computer science minor, but I'm not sure if it would be worth delaying my graduation for it.

One elective I really liked was computer networking with socket programming and internet protocols, but it looks like there are no other courses offered in my department to go from there.

He has not used one of these for many decades and when I was smallish he gave one to me (I believe the last surviving) as a kind of fidget toy.

Having re-discovered it in our cellar, I have given thought to reviving it as I have never heard it operate though my dad says it is rather fierce and grandad claims many fingers were bruised trying to start it. There are many curiosities that I hope someone here may be able to help me with (and ultimately make it clear whether this motor will ever move air again).

&amp;#x200B;

This is a view of the little thing in its entirety (all pictures with my macro lens) [https://imgur.com/xv1aY0B](https://imgur.com/xv1aY0B)

&amp;#x200B;

First, is the fuel. Since it is compression-ignited, I would hazard that the fuel type may need to be somewhat specific. Is it possible that petrol (gasoline) from the pump will be viable for this machine, or will it be impossible to fuel? (model planes don't use combustion engines any more...)

&amp;#x200B;

Second, while as best as I can see the [intake ports](https://imgur.com/lp2TBRb) are clear, there is growth in the combustion chamber (and the [carburetor](https://imgur.com/HezH81W)). Is this something that needs to be dealt with? (i.e. complete rebuild) The whole thing is pretty filthy, but I don't want to wash it in a way that could cause it further damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, is whether it's possible to dismantle at all, unscrewing the compression adjustment head reveals what seems to be an [irremovable plate](https://imgur.com/gxba6oJ) (as far as I can see) and the carburetor is connected to the crank case with a [strange red glue or weld](https://imgur.com/j3hhyAm)?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, as you can see in many of the pictures parts of the metal casing have chipped or work off. Is it possible that the metal has become too brittle to restore the engine or operate it safely? This is a difficult puzzle as I do not know the brand of the motor, and the age and obscurity makes it hard (neigh impossible) to google even the simplest things about it.

53,Which coding language would improve my employability as a chemical engineer?,1552990008,"Hey reddit,
I'm doing chemical engineering in Melbourne and what I can tell from the courses club/society and my seniors is that the market for chemical engineering (at least in Melbourne) is pretty small and that a lot of graduates do end up unemployed.

I am not interested in working on site. For now, I have my eyes set on consulting (though I've heard that some chem eng graduates go on to work in financial consulting and IT).

I was wondering which coding language would be good to improve my employability and help me stand out when I start applying for internships and eventually a job.

* BS in CE
* MS in EE (including teaching undergraduate PCB design for two years)

84,"Former Engineering Student Graduating with Unrelated Degree, and Regretting It",1552922790,"Hello there AskEngineers,

I am a senior in college graduating this spring with a degree in Communication and Information Design. I am not proud of the degree I am receiving, nor am I hopeful for the job opportunities it is going to open up for me. I have had many different majors in college, constantly wondering whether or not a program was right for me or if I wanted to do work in that field for the next 30 years of my life.

I started in Engineering, switched on day 1 to Computer Science because it seemed easier and more fun. Didn’t enjoy it, and switched my major to Communication and Information Design. Continued taking courses that could transfer into CS if I changed my mind. I then started looking back into Engineering, and started learning about Civil Engineering. I’d always looked at studying Landscape Architecture, and Civil seemed like a more secure but similar choice. It seemed like the type of work I wanted to do, and switched into Civil the beginning of my junior year. Because of how regimented Engineering programs are, this meant adding 2 years to my time in college, but I considered it worth it due to it being a fulfilling discipline as well as high paying. 

I enjoyed my year as a civil engineering student. I felt like the material I was learning was interesting, challenging, and mattered. I LOVED my Engineering classes, tolerated Chemistry, and somewhat enjoyed Calc I. We had a really cool professor and all classes were taught through MatLab. Plus, when people asked me what my major was, I was proud to tell them I was an Engineering student, and I hadn’t experienced that before with my other majors. Fall semester went really well, and I was feeling good about studying Engineering. 

Spring semester was much more rough. Besides struggling in Calc II and Calc based Physics, I lost a family member, lost my motivation, and had a really tough time. I had to withdraw from most of my classes. I also knew that retaking the courses next year would put me even further behind, which meant adding to my already lengthy time in college. 

So I switched back into my previous major because that meant I would be able to graduate on time. 4 years. Then, I could look into pursuing a Masters or other further education. 

Landscape Architecture is a field I have been interested in since I started college, and believe I would enjoy doing the work of that discipline as well. The reason I found Civil in the first place is finding resources online saying a Civil degree is similar to Landscape Architecture and way better career field to be in. I have been accepted into a Masters of Landscape Architecture program I like, and that is my current plan of action. I am second guessing myself though because I think I will always regret not finishing the Engineering degree. Plus, somewhat superficially, architecture doesn’t pay as well and is a less stable job in general. On the other hand, going back into engineering means getting a second Bachelor’s instead of a masters, which means acquiring more debt and taking more time in school.

I suppose my questions are, do you folks believe pursuing a second Bachelor’s in Engineering makes sense for me? Would already having a Bachelor’s degree expedite the process of getting the second one? What is the opinion of Landscape Architecture in the engineering discipline? Do you guys think I should just carry on with the Masters and put it behind me. 

Any and all insight is valuable. Ask if you have any questions for me. Thank you.

**TLDR; I’ve changed majors a lot, am graduating this spring, but don’t like my degree and regret leaving Civil Engineering. I’ve been accepted into a Masters of Landscape Architecture, but am considering a second bachelors in Civil. Pls help**

I recently got a job offer for a mechanical engineering position with the FAA and was wondering from a career perspective if it would be wise to accept the offer. I am a recent college graduate with about 6 months of work experience and have some concerns about moving over to the FAA.

I have always held the firm belief that once you join the government, you tend to stay there, but as I lay out my career path I have different ideas in mind. I've been checking around LinkedIn and it seems like most people tend to finish their careers with the FAA and there are very few people my age working with the FAA. With this in mind, I was planning on using the potential FAA experience as a stepping stone for other defense/aerospace companies and automotive companies (Boeing, Lockheed, Ford, etc.) in the private sector and was wondering if my rationale is wise.

Is it easy to leave the FAA if I were to stay there for around 1-2 years, and would having the FAA on my resume be a deterrent for future employers whenever I decide to move forward?

26,Why do misconceptions with the P.Eng. Engineering Stamp on liability and costs exist?,1552859544,"I'm a licensed Engineer in the province of BC and have been a professional of record on several projects before. I'm wondering why the following misconceptions still exist as I still hear these in boardrooms.

1. Misconception 1: We don't want to provide engineering P.Eng. stamped documents / drawings because of the liability issues. 
2. Misconception 2: We don't want to ask our Engineer to stamp these drawings / documents because that's a big cost.

So one of the first things I learned about the engineering stamp is it's purpose and when to use it under the [EGBC Use of the seal guidelines](https://www.egbc.ca/getmedia/4acd4afe-a372-43d5-8111-b05467647dc3/APEGBC-QMG-Use-of-APEGBC-Seal.pdf.aspx). 

On 1. above,  there's no added liability when stamping  documents. Seal or no seal, if you created the engineering documents / drawings,  you are responsible for it. Meaning even if you don't seal a document /drawing and send it out to a client, you're equally as responsible for it. In fact the EGBC guidelines (section 3.3.3.2)  state that you add no extra liability to yourself when you seal your  documents. Per section 3.1.1: The seal is not a mark of warranty. It is not a guarantee of  accuracy. The purpose of the seal is to authenticate documents that have  been prepared and delivered by a licensed member in their professional  capacity as a mark of reliance. 

&amp;#x200B;

For 2. above, cost of an engineer is for their design and coordination. It's not as if they would provide documents / drawings with another option to provide the same but stamped for a higher cost.  (Per section 3.3.4.1) an  Engineering Professional may not charge a fee for simply applying his or  her Seal to a document. The Seal is used only for authenticating  Engineering work. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's also videos from the association about the engineering stamp / seal which goes more in depth about the above.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just wondering where this is coming from. For Engineering students it's fine as when I was that age I thought there was a correlation with the engineering stamp and liability / costs too. It's when I see older project staff and even other Engineers who seem to believe the above misconceptions that I wonder why it still exists.

In the pursuit of aerodynamic improvements, I've done a lot of research on where drag is produced on a car and how to reduce it and/or improve downforce for our speed range.

The problem: particularly with spoilers, there seems to be a lot of contradictory information regarding their effects on the drag and lift of the car.

For clarity, I'm looking for racetrack performance, not typical street car stuff. Our speeds range from 45 mph to about 130 mph, potentially faster if we can manage it!

[Random site stating spoilers don't reduce drag, they reduce lift] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12384789)

There are several studies I've seen out there that are, frankly, not the best written that seemed to kinda point one way or another without any clear help for me and my racecar aerodynamics.  Also, they all seem to be about street cars, where the speeds are generally a bit lower.

I'm a 26-soon-to-be 27 year old non-traditional college student. I started school in the Fall of 2010 at a top-ranked engineering program (not that it matters much anymore). I started off school doing ok and managed to get ~3.3-3.4 GPA for about 3 semesters taking tough premed and engineering courses that were curved down. 

Unfortunately, my GPA tanked after a bunch of family and personal related events happened. My family tore itself apart, we couldn't afford school, and I failed to find effective ways of dealing with the stress or figure out what to do afterwards. I did so poorly for the next 2-3 semesters that I was suspended from school. I went back home, got depressed, gained weight, became homeless for about a year, and slowly had to fight my way back into University.

Things are somewhat better now. I have some work experience but it's not super-relevant to what I want to do. 

I would ideally like to: work in embedded systems engineering, or back-end development in software. I don't have target internships for jobs like those and I actually majored in Biomedical, while minoring in Electrical. But I've taken so many of the electrical courses now that I'm more than half done with the major as well. 

My grades are better, but still crappy. I've been back for about 4 semesters and still deal with depression. 

I've talked it over with an advisor and I can stay for an extra semester, take grad-level courses and then finish an M.Eng in a semester to graduate next spring at 28. 

Thus far, my mother's been very kind to me and agreed to pay a majority of the last four semesters. But I would have to take out loans for the remaining two.

Question: Should I just go for the M.Eng, finish that with a high GPA and then go to work? Or is it better to start working immediately? A friend in the software industry said I could start working immediately and just build experience. I hate having to do this to my mother who's been waiting to see me graduate for years now. And I hate the idea of having only 2 years left in my 20's to start working and live the life. On the other hand, if I stay I can network more, build experience, and start work on the right foot. 

If I start working and return for an M.Eng/MS later in my career, it would be more difficult for me to get into a reputable program bc of my shit past. 

I know school brand really doesn't matter much in the long-term; especially for SWE. And the best engineers may not even have degrees. But sadly for me this is one of the only strong points in my resume.

These installs will be on collocation sites and will have to meet industry standards, which I admit I know little about. I'm unsure if the mounts are drilled into place or strapped into place similar to what i am used to with concrete.

Are there any guidelines or resources for mounting antennas that are freely available that could assist me in the design? ",AskEngineers,False,mixedliquor,/r/AskEngineers/comments/b1w538/mounting_antennas_on_ductile_monopoles_where_to/
69,How to get compensated for automation of tasks?,1552761835,"Im the only programmer/automater on my team of glorified drafters. Ive done all the serious programming and whenever there is a new issue that could be automated. Im talking about automation of drawings and 3D models using APIs and calculating sizes of various parts. It used to take us a 5 days for a whole package and now it takes us 2-3 days. I know it could be even faster. 

That said, no one else even attempts to improve the lead times. Ive shaved a few hours on our lead times across the board for all of us engineers. If an adjustment needs to be made to my scripts Im the only guy capable of it. Even if its as simple as changing a constant variable.

My name is Sydney! I’m currently a junior in high school focusing on research on artificial gravity and comfortable RPMs for humans on a potential rotating spacecraft. I have been developing my research as much as I can and basing certain elements of it off of studies that I’ve read about and have been conducted in the past. 

Recently, I’ve become invested in entering my research in the Regeneron STS completion. Long shot, I know. But, I’ve been looking through past research of winners and seen that many, if not all, conducted personal research themselves. 

A large part of calculating the ideal radius of a spacecraft with artificial gravity is determining the comfortable amount of RPMs for humans. To do this experiment myself, I would need access to a centrifuge. I know, another long long shot.

83,Pay not increasing with quantity of work (career advice),1552699999,"I've been doing structural engineering with my current company for 3 years now. I've gotten good reviews, and have felt an increasing level of (unofficial) authority. My starting salary was 60k. After 6 months I got a $7,500 raise, then another $5,000 raise about a year later. With some yearly COL increases, I'm at about 77k now.

But in the last 5-6 months my workload has really ramped up. I am confident I can solve any problem I am given...as long as I am given enough time. The problem is I've recently been handed projects with aggressive deadlines, and I am starting to make silly errors.

For example: I had to design a number of fairly custom details on a large project. That required me to spend ~16 hours working over a weekend. Basically I designed something I knew would work, and reduced it as much as I could with the time I had. Ultimately the details got fabricated with a factor of safety of about 100, at a cost of about 4x what our client budgeted for. Now I've been dealing with a ton of snarky ""over-design"" comments. The best part is I just got my calculations stamped, so when I send the actual numbers over the client will blow a gasket.

So here I am on a friday night, looking forward to another weekend of work knowing a shit tsunami is on the horizon. I actually kind of like it though - the pressure makes me feel alive. What I don't like is my salary. I have a scheduling meeting with my boss on Monday (because of my workload), and am toying with the idea of asking for a raise.

Next April I will write the PE exam, and it's clear they really value that. I would have zero issue asking for a raise once I receive that, and am fairly certain I'd get one regardless. But a year is a long time, and I don't want to be taken advantage of. I want to give the impression I am willing to work hard and take responsibility IF the compensation matches. On the other hand, my pay has increased about 8% a year so far (not bad?). I also feel asking for a raise after making ""silly errors"" is poor timing, especially in a smaller company (single owner - not a multinational).

8,I just got a job offer and I'm sick with worry over the impending background check,1552662328,"I'll try to keep it short. I graduated one year ago and have been working local odd jobs to keep myself afloat while sending out resumes to engineering companies daily. The process has been grueling- roughly 500 applications and a few interviews (that went nowhere) later, I got offered a contract job with the likelihood of being hired on after the first 6 months at a major aerospace and defense company. I got the offer the same day as my interview, and it seems as if they liked me a lot (the interviewer escorted me out of the building and complimented me on a well done interview). The pay, the location and the work are all ideal for me.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I have a somewhat checkered past with the law. Parking and traffic tickets notwithstanding (the job doesn't require driving so I don't foresee having to worry about this), I have an OWI conviction for marijuana use (misdemeanor) from two years ago and a possession of marijuana charge from 5 years ago. My life has been severely impacted by these charges. I failed an entire semester because I sat in jail during the finals, and I lost out on a job opportunity (fantastic pay, but a meh position) right out of college due to the driving record (this was a field position). That one hurt. I do not drink or partake in the use of any other substances (never really was my thing, aside from weed). I feel that I have paid for my indiscretions, with interest, but I recognize that my personal feelings on the subject are irrelevant and that it all comes down to- who exactly? The guy who does the hiring? Someone higher up who has met me? I don't know. I currently have an open case for possession of a controlled substance (i don't like to carry around my prescription, so i had two or three loose in a pill case), but it is prescribed to me and has been for almost a decade. Next week when I go to court and the charge will be dismissed on those grounds. I also have a drug test scheduled next week and I will pass it. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, the application process has been grueling and I am terrified that its been a mistake taking the last few days off from sending out applications. I'm trying to be optimistic but I just feel as if I will never be allowed to reach my full potential and apply my skills/knowledge that I worked so hard to gain because of issues from my past. My parents are so excited that I got a position in this particular company, but I cannot bring myself to feel anything but dread because I foresee myself having to break the news that this offer was withdrawn due to the background check and that I will be back at square one. This is the worst part for me- disappointing my parents after they've sacrificed so much to help me be the best I can be. To be honest, I'm not sure I have the mental fortitude to continue trying to break into this field if I am denied. I feel as if I've done nothing but waste time since I started school, while racking up a ton of debt to boot- not that I feel that my education itself was a waste, but all of the red tape around it makes me envy the friends who have already found success in 'simpler' fields, be it fashion, entertainment or elsewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the point of my post is to get some feedback from other engineers and to see if my level of concern should be as high as it is. Yes, I have made some mistakes. I have a history with the law. I have never done anything violent, or committed a crime against anyone else. I volunteer in my community and I tutor grade school aged kids. I feel like I am doing everything as I should be, but I'm desperate, and it seems so unfair. I know that life can be unfair and that not all people who are 'losing', so to speak, deserve it, but thats simply how the cookie crumbles. I just really want this position, its exactly what I set out to do when I first chose my major and in all reality I don't know if the stars will align in this way for me again.  I'm not sure how relevant it is, but I'm in New York. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't myself to get excited or to feel as if I've accomplished anything yet. The excitement of my parents and my friends is just making me feel worse, I wish I hadn't mentioned the job offer until after the background check. Whatever happens at this point is completely out of my hands and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. Science is my passion, but I'm just filled with so much concern and regret and it seems like these feelings have been boundless since graduation (and even before, but I kept telling myself that once I had a degree, everything would change). I have been humbled by my much more successful friends who never went to college, I just want to be able to have something accomplished that I can feel some pride over. Receiving a degree did not do that for me, I didn't even go to graduation. I put off the celebrations for when I got my first job offer, but now that I'm here, I still can't find a reason to celebrate. I just want my concerns assuaged, but I feel like the responses I'm going to receive are exactly what I'm expecting- ""you might have nothing to worry about, but whose to say"" or ""dont waste time worrying, it is what it is even if you dont get the job"" or  ""if you dont get the job, its your own fault- you should have known better""

Nowadays everything is moving towards being reusable, including plastics made by injection moulding. I am currently gauging the market for any ideas about material selection for an oncomming project the team is about to recieve.

Injection moulding of a plastic material which can be washed a hundred times by a mild detergent for five minutes to upwards of 170°F, and after, disinfected for a short amount of time at around 250°F

11,Resources for a CompE looking to get his feet wet with terrestrial and cable TV systems?,1552659922,"Hi all,

I'm a CompE doing some work for an ISP in the states and they've recently picked up a small cable plant in their service area. While the current plan is for the cable TV portion to go away (leaving just cable internet) they want to start pulling in some local TV channels and providing them via IPTV (HLS) to clients in the area. (The company has been in talks with the broadcasters and this is apparently doable from a contractual perspective.)

I'm perfectly at home with the IPTV component (i.e. once I have a video feed for a channel) but what I'm new to is the analog side of the TV system.

I won't be doing any RF design work (we'll either bring someone on or contract out for that) but I would like to get up to speed on the basics of terrestrial TV and cable TV, just so I can have an idea of what's going on down there (and to do basic troubleshooting if one of my video feeds suddenly goes tits up.)

So far I've given Google a fair shot and done the basic reading on ATSC, 8VSB and QAM256. I'm generally ok with them from a signal processing perspective but I'm interested to learn more about the actual industry standards of practice. E.g. Are there standard antenna types? Typical broadcast transmitter powers/ranges? SNR/Signal strength expectations? Etc.

14,Can I get some constructive criticism on my first RF PCB layout?,1552656004,"The task of this circuit is to receive a 1.4GHz RF signal, properly filter it, amplify it with a very large gain (the signal is extremely weak) and measure its amplitude in dB's. The main board will be connected to the antenna through a 1.5 meter coaxial cable, so I figured that it would be a good idea to have a seperate filter&amp;amplifier placed very close to the antenna to minimise the losses on the cable. So here is how it goes. We firstly filter the signal and amplify it with an LNA, then we send it to the main board through a coax. On the main board there are 3 more stages of filtering and amplification. The output of the last amplifier is feeded to the logarithmic RF peak detector. The output of which goes to an inverting amplifier with a unity gain. The output of the detector is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the signal (-24.5mV/dB), so this way we make it proportional. The output of the inverting amplifier will have a scale of 24.5mV/dB and we will up-down scale it to different levels. The voltage divider at the output of the inverting amplifier down scales the 24.5mV/dB into 10mV/dB and the following non inverting amplifiers scale it up to 50mV/dB and 100mV/dB respectively. The whole circuitry is powered by ultra low noise linear regulators.

The board that is close to the antenna has only 2 layers with a bottom ground plane, because it only has RF circuitry. It does not feature an RF shield on the PCB itself because it will be placed inside a metal box. The main board has 4 layers: RF - GND plane - VCC plane - everything else. It has 4 RF shields on the board, the little copper surrounded ""rooms"" are where the shields will be soldered to.

I would like to get your opinion on this. It can be tips on how to improve it or things that I might have done wrong/badly or comments. Thanks!

Note: I did not design the bandpass filters. They were designed, simulated and performance tested by someone else, so they work great.

Because I’m not being put on a specific project to do work on, I can’t just go to my program manager and ask for more work. Instead my boss has me floating around doing little things here and there which ends up having me constantly looking for more work. 

I knew coming into this what everyone has said about these large bloated defense companies, but I wasn’t expecting having so much trouble finding consistent work (especially when everyone I work around always seems to have a lot of work to do) to the point where i spend a good chunk of my day just sitting on Reddit because I have nothing else to do. I’ve tried being as proactive as possible; I’ve asked multiple people outside my boss if they have any work I can help with but my requests always fall short. Basically everything I’ve done up to this point has come from me asking people if I can do work for them rather than my boss finding work for me, even though I’m consistently told that he should be responsible for my staffing.

I just feel like I’m wasting my time and not getting anything out of this job. My intent was doing grad school part time which means I would have to stay at this company for a few years to get them to fund it, but I’m not sure if I can go on like this for that long.

54,Switching from Design to Structures (Aerospace),1552572066,"I’ve searched through the sub and have collected bits and pieces of answers to this, but I decided to pose my own question. 

I’m currently a design engineer in a small aerospace company and have been working at my job for almost two years now. When I was graduating college two years ago I knew I had strong interest in structural analysis (especially fatigue), composite materials, and then partially design. I ended up with a design role post-graduation, and I was excited to give it a shot. 

In that time since I was hired I haven’t really done much design (more project, quality tasks), but from talking with senior designers and hearing what they do I’m not sure if I’m actually as interested in it as I thought. I am being moved to a true design role soon so maybe the opportunity to do more rewarding work will revive interest, but still am doubting that this is where I want to be.

I definitely know that I’m still very interested in structures topics and I’m strongly leaning towards the idea that I want to switch disciplines, either within my current company or by looking for other jobs elsewhere. 

It’s been two years (at least) since I’ve done any sort of work using statics, dynamics, etc. I’m worried that I won’t be a good candidate because I’m rusty in my basics.

Empirical research shows that once countries/regions remove capital/cultural/legal barriers their GDP per capita between these regions tends to converge. My idea is to model the dispersion of capital/GDP as if it was a substance immersed in a liquid: vats with a greater concentration will diminish their concentration of said substance at a certain rate depending of certain factors (I assume, density, temperature, viscosity, pressure, etc.) when put in contact with lower concentration ones until the two have the same concentration and vice versa.

84,First Job Dilemma - Should I change career paths?,1552518620,"I hope that this post is accepted, as in  /r/engineering there is a career thread but it is mostly dead and this is a bit of a time sensitive issue.

Background and context:

I just graduated as an ME in December. I am 22 years old (23 this year) and I reside in Europe. I have various hobbies and interests, ranging from photography to DIY to business to things such as medicine, psychology etc, I think of myself as an interesting person with lots of interests. Now, I am a very hands on person and a DIY enthusiast. I've made lots of things which to other people around me seem quite impressive but in reality they're things which with some dedication and logic and common sense anyone can do, change car's timing belts, work on car like changing brake pads, this already blew some people away as they take their car to a mechanic. I also have hands on experience with workshop tools and powertools and with these skills I fix/create projects. I say this because I'd love to have a small workshop in which I produce things and sell them be it knives or be it torches or wooden spoons, I want my own ""shed"" (I'm getting it soon enough in fact). I recently started to look for a job and had many great interview and job offers.

Scenario:

Now I am sort of settling into my first job ever, this is week number 3 for me. I currently work for an international company ( lets call it A ) specializing in Injection Moulding. I like the work, the environment and the people. I have a new project at hand and I am one of their main engineers on this project. The company itself is great, it provides lots of training abroad and I am not just a number to them. The salary is also good for a starting position. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I got an interview with a small, young company (lets call them B) that specialize in lighting and lamps and sustainable energy projects. This company is backed by a bigger company (context). Company B are launching a new project and want a jack of all trades (which I guess I am) to help them launch. Startup company (company C - sister of company B) . Technically I won't be an engineer only, I'd be doing work such as photography, marketing, meeting clients etc. It is essentially a startup, currently worked on by two people and they want me as their third person but working full time on this. C has all the facilites of B, meaning workshops, laser cutters, 3D printers (A has 3D printers too), lathes etc, they're a manufacturing company but quite flexible. C focuses on lighting and lamps too but in a slightly different way than B. I love their product and passion for this project. And it looks like I also have that passion as they want to hire me. The way they explained to me is that I would have free use of the workshops as long as I get my job done - unlike at A where I need permission by management to use some machines (3D printing mainly).

&amp;#x200B;

Dilemma:

&amp;#x200B;

I love both jobs, maybe the second (C) a bit more as it reflects my dynamic nature and flexibility but it comes with a huge salary cut. If I join the startup (C) I would be taking around 2.5-4k euro pay cut (gross income) for more work than I have at company A at the moment. some salary benefits with company C though would be that I have all my fuel costs paid and I will have a company phone with mobile data which I can freely use for work and non work purposes, and was told that the phone line essentially amounts to around 500-700 euro a year and the fuel depends on how much I would use my car - but around 1.5k euro. This totals to 2-2.2k of paid services (which company A are not offering). What I will not get with C is the training and promotions that A will offer once their project is completed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have the drive for both jobs, and I like the people and environment in both places but I just can't decide. at the moment I am just thinking to go for the money as I am just coming out of being a broke ass student, and money will help me for sure.  What do you suggest? And if I should opt out from company C (startup) how is the best way to do so while not breaking the great ""relationship"" I built in the couple of interviews I had with them?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just a simple Mechanical Engineer who's getting dragged more and more into the controls side of industrial automation. (I'm a machine designer, machinist, and have a couple of certificates from Fanuc for robot programming.)

I'm currently working on a Robot integration that does not have a standalone PLC - the robot controller is going to tap into several other pieces of equipment via Ethernet I/O. To that end, I would like to debug the robot program as much as possible before bringing down the current production line. But because I have the robot currently running offline for testing, and it does not have its own PLC or the ability to 'force' bits on or off that are external I/O, I don't know of a way to simulate/force the I/O for the sake of debugging the program.

In my mind, the solution that makes sense both now, and to have on hand for future training and integration projects of a similar nature, is to build an 'Output Simulator.' I essentially just need to create a bunch of 24VDC signals with manual switches, that I'll wire into the Modbus I/O units that are getting run to the robot.

Am I way off base with this? Are there commercially available units to buy on the cheap? Although I think I'd actually like to build my own for the experience/practice as well.

If I'm building my own, I'll need a box, a 24V power supply (powering off 110VAC), a bunch of switches, indicator lights, cable tray, cord grips, etc.....what am I missing? I'll have like 20 something switches to simulate, and extra is never a bad thing, right? 

Do I need to worry about any current limiting, either to the switches or from the switches to the I/O devices?

What I am looking for is a better way to do the system &amp; cabling harness drawings. Currently my company uses autocad or Visio to generate a reference system schematic and then manually generate a pin to pin netlist for each internal cable harness in Excel which is given to a ME to draw. The ME does a very generic drawing (usually 2 rectangles with a line between and a length callout, a copy/paste of the netlist, and the BOM).  

I've looked around on the internet and found RapidHarness which I absolutely love but @ $140/month/user this software becomes costly quite quickly considering that we already have free and/or paid for ways of designing these cables to an ""acceptable"" level - I doubt I would be able to push this through management to get each member of our team a license (there are 5 EE's, the company is small).

24,"Mechanical Designers and Stress Analysts of the Aerospace Industry, what skills and knowledge is vital to your success as an Engineer and how much of it have you learned on the job?",1552456521,"Hey r/AskEngineers I am completing a BSME at a small and cheap state school. I have held two internships, one of which I was a Design Engineer and the other a Manufacturing Engineer. I have accepted a position as a Design Engineer/Stress Analyst in the Aerospace Industry that will start over the summer and I am a bit worried I will not be very well prepared for the workforce.

I have done well in school, and will be graduating with a 3.5 GPA, though much of the theory has gone over my head and I am finding myself having a difficult time remembering much of classes I took a couple of years ago. I am familiar with the term ""impostor syndrome"" and am doing anything I can to ensure I prepare myself as much as possible for the industry instead of actually becoming an impostor. So my question to those of you who are experienced in the industry and who have been in my shoes at one point in your career is this:

**What skills (soft, technical, software/programming related, etc...) are needed to be successful in a Design and Stress Analyst role? 

How much of this did you learn on the job and were trained for versus what you were expected to know?

I'm in a bit of a tough spot and was looking for some wise words from those of you who have worked at Sandia or Lockheed. I'm about to graduate this May with my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering with two competitive offers:  Sandia National labs as an ""R&amp;D Electronics Engineering Technologist"" and Lockheed Martin as an ""Associate Electronics Engineer.""

The title I would have at Sandia worries me since I won't be titled an Engineer (which only comes with a graduate degree) but the thought of working in R&amp;D at a lab straight out of college sounds like a very challenging and fulfilling experience. The job involves radiation testing of brand new transistors and IC's in their nuclear department.

At Lockheed I'd be in the space division with the group that maintains the electronics on the Minuteman ICBMs and support systems.

Both offer to pay for my Masters, deal with nuclear weapons and require a secret security clearance. Sandia is offering $2k more per year. For cost of living analysis, Sandia is in ABQ and Lockheed would be in King of Prussia, PA (10% higher cost of living.)

I don't know what to expect from either employer and want to make the right choice between the two as far as setting up a strong foundation to build my engineering career on.

28,Please help out a high school senior decide whether engineering is his fit.,1552447906,"Hi r/AskEngineers, I don't know if this belongs here but I'll try my best.

So my family is dead-ass serious about me going to be a doctor or pharmacist, while I have been accepted to the physics major of the college I'm going to (which houses a nuclear engineering option) and am planning to go to grad school in that idea. I've been lying to them that I'm undecided, but they kinda know I want to be an engineer and constantly pressure against it. Here are their reasons:

1) **""The engineering job market is too contingent on how the economy is doing, while a job in the healthcare industry isn't.""** While I acknowledge some truths in this, I don't think it's as bad as they make it out to be. I heard of massive layoff in time of recessions, but nurses and pharmacists were victims too. Any thoughts on this?

2) **""There's a surplus of engineers, but a shortage of doctors. You have to be in the top 1% engineers to have a job, why don't just graduate from med school and a job will land to you?""** (from now on, I'll just refer to all healthcare providers as doctors because it's my family's language). I don't know if it's true, but in my small little state university, I've seen far more kids wanting to do premed and stuff like that than kids in engineering. I decided to do engineering because I like learning math and physics, and I think nuclear power is the coolest shit ever, but I also want a job that makes decent money. Anybody knows of the demand of the energy industry, and nuclear energy in particular? In Texas (where I live), it's not that popular, but I don't know if it's the same to other states.

3) **""Engineering companies value fresh graduates, while hospitals value a doctor's depth of experience. Engineers have to keep themselves updated with all the new techniques, while doctors don't have to.""** I really with the fresh half of the second sentence, but doesn't it apply to like all careers? I mean if you don't know how to use a machine that everybody knows how to use, pretty much you're not as good. What bothers me the most is that I've seen so many former engineers who are no longer engineers for some reason. I don't mind keeping myself updated (or I think so), but I'm afraid there are other reasons into this? Do you think an engineer with like 5-10 years of experience will be at risk of layoff? What other paths could they take should this happens?

4) **""You are just not fit to be an engineer.""** This bothers me the most as it is the most personal reason, albeit the most important one. I don't always know how a particular machine works (a leaf blower, for example, I hate that shit). I'm slow to figure stuff out, but more often than not I manage to do it. A lot of people just don't have that patience to watch me figuring stuff out. I'm also not handy at all, and when it comes to dexterity I'm just outright the worst. How much do you think it will hurt me? I'm planning to take a lot of lab courses (in both the physics and engineering departments) and if lucky enough get an internship, so do you think that would help?

29,Is wanderlust a good enough reason to pursue a master’s degree abroad?,1552447691,"*I’ve asked about the logistics before, and while additional insight on that is appreciated, I’d like to ask actual engineers for perspective on my motivations for wanting to do any of this in the first place.*

In December I graduated with a BSEE focusing in electromagnetics. After traveling in Asia for 1.5 months, I started working a few weeks ago in my ideal role at a large aeronautics company, an industry I’d always told everyone I wanted to be in.

My job is located in the city I grew up in, allowing me to have a reasonable commute from home and save tremendously on living costs. Combined with a 9/80 schedule, getting back into hobbies and reconnecting with old friends, I think this is about as good as it gets on paper.

Nonetheless, despite having set myself up for a comfortable post-graduation life in the US, my desire to both live abroad and travel more in my 20s keeps me from feeling content with staying here forever.

Europe in particular interests me due to the closeness of so many different countries, and admittedly, their copious amounts of vacation time. Pursuing my master’s in the EU seems to be the most viable (and appealing) option, ideally France or Germany for their reduced/free tuition at many universities and my personal interest in their cultures and languages. If I find a EU job afterwards, I’d stay, at least for a while.

All that said, I never considered engineering my passion. Yes, overall I enjoy electromagnetics, RF and Antennas especially, much more than other subfields of EE, but I’d much rather read a history book or play the piano than devote a single second to engineering outside of work. 

I do understand that oftentimes hobbies should best be left as that, but it’s both amazing, and somewhat depressing, realizing how much progress I’ve made in learning French this past year - completely out of self-motivation, which is something I’ve rarely found with engineering without a grade or pay being involved. For lack of a better phrasing, I’m not sure I want to stay in engineering my entire career (though I do find my job pretty interesting right now).

At the same time, I’m under no illusion that my engineering degree, and the money I’m saving right now with an engineering salary, are the main reasons that I’d be able to pursue my master’s abroad in the first place - and relatively quickly at that.

So r/AskEngineers, what are your thoughts? Are my motivations sound or just some pipe dream? If you have personal experience with going abroad for school or for work I’d love to hear about it, and how it shaped your perspective. Was it to travel more, to gain international experience, or perhaps a better work-life balance? Did you actively look for international opportunities or was it more happenstance? And finally, do you have regrets about any of it?

I’d like to think I’m not naive about the realities of being an international student/expat, but I’m sure there will be plenty of surprises. Still, i believe it’s better to try it and come back, then never go and forever wonder what could’ve been.

Thanks y’all.

39,Post phone interview anxiety. Seeking advice and reassurance,1552433234,"I had a phone interview for a job I really want as a marine engineer today. It is with a company and for the most part I thought I did fairly well. 

The interview was fairly straightforward with a description of the job by the interviewer, a brief description of myself followed by questions I have, and then a discussion about my CV and experience. I tried to be as personable as possible and demonstrate strong interest in the position. I explained how I have been on the water since I was a boy and I was real quick to apply for the position. I asked probably about 10 questions to the interviewer. I was definitely nervous but I thought I was doing decently.

During the discussion of my resume my senior design project came up - specifically how I performed a failure modes and effects analysis. He asked me to elaborate on ways we minimized risk in the design and I was completely caught off guard. I got completely tongue tied and kept spitting out the same start of an answer with a failure to finish it. Eventually I asked him if I could pull up our analysis on my PC, and I was able to provide a sufficient answer. This awkward tongue-tying moment probably lasted 10 seconds but it felt much longer! I then geared the convo to my professional experience - particularly my hands on work I have done at my internship over the past few years. 

I figured changing the subject allowed the conversation to end on a positive note. And I asked for his email (rather than going through HR) to send him a follow up email along with my portfolio. I also included three brief examples on how I minimized risk in the design/analysis in the follow up email. 


I really want this job and I’m sure I’m overthinking it and am being self critical. But does anyone have any advice for future interviews so this doesn’t happen again? And more importantly, does anyone think that this will harm me?


TLDR: Had a phone interview that was going well until I got caught off guard by a question regarding my senior design project and couldn’t come up with an answer immediately (got tongue tied and failed to answer initially)... eventually  had to rely on pulling up the document from PC.

I've been looking for FT jobs since January, even received an offer paying 65k about 15 minutes from my home but turned it down because I really want to work somewhere not in the state I'm from as I've been here all my life (regretting this big time now)... they didn't ask for a transcript before offering me the position 

I just found out today after trying to get my diploma from my school that there was a change in my major's curriculum my final semester that I was not aware of and I still need to take 1 course. If I had known this a couple months back I could have taken the course in January and been done by May - now I most likely have to wait until Summer session to take the course (ending mid June)... I have no idea what to idea what to do as far as working goes right now

Do I stop looking for a job for now? Do I apply for jobs hiring in the Fall? Should I change my graduation date on my resume? Should I still look for jobs and somehow take the course in the Summer while working? Should I try to reverse my decision with the company that offered me a job?

*Is there an actual name for barriers on overpasses that prevent people from throwing things or jumping? It seems that guard rail or barrier is used more to refer to containing vehicle traffic.
*I sometimes see barriers that are just a tall chain link fence, and others that are chain link that go up and curve over like a canopy over the walkway of the overpass. Are there other options for discouraging dangerous behavior? What are the pros and cons of them, if any?
*Is it possible to retrofit chain link fences with with chain link canopy? As a layman, that seems like the quick and inexpensive way to go.
*Is there anything else you think I should know about before writing these letters?

2,Can I transfer my EIT license to another state to take the PE exam even if I don't live in the second state?,1552334857,"So quick background.  I graduated in 2015, then passed my FE in October 2016.  After the results from NCEES came that I passed the exam, their site has a link to your state boards website for the next steps.  My state is Pennsylvania.  At the time their website isn't very clear on what the actual next steps are.  I talked to the one other person in my office who had his PE from PA.  He said he didn't do anything after the FE, that the board sent him a certificate in the mail.  Because of this I assumed I didn't have to follow up and thought PA just had a digital record of me passing the FE.  

So now to the present, after talking to a coworker who got his EIT certificate in another state, I realized there should have been a certificate sent to me.  After looking into it a bit more, I eventually found the register link for the PA license and now officially have EIT issued to me. Unfortunately unlike other states PA has a specific law for PE prerequisites that you can not take your PE exam until you have 4 years of experience **AFTER** being issued your EIT certificate.  I even called someone from the board, and they verified this is the case.  So now I will have to wait to take my PE exam in state until 2023.

Looking at some neighboring states such as Ohio, Maryland, and New Jersey, they appear not to have the same ridiculous laws as PA.  I've talked to my supervisor and if I can go out of state to get a PE sooner, they are willing to pay for it.

So in a few months I will have 4 years of experience in design engineering while working under a PE.  What I want to know is since my EIT was issued through PA, do I need to transfer this certificate to another state so I can take my PE exam sooner?

[Here is an image](https://goo.gl/images/5rJWKi) from the document showing examples of allowed and prohibited measurement runs. My question is about the layout/arrangement of these. If you measure parallel/perpendicular, you need equal cumulative lengths of runs in both orthogonal directions, and also the same number of runs in both directions. But if you do them diagonally, you don't need the same number of runs along both diagonal directions, though they do need to add up to the same cumulative length.

Why is this? Why are you allowed to do different numbers of lines diagonally, but not if you arrange them parallel to the sides?

Aerospace is a passion of mine, but also holds several setbacks if opted for. It's a relatively new branch in college and is not all that secure when it comes to getting jobs in my country (India). In contrast, EC almost guarantees a job for every student. 

I find both fields interesting, ASE more so than ECE. I don't want to pursue a career in ECE but I do with ASE. EC is also said to be one of the toughest branches in the college. But speaking to seniors has revealed that shifting from my secure position in EC is a risky choice. 

 At the moment, my plan is to finish my Bachelor's programme and then do my Master's. I'm also in a college club that lets me do a fair amount of AS related work, but not too much.

35,What would you call the career that I am interested in?,1552280032,"I feel like the very first step into figuring out the career that I have wanted for the longest time would be to put it into words. I'd like to call it computer hardware engineering as I have always been fascinated by the idea of being able to take apart and put together a computer from the ground up the moment my grandfather took the time to show me how to do something as simple as opening up the computer and adding a mere stick of RAM in as a kid. That was it, that planted the seed of me wanting to be able to do this sort of thing as a profession one day. Ever since then, I've done things like add some sticks of RAM to the computers of other family members, graphics cards, fans etc. As a gamer this would be extremely advantageous for me to learn how to do for myself as well but, I'd want to be much more educated on how to do so not only for myself and my own hobby but, for a living as well. I'd want to be able to look at a piece of hardware, know what it is, know what's wrong with it, know how to install it and what makes it tick. I want to learn more. More about graphics cards, different types of RAM, power supplies, cooling systems, motherboards and what is compatible and incompatible with each other. Basically, I'd like to be able to go  in and make repairs on computers and make educated recommendations on what someone is looking for in that particular system for what task they plan to use it for on a day to day basis and be able to get that system up and running efficiently for whichever price that they are able to afford for what they need done and the, at the end of the day, be able to put together a monster of a gaming machine for myself on the side from the ground up with this knowledge and experience I've learned through this career path.  


Am I in the correct ball park? Every time I tend to look these things up it can be a bit daunting with the amount of subsections and vague acronyms there seems to be to computer hardware engineering.

36,Geotechnical engineering: Masters or PhD?,1552279546," My girlfriend, 28, is a geotechnical engineer, currently in her first year of her Master's degree. Her graduate research focuses on liquefaction of silt soils.

She is starting to think about what she wants to do after the Master's. The two options are:

**1) Continue schooling and pursue a PhD** (additional 3-4 years after Masters) with the intent of joining the workforce after graduating. She *does not* intend to stay in academia after getting the PhD. Her main reason to get a PhD is because she is interested in the subject matter (liquefaction) and enjoys her research.

or

**2) Look for a job after the Master's degree.**

There are several questions she's been trying to get information on:

1. In the geotechnical engineering field, does a PhD give a significant edge over a Master's in terms of salary? She understands that pursuing a PhD has an opportunity cost of 3-4 years worth of Master's level salary (minus the PhD stipend that is paid).
2. In industry, how does a geotechnical engineer's job differ between those with Master's degrees and PhDs?
3. Does only having a Master's limit her ability to become an ""expert"" in her field if she chooses to go into industry?
4. It seems like nowadays, a Master's in Geotechnical Engineering is essentially required if you want to get an entry level job in geotechnical engineering. From what she's seen, geotechs with Master's degrees are limited to density testing and other field observation type of work, whereas a geotech with a PhD could start out directly doing design work. Has this been your experience?
5. She enjoys her research, but has no intention of staying in academia if she gets a PhD. Does that limit her job prospects in industry significantly? She's worried that by getting a PhD, she'll become overqualified for many geotechnical engineering positions. Eventually, if she simply just needs to get a job out of finanical necessity, she wants to be marketable to a wide variety of positions, even if they're not ""ideal"".
6. She's 28 now. Doing a PhD would put her at graduating at 32-33 with her PhD. Financially, she has no debt at the moment, and hopefully wouldn't incur much debt during the PhD (funding available). However, she'd like to start making some money, as she hasn't been able to really start saving toward retirement. What is your take on pursuing a PhD with this in mind?
7. One of her goals is to be able to find jobs abroad (she loves to travel). Between a Master's or a PhD, which is more condusive to accomplishing this goal (again, the PhD would not be used for a job in academia).

38,Working Engineers- A Question on Pigeonholing,1552277760,"Hey everyone, I've been following this sub-reddit for quite sometime now and have seen great/interesting perspectives and advice on difficult career problems some engineers are having. I wanted to see if I can get some insight from y'all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated with a B.S in MechE and got a job right out of graduation. The opportunity just kinda fell into my lap via a family friend, and I snatched it up right away, avoiding the hassle of the job search. The job is basically being a QA/QC inspector on construction site for a construction company.

I'm three months into the job and have slightly mixed feelings about it. The **pros** of the job are: Relatively highly paid (Closing on 6 figures, which I am THRILLED about), relaxed work environment, and a tangential relation to a field I'm interested in. The **cons** are: 80+ hour work weeks (Every week), 2 hour commute everyday (to and from site), Salary pay with no overtime, and I think the real kicker is that there's no engineering work involved at all. It's just QA/QC + documentation of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my plan was to work here for 2-3 years, staying to save up money and building professional job experience, but I've been wondering whether my time would be better spent doing actual engineering work for an engineering firm. I've been thinking about getting into Control Systems, or something of that sort. My favorite engineering topics in school were Mechanical/Machine Design, and Controls/Vibrations. I'm just not dead set on what career path would be enjoyable to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

To sum my questions up:

1. Is my time frame for staying in this job too short/long? (being that I eventually want to move on)
2. Will I be ""pigeonholing"" myself in the construction industry?
3. Am I undervaluing my time (referring to the 80 hour weeks on salary), and my degree by doing this job?
4. Am I overestimating my worth and being arrogant/ungrateful about my current job/skillset?

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to get an idea of where I'm at, and maybe some advice to course correct in the highly probably chance my plan is deeply flawed. Thanks in advance!

I’m a middle school teacher who is creating a class that is unique and I could use your help.

My whole career I have bemoaned student apathy and the perceived irrelevance of the typical class in middle school. I see students leaving for high school with no interests, passions, projects, or accomplishments of any type. To fight this, I am making a class that will let students choose what type of creator they become and giving them the support, time, and space to develop their creative side. I’ll leave out the long details but I am halfway to pulling this off. 

One of the creator types they can choose is “Engineer.” 

I have a couple of example projects that get them moving in the lower grades. I am now trying to develop the next steps in becoming a engineer.

My science background is limited. **I could use your insights on the important processes, skills, and beginner resources that would help a budding engineer**. These kids have access and are learning how to use 3D printers, CNC routers, vinyl cutters, a laser cutter, general tools (scroll saws, general hand and power tools). They are so excited to develop into unique creators! I need resources and support for them, as most kids eventually ask me “What do I do next?”   

**Onward to how you can help.**

How would you divide “Engineer” into a few subdomains? 

What are the basic principles or guidelines that a middle school student could follow? I will need to research and teach them how to follow this. 

What advice would you give a kid who wants to be an engineer?

I'm a mechatronics student, this is my last year, and I did get this intership for three months, on a mining plant. My goals are to be an instrumentation engineer, but where no vacants on this area. I did apply to mechanical side of things, and I'm starting to get some frustration.  


First of all, I did expect to do some plant work. Hard work, installing pumps, taking some measurements and stuff like this, at least at first, but this first three days I was expected to give solutions on some mayor problems. I was informed that my first and most important duty is to redesign a feed chute, a heat dissipation system, and today another design task: a vibration crib that was faulty.  


I started the design, but almost without data... When I ask for some data, the only thing I hear is ""go to measure it""(blueprints are unreadable)...and was given only a measuring tape. twice now I was sent to take measurements on working equipment and whatever knowledge of basic security I have is on fight with the stress of not getting any work done. If I didn't get the job done as fast as I can I only get comparisions with the previous intern, subtly. ""hey X, can't you do this CAD work and send it to my email"", ""X was really good, worked MORE than 12 hours somedays"", ""X did the job already, you only have to take measurements again, only to be sure"".   


Today they asked me for specific solutions to some problems... solutions that I didn't have... I didn't know what to say.  


Some aspects of this is my mechatronics background, as I lack some ""pure ME knowledge"". Im getting ready to study, but work sometimes is up to 12 hours, 10 hour being the normal day, and get home drained.  


I don't know if this is normal, if I'm just being inmature... I was promised to do 2 months on Mechanical maintenance and 1 on instrumentation. I'd like to know what can I do to face this, and to get to learn as much as I can, and to give my bosses (who are really cool otherwise) as much as I can, but I feel already stuck and miserable.

My title designation when I resigned from my last employer is an Engineer Assistant.

A little information about me:

I'm a 3rd year Undergraduate Student in one of the top 3 universities in my country. I'm studying Electrical-Electronics Engineering. I'm trying to figure out a roadmap for the next 1-1.5 year in order broaden my knowledge to a respectable level in the areas that I'm interested in which are mainly ICs and Embedded Systems (including low-level/bare metal and high-level programming)

I've been searching the internet for basically the last one and a half year to decide on the my last year elective courses. In the last year of our curriculum, we choose technical elective courses that are bundled under different areas which are: Electronics, Computer, Control, Communications, Biomedical, Power Systems, Energy Conversion &amp;  Power Electronics and Microwaves &amp; Antennas. I'm planning on choosing the Electronics and Computer options as I'm mainly interested in circuit and computer stuff (general interest in life). I will be taking courses with the following names:

&amp;#x200B;

* Introduction to VLSI Design
* Introduction to Analog Integrated Circuits
* Solid State Devices
* Data Structures
* Operating Systems
* Introduction to Computer Networks
* Computer Architecture I &amp; II
* Introduction to Microprocessors (Assembly Programming on ARM will be also focused in this course)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I can link the course description sites if you want.

&amp;#x200B;

Some interviews with some respectable companies led me to believe that an undergraduate doesn't really know much because to my question of ""What do you expect from an undergraduate?"" they replied in the lines of ""Other than high CGPA and interest in learning, not much"". I don't want to feel like a fish out of water when I graduate do I want to start learning as early as possible.

* What programming languages should I learn?
* Should I be knowledgeable about Linux?
* Which books should I read?

***(DISCLAIMER: PLEASE NO TOXICITY OR NEGATIVITY)(Please don't get mad at me for my current situation)***

**Basically,** I just need a job out of college that will help me be financially independent. I am studying civil engineering environmental option. My school is well known for producing engineers so companies stay in very close contact with my school and often recruit.

**Heres the catch**, I never really had that much of an interest in the field and I went through personal obstacles in my life. This all affected my GPA. It was good until recently. Now it is a 2.75. And it might go lower depending on how I do this semester. I am still dealing with these personal issues however I am trying my best. Midterms are coming up so I will study my ass off.

**Anyways,** Well, my parents are urging me to find an internship so that I can eventually get a job. All my parents want for me and all I want for myself too is to be financially independent, using this degree from this polytechnic school.

TO BE REAL: I actually love music production and I will do it till the day I die. Never stop producing and honing and perfecting the craft. However, It will have to be something I dedicate the majority of my FREE time to, which I am completely fine with because I love it.

**So,** thats why I just need to be financially independent and not a starving musician. And Please Do not tell me to quit this major or school work shit. I am not dropping out. Thats not an option. I understand the importance of Financial stability and school in general. I respect school. AND I RESPECT the fact that I will need a job. So I might as well get a decent job with this degree.

***So more info on me: prob bad info but im being honest***

Ive taken AUTOCAD classes. Not that good at it. I am prob rusty now too.

I don't really have any projects or any activities under my belt. I am a part of ASCE. but not really active.

GPA is 2.75. i will try to raise it. i am taking only two classes this semester due to personal reasons. but i WILL do my best.

My neighbor that my parents know actually brought up me interning at EBMUD. But idk what the qualifications are. and im afraid to kinda know but lay it on me if you ever heard of the company. its in the Bay Area, CA. EBMUD

I do have a RESUME. But again, i mostly tried just kinda describing myself in good and positive ways. I mentioned Restaurant management experience.

**My main questions and worries:**  
do i even have a chance at internships, small companies, with my skillset and stuff I know and did? (I do exaggerate on the resume to look better.) I just really need my first internship.

What other options are there for me at finding a job if I graduated with this degree and got my license too as an engineer by passing the exam? (Btw is that exam hard?) the PE exam or something

Is simply, the engineering degree, from a well known engineering school amongst companies and firms( CAL POLY POMONA), enough to land me a job at other places in business or something? A job that can still pay 50-60k?

If my only shot is getting internships, pls let me know what I can do realistically and easily to just get my first internship. Again, I dont mind working the job. I get the importance of it. and I guess it wont be something I necessarily hate. So again, I wont drop it. Dont tell me to drop it because i am not passionate about it.

B) Optimizing how much variance a Company needs at a given time. Rather than just aim for 3.4 defects per million units, a business may desire to increase variance in some processes and reduce variance in others. But at what magnitude should the component variances change for overall optimal growth and expansion? How do you design experiments to hypothesize and determine the ideal direction and magnitude of changes to process variance?

For example, imagine a business transitioning back and forth between two quantitative phases: i) the controlled increase of variance to encourage priorities like innovation and ii) the reduction to a predetermined variance to regularly standardize products, benchmark growth and refresh a business's potential for expansion.

5,"Was given a challenge question for a job, wondering if I am on the right path to find a solution?",1552116797,"So i was given a challenge question regarding conjunction between a satellite and a space debris for a job. The detail is as followed:

    You receive a notice that your satellite will be experiencing a conjunction with a large piece of debris. The closest approach is reported as being 72hrs away, at a distance of 100m and a probability of 0.5%. 12hrs later, you receive another notification that reports the conjunction at the same time, but at a distance of 50m and a probability of 1%. Consider the following:
    a. The debris is randomly tumbling.
    b. Your satellite is performing scheduled operations.
    c. Your satellite is not uniform in its geometry.

So the question asks what I would do in two cases, one if my satellite has limited propulsion or no propulsion capacity at all.  So I went back through my notes and read up on a few papers regarding probabilities of conjunction. It seems it common that conjunction analysis is run multiple times over the whole orbit before any decision on maneuverability is taken. Since there is no specific information of spacecraft orbit and debris orbit or there geometry I cannot really use any collision probability formula I found (I would need more detail). This seems like more of a conceptual question right? Now based on my understanding it seems that the first report showed the closest approach at 100m which would happen in a period of 72 hours, them 12 hours in the closest approach is shown to be 1/2 of the original so 50m. The probability is still low with the initial probability of 0.5% and a new probability of 1%. Now without more details I cannot find the exact maneuver needed.  I was thinking that since it seems every 12hrs the closest approach would seem to be 1/2 with the probability of collision being compounded on each other (so 0.5, 1, 2, 4 etc.) Assuming no changes to orbit collision would  be imminent by the 72 hour frame. So I am assuming you would want to do some maneuvers such as using the propulsion system to move laterally to change orbit slightly or if you don't have propulsion capability use the internal momentum wheels to rotate to the side with least area to minimize collision. Am I going the right direction? If not what am I missing per say? Anyone have any reading I could look at that might help me here?

11,"Working my first ""engineering"" job while still in school full-time (need general advice)",1552096930,"I have the opportunity to do some very basic engineering work (almost all drafting, communicating with suppliers, etc.) with a small startup in a semi-rural area. I am still in school (3rd year, but should be 4th and no internships or practical experience). 

The (half) owner of the two-man company is a family friend, and I initially got the job by offering to draft some components for fun. They liked the mock-ups I did, and offered to hire me on this basis. Most of the work will be extremely easy compared to what I've done in school, and I am still working on a student copy of SolidWorks (None of the models I have made have been used in manufacturing whatsoever, and I am going to remodel all of the parts in Fusion360 on an entrepreneur license starting today). 

Given all of this, I have simply asked that they provide me a with a glowing reference as remuneration. I am fairly certain that they will insist on paying me \*something\*, but **I expect nothing**, and will not be upset if they are unable or unwilling. I went into the project assuming that I was getting nothing in return, and, at this point, I am very happy to have an ""engineering"" job on my resume at all. 

The operation in its current form is extremely crude. All of the manufacturing is done by hand with consumer-grade power tools, and the parts are not standardized (this is my job). However--even with all the faults--the product seems to be in high demand (significant backorders with no marketing or even website) and the profit margins are around 200%. With just the CAD models I am working on (which I can use to outsource fabrication) I can already reduce both material costs by a significant amount, and manufacturing time (per assembly) by at least 50%. 

To me, this seems like an incredible opportunity! BUT, I know that I'm naive, which is precisely why I'm writing this post. I'd like to know what I am missing. Are there legal concerns with any of what I'm doing? Is it even ethical to call this an engineering job? Should I incorporate as an independent contractor or is this more trouble than its worth?

I know technically Purdue is ranked the highest of them all for graduate engineering so it would make sense if it had the best course quality but it is not a huge name and I feel like the other 3 would be chosen over Purdue becuase of their reputation and prestige.

 Columbia has the Ivy league tag and is the most prestigious but I'm not sure if this applies to its graduate engineering program.

45,Advice for an electrical engineer taking Civil PE exam,1552060855,"**Any advice on classes to take or any strategy to tackle the PE Civil (construction depth) exam when I am a recent grad electrical engineer?** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit background to how I'm in this path: 

I got an internship at a Civil engineering company during my electrical engineering undergrad. My main job was to help out with some programming stuffs. But while I was there, I also got to help out with some inspection and civil engineering stuffs and I happen to like it so I decided to expand my knowledge and my option to civil engineering as well. 

After I graduate in 2018, I got the offer to work full time there, the programming job is still going on but at the same time I'm working with bridge engineers. I want to take the PE civil engineer to go further in this business and also making myself more valuable. 

I receive help and advice from a lot of fellow civil engineers but since my background is electrical, it seems a bit overwhelming to tackle down the PE. Some people say Geotech or Transportation depth are easier to take but I find construction more interesting and a lot more related to the work that I've been exposed to. 

My initial strategy was to scan over the practice test to see what I'm looking at, but I got overwhelmed after the first page. So that's a bad strategy. 

I changed the strategy to watching lectures from classes as if I'm completing a civil engineering bachelor's degree. I started 2 months ago and I'm almost done with a structural analysis course. I think this strategy makes sense but it could take a lot of time.   


&amp;#x200B;

**My questions:**

1-  So do you have any advice for me? Have you taken a PE exam for the discipline that you didn't major in? How did you manage? 

2 - If you think my strategy of ""taking"" the courses as if I'm going back to school for another civil engineering BS degree, do you have any advice on what courses to take? How I can combine and save time? 

(I've looked into some school's civil engineering undergrad program to see what classes I should ""take"" - that's another overwhelming factor. ) 

3 - How do I find out what course relate to what topic on the NCEES exam specification? 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* I understand this might be a bad decision regarding compensation - electrical engineers might make more money, some of my friends already prove that. However, I like this path that I'm taking, so I hope you guys could help me find the best strategy to study for the PE exam.

47,YOU WOULD BE SAVING A LIFE IF YOU TOOK THE TIME.,1552055037,"Hi, I am currently a civil engineer. Third year into it. I go to a polytechnic school called Cal Poly Pomona. I would like to give my situation and current worries.

&amp;#x200B;

***(DISCLAIMER: PLEASE NO TOXICITY OR NEGATIVITY)(Please don't get mad at me for my current situation)***

&amp;#x200B;

**Basically,** I just need a job out of college that will help me be financially independent. I am studying civil engineering environmental option. My school is well known for producing engineers so companies stay in very close contact with my school and often recruit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Heres the catch**, I never really had that much of an interest in the field and I went through personal obstacles in my life. This all affected my GPA. It was good until recently. Now it is a 2.75. And it might go lower depending on how I do this semester. I am still dealing with these personal issues however I am trying my best. Midterms are coming up so I will study my ass off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anyways,** Well, my parents are urging me to find an internship so that I can eventually get a job. All my parents want for me and all I want for myself too is to be financially independent, using this degree from this polytechnic school. 

TO BE REAL: I actually love music production and I will do it till the day I die. Never stop producing and honing and perfecting the craft. However, It will have to be something I dedicate the majority of my FREE time to, which I am completely fine with because I love it.

&amp;#x200B;

**So,** thats why I just need to be financially independent and not a starving musician. And Please Do not tell me to quit this major or school work shit. I am not dropping out. Thats not an option. I understand the importance of Financial stability and school in general. I respect school. AND I RESPECT the fact that I will need a job. So I might as well get a decent job with this degree.

&amp;#x200B;

***So more info on me: prob bad info but im being honest***

Ive taken AUTOCAD classes. Not that good at it. I am prob rusty now too. 

I don't really have any projects or any activities under my belt. I am a part of ASCE. but not really active. 

GPA is 2.75. i will try to raise it. i am taking only two classes this semester due to personal reasons. but i WILL do my best.

&amp;#x200B;

My neighbor that my parents know actually brought up me interning at EBMUD. But idk what the qualifications are. and im afraid to kinda know but lay it on me if you ever heard of the company. its in the Bay Area, CA. EBMUD

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a RESUME. But again, i mostly tried just kinda describing myself in good and positive ways. I mentioned Restaurant management experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**My main questions and worries:**  
do i even have a chance at internships, small companies, with my skillset and stuff I know and did? (I do exaggerate on the resume to look better.)  I just really need my first internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

What other options are there for me at finding a job if I graduated with this degree and got my license too as an engineer by passing the exam? (Btw is that exam hard?) the PE exam or something

&amp;#x200B;

Is simply, the engineering degree, from a well known engineering school amongst companies and firms( CAL POLY POMONA), enough to land me a job at other places in business or something? A job that can still pay 50-60k? 

&amp;#x200B;

If my only shot is getting internships, pls let me know what I can do realistically and easily to just get my first internship. Again, I dont mind working the job. I get the importance of it. and I guess it wont be something I necessarily hate. So again, I wont drop it. Dont tell me to drop it because i am not passionate about it. I get that part but I do have a real passion in plan and it requires a safe source of income which is this.

&amp;#x200B;

49,Can the floor of a school bus be replaced with wooden framing?,1552048314,"I am converting a used school bus to an RV and a portion of the existing floor is severely corroded and needs to be replaced. The original floor consists of folded 16ga steel sheets with additional stiffener channels on the bottom, with these sections welded together end-to-end and resting directly on top of the two C-beams of the bus chassis [this video shows how the floor is constructed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=SBcUnUCbEsg#t=3m8s) (this is actually the exact make and model of my bus that they're building).

On the outer edges of this floor two steel pieces (they're a sort of beam without flanges) about 10"" high run front to back (this part is not really shown in the linked video or Part 2) and are supported from underneath by the outside edges of the floor. The ribs (or ""channels"") that form the walls and the ceiling are welded to the outside of this piece (incidentally the out side of the seats are bolted to the tops of these pieces so they're often called the ""chair rail"" although they're more important structurally than just holding up the seats).

On my bus, unfortunately, the floor section around the wheel wells is severely corroded ([pics](https://imgur.com/a/yisoA9i) remember to cover your childrens' eyes). Rust in this area is a common problem in school buses but this is a very severe example. The normal solution to this problem in the skoolie world is to sell the bus to someone who doesn't know any better and start over, but I want to at least try to do something about this as an experiment.

Some skoolie owners who have faced this problem have rebuilt the floor with a 3"" steel tube frame covered with sheet metal welded on (3"" is about the height of the original floor so this brings it back to the same level). For reasons I'll mention below, I want to do the same thing except using pressure-treated wood. I would essentially remove the existing floor and run 4x4 beams from side-to-side just in front of and behind the wheel wells themselves and then another pair at the edges (front and back) of the wheel well floor panel, so the section (about 6' total) would be supported by four 4x4s that start underneath the chair rail on one side and run to the underside of the chair rail on the other side (so that these 4x4s would be sharing in the load of the walls and ceiling just like the rest of the floor). I would also frame out the small area between the wheel wells with 2x4s, but this of course would not support the walls the ceiling.

I don't know how to evaluated the bending strength of these existing floors, but would it be comparable to the bending strength of 4x4s space every foot and a half or two feet or so? The reason I want to use wood (instead of steel) here is that I can insulate the wood framing with polyiso foam board, so that in this area I would not have to build an insulated *sub*floor so I would gain an additional 3"" of interior height (I'm 6'1"" in shoes and the difference between a 6' interior height and 6'3"" is enormous).",AskEngineers,False,Garfield-1-23-23,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ayprbb/can_the_floor_of_a_school_bus_be_replaced_with/

The only downside is that the fellowship would pay me 15,000 a year and I feel like I'd get paid more doing research which is about 20$ an hour. My masters tuition is about 4,000 a semester and is still really cheap compared to other universities in the us.

91,Evaluating an offer - job satisfaction vs quality of life,1551967150,"Hi all, I'm struggling with a career crossroads and looking for some unbiased input on the situation.

I took my first and current job out of college about 4 years ago as a test engineer in the elevator industry. I love most aspects of my job. I work with good people, learn everything about cool systems, travel to cool cities, and get a lot of latitude in learning new and sometimes completely unrelated skills. I don't see a 40 year career in this position due to the cap on advancement, but it has been a great experience and one that I'm really struggling with the idea of leaving.

However (long story short), I drive 90 miles (80+ minutes) each way 4 days a week which makes for 14-15 hour days away from home and a massive cost even with an efficient car. After 2 years of doing this and with a now-1 year old daughter at home, it is unsustainable.

I have a potential offer (pending approval) for a pump application engineer position 19 miles (25-30 minutes) from my house with the potential to move much closer. I had a great phone interview with this company a year ago which left me with a very good impression of the company, job, and hiring manager. The catch was they really wanted someone bilingual (Spanish). After a year of searching, I was still (apparently) the top candidate and they decided to relax the requirement. They called me last week for an in person interview which apparently went well on their side. My hold up with the whole thing is that I don't feel like I'll have the breadth of experience I get now, but at the same time I'll have a lot more opportunity to finish my Master's, learn at home, and be with family. No other opportunities have panned out in this area, I was either ghosted or found out I didn't want to work for the company for any price.

Part of me says this is really easy, take the closer job that happens to have better pay and benefits, and enjoy the time I gain with my toddler. The other, selfish part of me hates to give up the job satisfaction I feel here.

92,Three Building Upgrade Recommendations for 2019,1551962674,"  

Building updates bring advantages, for example, lower working costs, a decreased ecological impression, and improved wellbeing. In any case, the best outcomes are possibly accomplished on the off chance that you select updates that are ideal for your property. For example, a vitality proficiency measure that is successful in another building may accomplish poor outcomes in yours, and the other way around. 

You should likewise think about the time when arranging building overhauls: winter isn't the best time to redesign your space warming framework, since you need it operational to keep an appropriate temperature, and the equivalent applies for cooling amid summer. 

This article gives a few building redesign proposals to 2019, considering motivating forces that are as of now accessible, just as patterns in power costs and development.

**Get a professional inspection of your building installations**

[https://www.ny-engineers.com/contact-us](https://www.ny-engineers.com/contact-us)

**1) Solar Power**

With the record low prices of photovoltaic modules, solar power is now among the best building upgrades available. If your property has a suitable area that is not covered by shadows, a solar array can achieve an excellent return on investment.

However, there is a key reason why 2019 is an excellent year to install solar PV systems - this is the last chance to get 30% of the project cost back as a federal tax credit.

· The incentive will be reduced to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021.

· From 2022 onwards, the incentive disappears for residential solar power and is reduced to 10% for commercial solar power.

Although solar panels will continue decreasing in price, the net cost of photovoltaic systems will increase when the 30% federal tax credit is phased out. If your tax burden is not high enough to deduct the full tax credit in one year, you can use any remaining credit the next year!

Consider that the federal tax credit only applies if you own the solar installation, even if you have purchased it with loan financing. You don’t get the benefit if you use a leased photovoltaic array, or if you get solar energy through a Power Purchase Agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Fire Sprinklers**

Many flame episodes stood out as truly newsworthy in 2018, including the Trump Tower fire in April, which devastated a $2.5 million extravagance loft. Albeit various flame episodes were accounted for, some setbacks were maintained a strategic distance from gratitude to the brisk reaction of local groups of fire-fighters. Programmed sprinkler frameworks could have avoided a significant number of the fires revealed in 2018, and therefore they are unequivocally prescribed by flame insurance engineers. 

On the off chance that your building is situated in New York City and secured by Local Law 26, introducing programmed sprinklers isn't a ""prescribed"" assembling redesign, yet rather a lawfully ordered undertaking! 

**3) Energy Efficiency Measures for Air Conditioning Systems**

The US Energy Information Administration predicts that electricity prices in the US will increase by 3% on average during 2019. As you might expect, the highest impact on power bills will be felt during the summer, when buildings rely on air conditioning to keep a suitable indoor temperature.

Since summer is still several months away, now is an excellent chance to get a professional assessment of your air conditioning systems. Performance issues can be corrected, and you can also consider system upgrades to boost efficiency. If electricity prices increase by 3%, any savings achieved with energy efficiency measures will also be 3% higher!

**Conclusion**

A well-designed building upgrade that is suitable for the needs of your building is always a good investment. However, the three suggestions in this article are highly recommended due to conditions that are particular of 2019. The combination of solar power and air conditioning efficiency can greatly reduce your electricity expenses, while automatic fire sprinklers safeguard your property (mandatory for NYC buildings covered by Local Law 26).

My university offers an accelerated masters program, where I can get the masters degree in only one extra year after graduating with a bachelors. The graduate aerospace engineering program is about the same as the undergrad in ranking (around 40/50th in the country). Due to my scholarship at the school, that fifth year would basically cost me nothing.

On the other hand, my experience (2 internships and research with a professor) along with my gpa makes me believe I could get in to a top 10 graduate aerospace program (somewhere like CU Boulder). These programs would cost me considerably more for tuition and housing, but in my opinion much much better at engineering than my current school. I believe I could get into one of these schools.

Is it worth it at all to get a masters degree right after graduation? If so, how important is the reputation of the program? If I could get into one of these top 10 programs, would it be worth the extra cost when compared to attending my current university?

12,Help with DIY Project?,1551914180,"Hi All,

I am trying to create a vertically mounted rotating system similar to a sushi conveyor belt. The idea is to have this system be mounted against a wall vertically and each mounting location (when scaled to size) be able to hold a 50lb piece of equipment that also needs to be plugged into a power source. The equipment will also have data cables. The goal is to have the conveyor system move in either direction around a circular track controlled by the user.

&amp;#x200B;

The major foreseeable issues:

&amp;#x200B;

Power cord management - I have briefly gone over this with a friend of mine who is an electrical engineer and he introduced me to what a slip ring was. Thinking about putting a large slip ring in the middle of the circular track that would allow rotation of the power cables as the conveyor moves back and forth

Data cable management - This would most likely fall under the same issue as the power cables Perhaps just have a modified solution.

Weight - Sushi conveyor belts are not meant to hold weight while mounted vertically as far as I know. The scaled track system will most likely weigh a shit-ton if the track is  trying to support and move around multiple 50lb pieces of equipment.

&amp;#x200B;

14,What to expect on a second interview with the hiring manager?,1551911995,"Hello I tried finding an answer to my question before posting, but I couldn't find helpful information related to this situation. If I missed a post asking this very same thing, I apologize. 

My experience so far has been that a phone interview is usually done by a recruiter or someone in HR, then an interview with a hiring manager/team. In this case, I had the phone interview with the hiring manager 2 weeks ago. The conversation was basically going over things on my resume, education, and questions about experience relating to the position. A few days ago, I was contacted by HR for an onsite interview with the same hiring manager. The interview is out of state and the company is paying for my flight, hotel, and car rental to be there. The email states that the interview duration is only 2 hours, so I doubt I'll be meeting with people other than the hiring manager and maybe someone from HR. I am not sure what to expect if I am interviewing with same person again. Should I expect behavioral questions since I didn't get those during the phone interview? Or perhaps technical questions? Any help would be appreciated.

15,How do I tell an employer that I have a government clearance on my resume?,1551911038,"For obvious reasons, throwaway.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in college and have the privilege of being an undergrad with a government-issued secret clearance for my job, but I'd also like to change jobs soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing as a clearance would make me stand out to government contractors, I would really like to list this on my resume, but I'm not sure how to go about doing that... I wasn't given any paperwork or proof when I was given my clearance, I assume my name and identification are just in some government database somewhere, which can be checked by contractors, but I don't know for sure. And I can't exactly ask about this sort of thing at work, as I don't want to announce my intent to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, how does one cite a clearance on their resume? Or should I not put this on my resume, and tell them in person? 

Would they believe me in either case? As I said, I have no hard proof of being cleared, they'd have to take my word for it, and what good is that? I'm just some 20 year old.

17,"Could a clear, vacuum insulated, glass/polycarbonate roof be built and last?",1551909919,"**TLDR: I was wondering if a small/medium-sized structure/house could have an \[almost\] all-glass roof. Specifically, I'm thinking of a place in the woods that would get cold and see a good deal of snow, like Colorado.**

&amp;#x200B;

OK, first of all, I know this is a flight of fancy. I'm sure that, even if what I'm envisioning could work, it would be prohibitively expensive, but I'm still curious! Second, I'm not at all an engineer or even an engineering student, so I'm sorry if I use any incorrect terminology, or if any of my thoughts below are just dead wrong. Thank you in advance for your input!

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was really thick glass panels, like the stuff they built [Chicago's Skydeck](https://theskydeck.com/) out of. The panels they used are composed of three layers of 0.5"" thick tempered glass, laminated together.

My next thoughts were about weight, impact (hail, tree branches, etc), thermal insulation, and drainage.

As for weight/load, like loads of accumulated snow, I really don't have a clue what material would handle that best between glass, plexiglass, polycarbonate, whatever. Also, glass and polycarbonates seem like very low-friction surfaces to me, so I was wondering if one could get away with just pitching the roof steeply enough that a significant amount of snow could never accumulate? Maybe with some kind of anti-stick coating for extra help?

As for impact, my mind went to bullet resistant glass products. According to the most reliable source out there, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof_glass), glass-clad polycarbonate exists that satisfies UL 752 Level 1, which is three 9mm shots. That seems to me more than enough to withstand probably even severe hail. Although it also raises the thought that whatever type of panels this roof is made of, they will probably need to be replaceable in case they do get cracked.

Finally, thermal insulation. (For this paragraph, I'm just going to say ""glass"" when I mean any type of glass/plexi/poly-whatever product.) Obviously traditional, mechanical insulation methods are out the window, since none of them are transparent (fiberglass insulation, spray-foam, etc). I was thinking of vacuum insulation like a thermos. Roughly, I'm envisioning large (4'x8'?) roofing panels/cells comprised of a sandwich of two thick sheets of glass with some space left between them for the vacuum. Let's say it's a 1"" thick vacuum chamber. They would obviously need to be sealed up around the edges. I'm thinking they would also need some bits inside the vacuum chamber exactly 1"" tall, spaced out every X inches, to keep the sheets of glass from caving in on each other when the air is sucked out. Maybe glass discs, or even wood or metal discs? It would look polka-dotted looking up from inside, but that might be cool. I was also reading that all vacuum insulation systems fail (hopefully slowly over time) eventually, which furthers the idea that these ""cells"" need to be replaceable.

Finally, drainage. How would these cells be assembled together into a roof system, and how could it handle rain? I can picture some kind of steel rafter system creating a grid that the cells could sorta just be dropped/slotted into.. then just flashed at the seams to keep the rain out? Drip edge around the outside edges? Really out of my element here.

I really wasn't sure where to ask this. I found this subreddit and I'm hoping someone can maybe help me.

Basically, I have a list of ID numbers, and an equal amount of blank ID cards. For each ID number, I want to print it onto it's own ID card. 

In terms of logical order:

1. Move current id card under printer

3. Trigger printer to print the print job
4. Move current ID card to success pile
5. Repeat for the remainder of ID cards/ID numbers

Hi, I'm a graduate engineer in the UK and have been working in manufacturing for an international company for the last 9 months. I have had SOME automation experience, but the automation solutions have always been developed by a third party company and I have for the most part been responsible for managing the project and developing assembly fixtures to fit the machine. I have had extremely little to do with developing the machines themselves.

As part of my graduate program, I was given a chance to work abroad at one of our other sites in Romania for three months. Due to the lack of automation in our factory, my manager recommended Romania and specifically to work within the dedicated automation team there to bring some knowledge back. I agreed because I felt that it could benefit my factory in the UK, would benefit me in my career, and I am really interested in learning about the inner workings of automation and its development - not just its effect on production.

However, I have been with the team for 3 days now and I feel completely out of my depth. I have zero experience in developing automation solutions and now I'm feeling it the hard way. I have no experience in electromechanical engineering, PLC programming, industrial robotics etc. At this point it may sound like a really stupid decision to have come to work in a department I have no experience in. When my manager recommended it, I trusted his judgement and naively agreed without looking into what was actually involved.

However, I do have a very keen interest in automation and I have a willingness and enthusiasm to learn as much as I can in these three months. So I was hoping the community here might be able to help me get started.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am new to this forum, however, I am currently three years into my civil engineering degree. My gpa is a 2.75, as I had to deal with personal issues which negatively affected my ability to attend class. Now, since it is my third year, my parents want me to start getting internships; however, Idk if a 2.75 gpa will make the cutoff for getting internships for civil engineering. I heard that after I get experience, people who review you for jobs don't care about GPA. However, I am worried about the threshold. If anyone can just honestly give me some guidance so that I can at least still have a way of landing an internship so that I can get a job after college pls let me know. 

&amp;#x200B;

(also I am writing my resume; however, I dont have any previous internships. I am a part of ASCE and i have taken AUTOCAD and MICROSTATION classes) TIPS on RESUME WOULD BE HELPFUL

&amp;#x200B;

AND CAREER FAIR IS IN TWO DAYS, WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO NETWORK?

&amp;#x200B;

Tbh, more about me. Civil engineering is honestly just okay for me as a major.  Mainly, it is going to help me be financially independent. I am interested in music production and want to take that all the way if I ever do break through. However, until that time, I will be a civil engineer hopefully.  

&amp;#x200B;

I go to Cal Poly Pomona. 

&amp;#x200B;

My option for civil engineering is environmental. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope for some good guidance on what I can do in this specific situation. Pls no rudeness or toxicity. Although there might be passionate engineers here, I am not as passionate. That doesn't mean I won't treat it with respect and focus and work. It is still school after all.

I've recently finished 4 years of university study and now I'll be graduating, along with having to find myself a new job at a movie production company as a mechanical engineer.

Quite nervous about the whole thing, but I've been given an incredible opportunity and I want to make the best of it. But my problem is that I just don't know how. I know that I can do more than just learn how to do my job (Although I do need time to land on my feet ), but I'm at a loss coming with ideas of what I can do.

Some are:

&amp;#x200B;

Interacting with members of other departments to form professional relationships (For networking, moving into another department etc)

Looking for other ""projects"" to work on other than my current work load

Considering certificates or looking for extra training to expand skill set

Hunting for a mentor

&amp;#x200B;

And possibly others. I'm looking to make the absolute most out what I have and I just want to be a sponge - absorb everything and be actively engaged in this opportunity. I do need to set some time aside to learn how to do my job competently, but I can't afford to be complacent.

I’m nervous about going into a new environment after being a student my whole life. I’ve had 3 internships so I somewhat understand how engineering firms operate but having the title of intern vs engineer seems like a big jump despite all that’s separating the positions is me graduating and slightly more knowledge on engineering classes that are probably useless. I just want to be good at my job and not knowing what tasks I’ll need to accomplish makes it hard for me to visualize how it’ll go and if I can do it. So what are your stories from early on in your career? How we’re feeling? Did you have doubts? How much were you expected to know? I want to hear good and the bad. Just want to get a feel for how others handled life as a young engineer and when these feelings of inadequacy go away if you ever had any. Also I’m civil engineering student so responses from civil engineers would be great but responses from all types of engineers would also be great to here from. Despite the jobs being very different it’ll be a technical position nonetheless surrounded by similar emotions going into the job so I’d love to hear. ,AskEngineers,False,monkeyimpulse,/r/AskEngineers/comments/axvcz3/how_was_your_first_day_month_year_and_so_on_as_an/

Making a new thread asking what engineering major you should pick is against the rules and it will be removed. This is to prevent AskEngineers from getting spammed with the same questions every week. Only AFTER you've done your due diligence and come up with specific followup questions should you consider making a new post.

The only exception to this rule is if you're asking about an uncommon major that isn't represented in the annual Work Experience threads.

Finally, if you need to interview an engineer for a school assignment, check the sidebar of AskEngineers under **Resources** for a list of engineers you can contact. r/engineering maintains another list in their sidebar.

## Background

Every year, AskEngineers gets flooded with hundreds of posts by students asking for advice on which engineering major to pick.

To address this problem, the mod team decided way back in 2014 to host a yearly thread to collect the experiences of engineers from various industries. This helps students learn what engineers do at work, and also gives engineers insight into what their counterparts do in other jobs/industries.

If you have any career-related questions, I highly encourage you to post them in the latest [*r/engineering Weekly Career Discussion Thread*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/search?q=flair%3A%22weekly+discussion%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) where engineers will give you advice and feedback on your job hunt if you ask for it. A new one is posted every Monday morning.

The weekly thread is a good place if you:

  * need career advice, feedback on your résumé, or other career-related guidance
  * are asking about salary, job demand, switching industries, etc.
  * are a student asking about engineering majors and/or universities

However, I got to participate in truly ground-breaking nanotech research my first year at the university (2012) and two internships, one in 2013 and 2014 for a petrochem fortune 400 company. I got to be there in a rare turnaround period for an old unit, work on high capital (300,000 and 220,000 dollar) projects working with re-designing RO unit configurations and alternate chemical suppliers. I met the CEO of the entire company and worked with him on safety training implementation, and even got to do some work with operators designing easier, more natural control systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds really great from an employment perspective but this was all 5-6 years ago. I hit a rough time in my life where I  moved back home, became my grandmothers caretaker after her bout with sudden heart failure, and began doubting my abilities. My grades slipped, I lost my full-ride scholarship, and I fell into depression and thought about dropping out. I honestly should have to save my grades but the choice was more clear in hindsight. I at least built a business with my friend and sold it in this time but I doubt that makes up for much in employer's minds as anyone can have a friend say they did that together. 

  
I can explain away my long time to graduate and less than optimal gpa behind closed doors in an interview environment but at a career fair I dont know how to tackle this problem and even moreso dont know if internships and research from 5+ years ago is worth it if it reminds them how long ive been in school or is considered too long ago.

As I understand it, it decreases the safety in rollovers when you alter the way A pillars are made today, but I can’t help but think as someone who has recently started driving that they are absurdly thick and can block your view of literally 1-3 people or even small cars. That seems like a very serious issue I encounter nearly everyday, and the A pillars on my car are quite small compared to what other people (e.g my parents) drive

So my questions really is, will I be able to buy a car with see through/ small A pillars in the next few years? I would buy any car in an instant that could give me the front view I want.

86,Good minors for engineers interested in leadership/management.,1551812874,"This is my first time finding this community, so I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this here, but here it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Computer Science major at Texas A&amp;M, and my friend is an EE major also at TAMU. We are both interested in entrepreneurship and the business side of engineering. We are looking for minors that would help us in the future if we chose to either start a business or if we wanted to veer away from the engineering side to the management side of our industries. 

I would like to get a minor that would give me the tools to know how to start a business and manage financials if I chose to, that would also help me in pursuing management or executive positions at companies if I chose to go down that path.

While I love programming, I don't want to spend my whole career spitting out code for the benefit of my higher-ups if I could advance in the company.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know exactly what I'm looking for. Would a minor in business or a minor in accounting be a good idea? Is there some other minor that would do me better?

We've decided to go all-out and work toward vertical takeoff vertical landing. As such, landing legs are part of our design. Here's a rough [SolidWorks model](https://imgur.com/a/VZ8PuUa). I'll be using shear pins to attach the legs to the disk in the center. The disk will be attached to the nose cone, and, when we pop the top, the cord will yank the disk upward, shearing the pins and allowing the legs to fall.

I've been trying to figure out how to lock the legs open, and the idea that's sticking with me the most is using springs popped over center that, when pushed outward, will then swing the legs downward and keep them in the open position. This is also idea, because the springs will absorb some of the shock from landing.

31,Very basic statistics problem (Z score calculation). Disagreeement over exam solution.,1551739997,"https://imgur.com/a/325andK

So this was my solution to an exam problem. The answer on the solution guide was something like 49% (don’t remember exact value). As you can see marked on the paper, the difference between those 2 values is whether or not you divide the standard deviation by sqrt(sample size) when calculating the lower Z score.

I didn’t divide by that because my strategy was to calculate the chance that a SINGLE object was in spec and apply that value as the answer (proportion of objects in spec).

So I’m here for a second opinion. If there is a consensus that I am wrong, I will drop it. If there is a consensus that I am right, I will bring this thread to my professor during office hours.

33,Object tracking problem that likely has no technical solution,1551736359,"Hi all, 

I've been tasked with finding a technical solution to a problem where one doesn't likely exist, and I'm hoping for some input from folks who know more than me.

&amp;#x200B;

My company manufactures and sells mobile equipment (engine-powered machines that people use outdoors). We've sold direct to consumers for years. My boss has expressed interest in getting one of our products into tool rental outfits (like Sunbelt, Taylor Rental, etc), but focused on smaller Mom 'n' Pop operations. For some business-related purpose, he wants to GIVE the equipment to the rental outfit, then have us get a cut whenever the rental outfit rents out the equipment.  The rub is this: The rental outfit could just as easily rent out our machine, not tell us, and keep the full charge. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's become my problem to imagine a tamper-proof system to track the rental traffic of the machine. I think this is either impossible, or infeasible for the following reasons: 

1. Tracking the machine's location is important, not it's actual use. This invalidates the idea of a tamper-proof hour meter. 
2. The machine does not require electrical power (either plugged into the wall, or from a battery). It DOES feature a 12V battery used to start the engine, but can also be pull-started with the battery disconnected
3. The machine is not outfitted for any ""smart"" functions or network connectivity. Rental agencies are unlikely to have their own private wifi network. 
4. The machine is used and may be stored outdoors. Dust, water, vibrations, and shockloads are all expected. 
5. Discretion is key here. The boss imagines a ""tattle-tale"" box that phones home at discrete intervals with its location. This is supposed to be a way to keep rental outfits from being dishonest. The solution should either be well hidden/ undetectable or otherwise tamper-proof/ tamper evident. 

Can anyone point me in the direction of a technology that seems applicable here? Or, a non-technical solution? Is this a total non-starter, technically feasible but expensive, or other?",AskEngineers,False,Enginerding_Throw,/r/AskEngineers/comments/axcxbn/object_tracking_problem_that_likely_has_no/

42,Career Advice from current Engineers/ Technicians,1551726554,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello, Engineers and future engineers, I have a question for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

First a little about myself, I am currently about to graduate in around 9 months with an Engineering Degree in field of Mechanical Engineering, my GPA isn't that great, may be lucky enough to boost it to 3.0 Overall. 

I'm also currently doing an internship in a large company (Con Edison) which I consider myself fortunate to have landed, the pay is really good and it's very goof experience on my resume, but this is a very boring job, my resposeabilities mainly lay on updating Excel sheets of work that is being performed to be reviewed on weekly meetings. So I just sit here, updating the Excel sheets, a work that can be done by a High School student in 3 hours, stretching the job into 30 anyway I can, usually reading Wikipedia.

In general people probably think I hate them or something, because I just come to work, and sit here in the cubicle doing the work without talking to anyone, in reality, that's what you get when you combine an introvert and a workoholic in a confined space =D. The only time I act like myself is when I have some sort of adrenaline rush, the one I experienced at any labor jobs such as contruction or store stocker.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, ending my rant, I would like to ask someone for advice, and who's better than current engineers. 

After extended research in my free time, time I have a lot of =D , I have assed my options. and was wondering.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Are Technician jobs easier to get in with an Engineering degree?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Is there a good prospect of growth from Technician jobs? (I don't mind starting at the pay that is much below engineering entry level pay, but I want to know I have a prospect of earning good money doing what I like)

&amp;#x200B;

3. Do labor union jobs have any prospect of growth, or at least have some sort of value on a resume?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I choose engineering aside from perhaps of course from family history, it's because I wanted to both know how things operate/ have to be designed and be able to do it myself. Rather than telling a technician how it needs to be made and then harass them by checking how it is being implemented. Hence my goal is to be a person who is given an assignment to be performed but can also recommend what can be done in a particular scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who faced such career decisions would really appreciate an advice. Thank You.

Now beause of statistics this spectrum obviously contains higher and lower waves. Suppose I want to artificially add a ""freak wave"" to this spectrum on a known position, how do I go about that?

Say I have Hs = 4.5m, Te = 10s, do I just add a sine that is zero except for one phase which I drop somewhere in the timeline and add to the force? How do I go about the other waves, do I have to correct the wave seed so all other (40) ave components will decrease a bit as to maintain the energy level in the spectrum?

This Eg causes a current If0 = Eg0/Rf to flow through the field.

I don't know the equation for flux, but I'm assuming it's directly proportional to If0. This If creates a new flux Φ0. I also don't know how the magnetic flux ""adds"" or ""multiples"" but I'm assuming Φ0&gt;Φres.

The flux Φ0 being cut creates a new Eg1 = kΦ0N which is obviously &gt; Eg0. (Φ0&gt;Φres).

I'm the production director of a small-medium size OEM. We cut metal in pretty much every way there is, but we don't form it in any. I'm looking in to the possibility of adding forging to our processes. We make a lot of gears and other highly stressed components and we use forgings where we can. We make maybe \~400pcs per year and component, but ´we make hundreds of components. We have everything i believe we need in machine tools from a large 5 axis precision bed mill to an edm and everything in between. We don't have heat treat in house, but that's pretty much what we've not got in order to start making tools. We will be adding heat treat in the future, and we're just now installing a microhardness tester that we can use to analyse microstructure. We are open to buying a microscope, too, since we already took the cost for the sample prep eq.

Our goal is to be able to forge near net shape gear blanks, that is gear blanks where most of the tooth is already formed. We are then planning to finish machine it with skiving in a mill-turn lathe or when higher tolerances are necessary ( tbh, all the time in our case ) grinding in a universal grinding center that will do both the gear grinding and the grinding of the bearing surfaces etc.

66,"Being out of engineering work has really got me second guessing my life choices, any advice?",1551692099,"Hello fellow engineers,

&amp;#x200B;

You may have seen me post before, I'm still looking for some advice. To preface my situation, I graduate back in 2016 (June) in Aerospace Engineering (yes a very specialized degree for bachelors level) from a Canadian University. After graduation I had some issues landing a job (at that point I didn't know what type of jobs I wanted to or apply for and I was just excited to be done, took 6 year instead of 4 due to bad financial situations and failing classes in 3rd year and breaking my ankle in 4th year). So I spent most of my time just doing other jobs, now I am working in risk management but I am bored out of my mind and need something more mentally stimulating. So I started applying again full time now seriously (say from last Oct 2018). I have have gone to online resume workshops, learned to tailor my resume to pass some of the ATS systems and such. I have been doing some research and figured out that I should still be applying to positions even if they require 2-5 years as that is the target for desired employee. I also figured out that i find myself mostly reading up on simulation and analysis aspect of engineering (I have been reading up on interesting CFD/FEA work in both engineering and science fields and would love to some day work on that)  so I thought I should focus mostly on those types of jobs. I am definitely still interested in the design aspect (I enjoyed my capstone project designing payload for a satellite) and even the management aspect (thanks to some experience working in risk management and managing clients). 

&amp;#x200B;

However I haven't really been getting replies, I have applied to around 320 positions where I only got back maybe 30 declines, two interviews and that is it. And I haven't really seen any more entry to junior level jobs in the aerospace sector at all, I even started targeting mechanical and software jobs in aerospace or civil companies. Its been really getting to me now that I am coming up to 3 years out of school. So I am questioning my decisions. Am I screwed? What can I do differently? How would you say I should go about building experience to finally build up to a dream job or something interesting? I know one of my disadvantages is not having any direct experience and/or lack of it, so how would you suggest I go about convincing any potential employers to higher me? Any advice on how to better target positions (I have been using job alerts from different sites such as indeed, glassdoor, eulata, linkedIN, etc.)? As a junior engineer with only an aerospace degree, what other types of jobs can I target outside of mechanical, system, avionics, technician jobs? And finally I have seen some post regarding pidgeonholing in positions that hire degreed engineers as technicians, how big of an issue is that really? Should I be worried?

Due to a series of events I ended up in a position of an electronics engineer for a well known company and then again being picked up by a bigger organization. Both recruited me due to my knowledge and reputation for solving complex problems and a tenacity to learn.

My current position pays well, but I cannot be considered for leadership positions without at least a master's degree, per the chief engineer.

I am a contractor and I am working on a dam in order to replace large flow control gates on the dam.  In order to replace them, I must install a large siphon to maintain the flow of the river downstream while bypassing the inlet and outlet structure of the dam.  I will be hiring an engineering firm to finalize the design, however as a brain busting exercise, I would like to know if I am thinking of the siphon the correct way. 

Another way to phrase my question is this: If the lake level is 100' and the current outlet is 0', then the current head pressure on the outlet is 100' of column; 43.3 PSI.  (100' x .433 psi).  The current gate covers a 60"" pipe, therefore the current river's flow is determined by the lake level head pressure pushing the water through a 60"" opening.  Let's say the top of the dam is 30' high (130') and I will run a 60"" pipe from the lake with a check valve on the lake side, a gate valve on the riverbed side (at elevation 0') and a valve at the crest of the pipe for filling and priming the siphon.  Once the siphon pipe is totally full from the fill point, the water pushes against the check valve on the lake side and is stopped by the closed gate valve at the river side, the fill valve will be closed and the system will be hydraulically locked. In order to begin the siphon, we will open the gate vale at the river and the velocity of the water should be determined by how far open the gate valve is.  Once fully open, the 60"" pipe should be siphoning water from the lake.  Since the discharge of the siphon is at the same elevation of the discharge of the dam and the lake is still at 100', will this siphon discharge water at the same rate / velocity as the dam when it is just coming thru the dam's gate?

7,How do I deal with racist coworkers?,1551638845,"Sorry if this isn't engineering-specific enough, but it's been bothering me a lot recently.

I've been working at my first engineering job out of college for a little over a year now, in a product design role at a small (~60 people) company. I enjoy what I do, and everyone at work seems to really like and appreciate me, but the longer I've been here the more some of them have revealed their truer character and I'm increasingly less comfortable with it.

Essentially, as some of the Old Guard in the company have warmed up to me, they've started dropping their guard around me about racist views that they hold, as I guess they've come to see me as ""safe"" since I'm the same ethnicity and am friendly with them in the office. So they make passing (yet oblique - never so direct as to be ""*the* incident that crosses a line) racial comments in the office now when certain people aren't around, often about Hispanic and Vietnamese people (of which our assembly line employees are primarily composed), which I in my cowardice try to deflect and then do my best to disengage from the conversation. There was also an incident where, coming back from a bar after a work outing, one of them went on an unprovoked rant about the Black Lives Matter movement that I would rather not repeat. Not related to the racism, homophobia is also shared by a lot of the same individuals.

All of this has got me questioning if I'm implicitly supporting this behavior by working there and saying nothing, and also has made me second-guess my value as an engineer - are people pleased with my performance because I'm good at what I do, or are they just happy they've filled my job with what they see as the ""correct"" kind of person? Did I take the job of a more deserving applicant because I happen to be white? I can't report anything to HR because HR is just one person, who even if they agreed with me would immediately be overridden if they told the company owner something negative about their favorite managers. There's also the ""frog boiling"" aspect of it, where there is no one ""incident"" to report but rather a slow and steady ramping up where each offense is just a tiny step over the line each time, such that each moment in a vacuum seems minor but in aggregate they all add up to a very worrying trend. 

How do I deal with a work environment like this? I don't think the fact that I enjoy my specific job should be enough to force me to tolerate this kind of office atmosphere and culture, but I'm also afraid to leave because I'm still so fresh out of school and not confident that I'l be able to find and excel at different job.",AskEngineers,False,ImmediatePackage4,/r/AskEngineers/comments/awx1ho/how_do_i_deal_with_racist_coworkers/

10,How do I find a 15 psi cracking pressure check valve?,1551637448,"Hello,

I’m building a trough parabolic solar heater that needs to create low pressure water vapor and draw new water into it from up to 20 feet below. I’m looking to do it with a series of check valves that ensure that the heated water moves in one direction without need for a pump. 

The 15 psi serves two purposes: more than enough pressure to draw water up 20 feet, and enough pressure to ensure that, once water vapor forms, it maintains enough pressure to keep the water vapor at 215° F as would be typical from a off the shelf low pressure, natural gas powered, steam boiler.

Can anyone help me find an appropriate threaded check valve? I’m only currently able to find a valves with a nominal cracking pressure of ~8-10 psi. As I said I’m looking for one with a cracking pressure of 15 psi instead.

11,Looking for design advice for the compressor wheel and housing of a homemade electric supercharger.,1551634406,"So, I’ve recently made a separately excited electric motor (very similar to a brushless motor) out of an scrap alternator, and am powering it with the Turnigy Marine 150 amp ESC, at about 25v.

So, the obvious next step is to turn it into a supercharger ;). I’ve done some research, and it seems like super/turbochargers pretty much all run way above 4k RPMs, which is too fast for my motor.

So, I need to find/build a different compressor wheel and housing, with a larger diameter than a normal turbo/supercharger that will be able to achieve similar pressures at lower RPMs. I also would like such a system to be relatively inexpensive compared to new aftermarket super/turbochargers. 

Do you guys have any ideas? Is there such a thing as a low RPM supercharger? Would a car air conditioning squirrel cage fan survive these RPMs and pressures?  Would it be possible to fabricate one with limited tools (hand tools, drill, angle/bench grinder, jigsaw, welder)?

15,Help wanted: building an automatic rope oiler,1551631237,"I hope this is the right place to ask. I use natural fiber (hemp and jute) rope that needs to periodically be conditioned with mineral oil to prevent it from drying out and becoming weak. Typically I apply mineral oil by hand, then heat the rope to low temperature to distribute the oil from the surface to the inside of the rope. This process is very imprecise as different parts of the rope get different amounts of oil. I want to build a system that would automatically, precisely, and evenly add mineral oil to the rope.

First design I am considering is to have the rope inside a closed container with a heated oil bath and a bubbler. The idea would be that heated oil will get into the air over time and be absorbed by the rope. Questions about this design: how would I begin a rough calculation for the volume of this enclosure, temperature of the oil, and power of the bubbler? Would a fish tank bubbler be able to handle something more viscous than water? How much mineral oil can air hold anyways and how would I measure the absorption rate?

Second design is basically a fine mist sprinkler. I would wind the rope onto a rigid wire rack, then use several nozzles to spray it with oil, forced by something like a fish tank pump. I could presumably control this much easier than the first design but I worry about spraying too much oil. Also this method seems a lot messier and labor intensive as I would need to constantly reload the rope and still need to bake it after, while the former method might work without that. Again, could a fish tank pump handle mineral oil? Would heating the oil help? What size nozzles would produce the optimal mist size for best absorption?

17,Career advice for a ME grad,1551627968,"I am a graduate mechanical engineer (graduated with masters on July 2018) currently in a full time graduate role at a mining processing plant consultancy in Australia since November (3 months). 

I have previous experience in mining technology where I worked as a workshop assistant for a small company (10 months) and some manufacturing experience as well as some small vacation work done (2-3 months each) in hydraulics and research during my studies.

Currently, I am not enjoying my role as the company I work for has a pretty bad work culture, high turnover rate for graduates (mostly because its incredibly underpaid for the shit we have to do and put up with), but most importantly I do not see myself here in the future (already applying for other opportunities). 

I really want to get into a more design based role, specifically product design or mechanical equipment design. I am more passionate about those areas compared to doing feasibility studies, project management and PID drafting / piping modelling at my current job. 

My options are:
1. I have an opportunity to work at the hydraulics company I conducted vacation work for. The pay is MUCH better (we’re talking 35% more) but it’s still not an area I want to be in for the long term. Should I jump ship?

2. Don’t jump ship and stick with my current company until I find an opportunity I like (which is what I am currently doing).

3. I have applied for a role at a bigger company with a well known graduate program and a great work culture. I am family friends with one of the principal engineers there so I think I have a good chance to be accepted. The thing is, from what I’ve read, the work is similar to what I am doing now (piping, some mining stuff - material transport) so I may not want to be there in the long run.

based on this information, do you think you can actually beat the codes, and smooth out the signal downstream on a post catalytic converter o2 sensor 

For the sake of argument lets assume this is for an off road only vehichle in a state with no emissions laws so emissions laws are not even a concern, it's an older vehichle but it still has an ECU and OBD2 port, and for our purposes it's for off roading only, and the catalytic converters were removed at the junkyard, and it now has straight pipes, except for where the o2 sensor bungs were located. 

The upstream o2 sensors are pre cat, and only there to tell the ECU what is going on with the lambda readings (stoichiometric air fuel ration)

The downstream o2 sensors are narrow band, and they are only there to tell the ECU that the cats are catting. 

The sensor readings are varying from .1v to .7v on about a 3 second time 

so using (resistance in ohms) * (capacitance in Mohms) = time  

I get ( 4.7uF)*(.690Mohm)=(3.243 sec low pass)

I made a throwaway because my little brother knows my account, and I don't want him to know how I feel and I don't want to discourage him since he will be an engineering student this fall. I also posted in the weekly career threads, but they don't seem to get much traffic.

I'm currently at a point in my career where I feel completely stuck because of the path I have taken since graduation and the experience i have gained, and my problem is I don't know what to do to change it because I""m not sure what what is possible.

Some background on myself: Graduated 2013 with a degree in ME. Located in northeastern USA. My GPA was a 2.7 and I failed to get any internship/co-op experience while in school. I did develop depression issues starting the spring semester of my junior year, and that really messed up my studies and overall life . My last three semesters (one extra 12 credit super semester) I barely got above a 2.0 GPA because I struggled so much with my depression. I was on pace to keep above a 3.0, but obviously this didn't happen and my internship search was pretty weak and unmotivated. Alas, this is where I am and nothing I can do about it at this point, but I want to know what I can do today to change my career.

My experience involves 4.5 years of being an environmental regulator with the title of Environmental Engineer at the State level. Half of my experience comes from site cleanups, which includes reviews of remedial phase documents, and the other half comes from the States water supply division where I am a compliance manager for public water systems. I didn't mind site remediation from the public side, but the private side doesn't really interest me.

Here are two paths I would like to go down:

1. I do enjoy the water resources side of things, and would be interested getting into this work in the private sector. The problem is, I'm not sure what types of water resource careers I would be qualified for. Many of the positions I see posted with engineering firms ask for an Environmental/Civil degree (when I'm a MechE) and they look for experience with storm-water, hydrology, hydraulics, etc, which I do not have since my focus is drinking water. I see some positions out there that take MEs when it is water/waster related, but not as often. I also have very little actual engineering experience where a couple of jobs have turned me down for it unfortunately. I also need to pass the EIT which is a concern. With enough resources I should be able to pass it, and fortunately I have the time to study and prepare for it with my current job's work life balance, but until I pass it I feel like it will hurt my employment opportunities.
2. On the other side, I wonder if it would be possible to go back into the ME direction with absolutely no real world mechanical engineering experience besides what I did in school (FSAE). I feel like my resume would just be thrown in the trash for any entry level ME position. Has anyone made a huge transition in engineering disciplines during their career? I always wanted to get into design, and I'm not too particular on certain industries.

For #1 above, does anyone have any tips to help me become more marketable for a water resources job? Maybe some software out there I could learn? Classes? etc.

TL;DR: Two things

I'd like to prepare by brushing up on my knowledge that will be required for any calcs. What kinds of factors are there to consider for the conveyor system design?

Here's what I'm thinking so far:

* Product info of what's going to be transported on the system: weight, size, of product. Other properties as well (perishable goods, food items requiring clean environment) 

* speed at which they need to have items moved from point A to point B. Then calculate the tangential Velocity of the drive roller to determine belt speed. 

* use product weight to spec out bearings for rollers

* required belt material for particular product, will change tension and may require adjustments in design of slack take out (whatever it is called that picks up the slack underneath the system)

* Determining the optimal size of the rollers vs motor and gearbox, find optimal balance. 

* determining the size and spacing of idle rollers along the conveyor

* knowing the product type, I'd probably need to do basic statics to figure how steep I can make inclines. 

Not sure what else I'm missing. Overall, it sounds relatively simple. But I want to thumb through my old machine design book to get re-familiarized with some calcs that they may ask me to do at the interview.

I'm considering going back to university get a bachelors in mechanical engineering (or aerospace engineering, open for discussion). My question to you is how long approximately would this take? I know getting a second degree is usually a shorter process than the first because a lot of the GE's are out of the way, but business and engineering are such different fields. 

On top of that, I am a full time pilot and don't particularly care to halt my career, so I'm wondering if the two can be done simultaneously.

When we calculate the thrust force of a jet engine or a rocket, we usually consider the change of momentum for the incoming and outgoing masses and the pressure difference at the front and back, but we never talk about which part of the engine is passing that force. Obviously the base of the engine has to pass that force to the fuselage or main body of the rocket, but which part inside the engine is that force being applied to?

&amp;#x200B;

**About me:** 

* Electrical Engineering student in Canada
* Two previous internships
* Career goal: Embedded Systems. Full system design (schematic/layout PCB design, firmware programming, and testing of the embedded system).
* Initial industry goal: Automation and Robotics, Current industry goal: Open to other options
* In a long-term relationship 

&amp;#x200B;

**Job #1** 

Job/Company Info:

1. Large company (1000+ employees)
2. Industry: Semiconductor
3. Location: 1.5hr commute from home (one-way)
4. Pay: $70,000
5. Duties: System-on-chip design (PCB design, Verilog, FPGA)

Pros:

* Closer to home and therefore gf, friends, and family
* Work is an extension to my previous internship as it offers different and new duties
* Better pay than Job #2
* Enjoyed my interview with the manager, seems to care about the well-being of his engineers and is a good communicator

Cons:

* Industry not as ""exciting and new"" compared to Job #2's industry
* 1.5hr commute one way during rush hour :(

&amp;#x200B;

**Job #2** 

Job/Company Info:

1. Small company (100+ employees), expecting to double in size next year
2. Industry: Warehouse automation, robotics
3. Location: Different province
4. Pay: $55,000
5. Duties: Electrical and software validation (C++, PCB design, Testing)

Pros:

* Relatively new: &lt; 5 years old\*\* (\*\*More opportunities to wear different hats, but job may not be stable because of company infancy)
* Exciting industry and work
* Flexible vacation dates (offer letter mentions flexible vacation policy, but no additional details)

Cons:

* Lower pay, won't be able to save as much
* Different province (slightly lower COL), therefore will require relocation\*\* (\*\*Could be a good thing since I'd like to move out and begin my adult journey)

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, both jobs are great and offers a path towards my career goal of becoming an embedded system expert. Seems to boil down to:  Stability and good pay vs Risk and Passion? Granted $55k is within the expected job market of a new EE grad in Canada, albeit in the lower end.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently taking my first controls engineering class as an undergrad. The work we are doing though, is stuff that is frequently showing up as masters papers online. Examples include self balancing and driving unicycles, autonomous Labyrinth games, and similar projects. The class is very open ended and more of a self paced class, as our professor is emphasizing learning and understanding the material on a working basis, rather than learning it for the next assignment/test and promptly forgetting. But this brings me to my questions:

I have a 5000mAh lipo battery powering the raspberry pi, audio amplifier, and screen. The current when running off of a power cable is 2.2A, but that is also charging the battery at 1000mAh (or it's supposed to be, I think it's charging at a lower rate). When running off only the battery I get a voltage sag of .5A, and drop of .3A across a Schottky diode. I understand the drop across the diode, but should I be seeing that much of a sag at 2.2A (the battery is probably seeing less than that since it's not charging itself)?  [Here is a general idea of the charging circuit I am using](http://www.electrobob.com/5up-simple-5v-ups/), and the diodes are 1N5822's.

Is a .5v voltage sag off a 4.2v battery typical at these currents? Is there anything you would recommend to improve the performance? I haven't yet tested it with another battery, the battery I have is a fairly specific size, but I do have some spare 18650 batteries I could put in a test rig.

94,Arduino IDE for embedded programming at an industrial level?,1551457581,"Hello Reddit. I am fresh to the engineering industry and thus have very little experience regarding how things are done. From my past experience, I have only worked with the STM32 and utilized their standard peripheral library for development, which I assume more industries do as well. However, what about the Arduino language? I see that there is support for hardware such as the Teensy and STM32. 

The reason I have this question is that in my current company, the electrical engineers had initially started off using Arduinos for prototyping, which is fine. As for moving on to production, they proposed using a Teensy instead, but still keeping the use of the Arduino IDE since the Teensy itself is compatible, meaning that they could probably reuse most of their previous code. I have tried pushing for the use of the STM32 (partially due to having experience with it) but even if it were to be adopted, they may also end up using the stm32duino library.

Personally I feel that although usable on these ARM chips, it should still be avoided at the industry level due to overhead, lower performance, lack of full control and also to a certain extend, professionalism. However,  seeing that everything is working fine in the current state, I do not have an argument as to why the Arduino language and IDE itself should not be used. I would definitely like to hear any opinions or experiences regarding this aspect. Is there anything inherently wrong with this or are others in the industry doing it too?

* Air velocity and temperature (something like [this](https://www.dwyer-inst.com/Product/TestEquipment/HVACBalancingInstruments/SeriesAP2?Query=AP2), which I thought was great at first but my management as come back asking for a max range of \~1000 ^(\*)F)
