1,Graduating BSME and can't find a job,1559008530,"Hello guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm graduating from UC Irvine in less then 2 weeks with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and I've had no luck with job applications. I've been applying online for 5 months now and I can't seem to get any call backs. I've applied to hundreds of applicaitons in many different fields, but whatever I try, seems like no one is interested. The constant rejection is very disheartening and it feels like I waisted four years of my life. I've a 3.4 GPA, internship experience, school project experience. So many jobs I've applied too I've met the basic and desired qualifications, but still I constantly get rejected. I've tried using key words in my resume, applied to everyplace that I can, I've had my resume and cover letter revised multiple times, but still can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I'll be moving back home in less then a month and I'm worried it's only going to get harder when I'm farther away from my engineering peers. If you have any advice, methods, recommendations or can help me get my foot in the door in anyway I would greatly appreciate it",AskEngineers,False,Eazy_Rep,/r/AskEngineers/comments/btu8vl/graduating_bsme_and_cant_find_a_job/

3,keep going solo or join up with a larger engineering firm? career advice.,1559007162,"i apologize for the lake of directness about this post but i feel it important to represent my position more comprehensively:

I’m kind of haunted by what my Engineering tutor told me “don’t let your talents go to waste” and I’m not too sure what to do with my career.   

He asked “what do you want to do with your degree?” I said “I want to make props” like high end Electromechanical props; I figured it would be a combination of different and interesting work, the kind needing unorthodox solutions to unusual problems. One where I could do the design, manufacture, FEA etc. I did a 2 BTEC’s in manufacturing engineering before doing an MEng in mechatronics, I’ve been the sole designer and manufacturer for a couple of features within a couple of projects that were kind of up there 1 for the Saatchi gallery London and another the “Great Exhibition of the North” I completely developed a DMX controlled turret based laminar flow jet system (from CNC milling the fixtures to designing, populating and programing the pcb’s/ user interface) I’m currently making a stroboscopic fountain that overcomes some of shortcomings of existing designs. 

I’ve enjoyed these projects but I can’t shake this insidious feeling that I’m under utilizing my potential. I work completely on my own in middle of nowhere and I’m broke due to 2 years of medical problems inhibiting my work output (resolved mostly now). I’m living hand to mouth and slowly ramping myself back to 12 hour days 5-6 days a week. I don’t think id work well in a company I’m terrible with bureaucracy (I struggle to keep my head down and let the bullets go over the top as my grandad used to say) and at university I always found my own position so badly undermined by peers who didn’t want to contribute or lectures who didn’t care. I like working on my own. Right now I’m expanding my manufacturing capability fixing up an old Bridgeport mill that ill convert to CNC when I have the funds, will be making a CNC plasma cutter as I seem to need to outsource a lot of plasma cutting and who doesn’t want their own CNC plasma cutter?     

Maybe it’s just the grass is greener on the other side but I keep seeing impressive feats of engineering and some very interesting work being done by larger groups and companies. I’m concerned that I’ll end up stagnating and then if I do decide I want to be a part of something larger I will have missed the boat.  I’m not driven by money and I’m stupidly loyal to the point where I’m earning £12.5 per hour with no benefits to a company that can really probably afford more. I enjoy doing every aspect from conception through to production. I do every little part account for everything and when something’s done I know that I took it from just an idea into a functioning prototype.  I don’t feel like that kind of complete autonomy is something you will really find in larger companies but then I wouldn’t really know; I have never had a job interview and never found any job positions that really jumped out at me. 

It’s just every time I see something really cutting edge that niggling “don’t let your talents go to waste” plays itself again in my head. I’m 26 (uk based) and I don’t really know what to do, I’ve just always done what was in front of me. 

I don’t know if it would be best to just carry on doing what I’m doing: slowly accruing more and more capability and finding work where I can or throwing my hat into the ring of a larger firm and find myself more washed out in terms of work and duties.

Do any more seasoned engineers out there have some advice for someone in my predicament?

8,Cutting glass device with a diamond ring,1559002018,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons, keeping secrets from my girlfriend as I prepare to propose. 

I've been working on a design for a diamond engagement ring for my girlfriend which would double as a simple glass cutting tool, and was hoping to get some feedback about the mechanics from an engineering perspective. For context of my experience, I am a sculptor with some experience with building things, machines (3D printers, CNC machining), and I've explored a lot of different materials and have experience with simple CAD drawing. 

Since I know it might sound sort of absurd, there's some symbolism to the idea of making this ring have the ability to function as a tool. Even if it's not realistic she use it on a daily basis, or even more than a few times, I want to make something that actually works and I'll explain that a bit. First of all, my partner is also an artist and one of her primary materials is glass. Over the years it has become kind of a running theme that whenever I get her major gifts, they often turn out to be tools. She gets a kick out of it because it opens up new possibilities in her studio, and I get a kick out of it because it doesn't fall into the standard run of the mill girlfriend gift-giving experience. It's fun to see her excited about getting a Festool power tool and actually using it on a project. 

As I was thinking about what kind of ring to get her, I thought it might be interesting to design something myself and take this idea to another level. I also like the fact that diamonds have these properties in tools and engineering that move beyond being just a pretty looking stone, so I thought of ways I could imbue this ring with that idea. What I landed on is a concept for a ring that could be attached to a circular glass cutting device (the kind with a suction cup). 

I happen to have a friend in the jewelry business and we've collaborated on a design that we think works really well as a standalone ring. Her diamond specialist suggested finding a 'natural' cut which is where the diamond is cut on it's natural fractures, and somewhat stronger than more precision cuts. But she still warned me that a diamond can get damaged if using it to cut glass, so I'm moderating my expectations about how functional this mechanism would really be. It's okay if this only ends up being a symbolic experiment, but the goal would be to cut a few circles out and know they were made with this device, and  the device would be a 'holder' for the ring when she's not wearing it. 

The ring itself is already in the works and not changing, and what I need help figuring out is 1) will this actually work, or am I risking damaging the diamond and 2) what would be the best rotary mechanism to attach the arm to and any other concerns that an engineer would have that I'm not thinking about. Here is a link to a rendering: [https://framapic.org/TbdKfFTh50nt/eY7YY1G4SZBt.jpeg](https://framapic.org/TbdKfFTh50nt/eY7YY1G4SZBt.jpeg)

To explain the ring design: the band is platinum and the interior diameter is 16mm and it has little gold set screws that will allow it to apply pressure on four points of a rod. There was also talk of figuring out a secondary ways to make it attach to a rod with some sort of cuffs, since I'm not sure how much force these gold screws will be able to handle, but I like what they add to the design. 

I have a very simple drawing linked below that only covers the basic components. If anyone knows of a world of components to look at that I might be able to build something like this, I'd appreciate any feedback :)

10,Stuck between two career choices...,1559000458,"I'm at a crossroads in my life where I need to settle down and really decide what I want to do. I'm firmly between two career choices right now, mechanical engineering and software engineering.

Initially wanted to do mechanical engineering because I love designing stuff. I do CAD as a hobby, I like coming up with a design for something in my head and seeing it come to life (I 3D print as well). I want to work somewhere I'm creatively stimulated. I'm very much interested in going into the product design and development field for mechanical engineering.

But I'm also considering software engineering. I don't have quite as much experience with programming as I do with CAD but it kind of satisfies the same creative outlet for me. CS and software engineering is much less intimidating for me because I have friends in that field so I know exactly what goes into finding a job. I also know for a fact that I'd enjoy programming classes much more than statics/dynamics/fluids - and yes I know most ME's don't use that stuff on a daily basis but I'm not sure if the fact I'm dreading that stuff is a bad sign for going into ME in the first place.

Tl;dr - Designing products and physical objects is a lot more attractive to me when compared to designing software, but I know I'd enjoy learning about programming a lot more than the endless grueling physics classes I need for ME. Programming seems to be hot right now and pays really well but ME definitely seems more stable in the long run.

I'm at a point where if I screw up my career choice again I'm boned, would appreciate some opinions or pointers since I know this subreddit is frequented by both software and mechanical engineers",AskEngineers,False,noosesalesman4,/r/AskEngineers/comments/btt0e3/stuck_between_two_career_choices/

13,How often did you make mistakes in your first year as an engineer?,1558994284,"I had an internship two years ago at a quality control lab that was meant to be for 3 months but then I was offered a part time position with school that lasted for another year before I quit.

I was learning a lot but I was also messing quite a bit along the way. Within the lab there was the lab supervisor (who would usually be in the lab every other few weeks because he would fly a lot), the lab manager and me. So I only was able to turn to the lab manager for help most of the time.

As my time went on I noticed myself making a lot of mistakes because a lot of different products would come into the lab and each product requires a different type of test and procedures which means I’d have to learn something new. Then when that product would come back in another two months I’d have to try to remember every or ask my boss again. He eventually got me a notebook to write everything I need to remember in, that’s how much I needed to remember. Sometimes my boss would get angry if I ask about something that I should “already know the answer to”. My internship basically felt like another extremely hard class that I was afraid of failing. Sometimes my boss would tell me that it’s okay to mess up because he’d see how frustrated I’d be once I get lectured on something again. He told me that he’s messed up in every way possible so that gave me some comfort. It was just very annoying to experience all the mess ups and self doubts. Being there felt discouraging and I left with less confidence.

14,Where is the technical work in manufacturing engineering?,1558993387,"I'll start with a simple question and then divulge: Where on the manufacturing side of a factory is there technically challenging engineering work? Assembly? Primary manufacturing? It just depends?...

&amp;#x200B;

To divulge a bit: I'm a BSME senior graduating in December on my third and final internship. My last two were in design and I got very good experience with technical, meaningful projects. This summer however, I took a manufacturing engineering internship with a major heavy equipment manufacturer, and to say the least, I'm very disappointed so far.  


I'm in the ""primaries"" department, meaning we make parts out of raw sheet steel with the use of laser cutting and press brake operations. I thought this experience would be very interesting and, if nothing else, would help me be a better design engineer. It likely will help give a new perspective, but I feel very led on by my recruiters/supervisor. The offer and conversations that followed sounded like the position would include technical work and that I would help implement brand new laser cells featuring a bunch of newer automation technology. Sounds pretty interesting, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

What they didn't tell me is that my supervisor and all the other ""ME's"" in our group don't actually have engineering degrees. This is fine with me, but what I'm concerned about is the lack of technical projects they work on. It really seems like their job is more of just managing the shop floor and fixing issues the floor workers run into. The automation they plan on bringing in to the factory will likely be over a year out, and there isn't much work to do in the meantime regarding that change. So after one week, I haven't been given any meaningful projects and from talking with guys around the office, it doesn't sound like there are any pressing projects for me to get involved with. I will press my supervisor this week for more information on projects and needs of the group, and let it be known that I want to take on responsibility and be challenged.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I'm just really surprised how little ""actual engineering"" work they do, and wonder if things are much different in other manufacturing areas like assembly? At this point I'm just kicking myself for not taking one of the design offers I turned down for this ""diverse experience"". As someone who knows very little on the manufacturing side of things, I would really appreciate some insight on where or if there is more technically challenging and exciting work.

I made it a point to try a little bit of everything before deciding that I love repair welding. Taking something broken and making it like new again, is something I excel in. A majority of my career has been spent on steam path repair (steam turbine). 

At the age of 25, the idea of becoming a metallurgist interested me. Unfortunately non-permanent contract work involves a lot of random shift hours and 7/12s; so college wasn't really an option. 

I got married, had a kid (2nd is due next month) and my wife convinced me to get a full time position as a welding instructor in our home town (12/2017).

So I have a plan set in place to get my AA and into the BS materials science program at University of North Florida.

1. Studying Computer Engineer, first time at college was more than 10 years ago. Came back ~2 years ago, changed to Cp.E and would technically be in my third year (in terms of progress towards my degree.)
2. Honestly had no career plan when I chose the degree, simply a love of everything the course list included (Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Computer Programming, Electronics)
3. Literally no way that I'm going to graduate with a GPA over 2.5, from a top university in the state though.
4. &lt;1 year related work experience (and only in programming/DBA)
5. Eastern US

---

So I've always felt a bit behind, and recently I've been really worried about what to do. I guess I never planned this far, and really felt uncertain that I would even make it as far as I have. I thought I would have more time, but I'm constantly taking the maximum credit hours possible and seem to be on track.

There are just a few problems that really worry me at this point.

1. I honestly have no idea what sort of career I'm even going for at this point. Searching BLS/OES shows that 'Computer Hardware Engineers' have decent options in my area, but I literally have no idea what that entails. I'm not against going into education, but my GPA disqualifies me from taking it as a minor at the moment.
2. Am I too late to consider an internship next summer? I would have ~1 year remaining at that point, and would have covered a large majority of my core classes
3. How bad it is graduating in the situation I am (much older than most students, low GPA, spent much longer on my degree)?
4. Who are the kinds of people I need to talk to so I can get these things in order? I've never been to a school with good resources, but I've been here for a year and literally never been able to see my adviser. 

Sorry for the wall of text and all the questions, but I've just been so worried about getting all these classes done I didn't really consider what I would do with them.",AskEngineers,False,LowerBlood,/r/AskEngineers/comments/btkqte/feeling_far_behind_how_screwed_am_i_and_what_can/

As of now I'm studying to get certified as a EIT, since one of my future goals is to become a PE.

With all that being said, my questions are:
- Is the EIT very beneficial (as to get my firts job) or do companies consider it neutral?
- Are there internships/co-ops post college (I know people that have got some of them, but I juat don't seem to find those)?
- Regarding not having my diploma yet, I could have pay it off but it would had left me literally broke, and would only have done it having secure a job. Having said that, do companies check that as they are going through applicants?

The idea is to, instead of having the electricity do a large jump through the air it would instead do a series of smaller jumps from small metal piece to metal piece, accomplishing the same visual effect.

The centripetal force would be guided below through a cone into a singular downward exhaust (like a helicopter but with the rotary mechanism on the bottom).

41,Water friction question regarding moving water from one larger bucket to smaller bucket with least amount of work,1558938942,"http://imgur.com/gallery/doChicF

As illustrated in the image there is a 1 meter tall bucket with 20 gallons of water inside. At the bottom of the bucket there is a tube measuring 15 cm in length and 2.5 cm in diameter. Attached to that tube is a small hand  pump or syringe(15.25cm w x 25.4 cm L)with 1 gallon of water inside it.

 in this set up the smaller 1 gallon bucket pump must be at the bottom of the 1 meter bucket and can not be lifted.

What I'm trying to accomplish is to get the 1 gallon of water as shown in illustration into the 20 gallon bucket with the least out put force and most efficent way possible. 

I'm willing to do this with or without the pump if there is a better way.  Maybe having the 1 gallon of water in balloon and squeezing that into the 20 gallon bucket will be more efficent? 

I have taken into account the length and especially diameter of tubing. With smaller diameter the work will be significantly more,  

 However I am still confused whether a tube 2.5 cm in diameter with a 15cm length pumped in at the bottom of the 20 gallon bucket would be more efficent than a tube 2.5cm in diameter with a 1 meter length just above water surface. 

On one hand you have a shorter tube with less friction but then it will be pumped In at bottom of bucket with much higher psi. Around 1.5 psi I believe. 
Overmore in longer tube example,  it will avoid the higher psi at bottom of bucket but will add a meter of head and water friction in tube.

Your input on this problem will be much appreciated even if it is not an exact figure,  again I just need to get the the 1 gallon In the 20 gallon bucket (both in same position as illustration) in the most efficent way.  By efficient I mean least amount of work.  Thanks so much for your time",AskEngineers,False,msharif25,/r/AskEngineers/comments/btio8w/water_friction_question_regarding_moving_water/

However, when 2 (200 pound) people are both in hammock chairs, that’s 400 pounds pulling down on this.

The mechanical engineers are always grumbling about how they should have been coders.  The coders are always wistfully grumbling about how the EEs do the hands on ""real engineering"".  The EEs are always dreaming about being on the ground floor of a startup.  The people at a startup are always insecure about their future and wish they went the safe route.  Everyone is always complaining about how they don't get paid enough or how the last raise was shit.  

I've hopped between engineering disciplines, gotten a Master's and worked at small companies, big companies, scientific research labs, etc...

66,I'm a metal artist looking for a wind powered mechanism to wind a clockwork sculpture.,1558883641,"My goal is to make a sculpture much like a wind-chime. I'd like to use a vertical propeller that catches the wind and uses that energy to wind or tension a spring. That spring tension would ""cock"" the striker. Once enough energy is stored I'd like it to automatically ""fire"" the striker against a tubular bell. I am imagining a sort of spring loaded piston that would shoot out and strike the bell just once before being re-wound by the wind. Also, this sculpture would be outside exposed to weather. 

I think my main problem is finding the release mechanism. I can design the correct gear setup and imagine how the spring would be tensioned. But I can't figure how to release it. What I think I'm looking for is a cocking mechanism with an automatic trigger.

Obviously I'm not asking anyone to design this for me. I've come here for your help because I can't seem to find a simple mechanism like this on the internet. 

Also, I have a fully equipped metal art studio. If I need to mill a part or weld that isn't an issue. This is an installation sculpture so I would like to avoid 3d printing for aesthetic reasons. 

So my questions are.. 

1. What are some good resources or examples of this type of mechanism? 

2. How do I ""cock"" the spring and release it such that the spring doesn't spin my propeller in reverse when it is released? (I think that's what cocked means. But if that's not clear; I need the winding mechanism to disengage from the spring once it is cocked) 

3. How do I make this process automatic? I need the machine to automatically trigger once it is fully cocked. 

4. Is there a sort of library of different mechanical gears and mechanisms that I could browse for ideas? 

5. Any additional resources, specifically for learning the proper terminology so I can improve my own Google fu would be greatly appreciated. 

I understand that this question is vague. Hopefully, with your help, I can begin to formalize exactly what it is I'm looking for.

a) the fact that I won’t have to take many humanities requirements (I am not motivated in those classes and will have a miserable time taking them)
b) I enjoy working project based and hands on. I learn by problem solving and doing direct experiments/ working hands on. Understand much better and much more fulfilling
c) generally higher pay than academia.

So basically, if I want a math/science oriented job that’s not a doctor or a researcher/professor, my last option is engineering.
d) I am creative and have a passion for art and design. The creativity of engineering (building things, freedom to thing of new ways to solve problems) is something I can imaging myself loving as well.
I have no experience in robotics or engineering at all.
I took AP calculus BC junior year and AP CS sophomore year. Calculus was difficult but I passed with an A and found it rewarding and satisfying even though I struggled. Computer science was fun, i enjoy it but I also lacked motivation during that time and slacked on a lot of the projects. I also took AP bio junior year which I really enjoyed, the stuff I enjoyed most about it was when we did lab stuff and worked hands on. Was not as into the theoretical stuff. 
Did not take AP physics but took physics regular my freshman year. Hardly remember anything but I did get a good grade and enjoyed the class. Especially enjoyed when we did electrical circuits and stuff. I got to make an arcade game with electrical circuits and I vaguely remember getting pretty into that.  
I really want to do biomedical engineering but my university doesn’t offer that as a first major at my school, I’d have to do one of the main ones (mechanical, electrical, etc) and do bme as second major.
So yeah, do you think this is right for me or do I not have enough experience? Based on what I’ve said do you think I’d enjoy research and academia more? Also which engineering subject should I major in? Rn leaning towards chemical bc it’s the closest to bio, and also I have no idea whether I’d enjoy electrical or mechanical since I don’t have much experience in them.

4,Started at a company - actual job and advertised job are much different. I feel very misled. Advice?,1558795739,"All,

As the title says, I recently started (\~1 month) at a small-ish industrial contracting company looking for an electrical controls engineer. The job as advertised involved a lot of what a control engineer does - full system integration and control system design. However, I come to find that we have virtually no jobs that require this since they sub nearly all of their controls work out. The reason they need a control engineer mostly is to make up for the deficiencies in their project management.  E.g. ""I didn't realize customer required X functionality, could you design a control panel with relays that manually overrides the control system to perform X? It is too expensive to go back to our control supplier to get them to modify the program and add I/O""

I also spend a lot of time helping out our electrical construction department in doing take-offs and bidding jobs. There's even talk of me doing some power contracting (which I don't mind, but not what I signed up for). 

My boss is also very new. He is a good, knowledgeable guy that has made it clear that I'm pioneering their electrical controls group and have some good opportunity in front of me with it (managing engineers etc.). However, I've also come to find out that the terms of my hiring might not be what was advertised. For some reason my time off and vacation had not been written into my employment agreement while everything else was (shame on me, I know). My boss in offering me my job made it explicitly clear that my vacation time and sick time were effective upon my date of hire. I had to take a day off earlier this week for some personal stuff (I moved from out of state for this job and had to take care of some personal stuff that I hadn't gotten the chance to until now). My boss knew about this ahead of time and didn't mention anything. I come to find out yesterday when turning in our time cards (engineers do too, for billable work) that I will not be paid for the day I took off since new employees do not get vacation or sick time UNTIL AFTER ONE YEAR OF EMPLOYMENT. I am fuming at this point not only because no one had ever mentioned this in my onboarding or during my employment negotiations, but the fact that other people in the company are unable to take time off for a year is drastic and insane for a company to do. 

I spoke with my boss and made it very clear I was unhappy about this and feel very misled. He says he will take care of it; however, I feel with this combined with other things about the company have made me really second guess being in here for the long haul. In addition to these things, the company culture is not great outside of the engineering department - the VP of operations and one of the estimators got into a literal screaming match at a meeting. 

The job market is pretty hot for controls people at this point - so I'm not worried about finding a new job, but I am a committed person and want to make this one work.

8,Book recommendation to refresh engineering math?,1558789005,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a good book(s) to refresh my engineering mathematics. Although I have taken a bunch of courses (Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Fourier Transformation, etc) in undergrad, it has been a while since I have had to use any serious mathematics (a bit over 4 years) and I would really like to remind myself of the concepts that I have learned.  In particular, I am interested in the application of these concepts in engineering. 

I have a feeling that one book will not cover all of my interests, but it would be ideal if all of the topics (mentioned below) that I want to learn were condensed into a single book. One more request is that the book not only covers the mathematics, but also gives me examples of real-world to solve an engineering problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Topics that I want to learn.

1. Probability and Statistics 
2. Combinatorial Mathematics 
3. Fourier Transformation 
4. Taylor Series and other series useful in engineering
5. Linear Algebra (I have followed Gilbert Strang's videos, but they were a tad too detailed for my use case)

9,Suggestions for Mass Flow Controllers?,1558786496,"I looking for MFCs to run oxygen into some kilns. I'm currently using a simple solenoid valve and an adjustable analog flow meter.

The flow rate needs to be constant but as the kilns heat up the outlet pressure changes, drastically affecting flow and requiring manual adjustment throughout the burn.
 
I found some with an integrated controller and display that will work but they are total overkill and cost about $1000 a pop and I need 6 of them so I'm looking for a more cost effective solution.

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a simpler solution. Perhaps a purely mechanical device the will keep constant flow despite fluctuations in pressure.

It would need to work in the 10-20 SCCM range. Precision is not an issue, as long as it is reasonably accurate and durable/repeatable.

10,Please help to find drain flow rate equation,1558785347,"I have a drain system which is not quite simple enough to get an answer from the basic equations I'm using from https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/flow-liquid-water-tank-d_1753.html

It looks like this, a tank with a sharp corner to a thick pipe then narrowing to a thinner valve:

|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|

|__________........... __________|

..................|........|

...................\......./

....................|....|

I want to find the flow rate at the bottom. I can get it using the full height from there to the top but I think that value will be too high, or will it be about correct if the first gap is thick enough? I can find the flow rate at the initial thicker opening for if it was just a hole, can I use the minimum of the two values? What would be the correct method?

​

The reason for this shape is because I want a larger flow rate through the valve so made it lower to increase H. I thought if the pipe was constant thickness dropping it wouldn't help because the top of the pipe would be a bottleneck so came up with this, a thicker bulkhead which narrows at the bottom at 45 degrees to the thickness of the valve thread.

11,Controlling a relay with RF/Passive keyless entry,1558768939,"Hi everyone,

I've been trying, without success, to figure out a way to control a relay similarly to how a passive keyless entry system locks and unlocks car doors - when the remote is within range, the normally open circuit closes, and re opens when the remote leaves the proximity (a few metres).

I know that there are 2.4ghz wireless relays which you can control with the click of a button, but ideally it would be completely passive and range based.

I know very little about electronics so my first attempt was to use a generic chinese PKE kit who's unlock / lock door negative pins earth a latching /flipflop relay to get it to change over. The only problems was the kit clicks once when unlocking, and twice when locking.. and just sometimes the flip flop relay would take the locking as 2 triggers rather than one, cancelling out what it was meant to do.

So with that as context I guess I'm asking for any information you'd be able to give me regarding this particular application, whether it be reading material or links to components that I've failed to find after all my hours of research. 

Perhaps I am on the completely wrong path and to achieve something like this it'd require designing your own PCB. Or perhaps there is a component I could incorporate with or without the KPE kit and flip flop relay that would help me fix the problem.

29,I'm trying to find the max cross-section area that can cut a shredder machine of plastic!!,1558728428,"Hello to all!!, I'm designing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFIPXgrk7u0) shredder machine of plastic.  Precious Plastic (the company that makes the video) have all the specification about the machine, the blueprints, and the CAD models (you can see it [here](https://preciousplastic.com/en/videos/download.html)). Thanks to their instructions and looking in their [forum,](https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/) I was able to make a lot of progress, since I'm trying to design a PET shredder.   
In my design, I have a motor of 1500 W with 3490 RPM and a pulley system with a  49 : 1 ratio, that allows having 71 RPM in the shaft. The problem that I can't solve is **what is the bigger cross-section area that my shredder can really cut?** 

&amp;#x200B;

 I make some research about the topic (seeing [this](https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/calculations-required-for-shredder/page/2/#post-140882) calculation post) and seems that to know that, first I have to know the motor's torque: 

**Torque (N.m) = 9,5488 x Power (kW) / Speed (RPM)**= 9,5488 x 1500 W / 71= 201,74 N.m

After knowing this, I can say too that the torque in the blades that cut the plastic is equal to: 

**T = F. b**   ***(1)***  Where:

T = the motor’s torque

F = Force needed to cut the material

b = the radius of the blades which is 59,785×10\^-3 m, the arm is equal to this value since the blades of the shredder generate a torque whose arm is the radius of the same blade 

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I look [here](http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheet.aspx?MatGUID=a696bdcdff6f41dd98f8eec3599eaa20) and I find the PET’s yield Strength (since I want to make a PET shredder), which happens to be 90 Mpa. Knowing that I can follow this logic:

**Stress = F / A.** Where;

A = cross-section area of the material to cut

Stress =  PET’s yield Strength

F = Stress . A  (force that will break the material)   ***(2)***

 

Making ***(2)*** in ***(1)*** 

T = F. b = Stress. A. b      (3) 

A = T /(Stress . b)

Which gives me:

A = 201,74 N.m /( 90Mpa x 59,785×10\^-3 m)

A = 3,75×10\^-5 m\^2 = 0,375 cm\^2

Isn’t that too little? Looks like a really small area… Maybe I’m doing something wrong? I don’t think that I’m using an inappropriate engine because I follow the recommendations of the Precious Plastic community, I think that I have good parameters for the design. And on the other hand, If maybe someone doesn’t understand the context of my calculations, you can let me know, I know that maybe I'm not so clear, that is because my language limitations, but you can feel free of making me whatever question to clarify the ideas

52,A question to electrical engineers regarding my canister vacuum cleaner,1558667134,"Hello engineeros! I apologise if this is the wrong place for this type of question. I've never frequented the subreddit before but I was (also am) a little bit drunk and looking at new vacuum cleaners, when I felt that maybe a word with a professional would help me decide if that is truly warranted, or whether I should pursue out-of-warranty service. I work in tech support myself and I know that contacting the manufacturer is only going to get me forwarded to a service point and that, while I am sure they will resolve the issue, they might well charge me the price of a new bloody sucking-machine.

  

My (Electrolux ZUOGREEN+ / canister) vacuum cleaner died - as in it would not start - and I had it serviced at an authorised service centre. Since then it worked fine maybe 2 or 3 times, but the condition of it now is that when I plug it in and press the power button it revvs up - just barely - but doesn't start up properly and instead just sputters out. ""Sputters"" is really the wrong word, it just revvs up a little and winds back down to nothing. I find that when I press the button repeatedly (and sync it with the revving of the motor, much like a chainsaw or overboard motor) this edges it further, even bordering on the device actually starting. Removing filters and bags makes this effect greater.

54,"What's the theoretical max MPG for sustained highway cruising @65mph, with a gasoline or hybrid drivetrain?",1558660397,"For example:

* Car: Camry Hybrid, standard size, but styled more like a Model S or VW XL-1, 0.21 or lower drag coefficient
* Normal wheels, safety, price
* Drivetrain: any hybrid design, like a Prius, Volt, i3, Pacifica Hybrid, etc. with any design or engine size
* Or the Toyota free-piston generator design - this skips the whole rotation step by putting magnets in/around the piston itself - you might even get away with using only 1.
* Fuel: you have to drive using standard gasoline, no propane or hydrogen. No plug-in batteries. 
* No cheating by using a lot of battery power for only the first 40 miles.
* Any amount of playing with clutches like Volt/Accord Hybrid is allowed.
* Other cheat systems are allowed (deployable aero wheels... fifth wheel... in-wheel hubs... whatever you can think of, really)

I was inspired by the Prius pulse-and-glide method to ask this. Some of the extra energy seems to come from disengaging the gasoline engine with a clutch for less resistance during coasting... Accord Hybrid seems to do something similar, alternating between gas+charging battery, &amp; coasting in EV mode on the highway - which as far as I believed, shouldn't have worked due to losses, but it does.

&amp;#x200B;

According to my calculations (and a horsepower calculator I used on top to make sure I was correct) to reach 6000nm of torque the engine would need to be boosted by 7-9 bars or so. And as far as horsepower goes... I don't have access to a torque curve of the beast, but I would assume they have a lot more high-end torque in there which gives extra horsepower which helps a bit to push out those numbers, but even more boost is needed according to my calculations to reach those horsepower numbers.

94,Breaking street signs -weird personal questiom,1558617982,"Hi guys, i had a sort of unconventional question about the structural tolerance of standard speed limit/yield/stop signs in relation to impacts. I am asking because last summer i was involved in a pretty severe motorcycle accident where i slammed into a car that pulled in from of me and was ejected over said car and into a street sign which I impacted with the upper left part of my body. I don't remember much at all but the police officer who came to the scene and the accident investigators told me that I had broken the sign out of its base. I was surprised but the sign definitely ‘won’ overall, i suffered a broken collarbone, shoulder blade and a badly bruised lung that made it hurt to breath for weeks, along with lots of soft tissue damage. Other parts of my body were hurt from hitting the car. my bike and the ground where i landed, even though I was fully geared. 

I am laying here this morning sore as usual and just had a weird question about how much force it must have actually taken to break the sign like that? The only thing I could find in my research without maybe reading through dozens of pages of papers by various transportation departments was that these signs almost always have special bases that are designed to break at some point, but that must be strong enough to resist some considerable force... I live in Denver, CO, i hit the car going about 45 or so, I was probably around 200 lbs (6’2”) at the time and it was a speed limit sign about 10-15 feet from where I hit if i remember and was set on a concrete median. I hit it somewhere in the middle. The sign has obviously been replaced and the new one just has the normal triangle plate. This probably isn't super easy to determine but I have been pretty curious about the sign vs body question considering they are meant to be taken out at low angles by a very heavy metal vehicle.

98,Help needed with television concept - any ideas gratefully received.,1558608751," 

Hi All,

Giant Jenga help needed…I’m not an engineer.

I work as a TV development producer, which means I’m tasked with inventing TV shows but also standing them up once the pass the first hurdle and get a little seed money to refine the idea. For my sins I’m in the niche of engineering / pop science / ‘build’ shows which means I’m forever butting up against ‘creatives’ who have zero understanding of materials, the laws of physics, fabrication or what’s actually possible.

In my time I’ve seen Greek ships on fire, drag cars constructed in Cuba, bronze cannon made on set, built all sorts on a scrapheap and tried to retard the fall of a pallet dropped from a crane with a rocket, to simulate a wild Allied idea from WW2 regarding supply drops.

One the ideas I’m currently working on is ‘classic kid’s toys made real / giant’ show - and the list of suggested toys is really quite something.The overall budget per ‘build’ might be in region of 350k USD, so not peanuts, but it won’t go half as far as they think it will. Some of you probably spend that on R and D or some new tooling.

It’s a fairly painful process dragging ‘creatives’ and Exec Producers down from la la land to reality. I am of course ‘negative’ and need to ‘focus on the can do’. Urrrgh. I was honestly asked yesterday for an Iron Man suit - which would allow a man to spring off the floor and land on buildings. I had to explain it is CGI. A fantasy sci fi movie. Though I guess I could call Richard Browning…

However, why I’m here is not to ask you about an Iron Man suit, but a ‘simple’ idea – Giant Jenga. Like shipping container giant, stacked maybe 10 high for maximum visual impact. The issue I have with this idea is the way port reach machines / cranes pick up shipping containers (it’s 4 points of contact at least).

Pulling from the ‘stack’ with a crane or reach stacker from the side is impossible, even if friction issues etc. could be overcome, the sudden loading would be a danger – and who wants to hook up the crane to the chosen container, or operate a machine near a giant stack of falling containers?

There are many issues. I proposed killing the idea, they don’t want to. I suggested big but much lighter rectangle ‘blocks’ made of something else, which they are agreeable with. Ideally these would be made of something which can survive an impact.

Yet the question of how you could cleanly remove giant blocks sideways remains – plus wind loading on the stack etc. etc. Sure there is a ton of stuff I’ve not even thought of.

I appreciate it’s ridiculous, but any ideas welcome.

Cargo helicopters? Electro magnets? Long reach excavators?

For example, you have 4 batteries in a Tesla, and then you attach 4 supercharging cables to the car, and then the car goes 4x (or still, at least a lot faster) charging.

8,What can I use for metal clamps for easy attaching and detaching of a thing to a surface?,1558573652,"End goal: engineer a way to easily attach and remove a plastic bin to and from a surface. I work in a biochemistry lab and we're about to grow a bagillion small culture flasks. Instead of taking each flask and individually placing it into it's metal holder, I'd like to be able to secure them in a plastic bin and just attach the plastic bin to the culture shaker. This way when I need to transfer a bunch of them at the same time, I can transfer 8 or 10 in one motion rather than 10 different motions. Condensing 10 motions into one can save a lot of time when I have to spray all of them into a biosafety cabinet and take samples and otherwise move them from place to place. (I bought 50 tourniquets off amazon so I can make a grid in the plastic bin that will cushion and hold the flasks in place!) 

My question: I'm thinking of just making holes in the bin, screwing a metal piece to the bottom surface (shaker), placing the holes over the metal pieces and securing those metal pieces in some position that will make them act as buttons or clamps.  https://ibb.co/CJ2wgqJ I was just wondering if there's already an easy mechanism for this and what it's called. There's no sense in re-inventing the wheel if the mechanism I want is easily available somewhere on amazon. I just don't know the proper jargon for it. 

I would like something that I don't have to screw and unscrew for easy access. (if all else fails, I could always just use a long screw, but I'd like it to be more convenient). Maybe something like the metal locks of a briefcase (do those have a name?). Maybe a metal thing that is longer than it is wide so I can twist it to lock it. Or a metal thing with a hole so I can put another metal thing in there and ""close"" it. Is there a really simple solution to what I'm describing? Maybe metal isn't even the best mateiral to go for. I just figured I can maybe go to my local hardware shop and ... get some metal and twist it into whatever shape I want. 

Please share your knolwedge if there's a locking device that you know of that I can just google and purchase. I'm so excited about this project!

33,Trouble interfacing Chinese caliper with Arduino,1558544099," 

Hello,

I am working on converting a Chinese caliper to have a digital read out (DRO). This particular caliper came as a part of an universal testing machine and we use it to measure deflection caused by compression and tension. There are a number of tutorials and code out there which makes this conversion a fairly straight forward process. I have linked the references I have been using below.

1. [Instructables Tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/id/Reading-Digital-Callipers-with-an-Arduino-USB/)
2. [Hackerday Tutorial](https://hackaday.com/2016/05/17/improved-digital-caliper-interfacing-including-3d-printed-connector/)

All these tutorials assume that the pinout of the calliper is VCC, GND, Clock and Data. However, the particular set of callipers I have do not seem to be using this communication protocol. Using a multimeter and oscilloscope, I have able to identify VCC and GND quiet easily. I connected the other two pins to the an ocilloscope and got the following output.

[Link to oscilloscope output](https://imgur.com/a/IrdqTMU)

One of the lines seems to be transmitting continous data with a peak amplitude of \~ 1.3 volts. This seems indicative of the clock line I have seen in the other tutorials. My issue is with the second pin. What should be the data pin seems to follow the exact same pattern as the ""clock"" pin, but has a much lower peak amplitude in the milli volt range. I tested with a few other callipers I have lying around and they work perfectly as described in the attached references. My top pick is that this calliper is using UART and hence communicting using a TX and RX line. I am not sure what exactly is going on here and any help that you can provide will really help move this project forward.

Thankyou!

I've been applying for graduate positions recently, and I think the prospects are looking good. I have just been offered a graduate systems engineering role within a defence contractor, but I still have interviews with other firms coming up.

I'm at a crossroads right now, and at a bit of a loss of how to choose between any job offers I may receive. Personally, I feel like I would prefer to work on something technical, and I'm not 100% sure that I would get that in a systems engineering role. I like coming up with designs, prototyping and testing them, and as I understand it, systems engineering is more oriented to the lifecycle and management of the system, and less towards the development of it.

I'm also concerned that if I choose a systems engineering role, it may be hard to switch into something more technical later (say with a design firm). Obviously, I am new to the workforce, so I have no idea how hard it would be to make that jump after a couple years if I desired to do so.

Say I took the systems engineering role, decide it's not for me, and want to move into a mechatronics/electrical role, how hard would be it? Do employers care that I have been out of uni a couple years, working in a related field but not the exact one? I feel like a lot of entry level roles at larger firms are taken up by graduates who have finished their graduate program, and thus there is not much opportunity to enter there. 

Is there anyone here who worked in one engineering field for a couple years after they graduated, decided they didn't like it, then switched to another field and is willing to share their story/how they moved?

41,Need help designing a magnetic system,1558537874,"Hi everyone,

I am trying to design a system that could withhold a load of F = 290 kN (yeah that's a lot) and I was checking if it were possible to do so with an electromagnet (I'm not expecting it to work since the load is huge but my boss still want me to do the calculations).

Using the formula of the attractive force of a magnet : F = 1/2 . (B^2 S / mu0) with B being the intensity of the magnetic field, S the contact surface and mu0 the vacuum magnetic permeability (4.pi.10^-7 ) I find a magnetic intensity of B = 8.03 Tesla (the radius of the circle contact surface being 120 mm)

With this magnetic intensity, I'm looking into what kind of electromagnet I would need to generate such a field (geometry, number of turns of the coil, alimentatio etc). 

I found the following formula for the magnetic intensity : B = mu . (N . I) / L

With mu the permeability of the magnetic core material, N the number of turns, I the intensity of the electric current that goes in the coil and L the length of the coil. I assumed the length of the coil L was in fact the diameter d of the wire times the number of turns. Considering this, B doesn't depend on N nor L anymore (since both are proportionnal) but just d

That way, I need an intensity of i = d.B / mu to generate the magnetic field. Mu for a regular electrical steel is 5.0 . 10^-3 H/m, I picked a wire of 0.2 mm diameter (the tinier the less intensity I need) and I end up needing an intensity of i = 0.32 A

That's where I'm surprised. With such a strong load to withhold, meaning such a strong magnetic field to generate (8 Tesla is no joke I believe), I only need 0.32 A ?

That means that for the 2 minutes I want to withhold this load I just need a battery of 0.011 A.h capacity ?

Does anyone have a take on this ?

Thanks a lot :)

Please excuse any grammatical error or typo.

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of a back ground:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 28 from India, I resigned from my previous job as a Mechanical CAD Engineer to pursue my career as a Mechanical Design Engineer. Unfortunately it was not as easy as I thought it would be to get a job in my desired field. After a month and half it was getting stressful without getting a call or an offer from any company that I sent applications to, making me more and more depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So last day I got a call from an HR consultancy asking me if I would like to attend an interview for Planning Engineer role. Since I was so desperate, I agreed to attend. The company is an Oil and Gas construction company, based in Middle East, one of the biggest corporations over there actually (which I didn’t know then). The interview went well; I was offered a position as Planning Engineer (Mechanical/ Structural Construction) for 2 years. I don’t know how I made it but I did it. And I said yes. I gave them my passport for visa stamping and such.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I got another interview call from a company in India for the role of Design and Simulation (FEA) Engineer (almost same job profile as I was doing before) mostly in Aero Engines and stuff. I said I will call back later. It’s been 8 hours since and I haven’t done anything yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am confused what to do. If I go by Planning Engineer as a career, which will be mostly Planning and scheduling, there will be little to no technical engineering involved. If I attend the other interview and if I get it, I am not sure I will, I will be doing what I know best and what I love to do: design and analysis. On the other side, the pay is substantially good in Planning Engineer role.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I feel like I have made a mistake and the thought is making me sick.

58,Lever momentum question regarding removing weights on a side of lever while momentum is moving downwards.,1558505903,"http://imgur.com/gallery/zUssGf2

Attached photo illustrates question. 


Example A and B are the same lever.

A lever with side L (3m long) has 10 N of weights in box while side x(1m long) has 25 N of weights in box. To balance the lever side L need only 8.33 N. So there is a surplus on side L of 1.67 N

question: on point B when lever on side x is at a 45 degree angle then comes down on side L with 1.67 N of force until it becomes level to the ground( lever becomes parallel to the ground)
If the 10N on side L as it's coming down becomes level to the ground, at the point where the lever is parallel to ground and the 10N is suddenly removed as the downward momentum is in play, 

will the downward momentum have enough kinetic energy to keep lifting side x with the 25N once 10N is removed on side L?

Or regardless of the downward momentum,  once the 10N is removed will side x instantly begin to move down? 

I hope this is clear but it is kind of complicated for me to explain. I'm thinking once the moment of side L comes down from a distance,  once the 10N are instantly removed when it becomes parallel to the ground it will still have enough momentum to keep lifting the 25N for a foot or so before side x with 25N comes crashing down.

60,Liquid Flow by Gravity from One vessel to Another,1558503197,"Hi all,
Recently we installed a Wellhead Compression system at on of our well with a blow case arrangement. A blow case arrangement is where the low pressure liquid flows from the inlet separator to a blow case separator where the high pressure discharge gas powers the low pressure liquid into the system.
The inlet separator is operating at 6 barg, and the blowcase is operating at 6 barg as well. They're connected with a equalization line so that the pressure remains the same in both the vessels and the liquid travels from Inlet separator to Blowcase vessel by gravity. 
Now the problem we are facing is that the hydraulics and piping done between inlet separator and blowcase is very complicated. The size is 3"" sch 160, liquid flow is 2500 BPD, the elevation difference between liquid out from inlet separator and Liquid in to blowcase is 0 m (the liquid out from inlet vessel is 4ft high giving me an elevation of 4ft, however it has been cancelled by the inlet of blowcase which is also at 4ft, therefore the elevation difference is actually zero) , the horizontal distance between inlet vessel and blowcase vessel is ~ 30ft. . Therefore the only time the liquid should flow is when there is a static head in inlet separator.

Ive drawn a sketch in the below link for you guys to see. As per my calculation, the head required in inlet separator should be 1100 mm for the liquid to flow. However the diameter of the inlet separator is 800 mm only. This was also seen during operation of this system, the liquid wouldn't travel to blowcase at all or it would be very slow.

Now we are looking to modify the system piping, elevating inlet separator further is not an option. My options are either giving bottom entry to the blowcase, or letting the top entry be there and extend the pipe into the vessel and create a vertical elevation and siphon of ~3ft. 

Your feedback would be appreciated please.

I have never applied for any American job before (I'm a first gen immigrant, and neither of my parents have worked in corporate America so I'm not sure of how the hiring process works). Originally I was thinking about working for my own business, but someone offered to buy my business at a price I can't refuse (deal is still pending). I have no other engineering internship experience because of my business (Yep now I realized I made a huge mistake). Last night I was browsing around glassdoor and discovered an engineering position called ""sales engineer"" and immediately became interested in it. So I am wondering if any of you sales engineer can tell me about your experience and let me know whether or not if my resume is tailored to that field. Thanks so much!

I just finished my undergrad degree in engineering. I won’t get into specifics for privacy sake, but I interned with and have been offered a full time position at what is considered to be one of the most sought-out and prestigious companies in the industry I’m in. I essentially tailored all of my undergrad projects, research, internships, etc. so that I could get to this company. This year has been really rough for me- I’ve gone through a very ugly break-up with the girl I thought I was going to marry and have been experiencing a variety of other family and mental health problems. I’m reaching out here because I spent years and years working my ass off to get this job, but now with everything else going on in life, I’ve sort of lost all desire to keep pursuing it. I don’t even feel like I can talk to family or friends about this because the job is seriously such a “score” that my friends are very jealous and seem almost offended if I bring up not taking the job, and my family just thinks it’s the situation I’m in and that I’m not thinking straight and talking about giving up my dream. I realize that it’s probably just what I’ve been going through, but something in me feels like I really want a change in the direction of my life, and that I spent so much time focusing on pursuing my career that I really lost sight of myself and who I am along the way. I have enough experience and knowledge that I’m not really worried about finding a job anywhere right now, so part of me wants to move closer to family and just work on myself for a while and not focus so much on my career, but I’m worried this may be my last chance to really achieve something as impactful as the work I’ve been offered to start doing this month.

I'd like to apologize in advance for my grammar. English is not my native language. This also will be a long post.

I know some programming but not at a level that most companies are looking for. I know how the logic works most of the time but not the actual language, and depending on the software which I have no idea what people use. I used notepad++ and CMD to fix things. I used MS-DOS and Visual Basic in collage but that's it. Mostly for C, C++, and C# programming. **I don't think** I want to be a programmer again since my 1.5yr thesis had me and only me program our self check-out cart project for a group of 4 students. I needed to pass.

My knowledge is mostly General of things but not at a level that I can even call mediocre. I like electronics, computers, fixing, and organizing stuff. 

I lack the knowledge to set-up stuff without the help of the almighty google. I don't have any creativity to design anything to look pretty. I design things to be functional and convenient. I don't have anyone to call a friend here, not even in the Philippines to help me with my employment issues.

**Story:**

I am a BS Computer Engineering Graduate in the Philippines back in 2015.  My school was not great, not having enough equipment to pursue our desired major, we were forced to **divide our majors into three(3) sections:** **Telecommunications, Microprocessors, and Electronics.**

&amp;#x200B;

I had moved to the US as soon as I graduated and found a job in California. I was a Remote Operator for a certain Fuel Cell company. Around 9 months in, I had to go back to the Philippines and stayed there for about 3 months(Had to take care of my Parents). Naturally, I had to resign.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016 of November I got a job as a **F**ield **S**ervice **T**echnician. Not related to my degree but It did give me some pay to survive. It was mostly Installing and Fixing displays on various retail stores. Sometimes getting 4hrs of work a week, sometimes 30hrs. But never more than that. Stayed as an **FST** until May 2017.

February 2017 I re-applied to the Fuel Cell Company and happily accepted me since this company was in need of someone who doesn't need to be trained that much (I had two Jobs for about 3 months). Stayed until June 2018 until I had to go back again to the Philippines for my Parents.

&amp;#x200B;

From June 2018 until April 2019 I had just been doing Maintenance work for my parent's business, like fixing Network issues, Computers, Security cameras, etc., basic stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm back in CA, I've been struggling to get a suitable job for myself to be able to survive. What also worries me is that my wife will be coming to the US soon and I'm afraid that I won't be able to provide for her basic needs. Thinking about moving to Sacramento as well after she arrives.

3,I might be suddenly fired from a large startup - do I quit?,1558457429,"I graduated with my bachelor's in 2018 and have been at my company full time for almost a year. I also did an internship here as an undergrad and they begged me to come back. It is a startup going through extremely rapid growth (several hundred employees at this point). While working here I've had 2 positive performance reviews coupled with 2 significant raises, so I assumed I was doing well. The most recent raise was about 3 months ago.

Recently, my boss pulled me aside and told me I ""wasn't really doing any engineering"", and that I wasn't working fast enough. He told me that I also need to do more simulation and modeling, testing, high level design, firmware integration, supply chain, take on more leadership of projects, and that I need to volunteer for more tasks at our daily stand-ups.

Basically, I felt like he was vaguely listing several jobs worth of expectations, and as  a young entry level engineer, I'm feeling super overwhelmed. He has scheduled a meeting for Friday (one week after this deluge of criticism) to see what progress I've made in all of these categories.

I get the feeling that there is a case being set up to fire me, but I don't know for sure. I've already started applying to new jobs, but that takes time. Should I consider quitting before I get fired, or would that be a huge red flag for applying anywhere else? Is that better or worse than getting fired?

61,How to get good guidance and approach early career choices at the end of uni?,1558312654,"I could have simply posted a question: ""how should I choose between two likely I might receive?""

tl:dr; How can I learn how to make good career decisions at the beginning of my engineering career?

Thing is, there's no way for me to provide enough background and specifics in this medium, and there's really no way for someone here to provide advice specific to my situation since you're probably in some other part of the world, and probably in a different field of engineering. 

So I am in my 2nd to last semester and I will have to start making choices: offers to accept, how to decide certain things, etc.

I have a step-relative who doesn't know me too well, but well enough, and who won't humour me, who is hard-nosed, etc. She's an accountant, but I know I could consult with her for more general advice. 

I have a mentor in the company I currently work at as an Eleoctronic Engineer (a title they've given though I haven't graduated yet). He's got 25 years of experience, is practically indespensible to the company we work for, but I actually met him at uni because he doesn't have the piece of paper he needs for my country to be professionally recognized; pity he can't just sit an exam for that like in the US. Moreover, we've become close friends. He has said we will stay friends even if I accept a different offer at the end of my degree, and he's sincere. 

Another company who don't pay me but with whom I'm getting experience, works at a higher level, and have engineers who can teach me more about higher levels of digital design/electronics. 

There is also a possibility of the company who officially employs me sending me on further courses for this, since they recently bought a piece of IP they don't really understand (product with an FPGA mated with a DSP for very high speed multi-sensor domain stuff, but it's a mess, and I'd have no one in the company who would know more about the FPGA side of it than I). 

Anyway, as I look at places to apply, offers to consider, how to weigh all this up, to make of my career something that will keep my in health both financially and psychologically ... who do I approach? how do I approach them? what bigger questions should I be trying to answer?

62,Is there any way to estimate the carrying capacity of this table?,1558311273,"Table in question: https://imgur.com/a/IPYgjjL

So I want to get a new fish aquarium and I have this wooden side table that I think would make a great display table for it. My concern is that aquariums when filled with water can get quite heavy. A filled 40 gallon aquarium with dimensions 48L 13 W 16 H (surface area of 624 square inches if that's relevant) will weigh approximately 450 pounds. 

The table pictured has 4 legs, which are approximately 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch at their base. The top of the table is .75 inches thick and is made from an unknown type of wood. I can provide more pictures/specifications if that would help you arrive at a conclusion to my question. I don't need to know an exact capacity in pounds that this table could hold, but for safety reasons, so you think I could reasonably expect a table like this to carry say, 600 pounds without being at risk of collapsing? 

Follow up question that I'm fairly sure won't be an issue, but would a table carrying 600 pounds being supported by 4 legs with a surface area of 2.25 each be at risk of falling through the floor? A basic calculation suggests that this would be equivalent to 66.66 or so pounds per square inch. I'm not an engineer so I don't know if I did that right, or if that would punch through a floor. 

Anyways, I would appreciate any guidance you could give me on the topic. I don't want to drop $200 or so dollars getting a purpose built table if you think I could safely use the one pictured here.

63,How much weight will sheet metal support?,1558308294,"Vague question, I know.  Here are the details. 

Steel or aluminum.  I don't have a particular kind of steel or aluminum in mind.  Open to suggestions. 

1/8 inch thick.  Or how ever thick is needed.  I'm just guess starting with 1/8.  Trying not to buy much more than I need.  I don't want it too tall or too pricey.  A little safety factor is good though. 

29 1/2 long x 20 3/4 wide.  It will have some holes drilled in it near the middle(ish).  The holes will be 1/4 inch.  Not sure how many.  Not many. 

How much weight can it support? 

Considerations:

The sheet will be supported from underneath 1 inch around its perimeter by a kitchen counter top and cabinetry.  The counter top and cabinetry formerly supported a four burner electric range top and any household cookware and foods we've put on it.  I'm confident the supporting structure is sufficient. 

The weight will be applied from the top.

The weight will be distributed near the edges of the sides; the 20 3/4 inch sides. 

What exactly am I trying to do?  The idea is to use a propane camp stove in place of the already removed electric range top.  So imagine this-- A propane camp stove on top of a piece of sheet metal which rests on the counter top where the old range top used to be.  The old drip pan for the range is still in place.  Also, I will drill holes into the sheet metal to allow any drips from the camp stove to drip down into the old drip pan. 

I do understand I have to consider how much weight the camp stove can hold.  I've used stoves like this for years, so I have a good idea there.  Yes, the camp stove will be the most limiting factor. 

Why do I want to do this?  I want a gas stove.  We have no gas service in this neighborhood.  The city will not permit a large propane tank in my yard.  This stove uses a one pound tank; the green tank you always see for camping stoves.

Is there a formula I can use for this question?  I'm fair at algebra and geometry. 

P.S. 

I am also looking at buying a gas range top and converting it to propane.

79,Should i major in a specialised engineering degree or a broader degree?,1558282950,"Hi, im a highschool student planning to study engineering, but i am confused to the dozens of fields available.
I have one question, is it better to study a more common and broader engineering (mechanical, civil, chemical, electrical)
Or a more specialised degree (mechatronics, environmental, power)
Does it have an effect on the job market? Does choosing a specialised field lower your job opportunities than choosing a broader field?

Is it worth it to study these or should i stick to the main broader types mentionned above?

I currently live in the middle of nowhere where there are a good amount of engineering jobs within an hour but the nearest tech hub is 2 hours away in any direction. Last year I graduated with a degree in CS and had planned on moving away to find work, but right before graduating I met my soon to be wife. All of our family is here and shes a very family oriented person and so she doesn't want to move which is something I'm fine with. 

I'm currently driving an hour one way to make $15/hr with my CS degree and no other options available to me. After doing some research I've decided I want to try and go back to school for EE but have no idea where to start. It seems like the CS field and Engineering field are full of problem solving which is what I love to do.

87,"I feel like I’m using few of the skills I studied in my job, could this impact future opportunities?",1558256708,"So this is very early days and I know I probably don’t need to concern myself with this right now but I just want to know exactly what I’m getting myself into.

Essentially, after shuffling some papers around for uni I‘m studying (mech eng) part time this semester, full time next semester and then I’ll graduate May next year. I scored a reasonably well paying and engaging summer internship in December internship at a reasonably large company in paper manufacturing. I was very much thrown in the deep end, because of both planned and unplanned changes to the engineering department and the company overall. Due to my part time studies, my supervisor and his supervisor both told me they were more than willing to work around my uni schedule, and I was able to just tell them the hours I want to work and they made it happen.

As a result, I have now been here for more than 6 months and am transitioning into an engineering planner role, which is permanent, part-time, and comes with a good pay increase. Due to the changes in the company, I now have experience with, among other things, the following:

- Machinery decommissioning, relocation, recommissioning.

- Plant layout, set up and design.

- Maintenance planning and scheduling with a reliability-centered maintenance approach.

- Inventory management and purchasing.

- Post-Emergency damage assessment, clean-up and rebuild. 

All in 6 short months. I am rather adamant that there is nowhere else I could have been for the first 6 months that could have given me as broad experience as this, which I am definitely grateful for.

However, I feel like I’m using very little of what I studied for this job. There have been a few times I have used somewhat basic dynamics, and I have talked with QA about failure mechanics, but other than that I feel like I’m just using general mechanical knowledge that I would not have necessarily needed to go to university to gain. 

This kind of has me worried, as I still don’t know exactly what path I want to go down career wise, all I know is that I am enjoying my time in manufacturing. I just don’t want my *only* future opportunities to be in manufacturing.

I guess my overall concerns are:

Would it be hard from me to transition from this sort of role to an engineering design role outside of paper manufacturing?

If it will make it harder, what are the best ways for me to make the transition easier in the future?

Should I really be concerning myself with these matters this early in my career?

Hello dear engineers...

I have a BS degree in Electrical Engineering and have a 1-year market experience of IOT and embedded systems design. However, I chose to leave my job as it wasn't much rewarding (\~30k/yr) as the field is getting saturated and people are willing to work for lower wages here. Since then, I've been working on a tech startup (mobile SaaS model) and most of my daily grind involves skype meetings, preparing various pitch decks for various meetings and get-togethers; have to involve a couple of marketers as well. I'm also managing a team that is working on online software projects and helps me with my startup in their free time. I have found this challenging and grinding but at the end of the day, I'm not very optimistic about my business thriving due to volatile economic situations around my area. I am deciding to go back to the design engineering field but really skeptical about my skillset (C, Matlab, Platform I/O, Linux(a bit), Xilinx, FPGA's (a bit), Altium and Proteus).

  
So, what's the best option to improve my skill set as a design engineer? what options do I have? Should I start a masters degree from abroad (place suitable to execute my startup as well) or take some local projects?

Ideally I would study abroad but it's an incredibly expensive task, which I'm hoping I could one day fulfill, but as of right now it looks pretty hard. So, if I study here, I'd like to study a career that could give me international job opportunities, since eventually I'd like to move out. I discovered the field of bioengineering (that's what the career is called here, but looking at the courses you need to take, it's clearly driven towards biomedicine). So, that'd be a hybrid between biology and engineering that I'd be interested in studying. The part where I'd need others' input is on how profitable this career is on an international level. As in, how are job prospects looking for someone with a degree on this particular subject of engineering in the world (preferably places in Western Europe or North America).
What are some of your experiences if you're a BME graduate and currently working in the field?
What do you do at work? 
I did some research on it and apparently it seems like a very broad subject, so that's a pro I guess.

After a bit of mucking around on the parts program (dealership access) I found the way to identify between the two (One has a 16 tooth primary sun gear and the other has a 19 tooth). Anyway at TAFE (Australian version of tech school) we learnt how to calculate ratios but only brushed over it because ""we aren't ever going to need it"". I was using the Driven/Drive division to try and figure out the ratio but couldn't get the result I was after.

Anyway the teeth numbers are Ring gear: 78, Primary sun gear 16, Secondary sun gear 19 (Driven by the primary planetary carrier). I was using the ring gear plus sun gear equals planet gears calculation but I am not 100% sure that is accurate (Due to my complete lack of finding the correct answer)

It's getting late in the season and I'm a little desperate to secure any position, but should I continue holding out for an IC-related position if that's where my passion lies more for future career goals?  Or is this a case of any experience being better than no experience, and would taking the avionics technician position be better if it's pretty much guaranteed? 

&amp;#x200B;

I also haven't applied yet, but there seems to be an entry level (High School Diploma/GED only) production position available at a fab nearby. The problem is that it seems like unspecialized work related to moving the wafers between machines. In that case, I'm leaning more towards the avionics technician position since at least then I'd be dealing with electronics and troubleshooting.

66,potential career paths for chemical engineer who wants work/life balance?,1558063349,"Brief background: I'm a chemical engineer who worked 2 years at a chemical plant along the gulf coast, and didn't like it very much (not a good cultural fit, among other reasons). went to grad school to get a phd in battery technology, but matered out because I had hobbies, and my boss didn't think I was ""hungry enough"", even though I was one of the more productive students he had.

At this point, I am at the crossroads trying to figure out what to do next. (I know, poor millennial). On one hand, I want to continue pursue my path in batteries, because it's a market that will set to grow exponentially, and electric cars are just the right thing to do. However, I also realize that being part of this rat race will probably require me to work &gt;50 hrs/week, with 2-4 weeks of PTO a year. It's not a life I want for myself. That said, what are career paths that are generally friendlier in terms of work/life balance but also lets me utilize my skills/knowledge/curiosity as an engineer and scientist?

And FWIW, I wouldn't consider myself a lazy person, who plans to spend my free time watching netflix with a pint of ice cream.

* Generate a bill of material
* Assign a budget to the different items of the bill of material
* Create tickets and link them to the different items (systems, components,...)
* Assign tickets to team members and track the working time
* Visualize the assigned tickets in a Kanban board or similar style
* Follow up the lifecycle of the different items of the bill of material
* Create reports about the project status, status of the items of the bill of material, budget,..

I just graduated from a top ten university with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Sounds great, right? Well...I graduated with a 2.21 gpa (2.43 major). Zero internship experience. Spent most of my semesters on academic probation. Took 6.5 years to graduate.

To be blunt, I'm not hireable. No company in the world could look at my academic record and choose to give me a shot. I know that, and I recognize that engineering simply isn't an option for me at this point.

With that said, what *are* the options for someone like me? I don't want to work a minimum-wage job the rest of my life, like I have been full-time since graduating, and I have to believe it's possible to find some job somewhere that I could be qualified for. Or become qualified for.

0,3D printed speaker cabinets: how thick to make viscoelastic layer?,1558018520,"3D printing opens up some interesting possibilities for improved speaker cabinet design, like mounting the speaker from the magnet rather than the frame, optimized bracing, smooth curves for low diffraction, etc.    

Another possibility is to print the walls with a thin hollow space in the middle of them with an opening to be filled with viscoelastic material.  For example, I've got some tubes of [Green Glue][https://www.greengluecompany.com/products/noiseproofing-compound] in my garage that are specifically made for a soundproofing constrained layer between faces of sheetrock.  This stuff seems like maybe it could work, but I'm worried that it would be too viscous to flow evenly into a thin cavity.  The print would also not be putting the green glue under compression in the same way it would be if you screwed together two faces of sheetrock with a layer of it smeared in between.  Would these parameters violate the useful operating space for a viscoelastic material like green glue?

Alternatively, I could make the cavity thicker, which would solve the problem with the GG flowing into it, and maybe use a lattice structure to get back some of the constraints lost by thickening the cavity...?  If I'm understanding this paper right:

*Vibration and damping characteristics of 3D printed Kagome lattice with viscoelastic material filling*

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27963-4

&gt;\[Viscoelastic material filling\] can be regarded as a special “constrained damping layer”, and the damping material receives more constraints and may cause more types of deformation. 
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;In fact, compared with polyurethane in other literatures25, the damping of polyurethane material used in this paper is relatively small. Polyurethane viscoelastic solid have wide range of mechanical performance, so we can reasonably guess that by making more suitable polyurethanes (or other viscoelastic solids), the damping performance of VMF can be manifested more clearly.

Supposing I'm building a relatively small enclosure and have plenty of green glue to spare (or polyurethane for that matter), would I be better off to just throw a lot of viscoelastic material at the problem, make the cavity very thick and add some lattices?",AskEngineers,False,incredulitor,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bpdjmz/3d_printed_speaker_cabinets_how_thick_to_make/

3,Ways to vary the size of ribbon width while coating,1558004412,"Hi everyone, 

for a project at my university I am looking for a way to increase the size of ribbon width (I honestly don't know how it's called in English) of a dosage needle whilst operating the system.

For instance when I am coating any part and the surface increases, I am looking for a solution to increase the ribbon width and quicken the coating process.

I have thought about some ways myself, but don't have the experience yet to come up with decent solutions. Here are two thoughts of mine:

&amp;#x200B;

I work in the marine industry with very specific requirements on conducted emissions and radiated emissions of all equipment on ship board. My team has come across a problem where one of the network switches we use actually provide power over ethernet (POE) which has then lead to conducted interference across the cable.

Since the concern is conducted emissions, I am guessing that going from shielded cables to double shielded cables will not improve our situation. To pass one of our tests, we have added ferrites to the cables, but that is not exactly a clean solution.

25,HVAC/ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING ENGINEERS PLEASE HELP WE'RE SICK,1557932110,"Hello all. First post. I'm getting desperate. I apologize for the book I'm about to write but it's a big issue.

There is a condition at my workplace which I believe is causing illness for many of us. After a health crisis I visited a toxicologist who said I might never know what we had been exposed to - but not to go back. I have moved on to a different building but I fear I may be required to return after getting a promotion. **An even greater concern is that now I'm training people who are going to be sent into that building and are now having the same symptoms I did, even without my having shared the symptoms.** I have spent over ten grand on medical tests and treatment which all did nothing and showed nothing. My health has recovered ALMOST back to normal in the last six-ish years (since I've left the building), but I'm not able to function 100%. If you have any suggestions for testing equipment, can cast any light on best practices, or can refer me to a place or company I would be very grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I'm a white male, upper middle class, and I have engaged in moderation for most of my life. I exercised four days a week, drank one day a week, and ate mostly healthy and organic the rest of the time. In 2012 -2013 my life was nearly perfect. I had a good job, owned a home, was a good parent, was in good physical condition, and was dating an amazing woman. Everything was looking up. I would routinely do hours long workouts with heavy weight, run 3-5 miles, and go out to socialize when I wasn't raising my daughter or working on projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

In that time frame everyone at work started noticing strange smells, and the office became oppressive. I work in an office environment built within older manufacturing space, and had since 2006. The office has an attached paint shop. At first we suspected the paint shop was the culprit, but often the shop would be inactive when the strange smells occurred, and everything had been fine for years. We constantly complained about the environment after then. It grew steadily worse. The temperature would rise to almost 90 degrees sometimes, but for some reason we would not sweat. It was almost like our skin was being coated with a waterproofing agent. It was hard to breathe sometimes. People began to experience mood swings, confusion , cognitive issues in general, nerve symptoms, panic attacks, rashes, spots on their skin, tumors, cancer (5 men with prostate cancer in the ROOM I worked in - most below 50), spontaneous abortion, constant infections (one person I know had phneumonia from the day he started until the day he left), lethargy, exhaustion (chronic fatigue), spinal problems (three people required the same spinal surgery - all sat within ten feet ), vision problems, bleeding, infections, an intoxicated feeling, flushed skin. I could go on. At one point my feet were bleeding and I felt like I had bugs all over me. The thing seemed to follow me home as well, as people who were in contact with me would occasionally have discomfort or strange issues as well. I realized after I left that I would relapse every time I wore my old shoes from the office. SOMETHING is present. 

&amp;#x200B;

We complained and contacted OSHA. They were useless. The management company diverted information and covered everything up. Their testing showed that the environment is PERFECT. Better than outside air. This even though we all had entire baggies full of crap that fell on our desks every day. They binder-clipped furnace filters over the vents. Over christmas 2014 they removed all of the air handlers from the building and replaced with new. Half million dollar units at least. We eventually found out that none of the doors in the air system had been working because the system was so full of moisture that it rusted. We had been getting no air. They tried to tell us that the black stuff on our desks was zinc from a rusting pan in the old air handler. They refuse to clean the ducts because they're full of fiberglass insulation. More tests came back perfect. OSHA wrote a letter scolding them for not posting any environmental info in the building. Not testing. The letter disappeared. I was leaving the building by then but everyone still reported a terrible environment. We contacted NIOSH. They informed me that all of the complaints had disappeared. It was just me and one other person. The management company came down to actively intimidate people who had filled out complaints. My manager tried to advocate for me. Thank god for that. I was barely functional by then. I would get lost in my own house. Confusion. Weakness. Everyone told me how healthy I was. But I wasn't. That was all years ago. Doctors have been useless. Worse than useless. I was in y middle 30's when this started. The refrain was ""you're getting on in years pal."" Idiotic. So many of us were athletes. I sat next to an olympic alternate for crying out loud. The government has failed. They won't even respond to emails. Now here we are. 

I need to know what to test for. How to test for it. I need a leg to stand on. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? How can I get our water tested for something I don't know? Our building sits adjacent to (or on) a huge man made pond which has been used for drainage. I know for a fact that this pond is drenched in insecticide and herbicide to keep it mostly clear. I know for a fact that the company allowed a large diesel spill to make it's way into this pond recently - and probably has in the past. Could this be a soil vapor issue? They tested for VOC inside the building and I have since learned that this isn't correct. They're supposed to dig holes and test. Recently they smoke tested the sewers and the building filled with smoke. Could vapors be making their way up the sewer from the neighboring (abandoned) industrial areas? Can this be toxic gas from mold? There are lots of psychiatric effects to be seen. The once-happy and close office became a wasteland of nervous, paranoid, twitchy, angry people. Lives have been ruined. And now they want me to train kids to sit in that area.  

Please help. If you have any expertise whatsoever. Tell me what to do and I'll try it. We can' make them change anything without evidence. And now they're building a daycare across the street. What if this is in the water? What if it's PFAS or something like that? How would I even find out? The company refuses to test the water. Can this be from a leak in the air handler radiators? I heard some contractors talking about how they had put fifty gallons of something into the system recently and it was gone?

If you are done reading all of this and you are going to comment that it's totally normal to have all this happen. That cancer clusters are natural. That it's really all in our heads. Please don't. The statistical probability of more than one man under 40 having prostate cancer adjacent to the other is tiny. Add to that more cases and it's just impossible. Just move on.

Just the charging unit with some wireless components on it. 

I understand IEC 60601 is a good reference point. I am reading up on it.  


From a mechanical design point of view, I was looking forward to understanding all the requirements of the certification for the FDA. The device will only be used for 10-15 minutes, and the product isn't invasive. 

I also need a good rubber coating on the exterior of the plastic part. I know there are a lot of adhesive issues with plastic and rubber coating. 

  
So far I am looking at the following:  
1. Material selection (ABS-FR or PP/PC)

2. Plasma coating for rubber coating on the plastic part.

So my questions would be:

1. What should be taken care from a design engineer pov?

3. Rubber coating to plastic parts, alternate/reliable processes that I should look into.

The entire device will be going for certification. So from a EE point of view, emissions, electromagnetic compatibility will be tested.

40,Opportunity to move from research EE to financial tech (HFT). Advice?,1557888700,"After graduating with a mechanical engineering degree, I job hopped a little to try to get something that was intellectually interesting, and not just paper pushing and mind-numbingly boring.  I did have geographical limitations at the time, and gave up, returning to school for an EE masters.  I ended up finding a job at a nationally funded lab, working with physicists all day, and doing genuinely cool and intellectually challenging work.  I experience none of that existential dread about work that I used to have, and it's a semi-academic environment, which I love.

The only downside is the pay.  It's a high cost of living area, and I've been meandering around ~$80-85k for a couple of years.  I don't blame my bosses or supervisors, they've all gave me good feedback on my performance. Because of budget cuts, our raises were all limited to below 3% the past few years.  Promotions can definitely happen going forward, but at a place like this, everyone seems to understand you're working below market rate to have a cool job.  When I extrapolate going forward, I can't see myself having a financially comfortable life like some of my other peers in, say software engineering, seem to have gone on to have.  For example, at this rate, there's no way I can afford even a lower end house in this area without an SO with a similar salary.

One of the things I do at work is FPGA programming.  I like it, and I think I'm pretty good at it as well.  I recently updated my resume online and received some calls from HFT firms.  I've scheduled a couple of interviews, but I want to come to a decision now as to whether it's a good move for me.  As I've made clear, having intellectual challenge at work is important to me.  I will shoot myself if I'm doing paper pushing, even if I'm getting $200k/year for it.  While ""selling your soul to go to the dark side of finance"" is a trope with physicists/engineers/math academic types, I can't help but think that HFT might be an exception, and designing ultra-low latency communications could be as challenging and interesting as the scientific stuff I do now.

Add to that almost doubling my pay, and moving from my suburban outskirts to a big city, and I'm almost leaning towards accepting if I get an offer.  These are the types of dream opportunities people salivate over at /r/personalfinance and /r/financialindependence.  But I'm currently at the coolest job I've ever had, one that people generally stay at until they retire.

41,I want to create a drone that can go to the bottom of the ocean.,1557887632,"This is well outside my area of knowledge, any insight is super appreciated. Here are some considerations:

1. Pressure is a problem. I believe that rather than trying to construct a vehicle that can withstand the pressure, it may be possible to create a drone that has no airspace in it. This would involve filling the drone with a liquid or gel. I wonder if you could vacuum seal parts (chips etc.) to protect them or use a gel that doesn't conduct and so won't interfere with functionality? 
2. Underwater Communication. To make an underwater wireless device is not easy. Typical forms of communication (radio waves) do not reach far underwater. I'm not sure what alternatives could theoretically work? The most practical might be an incredibly long tether (1000-2000M)
3. Power. Since the drone is being supported in the water, it will use far less power than a drone in the air. That being said, if you were to tether this drone for communication purposes, would it also make sense to connect it to a power source, would that even work over such a long cable? Would batteries create a problem with pressure? Any are space would become a problem.

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/j1DnNuR87I8) of the setup, the motor acting before the incident, the incident itself, and the post mortem of the motor controller plus the power schematic.

The Flier ESC is rated to 120V and 500A as per their [website](http://www.fliermodel.com/en/fixed-wing-electrically-regulated-120v-500a.html). Not that I take their website as the absolute truth given they are not a highly reputable supplier, but I don't think over voltage was the issue. The controller was pre-charged using the schematic shown in my video, although Flier insists that the controller does not require precharge (even with the 120V battery input).

My two standing theories are:
1. Controller and motor lost sync, leading to a current spike - Unlikely because we were running low throttle / low speed
2. Motor winding is short - Could be, supplier assures me they tested at the factory and it was fine. Motor had barely been ran before the incident, and pos incident i do not spot any burnt windings. At the same time, winding resistance to ground is all over the place (some in the MOhm range, some kOhm. My understanding is that they should have 'infinite' resistance)

**1. Difficulty getting a job.** You probably know a lot of stories of engineers graduating, not finding employment, and then landing a high-paying management job because they're good at math. While I would appreciate a $150k/year management job, I would have studies business if that's what I wanted.

I know a guy who has a master's degree in civil engineering, but he was tutoring me for $40 an hour after he got off of work (as a civil engineer).

If I join clubs and get 2-3 internships on campus before I graduate, can I be reassured that I will get an engineering job?

**2. Overworking.** I have heard stories of engineers being worked for 60, 70, 72+ hours per week.

59,"In development of a low-pressure, spherical, hydrogen gas cell. Use-case is for a modern hydrogen-filled airship. What are the flaws in my concept?",1557857029,"The concept is as follows: Spherical gas cells of any size, depending on the scale of the project and the redundancy desired. Within a cell is hydrogen gas under pressure, which provides some structural integrity to the vessel as well as ensuring that no air can penetrate within. The material being considered for the wall of each cell, thanks to its low cost and high abundance, is aluminum. The wall thickness proposed is approximately 0.1mm, similar to that of an aluminum beverage can. To prevent tears, a composite structure will be applied to the surface of the aluminum. The current idea, for ease of development, is to spray on a thin coat of Polyurea (Namely, Line-X premium). This stuff is hella strong. Otherwise, a light welded metal net could also be wrapped around the structure and adhered. All this of course contributes to weight. The weight of the envelope does for sure reduce the lift, but the square-cube law stands strong in allowing the concept to be scaled up, negating the issues of weight of envelope. Hydrogen is just really, REALLY light, and that lets us use safety features while still having a worthy payload in my mind. The objective behind this proposal is to replace helium-filled airships, as helium is an increasingly-scarce resource that has better purpose in medical and research applications. That aside, the cost of filling a craft with hydrogen is far less, as well. On landings, cheap, inert nitrogen gas could displace hydrogen, reducing buoyancy and sinking the ship to the earth. Ignoring legality, on the issue of safety, the principle behind this concept is that the gas cell material isn’t flammable, and so a chain reaction (as did occur in the Hindenburg Disaster) is avoided. If a cell happens to burst and combust, then other cells are not prone to also bursting with it. This enables selective levels of redundancy in design per the number of gas cells used, at the expense of payload (due to increased surface area of envelope -&gt; increased dry weight). The final objective to be accomplished with this proposal is the resurgence of airship transportation thanks to its renewed safety, and quiet operation in comparison to airplanes and helicopters. This would allow cheap air travel at locomotive speeds overseas for far less fuel cost than airplanes and helicopters, though slightly more than container ships (though surely with less emissions, given that container ships burn awfully dirty). And not only overseas, but over land, too.

Ah yes, and addressing one more detail- The use of variable ballast. Through combustion and electrolysis, the Hydrogen Gas to Water Ballast ratio can be varied at low fuel cost and would allow safe landings via dropping of anchors made up by ballast tanks. This system hybridized with onboard nitrogen storage for displacing the hydrogen would enable a high degree of control of the buoyancy of the craft.

Flaws I’ve conceived of are first and foremost, construction of such a large, thin-walled, spherical tank. It would certainly be doable if it was already commonly done in industry for other purposes, but it isn’t an established production process yet to my knowledge. This makes prototyping very difficult. Another flaw, after this one, is legality. Hydrogen airships are MEGA BANNED in most parts of the world. Perhaps in 3rd world countries of less regulation, this concept could thrive; it would enable transportation to remote areas without worry of building dedicated landing zones such as airstrips and helipads. The third flaw in my mind is the issue of weather, which has always burdened airships throughout history. Fortunately, modern weather-forecasting enables us to see storms and winds coming from quite far away. Still, airships are basically giant sails, so they are at the mercy of the weather. Thus, their feasibility will depend greatly on meteorological conditions and a crew’s ability to travel with the winds and orient the craft at an optimal angle of attack to the wind.

A reason I find this more feasible in the modern era is the reduction in material weight and need for crew in comparison to the past age when airships were still common. Computers can perform crew functions better than humans ever could, and our materials and construction techniques are far better than they were a hundred years ago. Additionally, war especially fueled the development of airplanes, because they were much more effective in war-roles than sluggish airships. But we live in comparatively peaceful times to the past century, and I am optimistic. Maybe it’s time for comeback of the lumbering, quiet giants of the skies. If not, oh well. It’s still a fun engineering problem to take on! :^)

Our current project is a helical VAWT (vertical axis wind turbine) with a *tiny* 3 phase generator I found on Amazon. I plan to 3D print this out of UV reactive plastic and drive UV LEDs with the generator. It'll be a wind powered version of those solar lights. 

Obviously a small wind turbine at ground level is going to be subjected to a lot of turbulence. So I'd like to figure out some sort of flywheel mechanism (or other idea) that will somehow help reduce overspeed, while at the same time allow it to start spinning at very slow speeds. It would also be nice if it could store the energy of those overspeed wind burst. I know commercial windmills is breaking but that seems failure prone and a waste. 

Currently I'm imagining some sort of inverted cone filled with water. As it starts spinning initially it's very low resistance. But as the water starts catching up with rotation, it should climb the walls of the cone like an ice skater spreading their arms. When the wind dies down, the water should keep it spinning for a while and as it moves down the sides and the rotational energy should move towards the center. That should keep it spinning and generating power. Basically a sort of water governor / flywheel.

Not having many resources I chose to weld two kids’ bike forks with 10” wheels to the swiveling mounts from two old casters. They'd work great except they are so big I’d have to mount them much too far apart in order to keep them from interfering with each other (i.e. when changing from pushing the cart forward to pulling it backwards).

Solutions could be:
1. find smaller wheels. (haven’t had any luck without spending a bunch of money, plus I’d like to keep the big ones for height and maneuverability)

2. limit the swivel travel side-to-side. Again less desirable in terms of maneuverability, but maybe my only option?

3. link the wheels together. I’m sure I COULD link them, but the question is how. Not technically how, but what requirements should I look to satisfy? Is it better to link them at the hub? Or maybe the furthest point “back” in terms of caster? Or will linking them be a problem in some way I’m not anticipating?

I’m not finding any conveyances online with linked swiveling front wheels, so maybe there’s a reason it isn’t done? Thanks for any thoughts you could share!",AskEngineers,False,sonicthebedbug,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bol230/is_it_sensible_to_link_swivel_caster_wheels/

89,Could increasing atmospheric carbon be effecting old engines with carbon buildup?,1557780262,"I drive very gently, and I've had 3 head gaskets die on me in the past year. Two of them were on Subarus known for the issue, but both with way less mileage than it's supposed to happen at, and the other was in a car known for usually having its engine outlast its body, with an engine that had recently been rebuilt. 

It also looks like I see a lot more people driving with smoke blowing behind their cars lately than I used to see, which is a sign of a blown head gasket. It seems like every few years there's a temporary period of more blown head gaskets than usual (an example of how oddly cyclical a region's car maintenance can be), but this is the first time it's seemed severe enough to impact me at all, let alone a total 3 for 3, with how carefully I maintain my cars and try to prevent wear and tear.

I idle a lot for my job, and the timing felt like excessive idling has been killing all these engines, except the fact that there are plenty of people with my exact job and there have been people with similar jobs for most of the past century, so the amount of idling I have to do shouldn't be outside the range the car is engineered for. 

At first I thought it might be planned obsolescence, like maybe a bunch of car companies predicted 2020 would be an important economic year and engineered tons of parts to fail around then, but this explanation seemed far-fetched and left me still curious what's really going on.

Today I realized cars have O2 sensors to determine the operating parameters of their engines, I've never heard of CO2 sensors in a car. It's like the opposite of the human body, which senses the need to breathe based on CO2 detection without being able to detect oxygen. 

Since oxygen levels haven't been changing proportionally to CO2 levels, then since the testing the car companies did while programming engine computers to avoid carbon deposit buildup would have been based on the amount of carbon in the fuel and the air relative to airflow, temperature, etc. then these calculations would all be way off because there's so much more carbon in the air now.

12,Should I submit a patent application if I might be layed-off soon?,1557734178,"Cheers fellow engineers,
I've been working for around a year at my current place of employment now. 

I have 3 previous patens, from when I worked at another industry and employer. I don't think I've ever saw a cent for those, altough they are in products that are currenytly in the market... Also, I don't know if having a patent in your CV is really a benefit or not. It may not hinder you, but will it really help you in any meaningfull way?

This leads me to my question. I'm currently in automotive R&amp;D (mechanics, fluids and hydrauliucs, not IT) in a Tier 1 supplier, and automotive is expected to see a large drop soon-ish. OEM are already laying people off, and so will Tier 1 suppliers (in my yet limited understanding of how this industry operates).

As such, I'm already sending CVs, particullarly to industries other than automotive.

As such, is it worthy to submit patrent applications with my current emplyer? I may not be here by the end of the month...

I think I've some good ideas, but they were never really studied in detail beacause our R&amp;D departent runs super lean, basically with 0% available capacity outside of our budgeted projetcs. I've basically just did some presentations in Powerpoint explining teh details of those ideas to my direct team and supervisor. My direct supervisor and his boss think that they are indeed relevant ideas (some of them), for possible use in furture projects.

If I'm layed off and I submit those applications now, I might get some more patens to put on my CV eventually. If I don't submit them, I may have some thrumphs in my hand (but probably not...) if I go to some of our competitors.

UK engineering student here. I've got a few decisions to make for my future and was wondering if anyone had any advice.

I'm about to finish my mechanical engineering BEng, and following my internship last year I've been working part-time as an engineer during my final year of studies, where mainly I develop simulation models for the automotive manufacturing industry, but also some energy systems and potentially there will be a move to aerospace projects. However, I've been interested in aerospace - particularly space - engineering for a long time and have been looking into masters that might help me transition to this area. I'm just not sure if I have enough work experience to justify it yet, so I've been trying to make a decision. The options are:

1: I graduate and by default go on to my full-time contract for work.

2: I leave the full-time job and go on to a masters in astronautical engineering or space systems at Cranfield/Surrey/Leicester etc.

3: I continue working part-time and go on to a part-time masters. I like this idea but my current studies (part-time work/full-time study) have already been quite stressful so this might be difficult for a masters. I could, however, possibly get it partially financed at work and could just work 2-3 days per week which may be more manageable. 

I have some good knowledge of what the space industry is currently doing, but I don't really know much about how they prefer to hire engineers and how an MSc (or even a PhD) is viewed in comparison to more work experience (which, while not 100% relevant to space, is very broad and technical, lots of programming). If it helps, my final year project involved MATLAB simulation of spacecraft trajectories.

&amp;#x200B;

My apologies if this post is not up to standard, this is my first post.

So basically I work in a factory where we use injection moulded and line extruded parts to assemble our products. We have external suppliers and we basically have set up contracts with them to supply at a certain standard which specifies the tolerances of every critical dimensions. My role in some instances is to design new parts or optimise existing parts for weight/cost savings and let our suppliers design the moulds. This ends up being a lot of back and forth as I don't have any experience in mould design (but understand some concepts from talking to suppliers over the years) and understand that extrusion is more of an art than a science. I also understand that there are injection moulding blends and extrudable blends, but that the same blend of material can't usually be used (with great success commercially) in the opposite application. There is lots of information available online, but it seems that it's a closely guarded secret by suppliers and I'm not sure how much of the information is unbiased and applicable across the board.

I told them I am more interested in the job than a specific dollar value, so I'd like them to determine what they think is a reasonable offer.

HR said they will get a salary assessment firm to assess my skill level to determine comparable salaries, and will require several references from me.  Not a problem, I'm just curious if anyone's ever encountered this before and if they know how that assessment process goes.

I have a career discussion coming up with my boss. I work as an engineer for one of the big aerospace companies. 

We do both military space and exploration space, but the exploration space happens at a different facility. Long story short, I work MIL-Space and really really want to work on exploration space-- NASA programs, planetary missions, manned missions, etc. 

So, I plan to announce my desire at this meeting to leave our current MIL-space group and hopefully work on exploration space, within the corporation. But it would mean transferring across the country. 

How can I respectfully and humbly express this to my boss? I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to do what I currently do and everyone has been nothing but kind. I just feel like my boss is gonna be very disappointed because she really likes my performance and recently I got a higher-level clearance (which I would lose if I worked exploration space full time). 

But my goals are my goals. They have not changed and I am still set on working exploration space. I love my team and boss here but the time has come to make a move. I think my manager will understand because she is super enthusiastic about her work and may understand my enthusiasm for something else?

I'm an engineering technician at a power electronics startup. I did not graduate, but I completed about 5/8ths of a computer engineering degree before dropping out for financial reasons. I spend most of my time developing and running automated tests for verification and validation of electronics hardware we are developing. I, with some input and direction from my boss, have been building up a plan for a year or multi-year project to significantly improve our V&amp;V workflow. This project would include:

1. Developing new rules, guidelines, and procedures for setting up and executing test runs.
2. Defining the test cases that make up the test runs for all products we currently have and any new ones created during this process.
3. Taking the defined test runs for each product, design a hardware apparatus to automate as many of the test cases for a product as possible.
4. Write software to execute these test cases. This software will be able to pull test configurations directly from our test hosting solution, or be configured by the user.
5. Write the software interface to allow the tester to pull data from the test hosting and to post data back to it.

There is a lot more to it, but this is as much as I could simplify it.

I see the need at work for a full time Test Engineer. We do not have one. The responsibilities for setting up the test cases and ensuring testing is going smoothly falls on the lead engineer for that specific product. Their time could be better spent improving the product. I think I have the ability to do this job. I recently purchased Verification, Validation, and Testing of Engineered Systems as a way to understand how this system I want to design should look. I plan to spend work time and personal time studying and working on this project to further my career.

I had a meeting with my manager and his manager where they told me of a new project that I could be apart of if I'm interested. The project is a high priority for the company so it would be good for my career in the company and I would have the opportunity of changing positions to work on it permanently if I wanted to do so. The work itself would make use of my technical skills and less so my grad school education.

After giving this a lot of thought, amd respectful consideration, I found that the real dealbreaker for me is the fact the project would require me to essentially move to a state hundreds of miles away and stay there for anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. I moved to my current state and bought a house with my girlfriend when I started my current position. We love living here so I'm not interested in moving, not to mention the fact that I don't want to sell my house so soon. I also really like the work I do in my current position, so I'm not interested in changing positions. And of course, I don't want to be away from my girlfriend for that long.

So I'm definitely not comfortable accepting this project. My problem is that I'm a people-pleaser and I hate to disappoint anyone, let alone my boss and his boss.

First approach will likely get me into the right industry quicker, but likely it will reset my years to reach management. Second approach takes a couple of years longer, but will hopefully be a direct switch to management in the correct field.

In this role, I have been mostly doing development of robotic systems for an industry that is presently going through their industry 4.0 transformation.

&amp;nbsp;

Since I have a mechatronics background (was a stream in my undergrad), my resume has a significant amount of controls and software experience. Furthermore, my company is a consulting firm so the amount of technical work is not intensive. A lot of time is spent on proposals, or early-days concept studies. This is a problem because I do not have a lot of mechanical experience to show for and have had no luck getting interviews. This is despite being recognized as a high performer at my company.


&amp;nbsp;

I think my technical competency is quite high because I am a first principles thinker, and did quite well in undergrad (at least in the engineering courses...). Technical work is what I truly enjoy. I do not care much for the ""soft"" side of engineering such as business development, or management.

I find that I really enjoy software development and have been thinking about switching into a computer science oriented career. To this end, I am interested in doing a masters program to support this transition.

I’ve recently been offered a position with my top company out of college, which is a very diverse engineering design firm. I have a BS in chemical engineering from a school with a highly regarded reputation, and the school works closely with said company. 

Also, I have the upper end of the experience needed for the position (4 years when they wanted 0-5 years) with specializations desired for the position. My background is in plant operations, though, not process design.

I have a dilema some of you might share with me.
I majored in electronics and worked almost 10 years in different jobs ranging from small family companies to big corporations, designing and testing various electronics ranging from optical sensors to jet engine controll units.
Almost a year back I decided to quit all this and move from a city to a village where I build a workshop and started building guitars, furniture and other stuff including electronics.
My dilema is if I should still pursue this?
I found a job here nearby for 6 hours a day, but I am realizing it takes the best few hours a day when I am the most creative and driven.
I dont know how to finde THE THING in which people might be interested to buy so I can make money and would make me happy doing it.
It is not sitting in an office I come to realize AGAIN.
I would rather be cutting wood on my saw in cold (like I did in January) than sitting in a warm office with my back hurting from sitting there all day.
One of my flaws might be that I am interested in lots of things and finishing building a guitar takes a long time, or finishing anything. I know I need more focus.
I have no problem working from 7am - 10pm like I usualy do, also do all the cleaning, cooking, washing my clothes since I live here alone.

I hope You might have some ideas to how a sealing could be designed :)

Hi everyone ! 
(Please don't be harsh it's one of my very first posts on Reddit)

I am a 22 years old french guy who's almost done with his studies in mechanical engineering, and currently doing a 6-month internship (which won't be my last one, because I'm taking a gap year to get some more experience before graduating)


So here I am, doing an internship as a project management engineer in a medium company in the aerospace industry. 

I was super excited to start this job, but I've been appointed to that one project which is almost over, made the company lose lots of money over time, and hasn't lot of things for me to do or learn, so I always felt awkward since I was welcomed there. 

Even worse, my chief (the engineer that I assist) or colleagues to whom I could ask for help are often too busy or away, so when I'm stuck I spend time doing nothing but waiting for them to be available and ask my questions. 

I can't completely blame them for that because it's the project that makes it this way, but it's already been 10 weeks and I am a bit disappointed because I feel useless and I'm not showing any of my true potential.

The main reason behind this decision is my ambition to be a robotics developer. I believe that in every robotics project there is a coherence between mechanical and electronic engineering. My assumption is that knowledge of these two type of engineerings will give me a better understanding of the entire system and will make me a better robotics developer.

On the other hand, I have heard many engineers say that each type of theses engineerings is difficult enough on its own. According to them, studying these two engineers at the same  time will just make me a bad mechanical engineer and a bad electronic engineer.

I've been having trouble staying focused at work. I just started a new job, so a lot of it is just reading training manuals/documents with some hands on stuff mixed in at the moment. So that doesn't exactly help. I am genuinely interested in the work itself, so it isn't like I'm bored where I am at.

However, even at my previous entry level job doing design work, I could only stay focused for 30 or 40 minutes at a time before I got distracted for a nearly equal amount of time. Luckily the projects were simple enough that I met all deadlines, but I still felt bad for the time wasted. At this new job, once I get my own projects, they're much more in depth and if that sort of 30-40 minutes before I lose focus continues, I'm worried about the outcome. The jobs are very doable in a standard 40 hour week, but I might not be able to get them done in that time frame. My company would rather not pay overtime unless it's an extremely busy time.

I had this problem in school as well.. but with school, you're not ""limited"" by a 40 hour week per say, as you could technically put as much time as you wanted on projects, as it was entirely on your time.

Does anyone else have this, or had this problem? What did you do about it?

I used a network analyzers but none of my locations gave me anything but 2g, and not a single hint of even a low DB 3g or 4g connection. I am currently stuck on Satellite connection but its not really good enough latency for what i need and bandwidth restrictions are stupid.     


I know the signal is blocked mainly by a ridge line further down the valley which it's not much higher that tower maybe 50 meters or so.   


I have been looking to find a solution. I am wondering if i get permission for small tower, and put Yagi or omni directional antenna attached to 4g Router, would I get signal and how likely would this be. I know there is bounce but i am not even getting weak signal. So i am wondering if its worth of all expense to build this and find i am getting nothing.  Thoughts and suggestions would be very much appreciated.  


P.s I have no neighbors who have good internet further down valley willing to share, I do not have access to large amounts of funds to pay for fiber to be laid. I am looking for a way to get a low latency connection so I can actually do my work and gaming from home, thanks.

Now one connector states its cavities can do AWG 20 and that would be ~0,519mm². What does that even mean? Is it minimum or maximum 0,519mm²?

76,How are mechanical systems (accurately) controlled by electrical systems? (1800 coins),1557369578,"I want to start by saying that I really don't know much about engineering, but this has always been something I wondered about since a very young age but was never able to figure out by myself and after several attempts at finding out the answer through google lately, I've finally decided to just ask someone who's specialized. So apologies in advance for any frustrating misnaming of what I mean to say throughout the post. But I'll start by clearing up what I mean by ""mechanical and electrical system"" at least.


""Mechanical system"": a system whose components are solid (metal, wood etc...) and their interactions form the system. The relevant part for my question is the fact that they contain solid stable moving parts and thus what allows us to ""do things"".

""Electrical system"": a system whose main component (electrons) we have accurate control over and thus able to use to implement logic into other systems, to make them ""do things"" with the necessary accuracy and succession (/logic).

 I'll divide the question into 2 parts:

1. How are ""mechanical systems"" controlled **at all** by electrical systems?

2. How are ""mechanical systems"" controlled with the degree of accuracy that they are nowadays by ""electrical systems""?

Examples to further clarify the questions:

1. How is a cylinder that is free to move up and down able to know when it is supposed to suddenly move 1 cm down and then after that 2 cm up by using an electrical system and how is this solid ""stupid"" cylinder able to execute the logic instruction after receiving it as an electrical signal by turning it into a mechanical instruction/action.

2. How does the cylinder know how to move **exactly** (with a margin of error of 1mm for example) 1 cm?
And in a more extreme example, and let's assume building a processor involves putting 1 nm holes into the processor ""base plate"" and then inserting transistors into those holes. How is it possible to control and execute movements to such degree of accuracy? and especially with a very low margin of error?
I'm particularly confused as to how it is possible considering how the tool that will be accomplishing this will most likely start from a random position and move countless nanometer units that each involve a margin of error and still land on the exact nanometer it is supposed to put the hole on? and in the other hand, even with a huge margin of error, how is it even able to know how to move a particular x unit?

In other words, overall, how is logic (through an electrical system) implemented into a (mechanical) system to achieve (any and then accurate) control over it?

Please include any great book recommendations that you deem relevant, preferably not advanced as I do not have much engineering knowledge but I am still willing to put in effort to understand. So general books that occasionally go into specific details to explain the details of this question (for example) are greatly appreciated.

This is really important for me and I'm not sure as to why such a beginner crucial question isn't available so upon receiving fulfilling answers, I will be gifting 1800 coins (either as one platinum award/3 gold and 3 silver ones), but please note that this will be cross-posted across multiple subreddits.

83,Will plasma cutting Spring Steel ruin the temper? (spring steel bow &amp; arrow),1557363207,"I've seen tutorials on making a bow (as in bow and arrow) using an old leaf spring from a truck. Most people shape the bow into the classic tapered look where its wide in the middle and thinner up top.

Some people cut the steel using a band saw, which I don't have. Other people grind the steel down, which seems like a ton of work.  I do have a Plasma Cutter, and in my experience it does not heat the metal too much. The leaf spring is around 3/8in thick (~10mm) and I think it has enough bulk to keep the temperature below say 100C for the bulk of the metal. The edges where I plasma cut might get lose its temper 1/8 of the way in, but do you think that would matter? would it weaken the steel enough to make a failure more likely?

Another question I have - Ive been reading that you should taper the steel from base to tip so its wide on the bottom and narrow on the top. They say this is so all parts of the spring steel experience equal stress. If the steel was a constant width, it would break in the center because that's where all the stress would concentrate.

* Freelance full time - I love doing contract work, the problem is that it's currently only about 1/5 of my total salary, so I would have to drastically ramp up the amount of contracts I take on as well as probably increase my rates from $30/hr to $40+, which I'm not confident that companies would be willing to pay given my current age.

&amp;#x200B;

My general impression of the tools at that time was that management really didn't have a good idea of what the tools did.  My assessment is, like UML, SysML is mainly a framework for creating diagrams to explicitly communicate systems engineering information.  The tool I was using didn't really 'do' anything in terms of automated requirements derivation, and I don't think we really got anything out of my efforts.  Recently, it's come up at work that we would start to implement SysML on certain projects.  I'm very much inclined to avoid working on that, though I'm afraid I'll be pressured to help because I'm a modeling guy.

11,New method for pre-seismic assessment,1557331188," Hello fellow engineers. I’m a structural engineer currently researching the following subject and I would be very interested in your feedback. 

  
 I suppose as professional engineers sometimes your customers will ask you about the security of their home in a possible earthquake. What do you answer? Imagine a device that works as follows: You place it easily on the highest slab of significant size, enter a website and fill in the features of the building in question such as number of floors / height, date of construction and type of structural system, existence of a soft first story (pilotis) etc. Simple data for which you do not need to have a special knowledge of structural engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

You leave the device for a few days on the structure, then remove its memory card and just send it for editing. That's where your own job ends. Finally you are sent a report with insight regarding the structure’s behavior on hypothetical earthquakes such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake, near or far from the epicenter or in an earthquake of the same size as an anti-seismic regulation, which offers much greater accuracy than simple visual control methods.

&amp;#x200B;

Science fiction? Perhaps not, as I said I'm researching this subject. For the field specialists, the principles of operation is a combination of the use of pushover for typical buildings with the structure's natural frequencies, which are measured by the recording of microtremors.

&amp;#x200B;

As we are in process A confirmation phase of the prototype we invite those colleagues interested to learn more information about how the service would look like and are willing to leave any feedback to visit [https://www.unquake.co/owners](https://www.unquake.co/owners)

15,Looking for best term from process engineering: additive goals vs structured goals?,1557325191,"Hi folks. I'm an urban planner and PhD researcher working on why governments struggle to build healthy communities. I would like to draw an important distinction for which I suspect process engineering may already have terminology. If anyone could help me identify whether the discipline does have such terminology, I'd be hugely thankful. 

I would like two kinds of goals. In the first (which I'm currently calling ""additive""), anyone making almost any contribution in any order can contribute to progress. In the second (which I'm currently calling ""structured""),  people must do specific things to specified standards in a specific order to make progress. 

The first category covers digging a ditch, fund raising, or activities to make a festival seem lively. Anyone shovelling dirt in any order will contribute to a ditch. Anyone doing largely any fun activity in a festival will make it seem more lively. These things require little coordination. A lot of government public health strategies assume that the path towards progress is additive in this way: anyone doing anything good contributes to the goal, so we need a lot of people doing semi-random good ideas. 

The second category covers most stuff in engineering: assembling an iPhone, building a bridge, operating a chemical factory, etc. In these cases, people contributing random good ideas will not add up to a successful result. It is instead necessary for each actor to have clear responsibilities for specific actions, defined by the logic and structure of the goal. Building healthy communities requires this kind of structured responsibility, I argue, because it requires that the design of streets, transit, government buildings, and zoning all work together in specific, coordinated ways.

Im a business student working on a flexible manufacturing system for my minor (its kind of an internship but in a different specialization). 

My knowledge on engineering is zero so I have work on my project with information that I find online. Also there aren't any teachers within my college that know anything about this subject and my supervisor can't help either. 

My task is to make the FMS self sufficiënt. I want to do this by connection our PLC (Siemens) to SCADA software (probably Siemens TIA portal including WINCC). I found out that this way it is only possible to control the PLC itself in SCADA but the SCADA can't make decisions  on his own. 

&amp;#x200B;

An example of how it should work:

There is a press with a pressure sensor on it. The data from the sensor will be sent to SCADA by using I/O link and after that it will be sent to the SCADA software by using PROFINET. I know its already possible to control actuators on the press manually in SCADA but I have to let SCADA be able to control the actuator itself. So if the pressure gets over certain parameters it has to control the actuator.

Is this already possible? or does this still need to be invented? Any help is appreciated.

Hey Guys,

Just wondering has anyone any experience with the above? I'm sourcing equipment at the moment for a fairly bespoke application, and the availability of equipment specific to glass far outweighs the alternatives.

For reference I need something mobile that can lift and rotate Sandwich panels (FCB either side with a \~150 mm gap).

I was debating going for a glass application lifter as there is far more on the market, but i'm worried about what the consequences may be. From my limited experience with vacuum lifters a potential watch out is accidentally grasping more than one panel, but the gap size I have that won't be an issue. I imagine a glass lifter rated to X Kg, would be significantly less effective on the FCB?

I do not like my current field of work in supply chain management and would like work work in the STEM industry. I am drawn to renewable energy in its entirety. My knowledge is limited, but I find most subjects from wind, solar, bio-fuel, energy storage and almost every aspect mentioned interesting. The technologist advanced diploma is the most immediate option for me, alternatively my option is to wait for the following fall semester in 2020 in order that I can upgrade prerequisites required in a bachelor of engineering program. If I go for a BEng it would likely be for Mechanical Engineering with a sustainable energy stream (if I am accepted to a school which has a program that offers that particular streaming).   


I'm leaning towards going into the 3 year advanced diploma program, instead of holding off for another year in hopes of making it into a bachelor program. At the moment, I would like to simply start the advanced diploma program and transfer into a degree program if I feel the technologist route limits my career opportunities and is not the right step..   


With all the political rhetoric, anti-renewable energy politics and so on, is this really a good route to pursue? I feel I may be putting my eggs in one basket and potentially limiting my breadth of knowledge or versatility in negative ways if transition into other technologist areas outside of Energy Systems is where the job market goes. Is pursuing Energy Systems worth it in the current political and social climate? Has the industry been showing promising job creation at the technician/technologist level?   


P.S. My goal is to join the renewable energy industry and obtain a B. Eng eventually either way. The advanced diploma program I am interested in incorporates co-op following its 2nd year. At my age, this has its appeal allowing me to get back to a full-time work focus, sooner than later.

I haven't particularly enjoyed working at the micro sized companies because i've found that at both companies, the boss frequently said one thing but then another has occurred. Budgets were super tight, so doing something the correct way isn't always an option (Eg. instead of contracting someone to do a job, it resulted in hacking at it until it kind of works because its outside our knowledge/field/expertise). Everyone is subjected to the boss's mood that day.  It's a complete dictatorship without room for discussion about what is the best method/best for the project. And if something happens there is no independent third party. And neither have given me or anyone else a yearly review/pay rise.

I found at the medium-large company, we didn't have these issues. The issues was more about the manager having favorites, constantly giving them nice tasks and projects.


What are your experiences in past and current companies?

I'm looking to change jobs but i'm not sure if i've been unlucky with the micro sized companies or whether i should just avoid them in general.

I work in a machine shop doing labor and maintenance. Often times we have parts that need sandblasted before painted or sent out to the customer. For those of you who aren’t sure how a sandblaster works, it basically uses a tank that you fill with sand, powered by a big air line. When the tank closes, air pressure builds and pushes sand through the hose at a high rate of pressure. Anyway, our current system is pretty mundane and it’s not efficient. After the tank empties, the only way to fill it back up is to manually shovel sand back in with a metal filter on top until it’s full. It takes about 10-15 loads of sand, and each load is about 3 scoops with the shovel. Not gonna lie, it’s sucks, but more importantly, it takes an easy half hour to fill it back up. Is there a way to use a motor with a hose and filter attached to it to suck the sand up back into the tank? Would I have to change the filter out for the motor non stop? Just looking for an easier way to do things. I’ll attach three pictures of the sandblaster to give you guys a better idea of what I’m working with.

I'm currently a ME major in an ABET accredited program. I'm in my second semester of sophomore year retaking a couple classes from last semester, the first classes I've ever failed.

I interned at a  local engineering consulting firm in an industry I thought sounded interesting. The internship went well, and I think I did pretty well. Got good reviews and all that mess. I was promptly offered a job. Kind of the dream, right? (or at least, not the nightmare)  
Well, I've been doing the job as a salaried big boy for several months now and feel like I am in WAY over my head. First, the learning curve is just bonkers. That all makes sense to me given the huge amount of information I'm expected to retain, and I've actually enjoyed learning about most of it. I knew next to nothing about this industry and learning about it has been cool.  


But that's also the problem: I know next to nothing about this industry, and I feel as though I'm behind. Now I'm starting to get handed pretty hefty projects.  


It feels super goofy having just graduated from college and then getting sent places where I am supposed to be the ""expert"" that's being consulted. 9 times out of 10, the contractor I meet with has 100 times the experience and knowledge that I have, yet our client is paying my company thousands and thousands of dollars for me to go out there knowing little more than how to tie my shoes competently. I've avoided exposing myself as a total fraud thus far (barely), though my lack of confidence has resulted in weird interactions a few times, requiring the involvement of my superior.  


I have a very hard time making decisions and communicating because I have maybe 9% confidence in my knowledge-base. I dread making calls because I know I won't even know some of the terms they're using and fear looking like an idiot (especially when being listened to by other consultants in the office).   


I'm starting to suspect that the problem lies within myself rather than the company. I chronically don't have an opinion on what I'm consulting for, though I think at this point I should. When asked ""what should I do with this component?"" or ""is this installed right?"", I never know the answer because I'm indecisive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I genuinely lack the ""soft-skills"" required of a consultant. Even though I'm fairly social, I'm not really very good at work banter, nor do I know enough to have good shop talk.  I don't think quickly enough on my feet to be able to deliver helpful, concise answers or comments, and generally just end up say ""ok"" or ""yep"". In short - the shit-opposite of what a consultant should be. It leads to me feeling defeated all day at work. I'm just really not good at the client thing.  


Is there a moment where it ""clicks""? Do I just need to learn more in order for my own opinions to arise? Is ""being decisive"" something I can practice, or do I need to think about switching careers to something where my job isn't to deliver useful information to clients? I can't really just up and quit because companies weren't necessarily knocking down the door to hire me, and I've got to pay my rent. I'm getting good reviews at work still, but I can't help but shake the feeling that people are starting to realize that I'm not catching on as quickly as I should.

97,Choosing Between Two Job Offers,1557169028,"I am using a throwaway in case one of my potential future employers also uses reddit.

Here is my situation:
I have job offers from two well respected engineering companies. They are both in the aerospace sector and are both making me substantial financial offers between 90 and 100 grand/year. For my level of experience these are very high, the reason being I have a rare combination of experience in both engineering and mathematics, with project management from a prior job. Let's call these placrs Company 1 and Company 2.

Company 1 wants me to work on flight control software for commercial and defense applications. Company 1 has great benefits, including paid family leave, and bonuses at the end of the year based on performance. Likewise, they are in a great low-cost location near major cities and the ocean. While the job itself was pretty cool when I interviewed, I couldn't help but feel a little bit of doubt regarding the experience. I suppose I was reminded of the corporate beurocracy that lead to me leaving my first job. This is a great opportunity, but I have a nagging feeling in the back of my head that this shouldn't be my first choice, though I couldn't tell you why specifically. 

Company 2 I applied to haphazardly when I couldn't settle the doubts about Company 1 in my head. They moved surprisingly fast and made an offer on the spot for me to join their team. The work they are doing is more theoretical and closer to my research in grad school. They are offering me slightly more money and a sign on bonus, but the area is in a higher cost of living, enough so Company 1 is paying me more all things considered. The location is also near major cities, but the weather isn't so great. However, Company 2 expressed strong interest in training me and getting me to move up once I start. I was told they made a special req for me so I could join quickly at a competitive salary. I'll be honest, I had such a good strong gut feeling after my interview with them that I knew I wanted to work on their team. Apparently they universally loved the presentation I gave during my interview. Their benefits, so aim told, are not as good as Company 1.

0,Help Determining Raise Amount?,1557167221," 

Hello everyone!

I need some help determining how much to ask for a raise. I've been working as an Electrical/Controls Engineer for a manufacturing plant for what will be 3 years this June. My main responsibilities include:

* PLC programming (developing new software as well as troubleshooting existing software)
* Vision work (Cognex camera systems integrated with PLCs)
* Additional EE/Controls work to keep machines running (updating/creating wiring diagrams, parts ordering, other troubleshooting)

Recently one of the four EEs we had left the company strictly for money, leaving us with just three. He was offered a position making $20k more to do the same work he was doing here and obviously took it. Now I have taken over his work (same as mine, but he was more of the vision guy before me) which means I am responsible for more machines on a daily basis. In addition to his work I am now growing to have the following responsibilities added to my plate:

* Support for another facility that we own (located out of my home state)
* Full network support for a new manufacturing network we installed that will only continue to grow (this includes network monitoring, keeping switches up to date, and keeping track of what is on the network)
* Desktop app development/support for a data collection app
* We also are implementing a whole new network for some of our staff and I will be the person supporting that network alone (they were going to hire someone for this but we talked and determined there wouldn't be enough work for a whole person so I will do it instead)

As you can see, my list of responsibilities is growing rapidly. I love the challenges that each role presents and feel fully capable of doing each (so far I've been doing a good job according to my supervisor). I've also received training courses in each of the responsibilities listed (general 1 week courses that give me a good basis of information).

However, given that my coworker left and I now have a lot of responsibility/knowledge they are more willing to work with me financially to keep my around. It used to be that at the 3 year mark employees get a level increase with a pay increase, but that has been taken away. My supervisor is fighting for me to make more and I want to have an idea of a number to ask for so I make sure I'm getting what I am owed and what I am worth.

Right now my salary is about $10k under the average salary of my state for the same position with similar experience. When we begin these conversations of what a raise will look like I was thinking of splitting the discussion into two sections and asking for one large raise that covers each. The first being my current job and roles, the second being the network support role that they were going to hire an entire person for. So my question to reddit is, breaking each apart, what would a fair amount be to ask for each?

Tl;dr

I'm about to hit 3 years with my company, took over another persons work because they left for more money, and am about to take over a role that my company was going to hire someone for.

I also do not take physics or further maths, and I'm not sure if that may be a problem (I have never liked physics, even at GCSE).

12,Don’t want to lose talented intern,1557124701,"Hey all, this might be an atypical question for this subreddit, but I wanted to ask the community their thoughts...

We have two interns right now. Both have degrees and I believe they only took internships because they couldn’t find engineering jobs before their graduation. One of them is really really good. The other is competent, but doesn’t shine like the first. Both have been given positive reviews to management, but I think the first one stands out as a must-hire.

I have already told management that both are good, but one is better. I think they’re both in a horrible spot working as interns despite having degrees, and I would never have wanted to be in that situation myself, and took the first opportunity I had to get out of it, when I was. What I would like to do is firstly make sure that the more talented intern gets what she deserves salary-wise (even if that means going to another company). Secondly, I want to pressure my management not to low-ball her, because she’s worth the money, and I feel like she is insulted daily with her hourly rate, and wouldn’t accept another insult like that. And in my experience, that’s exactly what my company does.

What I am considering doing is to ask her what her baseline is, and then tell management to offer slightly more than that, even if it costs us the opportunity to hire the other intern. I’m afraid management is going to try to hire both, and lowball them both, and then get neither, or only the less competent one. And while that one might be fine, the other would be much more valuable.

I truly don’t have any power in the situation, other than how management values my opinion. I have been told that they do, so I want to use that power to ensure we are able to build &amp; afford the best possible team. In the long run, I feel that’s more important than anything else, including my own compensation. So that leads me to my questions...

Should I directly ask her how much she wants? What if that creates an expectation and then management can’t do that and attempt to hire both? Unfortunately I believe they’ve both been told that management wants to hire them, if possible. So what if that means the other never gets an offer? I would definitely feel bad, especially since the first would know that to afford her, we couldn’t hire the other. They are friends and I think that she would feel bad about it. Do I just tell her that part to get her to come down on her minimum? I’d really like to give her what she wants, if possible...

44,How to chose a job offer?,1557040814,"I am an experienced engineer, and I am fortunate to be in a position of receiving 5 job offers from major companies (I prefer major companies than boutiques).  All 5 companies have their pros and cons, and despite building a point system to judge which one to pick, I am hoping to get a second opinion here.  Also, this is not US based.  

&amp;#x200B;

In your experience, how do you judge which job offer to take?  I have ranked the companies per the criteria below (Companies A to E) and I have also arranged the weight I put in each criteria from 1 to 10 (1 = top, 10 bottom).

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Type of role**

All the roles offered are lead roles, although for two of them the roles are as a senior lead.  

A &gt;B &gt;D &gt;C, E

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Salary**

All 5 companies offer competitive salaries, with a difference of 10% between them.  The difference is within my tolerable ballpark so I am satisfied (I am more interested in career growth than immediate salary).  

A &gt;B, C, D &gt;E

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Career progression**

This is important as I want to continue to grow my career.  I ranked these roles by opportunities to continue progressing above the role offered and the time it takes.  

A &gt;B &gt;D &gt;E &gt;C

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Interesting projects**

Being an engineer, I love taking on challenging projects, so I have factored in the current pipeline of work.  

C &gt;B &gt;E &gt;A, D

&amp;#x200B;

**5) Leap of faith**

Similar to how I judge whether I want to work with the company, I also consider the leap of faith a company takes in making me an offer (how much of a leap compared to my current role are they willing to offer).  

A &gt;D &gt;B &gt;C, E

&amp;#x200B;

**6) Individuals I want work with**

After such a long time in the industry, some of the companies have people I want to work with.  

C &gt;E &gt;A, B, D

&amp;#x200B;

**7) Engineering prowess**

I want to work with smart and driven technical people.  

E &gt;C &gt;B &gt;A &gt;D

&amp;#x200B;

**8) Peer feedback**

I've spoken to peers working in all 5 companies to get a feel for the culture.  

E &gt;A &gt;B &gt;C &gt;D

&amp;#x200B;

**9) Reputation of company**

On a personal level, the reputation of a company is a consideration as I want to work for a company I can be proud of.  

E &gt;B &gt;A &gt;D &gt;C

&amp;#x200B;

**10) Vision of the company**

Although all companies exist to make money, some companies are driven solely by revenue and not a bigger vision, e.g. SpaceX.  

E &gt;A &gt;B &gt;D &gt;C

&amp;#x200B;

Using the above, I assigned points to the ranking (5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 point for lowest ranking, and if two or three companies are grouped together, they share the same points for the rank, e.g. 3 companies in 3rd rank would all get 3 points).  I have also assigned a modifier, so ranking top in the 1st criteria is worth more than ranking 1st in the last criteria.  

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up with A &gt;B &gt;E &gt;C &gt;D.  The top three (A, B, E) are all close, so I am really interested to hear the suggestions you may have.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there is the option to pick the best one, and just change if it turns out to be the wrong choice.  However, I prefer not to move around jobs too often in particular for a senior role (industry will wonder why I change jobs so soon).

53,The bigger (networking) picture,1557009326,"Hey all.

So, it’s becoming more relevant for me in my current job for me to understand the more advanced elements of the networking landscape.

I’m wondering if there’s somewhere I can go that can inform me on what the larger industrial (and internet) networking picture is and how the various elements of the experience function and what their purposes are. 

I’ve been working as an instrument and control systems engineer (I’m a chemical engineer by training) for 3 years out of college now, but my understanding of industrial networks is rather inadequate.  I eventually would like to start building a IIoT skill set, and this information would certainly be a prerequisite

I’m interested in somewhere that I can see this bigger picture from a 500 foot view (what the pieces are and how they fit together), then start focusing on the elements (protocols, hardware, the interchange of information between users and devices)

Graduating in 2017 with a bachelors in MatScie (I'm not in the US, or Europe for that matter!), and started working afterwards in a Big 3 O&amp;G Service Company (yeah, job market wasn't great for MaSci). This was a 1 year contract. After it finished I started applying for Masters programs and got into a TU9 university in Germany. 

But now the company has come back and is offering a fulltime position with full benefits etc. The pay is good (as compared to the local market), and there is high career growth within the company. But then again, it's O&amp;G, with a 24/7 stressful job. I quite like the work aspects, and working hands on with stuff (the physicality of it all isn't an issue with me), but looking at the future, is it worth dropping this opportunity and going for a masters and then looking for a job in Germany?

As a sidenote, if I opt to do a Masters in MatSci 2-3 years down the line, what's the impression my CV is gonna give if I jump from O&amp;G services to this field? I am going to be in effect, a fresh engineer all over again.

What I do know is, in capacitive circuits, amperage leads voltage.

I know in common circuits like an AC motor they'll include run capacitors in the start windings to keep the amperage out of phase with the run windings by 90 degrees, thus allowing lower overall running amperage.

On the runs caps I've seen, the rating is usually +-6% and sometimes 10% with larger capacitance.

When is the start winding phase considered to be too similar to the run winding phase to efficiently operate?  At what angle?

Also from what I've been taught in school voltage input usually has about a 10% margin of error for simple motors and machines, don't know if this is relevant or correct by modern standards.

92,Is it hard for a good engineer to not be pushed into management,1556921646,I have been with my company for about a year and I'm climbing up fast. I went from 1 to architect quickly. I love the math and physics. But I am being pressured more and more to become a manager. That's the part of my current position that I hate the most. Can I avoid this?

94,Degree for working with Meta material?,1556917076,I have been trying to decide what to do with my life recently and I came across the emerging field of meta materials. I couldn't seem to find what degree would be best to work around this field. Would it be more on the engineering side or the (theoretical)physics side?,AskEngineers,False,Cyan_Ninja,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bkdeja/degree_for_working_with_meta_material/
95,Is contract to hire something I should consider as an engineer with a year of experience?,1556915270,"I graduated from my university in May of last year in electrical engineering. I found a job immediately and jumped on it, turns out it's not what I want as I'm the only EE in the building and no chances for me to grow.

I've been applying places and have had about a 50-60% call back for most jobs, but I keep getting calls from recruiters asking me if I would consider contract to hire. Any input on this? Should I steer clear? I don't want to job jump, but I need to get out of my current environment and actually enjoy what I spent years of school studying. Any input would be appreciated.",AskEngineers,False,Botchycoder,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bkd2xo/is_contract_to_hire_something_i_should_consider/

98,UCI ChemE or UCSD NanoE?,1556912886,"I'm trying to decide between transferring to either UCI Chemical Engineering or UCSD NanoEngineering (would transfer to ChemE asap, they are in the same department) from a California community college. I'm very torn between the two schools and not sure which to attend. If anyone could give some pros and cons to help my decision it would be greatly appreciated. 

I've heard some things about UCSDs ChemE program being under the umbrella of nanoengineering? How would this look for future job prospects?",AskEngineers,False,Brekfastnook,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bkcn7y/uci_cheme_or_ucsd_nanoe/
99,how to build my own smartphone?,1556912713,"how would I go about building a custom made smartphone?
say I would have chosen a list of components, maybe name the exact chips and sensors, would I be able to outsource just the work of assembling them by design from my 3d model, and maybe boot Android-compatible OS of my own?
are there companies that do such thing, or I could collaborate with?
and regardless if outsourcing, experts with which expertise would that require?",AskEngineers,False,high_byte,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bkcm2c/how_to_build_my_own_smartphone/
