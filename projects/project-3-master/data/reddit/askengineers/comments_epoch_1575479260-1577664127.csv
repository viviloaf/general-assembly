7,I feel like i've done the wrong degree,1577654794,"Hi all

So basically, I studied a degree in Product Design, completed the course, got to have my photo taken wearing a silly hat etc etc. This was 2 years ago this coming spring. 

Since graduating, I have managed to land a job at a local company which is a bit of graphic design and product, I use the usual suspects software wise, (adobe suite, solidworks etc.) Even though I have ""Design **Engineer**"" in my job title, I don't really do much engineering aside from material selection and dealing with manufacturing (CNC routing, laser cutting and joinery in house) and a bit of outsourcing. 

Basically, I enjoy my job, but it is not really what I would like to do long term, however alot of the jobs that are more for me design wise, such as NPI roles (which involve doing alot of what I did at university) such as prototyping, model making, working with CAD etc, require a Mechanical Engineering degree. 

I seem to feel now (at 24) I have made the wrong choice with what I studied at University. I couldn't do an Engineering Degree at the time because I did not do an A Level in Maths, and at the time the University I was accepted in to did not offer any engineering foundation degree courses. 

In my own time I have self taught myself things such as Arduino, messed around making things with a 3D printer, and I have recently started self learning the Mechanics part of A level maths through youtube. 

I find it amusing however that a friend of mine who studied ME wishes he did the course that I did, as he said everything he did was 90% math, how ever I wish I did the opposite. I can't do another degree now either so that route is closed. 

What are the thoughts of the experienced engineers in this sub? I know at the end of the day a degree is just a (very expensive) piece of paper that can open the door to opportunities, and I know that you do learn more when working in industry (i've realised that myself in my current role) I am just not so sure and feeling a little bit stuck in between a rock and a hard place. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 

I think i've done the wrong degree and now stuck in limbo with career paths.",AskEngineers,False,brownerboy96,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ehbsot/i_feel_like_ive_done_the_wrong_degree/

10,Advice whether to finish Grad school or pursue my career.,1577651642,"Hello all,

I am on a crossroad right now. I finished my undergrad in Systems Engineering and immediately jumped into grad school for Manufacturing engineering. During my undergrad, I had no internships or co-ops because my city did not offer many engineering opportunies. Because of that, I moved to a bigger city and continued my studies. 

Also, I was working throughout my education in an unrelated bookkeeping job. After my first year of grad school, I applied to a co-op for a medical device company as a manufacturing operations co-op and got the job! It is paid, so I quit my old job and started gaining crucial engineering experience.

The drawbacks of switching from my super flexible job to the 8-5 job is having tone down on my studies. They didn't offer a co-op course for grad students, so I was registered as a part time student. AND because of the part time student registration, I have to start paying my loans. 

They loved my performance, so they are offering me to keep my position until summer, since it is by terms. (Also, I don't know if I will be offered an engineer title after my co-op, as they tend to rehire co-ops after they gain engineering experience elsewhere). 

The dilemma is, I really enjoyed working at an engineering firm, and to be quite honest, I want to get paid more. If I were to go back to school, I would have to get another job during my studies (because of payments). I only need one year, plus the thesis. I still have plenty of time until the end of my co-op, but I don't know if I should continue working and possibly go back to school In a couple of years, or just finish focus on school. I am also getting a bit of pressure because of my payments and loans. 

From experienced engineers, I need to know how having a master's in manufacturing will assist me. Money will be tight if I continue school and maintain my payments with a minimum wage job. I was also very unhappy with working during my first year of grad. I had no time whatsoever. 

If you need more details, I will share more.

11,Passed FE Exam in 2003- So what does that mean now?,1577647071,"So I graduated with a BS Chemical engineering degree and passed the FE exam in 2003.

I've been teaching full time still then and I have grown to love controls/education. While I still love teaching, I'm curious about what my skills would get me in the open market. 

My questions are the following:
1) Could I sit for the PE (passed test in Ohio/work in Indiana) at some point? Would that matter at all?
2) If test the Job market with my knowledge of controls/robotics/ mechatronics, would listing this accomplishment matter?

12,Is it necessary to be an expert on the field to manage research project?,1577645546," 

Hi everyone. I'm a mechanical engineer in Turkey. I've 4 years of experience in finite element analysis field and currently work for a defense systems company.

In our company there is a group of people who try to implement R&amp;D projects. In Turkey everyone says that you don't need to be an expert to manage a project, project leaders responsibility is to create a team and lead them. It is same in my company and those who try to lead projects are not expert of any field. Of course they are engineers but they don't have special area of interest. For example there is a project which is related to material failure due to fatigue. The one who leads the project only knows basics of fatigue. He doesn't know what designer needs, what test engineer can give, what analysis engineer needs for input etc. He wanted me a fatigue analysis and I said him I need load information. Without second thinking he went to test engineer and wanted him to collect data from the field. But he did not ask me any detail neither he did not give test engineer any detail. Test engineer did his job and gave me the data he collected but it is useless for me. Now project leader says you did not tell me what you need. I said what I need but he did not think there might be options. He did not ask me the right questions. He did not clearly define what he needed from the test engineer. I cannot know what project leader knows or does not know. I think the problem is that he doesn't know about fatigue testing and analysis. I think if there will be a project than the project leader has to know the field. No one agrees with me. I generate an analogy. For example I am a manufacturing engineer and want to manufacture a part. If I don't know what tolerances I need, which machine make this part in these tolerances, technician will make the part but if there will be problem with assembly then it is not technicians fault but mine.

I am curious how is it in other countries. Can you tell me examples of your companies?",AskEngineers,False,omerfadem,/r/AskEngineers/comments/eh9q8g/is_it_necessary_to_be_an_expert_on_the_field_to/

14,"Semi-recent industrial engineering graduate stuck in miserable dead end job, feeling hopeless and need advice on how to escape.",1577638184,"Hey everyone, sorry for the oncoming blog post but I'm stuck in a shitty situation as the title says which is really making me hate my life and I could really use some guidance from the community as to what to do.

So I graduated last winter with a degree in industrial engineering from a well regarded state school. My grades were decent, I graduated with a 3.3 GPA. I know that's not great, but I really screwed up freshman and sophomore year and had around a 2.1 going into the second semester of sophomore year, so I really busted my ass and got all As and Bs from there on out (with the exception of one D due to failing an exam because I had to go home for a funeral instead of studying for it.)

I also had two co-op semester experiences in process improvement with a manufacturing company. The first semester went okay, it was mostly just learning the ropes because it was my industry experience, I didn't accomplish much but I learned a lot and my supervisor wrote me a good review. I really hit my stride for the second rotation, I automated the plant's excel accounting process reducing the work load from about 4 hours every week to less than 5 minutes per week, and I created a failure analysis system which reduced the average time to fix production machines from around 8 hours to around 2 hours. After this rotation my supervisor wrote me a great review. 

The problem was this company ended up having a really poor fiscal year my senior year, and stopped hiring new employees so they couldn't hire me after graduation. I tried for the entirety of senior year to find a job, applying to positions on my school's online alumni job board, online job sites, and through school hosted engineering career fairs (this was my main focus because I figured it would be much more efficient and have much higher returns to go through recruiters specifically here for engineering graduates at my school.) I applied to at least 250 positions, mostly in manufacturing, and maybe got 8-10 interviews out of this. I don't mean to sound arrogant but I think I interview pretty well. I put in countless hours of interview prep with my school's career services by doing many mock interviews, and going through their interview material. I also had my resume critiqued by both career service counselors and industry recruiters multiple times through a service offered by the school. I'm also naturally fairly confident and outgoing, I enjoy socializing and meeting new people and have absolutely no problem conversing with strangers. 

Despite doing all this, I didn't get any job offers before graduating and was beginning to lose hope, when I got the job offer for my current position a few weeks after graduation. My current title is software engineer,for a company which produces a project management and logistics software. They made it seem like I would be doing interesting work designing user interfaces and experiences which is something I really enjoyed in college, and they made it seem like I would be getting great experience and interacting with clients a lot which seemed great. I naturally took the job because I had already graduated and it was my only option, and it seemed like a good position. 

I have been here for close to a year now, and the way they described the position to me initially couldn't have been further from the truth. This job is seriously making me hate my life. There's nothing for me to do but menial documentation work and occasionally testing a feature one of the programmer's implemented. I haven't learned a single new skill in the year I've been here, nor have I learned anything that can be transferred to other jobs. There's absolutely no autonomy or creativity involved in my work, I'm given instructions with no leeway and I have to fill out a time sheet everyday with what I did to the 15 minute mark (which also prevents me from learning anything during work that's not directly required for the job). The company is very small, so they don't have the resources to develop their employees in anyway beyond what is required for the job, and there's also no room for promotion because of how small it is. Also everyone here is very antisocial and I'm stuck in an isolated cubicle for the entire day.

I'm not the kind of person who doesn't want to work, I really enjoyed going into work everyday as a co-op, but this job is making me so depressed. I hate waking up in the morning and I feel like my future is fucked because I'm stuck here with no way out. I studied industrial engineering because I really enjoy learning, solving problems and making improvements which help people, but here I'm not solving problems, learning anything or interacting with people.

I know people always say that it's easier to get a job when you're already employed, but I'm not sure how to leverage this into a different position because I'm not learning any transferable skills. Also I feel like I was a pretty good candidate my senior year with my co-op experience and interview preparation and I couldn't even get a good job then. Now I'm pigeonholed in this odd spot where I've moved away from traditional industrial engineering jobs, but I'm extremely under-qualified to work in other software jobs. 

Also I don't really have a good network or industry connections (outside of the company I co-oped for which is still not hiring) because I was a dumb, depressed freshman and sophomore who didn't realize the importance of networking or joining relevant organizations until it was too late.

I've considered graduate school, but I don't think I could get into a good one due to my academic record from freshman and sophomore year (many C's, D's and F's and 6 withdrawals), and I just frankly don't have the time/energy to study for the GRE right now because I work from 7:30-5:00 and have a long commute and need to enjoy my weekends in order to stay sane. Also I'm not sure what I should go to graduate school because although I enjoy industrial engineering, I feel like it didn't give me enough hard skills recruiters look for compared to other engineering disciplines.

33,PLEASE READ! Has this happened to you at the plant?,1577567115,"Lengthy but worth the read: When I was 21 I got my Associates in Instrumentation and finished 2nd in my class, so my instructors persuaded me to apply with a company that was known to pay very well but was very hard to get on with. The interview was one hour of technical questions/scenarios and a three-hour hands-on test using my meter and troubleshooting/calibrating instruments. To my surprise, I got the job. I was 21, working four 10's (OT when I wanted it), making $30/hr with a $3,000 sign on bonus. However, the day I started at the power plant it just went downhill. The first morning I walked into the cafeteria for the safety meeting and shook hands with the 11 other techs I would be working with. The HBIC, Randy, would not shake my hand or even look at me. I thought it was odd but didn't let it bother me. 

Well, as the months went by I found myself sitting at the table in the shop at lunch every day and Randy would not stop throwing me under the bus. Literally, any thing I said or did to try to ""be a part of the group"" wasn't good enough for him. I'm not a suck-up and I for sure fit in with everyone at the plant so I never could understand why he acted like this. I was better friends with all the other crafts than my own. Eventually the younger techs close to my age in my unit would stop showing up to help me troubleshoot and they would steal my Polaris and take it to the other side of the plant. 

I was in my 6th month and somehow learning enough to get by, I took my ""first year test"" early and in front of everyone Randy bet me a steak lunch that I would fail. Why would you want to see a younger tech fail? Well, I made a 98. Boy was he pissed. You bet I looked him in the eye at lunch that next week, took a bite of my steak, and said ""Thanks buddy"". That was the best day on the job. I showed him up. But guess what. It got even worse. 

Going into my last month on the job, I almost killed myself trying to do my job. It was a Friday, so just Randy and I were there. He was at the DCS as usual and I had a steam valve to replace. I went to the control room, had the operators isolate the valve, and went to work. I noticed though something was off and radioed Randy to come take a look. No answer. I radioed several times and finally he said he was on his way. No one came. An hour went by and I finally walked to the DCS and told him in person ""Please, I need help."" He said he was busy and would be there soon. He never showed. I started breaking open the valve and flew back as a piece of the valve broke and went flying past some operators who saw the whole thing. Turns out this 700 PSI valve was not isolated properly, just as I had suspected, but Randy insisted that I fix it or there would be consequences. I quit shortly after. 

It's hard to explain but my mind was not in the right place working there with him, I couldn't think properly and was always under pressure. I think what happened was my supervisor talked me up after my interview and before I started Randy decided he didn't like me. He was also 4'11 and probably had ""Little Man Syndrome"" but I never once commented on his height or size.

So I was wondering since my monitor supports HDMI is there a way around hooking up an audio port with HDMI port in the monitor? Or is it possible to like tear apart HDMI wire and possibly get audio out from one of those wires? I do have an HDMI to AVI convertor and an HDMI to VGA convertor both with audio out. And I’m trying to hook up my PS4 slim. I do have an additional HDMI and about that if there’s a way I could connect two HDMI cables together by cutting them in half and connecting other HDMI cable to that?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working for 2 years now as a Manufacturing Engineer (Mechanical Engineering background) having split my time between R&amp;D for a prime aerospace contractor and currently an R&amp;D satellite bus provider. I've really enjoyed it so far but now I'm looking towards my next roles/next moves and the possibility of investing in a graduate degree given my short term (5 years) and long term goals (10-20 years). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering a change to Systems Engineering largely based off of my observations/experience/frustrations with current role. While I enjoy working in Manufacturing I largely find myself frustrated in how restricted we are in making changes/what we can do, while we have quite a bit of freedom in R&amp;D we're largely still restricted by mission requirements/product requirements flowed down by the customer. On top of that I find myself solving more people problems (personality conflicts between technicians, lazy design engineer, etc.) than I do technical problems and while that is challenging I figure I can get that type of experience anywhere.  I would like a better understanding of the overall design of the satellite as well as the why behind those requirements. 

Which is why I am asking if pursuing a masters in systems or space systems engineering would help with this transition? Or if it would be a valuable investment? Any and all advice is welcome, I did this years prior in undergrad on what would help me get into R&amp;D and am currently working in that so I figured I'd try it again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info: my current company does not do tuition reimbursement so I would have to pay out of pocket for some or all of this. I am willing to do this since I currently have zero debt and am making decent money.

I am kinda *forced* to ask here too. I have already written in the students section, but unfortunately no one could help.

I am doing a masters in robotics and automation and I have a huuuuuge problem learning the ABB Robotostudio.  
I have looked all over the internet for some good examples, but there are only a few poor tutorials from ABB that do not really provide any help when it comes to doing smth juuuuuuust a bit more difficult...though it only seems difficult to me cuz I am a newbie. In the future I might become better, but right now I might fail the course if I do not finish my projects.

And it is not easy to do so, as there is no one to ask, the course is online and there is no interaction with other students. Interaction with teachers is on weekly basis too,,,,which means whole weeks might go without result and it is a pity because I dedicate all my free time on this :(

So, is there someone who can point me to some Robotstudio community, where I can ask questions and get answers and learn? Someone knows of any online sources (besides the operating manual? :/ ) Is someone willing to help me understand while I am doing my exercises? How did you learn?

I mean, when I wanted to learn python and matlab there was a TON of information.

48,Focusing a VCSEL Array's beam into a line,1577546136,"Hello,

for my project we're trying to use a VCSEL laser with eight separately tuneable lines of emitter arrays . The laser has a built-in lens which defocusses the individual emitters' beams into one, circular beam, which keeps its shape almost completely when switching off individual lines.

For the purpose of the project, we want to be able to only heat up a strip of the test object at a time, and ""scan"" the illumination over the object's surface, one strip at a time. Therefore, we need to re-focus the de-focussed beams.

So far, we've got two round lenses, which are able to re-focus the beam to show the individual arrays. However, we don't want to illuminate individual *spots*, we want the entire *line* lit up. Therefore, we now need to keep it focussed along the y-axis, but de-focus it along the x-axis. 

My supervisor suggested a cylindrical lens, which sounds promising, however neither of us have worked with lenses before, and we don't quite understand how to derive the necessary shape from our constraints.

Could anyone here point me in the right direction for that? 

Material of the lens isn't an issue, we're not using *a lot* of laser power here, and never for long. It's just about the shape.

80,Is learning RPA (Robotics Process Automation) a transferable skill for an intern?,1577462673,"I posted earlier but I wanted some clarification after doing more research on the topic: 

Anyone know what RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is? Do you think it’s a promising skill to learn for an intern?

I recently received an internship offer for an RPA developer at IBM. The environment that I would be trained under is Blue Prism. I had some machine learning experience so I guess that’s why the manager hired me since that’s one of the skills they wanted. However, I am wondering if I will learn any transferable skills that I could take to a big company after this internship. Also for reference: I am actually not a CS major. I just have a lot of programming skills and have done some SWE (really some programming tasks for companies but I did not feel that challenged to say I’m a great SWE)  but I’m actually EE. That’s why I’m asking on here if this internship will be worth it aside from the company name.


The manager told me I have free reign over what projects I would like to do and I could get into an image processing. I would be coding in Python and I am the one that shapes my internship. This is what got me interested was that I have a choice in what my project is. I have been interested in AI for awhile now but from what I read online, RPA itself does not require much programming. Some articles are comparing RPA to AI but is that true?  I would like to hear some input from software developers, engineers, or anyone whose in this field because I am not CS so I’m not familiar with what a software engineer actually does on the job. 

My other competing offer is Raytheon but after working for them for a summer, I found that as an intern I sat around and did mundane SWE tasks and got paid to pretty much exist. On my offer letter they said I would be under an EE department, but on first day of work they switched it and my manager I was blindsided and this left a bad impression on me) .  I don’t want to repeat last summer. At least at this company I will be given a project I just don’t know if the skills I will get out of it will be transferable when I apply for a full time job and choose to go the full software engineering route. Would this even count as software engineering?

81,Flexible chemical resistant tubing for gas transport?,1577461922,"Fellow engineers,

I am currently working on a project where we need to recover petroleum pyrolysis products (tar, hexane, benzene, toluene, etc..) entrained in a gas stream.

&amp;#x200B;

Our present approach is to bubble the gas stream through glass impingers (a simplified packed tower setup) filled with solvents and Raschig rings (to maximize contact). To maximize product recovery, we are using a multi-stage impinger setup, i.e three or more of these solvent/packing filled glass impingers connected to each other using flexible tubing.

&amp;#x200B;

The inlet and outlet of the glass impingers use 6 mm OD glass tubes which must be connected together for the setup to work. I am currently using flexible natural rubber latex tubing ([like this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Yosoo-Speargun-Slingshot-Catapult-Surgical/dp/B01M63R7UV/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=silicone+tubing+for+glass&amp;qid=1577457007&amp;sr=8-2)) to connect the glass parts together. The only reason I am using this tubing is because it can stretch and form a pressure tight seal with the glass tubes of the impinger when PTFE tape is used as a gasket. I have tried using PTFE tubing, but it does not stretch and I cannot fit it over the glass tubes to form a seal. 

&amp;#x200B;

We plan to use acetone, toluene and dichloromethane as the gas scrubbing solvent in the impingers. Naturally, we expect there to be some solvent loss from the impingers which will come in contact with the flexible tubing. I do not think the natural rubber latex tubing mentioned above is compatible with the solvents. I am worried that it will degrade the tubing over time resulting in a leak. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you please provide suggestions for connecting glass tubes together (ideally using flexible tubing) and what material would be compatible with the solvents/products mentioned above?

So according to this book the heat conductance (capital C) equals mass flow \* specific heat. So then with this data for a cross-flow heat exchanger, you have the liquid inside and the gas outside, unmixed. you get heat conductance for both fluids (I am assuming 2 GPM glycol and 56 CFM fans). then you use the formula:  

NTU = UA / C\_min  

Now it says its good to use 2.0 as an NTU value (god knows where that came from), U for cross-flow heat exchangers is around 25 W/ m\^2 K and now I want to calculate how big my heat exchanger must be, according to that formula the more CFM, the more area I will need.

A little about me. I was a super talkative and inquisitive child. My mom still talks about how at 3 years old I asked her “why?” to almost everything she told me. At 4 or 5 I even asked how a TV worked, and she gave me some BS answer and I asked why it worked like that to which she couldn’t answer. (I apparently also got frustrated or upset when she didn’t have an answer for me). I tended to be shy at first to people I didn’t know, but warmed up rather quickly. 

In grade school, my favorite subject was math, and I was nominated for a gifted program, but fell a couple points short on the IQ test. (Which I like to blame on the person giving me the test as he talked quietly and I was too shy to ask him to repeat the instructions on a couple of the tests, but maybe I just wasn’t intelligent enough). I was a big LEGO kind of kid and also built lot of forts in the woods of our back yard. My grandparents bought me lot of science books which I believe I read all of. 

As I got a bit older, I enjoyed math less and leaned more towards science and engineering ideas. In high school I watched hundreds of hours of science videos on youtube when I got home from sports practices and should have been doing homework. At the time, I wanted to be a civil engineer (probably structural) as my family owned a commercial excavation company and that is what I grew up around. I worked at the company reading and entering in data from civil plans to calculate material quantities during my summers starting at 16. 

My decision to go for nuclear engineering actually came about during my senior year of high school. I came home from practice one day and had this massive physics homework packet I had to get done. Instead of working on it, I decided to get distracted and open up my physics book to the nuclear physics chapter and ended up reading the whole chapter, working homework problems in that chapter on my own and stayed up almost all night watching lectures on nuclear physics. I was sucked into the rabbit hole and needless to say, I didn’t do well on the physics homework assignment I had. In general though, I had a tendency to get bored of things after I felt like I had learned enough about it. I actually fell under the “region 99” section on the career placement test, meaning they couldn’t narrow my interests down to any field and that i liked to learn about just about anything.

Today, I still spend my free time trying to learn more about random things. Right now I’m on an investing and taxes kick as well as trying to learn MCNP (Monte Carlo Neutron Transport) coding.

9,Is it possible to reclaim land off the cost of Morocco?,1577371195,"If you gander at a satellite image of Morocco you will see several submerged islands south of the Guanches Islands. 

I believe that these are dormant volcanoes (just like the Guanches Islands). They vary in depth but typically the shallow ones are &lt;1km below the service. Apparently they are not on the Continental shelf but I am not sure of this.

  
My question is - can land reclamation ever be done on these islands? They are in very desirable waters for fishing rights and military strategy and Spain does want to steal more territorial water in this area. There have been a number of Spanish ""research"" vessels seen doing sonar activities around these islands and now there are rumours flying everywhere. 

I am no engineer but I am familiar with the reclamation of the Sparaty Islands, in Monaco, Singapore, Mumbai and Dubai just because the economic side of things are relevant to my profession. I cannot see those islands above being reclaimed, however, due to them being far in the Atlantic ocean. What is the science behind my presumption? Can they be reclaimed (ignore the practicality of current cost) either now or with the anticipated technological advances in the next 100 years?

20,Job prospects for electrical engineer in UK?,1577320942,"Hi all, long post ahead sorry

I'm in my 3/4 year doing an MEng in Electrical Engineering. My university offers Electronics, Electrical and Electronic &amp; Electrical combined degrees, but I'm one of 9 people on the purely electrical degree at Southampton. 

My degree focuses a lot on power and high voltage insulation, where as the EEE degrees allow courses such as machine learning and programming to be taken as optional modules. 

I did an internship at a large power company for a summer, and although the people were fantastic and really accomodating I didn't like the locations where I would be living if I was offered a  place on their grad scheme once I graduate since they don't build power stations in ""nice"" areas of the UK if you get me. The work was uneventful, just repurposing old machinery to scrape pennies together and simulating wether they could be used elsewhere in the company to make money.

So I don't really want to go into the power industry from my lackluster experience from the internship, yet my degree steers me towards it. Currently I find control systems engineering fascinating since it involves good levels of maths, physics and practicality in the problems we look at, so I can see myself working in that area. 

My question is; given the circumstances I'm in right now regarding my qualifications after completing my degree, what sort of industries am I a candidate for apart from power? Does anyone have experience in the UK for systems engineering and if so would you recommend it to an aspiring engineer? 

What's the work like? What's the salary like? I love engineering and am naturally inclined to problem solve, but I've read so much about UK salaries for engineers being mediocre and can understand why so many engineers go in to finance, but I would really like to feel secure about my future as an engineer. 

Thank you so much for reading my waffle, I'm not very good at articulating myself in writing so if you have any questions just let me know I can give more information about myself if you need more.

45,Second Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering?,1577250049,"Hi everyone, sorry in advance for the long post but I hope you can bear with me.

Ever since high school I have always been interested in technology and hoped that one day I would be working in a field where I would get to build new gadgets and technologies (I had a particular interest in robotics). When it came time for college I was told by my teacher that physics was a great stepping stone to any field of engineering. Throughout college I was also told by various physics professors that one could do anything with a physics degree. So I decided to pursue physics instead of engineering without doing much further research on the matter (this was my mistake, I should have done more research). 

However, I'm now beginning to realize that Physics has taught me a lot about how things work at the very fundamental level (which is useful and great), and how to solve problems. But that knowledge doesn't extend much beyond academics. For example, I know quantum mechanics but I can't design a laser or a transistor on my own from that knowledge. I know some solid state physics but I can't build a microchip or a semiconductor device on my own from that knowledge. I learned how to code a little bit in Matlab but only towards applications to physics problems. I don't know how to program simple AI and machine learning algorithms. I know electromagnetic theory but I can't build an electric motor. I can't design circuit boards, or robots, or really anything else. (If I took the time to read up on all these things then I could probably do them but that's beside the point I think). 

Essentially by choosing to do an Undergraduate degree in Physics I missed out on all the hands on building, application, and design work that I would have received from an Engineering curriculum. **So my question is would it be wise to go back and earn another bachelor's degree in engineering if my end goal is to get into the field of Robotics? or should I look for a Master's program in Engineering?** (My only problem with going for a masters is that it seems to be more specialized than a Bachelor's and I would rather know more than specialize in one area.) 

I'm hoping someone who has been in a similar situation can help me out. 

Also since graduating, I've been teaching myself electronics and some programming by reading books and working on side projects. But I can't help but feel like I'd still be missing out by not going back to school. **Is there much difference between learning through hobbyist electronics projects and the undergraduate engineering curriculum at university? If so, what would I be missing?**

I am trying to find the natural frequency of a semicircular beam when the bottom is fixed and the top is excited by a line force, as shown here [https://imgur.com/yRjh7KW](https://imgur.com/yRjh7KW). I have used two different FEA methods to find it, but they both yield different results.

Firstly, I tried a static analysis, where a unit force is applied. The spring constant k is then found from that, and using Wn=root(k/m) I found the natural frequency, which was 44.0 hz.

The other method I tried was a frequency analysis, with the bottom of the curved beam fixed and a line mass across the top. I found that none of the modes matched the natural frequency, and the one that displaces the beam in the same direction as the static analysis is 80.2 hz, which is very different to the result I got from the static analysis.

Anyone know why this discrepancy exists? I'm using the FEA tools in CATIA for context.

I  asked for a internship on a company. I had a resume on hand, but they  only accepted a letter issued by my university. I'm a mechatronics  engineer, my path focusing on automation. I learned a bit of robotics  and other stuff, but process automation is my prefered path and my ideal job. I  asked for advice for it in this sub little time ago:

The biggest difference being the machinery; i  will be working on heavy duty machinery rather than, let's say, three phase electrincal motors, PLC programming or instrumentation.  The fault is mine, I didn't made clear  enough what places I'd like to be in (those details were on my resume),  and it's not only a preference, is where I have more knowledge and  experience.

I am a 3rd year EE student and I am really lucky to have gotten two offers, but I’m not sure what is the right path for me because they are two different internships. Here’s the rundown:

Raytheon: this is a defense company and the position is the computer processors internship so it will be a lot of hardware and analyzing different waveforms. I worked for them last year as a operations engineering intern I mostly sat around all day, and did not get any EE experience and did mundane software engineering tasks. But every position is different and I feel like raytheon does do some cool hardware stuff so I’m a little interested in this new position they have offered me. But I don’t want it to end up like last summer where I literally sat around and looked at documentation. And usually they give interns full time offers after wards so this is a good opportunity but I don’t know if I like the defense industry since getting projects approved is slow.

Question; have any of you worked for defense industry full time? What was it like?

And now for my second offer:

IBM: a commercialized company. this is for a machine learning internship. The hiring manager said I have free reign over whatever project I would like to do in terms of my interests and apply it to their business. I do have a lot of python experience from research but I am not a computer scientist. I feel like if I choose this role, while I think I won’t be sitting around all day, this is a SWE role basically. I’ll get good coding experience but as an EE I feel like I’m straying away from my major and if I ever want to do hardware, employers will not want to hire me Bc I don’t have that hardware internship experience. But AI is also really cool and interests me as well so I’m stuck.

This is my last summer before I graduate so this choice is really important and can influence my full time job later when I graduate. 

So really what I’m asking is: what was your experience like working for either companies? As an EE would I be making a bad move going to IBM? In the long term what would be better full time?

I am complete novice to engineering and I do not major in the programme or any variant of it. I know a lot of people who do in fields such as environmental and civil, but I have no knowledge of it. 

I was speaking to an advisor at my university who urged me to apply for a Humanitarian Engineering programme. I have always looked at engineering as being a degree that would give me skills but I am aware that I lack the mathematical and scientific knowledge to do so. They have explained to me that it is a field (discipline?) focusing on humanitarian intentions in the field of engineering. Whilst this sounds amazing to me, I am still confused as to exactly what it means and what it entails. The programme to me looks like a mixture of approaches but I don't see how this degree would really help me. I do have an interest in helping people, but I am not sure as to what this is.

I apologise as this may be bread and butter for you but I feel like it makes sense to ask actual engineers.

31,What is Hardware Engineering like? Is it right for me?,1577015756,"I am in my final year of Electronics and Comms BEng in the UK.

My final year project is Hardware Acceleration for Circle Detection, so I've been writing software in Python and designing the hardware in Verilog on Vivado HLS.

I want to find a graduate job somewhere that might be somewhat similar to this project as I've really been enjoying the mix of hardware and software, running Linux on the ZYNQ board, Jupyter notebook etc. Also the fact that I'm designing a complete system.

So I've been looking for Hardware engineering jobs, but I'm concerned that with these types of jobs I'll be working on a small part of a big picture, or say, exclusively validation and verification.

My  graduate friend thinks I should be looking for start-ups, which sounds very tempting however I would be concerned that with a less established career path I might not have the the same opportunities to continue learning and progressing.

Is this even realistic?

I would be really interested to hear from anyone with more experience, as although I'm really enjoying studying this year, it's hard to see how this might translate to a job for the future.

So I would greatly appreciate if:

* you have any pointer/advice,
* could give me insight into what its like being a hardware engineer (types of role etc)

33,"Graduating College Soon, have a decision to make with my first job",1577007294,"Hello friends,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a bit of a crossroads with what I want to do when I graduate University in this coming May. My degree is in Aerospace Engineering but I am currently interning at a very large semiconductor. Obviously, I want to be in Aerospace and what I'm doing now isn't really related to that. I'm just looking for advice and opinions on what I should do because I need to make some decisions rather quickly. Let me lay out my situation (this will be a little long to explain the background):

&amp;#x200B;

I very much like working for the semiconductor company I work for. The work itself is interesting and challenging, but it's not at all related to Aerospace or Mechanical engineering. The plant is very close to where I live, about 20 minutes with traffic. I don't want to move if possible, I am currently living with my parents and want to use my extra income to pay off my student loans and stuff. Obviously, not moving limits my choices of companies to work for. There is a very large defense contractor that's a mile up the road from where I currently work, and working there would be essentially my dream job. I know a few people in different positions there who have been trying to help my applications get somewhere, but so far I have heard nothing from them or others. The company I work for also has a big hand in self driving cars which is partially related to my degree (since I have a focus in autonomous vehicle systems) so I can potentially transfer to that department later. My current job wants to offer me a full time position when I gradate but wants my commitment rather early, I have not yet received a hard offer and will probably ask for that when I go back in this week so I can make a more informed decision. They know that if I accept their offer that I won't be there for long term, they know I want to work in Aerospace, but taking this job offer in early January will essentially forfeit the potential to accept an Aerospace Job later on in the year. The big issue here is they want to know within the next few weeks because they need to hire somebody soon to deal with some stuff that's coming up. I know if I take the semiconductor job I am hurting future chances of getting an Aerospace job, but say I only stay at the semiconductor for a year or so, and hunt for entry level Aerospace jobs in the mean time, would being out of Aerospace for a year hurt me that much?

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? If the offer is good (competitive pay, benefits, etc.) should I take it? Should I wait a bit longer and hope the position they're offering stays open if nothing else pops up?

42,How to switch into Renewable Energy?,1576990116,"Hi everyone,

The title summarizes my struggles as of late pretty well. I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree 2 years ago and jumped straight into a tech consulting job due to the fact my other offers were lower in compensation and in the defense or automotive industries. I figured I would get onto an energy client as this consulting company has a big division for it. However, being hired into the federal space, I was not allowed to be on those clients projects due to the fact they are in the commercial space. Over the last two years, I have gained valuable client facing experience, leadership experience, technical skills such as SQL while working on data migration work and a strong network. Unfortunately, my client for the last two years is in the finance industry. I turned to you guys to see if there is any advice on how to pivot my career out of tech consulting and into renewable energy. It seems as if every posting of an engineering job in this field requires prior energy experience, which I have none. I have 3 engineering internships from college (2 in automotive and 1 in space).

My driveway is relatively long (200 ft), steep, and includes a switchback. 

Whenever it even dusts snow in our area, only 4 wheel drive trucks can get up the driveway. What usually happens is visitors get stuck at the bottom, and either:

1. I drive their car up - sometimes it's just turning off the traction control or being familiar with what speed you can go up.
 - Pros: Quickest solution that gets car up the hill &amp; easiest to implement
 - Cons: Only works in some situations (about half).
2. I pull their car up: this has only happened twice, where I used a recovery strap on the back of my car to pull them up.
 - Pros: works for small cars that are pretty stuck
 - Cons: harder to work with large vehicles (minivans); possible scenario where my car slides backward into their car (didn't happen, but seems possible based on car slippage in past). Involves getting on ground and hooking car up to d-ring shackle, etc., which is a pain when hosting gatherings where I'm are more dressy and I don't want to change or get dirt on my clothes.
3. Leave car: If it's a quick visit, they leave the car and walk up.
 - Pros: Easiest solution
 - Cons: Car remains at bottom of drive, single car width means having to move it in and out as people come and go; pain when hosting multiple people.

I'm open to any solution that is relatively easy to implement, not messy, and works on a variety of vehicles.

if physical energy can turn into thermal, how hard would i have to punch a chicken to cook it?

&amp;#x200B;

A:

KE (kinetic energy) = 1/2mv\^2

if you have a 25 kilogram arm/fist moving at 10 meters per second

your Kinetic Energy is equal to 0.5*25*(10\*10) = 1250 Joules

so you just punched that juicy chicken at 1250 Joules

so, how hard of a punch does it take to cook the chicken?

lets say we equate a 1000W microwave set to cook for 10 minutes.

1 watt is 1 Joule per second1000W at 10\*60 = 600,000 joules

SO!

if you need 600,000 joules to cook a Chicken

then 600,000 / 1250 = 480 punches

OR!

you would have to have an arm that weighs 12,000 kilograms

your 25kg arm would have to hit the chicken at a speed no less than 219 meters per second

Will it also break traction at 1.0 g, exactly, in a corner? I can't wrap my head around why this wouldn't be the case. Under braking there are two tires with more load than the other two.

I would be able to take these in my masters and also hope to work my way into a leadership role which may require a masters. 

I understand industry experience can be similar to a masters in terms of pay grade and finding other jobs. My question is with my specialization and career goals would it be worth getting my masters and playing it safe?

70,New graduate being put in lead role,1576898448,"Hello all, I'm a very recent graduate from a software engineering program in Canada,  currently employed but facing a job offer and unsure of how to proceed. As I also feel this will be a long, there will be a tl;dr at the bottom.

So since shortly after my graduation I've been working as an automation engineer for a small manufacturing company, it was the first offer I got out of school and honestly I've always been kind of a hands in engineer, very non-stereotypical software guy so I've appreciated what I could learn with respect to making things manufacturable. Theyve been an awesome employer overall and while the wages are perfectly average, it's still more than enough to live a comfortable middle class life as a young single guy. 

Now, I was the first engineer hired, or indeed staff member, with more than the bare minimum computer skill. This means any and all of my projects have been treated as technical perfection, I'm not exaggerating to say I have received zero technical criticisms in the past eight months. This bothers me, I've received project management advice but in my field I'm the in house subject matter expert. I am very obviously not ready for that as a fresh grad, just because a project is completed within constraints doesnt mean it couldnt be better and it makes me uncomfortable to not have any (non-self led) learning opportunities, in my discipline.

I did request funding for external training to the tune of 1200$ but it was shot down by upper management.

To make matters worse, theyve recently started putting me on custom projects for clients, designs to be reviewed by an external p.engg. This provides a bit of oversight but... I recently learned that they are charging about twice the average local rate and five times my wage. It does not bother me that they are making significant money off of me, thats kind of my job after all, what does bother me is how it's significantly above average and while I like to think I'm a good entry level engineer, that's what I am. I lack all experience to justify a rate like that. To add to that there is no in house electrical engineer, leaving me to be designing things outside of what I really learned in school. I have voiced this but the upper management really seems to be under the impression that if you lock an engineer in a room with the internet long enough any problem will get solved.

Final point related to the current job, they've talked about making a division for the custom work I've been doing and placing myself at the head of it. All of the above concerns times five apply here.

Now, totally unprompted, a former client offered me a job. They received some government funding to bring in someone specifically with an engg degree to start a new product line. Which is kind of the same issue as I'm having now. They're offering me a lot more money, it would roughly double my after-bill and taxes income. Theyve agreed that all my designs would be reviewed by a p.engg and I would be able to clean on one as a consultant as a mentor for half a day a week, it's even in the offer letter as part of my compensation. Kind of more for them really but whatever. It's a software job with a hardware flair/minor, versus what I'm doing now is the opposite. Theyve also offered me 100% rrsp matching and stock options after 6 months. Not sure how to value those.

The bad on the offer, still in a similar technical lead role right out of school, and a smaller company, not a startup but small enough that their goal is to be aquired by a larger company within a decade.


I have no idea, I feel like both have the potential to be great both short and long term. The current job im gaining so much valuable extra-discipline experience but the new job seems willing to actual hear my concerns on the technical lead issue. Is this a grass is greener thing? Is my current job acting like a normal engg firm? Am I just scared as a new grad and this is actually common? I just need some insight  from those who are.experienced enough to give it.

73,[UK] 2nd Year Mechatronics Student Looking For General Guidance,1576893902,"Hey, so I'm currently in my 2nd year doing ""Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering"" at a Russel group university.

Before university, I was stuck between choosing this course and aerospace engineering, but chose this as I thought it had broader application and looked interesting.

After 1.5 years of this degree, I've realized that I'm leaning more towards the electrical and computing side of the course and less towards the mechanics side. Luckily for me the course seems to be more biased towards the electronics / computing side anyway.

Examples of some classes I've taken so far / am currently taking: 

Intro to electrical / electronics engineering (LRC circuits, basic power engineering, diodes, transistors, op-amps etc.), Mechanics (2d/3d statics and dynamics), Signals &amp; Communications, Embedded Systems &amp; Digital Logic, Control, robotics.

Part of me now wishes I had gone for an electrical engineering / computer engineering degree as I feel like come the end of the degree I would have had better prospects. Before university I didn't even really consider electrical engineering as I used to find circuits tedious in physics a-level.  However, I loved the 1st year electrical class and everything made so much more sense after this

I suppose my worry is I might be at a disadvantage for a pure electrical / computer engineering job as I won't have gone into the same depth. (e.g. we learn how transistors work and how to make calculations, but not the actual physics behind them and how to build the transistor itself from scratch).

I have an option of doing the 4 year MEng or a 3 year BEng. I think I'm going to go for the 3 year BEng now but still have ambitions of becoming chartered.

My strength is probably programming as I knew how to program before university (python, c#, java etc.), using C for embedded systems has been beneficial in developing this skill at a lower-level. Could probably see myself in embedded systems / software development.

Not sure if I should try and get a separate taught MSc in electrical / electronics  to be more competitive, or if a 1st BEng degree will be enough to get my foot in the door.

I also have the option of potentially changing to ""computer systems engineering"" (which isn't exactly the same as computer engineering) for my 3rd year (as first 2 years are almost identical).

If anyone else took a similar ""in the middle"" course it'd be nice to hear how it worked out for you! :\]",AskEngineers,False,Tizer7724,/r/AskEngineers/comments/edjoyw/uk_2nd_year_mechatronics_student_looking_for/

Usually, I get by this by working with someone who does know how to do the problem correctly or by going to a professor's office hours. 

After taking an exam for one of my courses, I'm starting to wonder if I can't solve these hw problems, problems with answers, how will I be able to solve real-world problems without answers correctly once I am an engineer? And to add on to this, if I come out of classes with only a B grade understanding, not a 100% or 90% understanding of the course content, wouldn't that make being an engineer in the real world really hard? I feel like I might not even be able to do my job if I am to be an engineer. 

Is the solution to just have a growth mindset, and to know when I do actual engineering work I will just relearn and hopefully master what I need for the job? To believe even if I come out of a class with 75-80% understanding, it will be ok in the end?

TLDR: Are there any engineers who passed a class with 80-75% understanding of a course's content, are doing work related to that course, and are able to perform their job well?

I am only 21 years old and I've been looking into software engineering and got a job at a prestigious marketing agency as a junior software engineer (without qualifications). 

I'm running my own financial services company, making about 3k per month in profit, about 12k revenue monthly, and profits have been consistently growing by about 1.4-1.5x each month. I see a very bright future in this field and expect it to grow with me as I mature.

I've also set up an import export company and that's growing steadily, around 0.5-1k per month in profit. Potential growth is 1.3-3x+ per month, but it's since slowed to a crawl due to the holidays. 

Furthermore, I've set up an ecommerce that is extremely well-made that I created from scratch, the looks are stellar but the functionality is definitely lacking. 0k profit from this as of now and I've put this project on the backburner.

Should I just go apply at a bank since I'm already working in this field? Or maybe get a job in fin-tech?

17,Accurate low load ~12 in diameter turn table?,1576803577,"Hi folks,

I need to source a turntable mechanism for a 12"" plate with pretty high accuracy requirements but low forces on it.

I've got a hacked together solution combining a poorly toleranced slide bearing with a super oversized 6205 bearing for in plane constraint, but my rotary actuator is a bit underpowered so that binds up occasionally.

Can anyone recommend a vendor or product line that fits these requirements? All I've found are monster slewing rings meant for heavy equipment.

* Max payload mass is 5 kg, and max force during worst-case crashes is around 400 N before stall protection kicks in
* Assuming the rotation axis is perfectly normal to the plate (in practice any misalignment is software compensated), the 300 mm diameter plate needs to stay within a +/- 50 micron vertical envelope, ideally more like +/- 20 micron
* In-plane runout needs to be about the same, 50 micron at worst preferably less
* Weight is at a premium because this rides on a relatively fast linear stage
* This is a fairly low cost system, so the ideal price is in the low hundreds, and I probably can't go past $500 even for a 'perfect' solution.

I'm also open to fabricating something, but I don't have amazing capabilities in house so anything that needs tight flatness tolerances will need to come from precision flat stock.

53,"What do you call an open cycle gas turbine that uses a second working fluid as its heat source, rather than directly combusting gas or kerosene?",1576719257,"I trying to read about gas turbines as they could apply to Concentrated Solar Power or nuclear power plants. The concept that interested me is the idea that replacing steam turbine power generation with gas turbine power generation could have benefits in regions that have a lot of sun but not a lot of water, or in cases where there is a safety benefit to siting your nuclear plant farther away from major water sources to reduce risks of flooding or water contamination.

Most of the concepts I am able to find for these applications are Closed Cycle Gas Turbines that require the remaining heat coming out of the end of the turbine to be pre-cooled before it gets compressed again. To me this seems like partially defeating the potential benefits of a gas turbine, if you had an open cycle you would be dumping the waste heat out the back with no need to run any water pumps, condensers, cooling towers, etc.

What do you call such an open cycle gas turbine that uses a separate working fluid as the heat source? The other heat source might be molten salt or metal, nitrogen, helium, CO2, etc, it might be carrying heat from a Concentrated Solar Power tower or a nuclear reactor, for example. And you exchange the heat within the core of an open cycle gas turbine so as to evacuate the waste heat without requiring big active cooling infrastructure.

Is there also a name for the concept where you would locate this ""open cycle"" gas turbine within a an underground tunnel circuit or something like that, where you could potentially replace the air with a higher performance gas (and/or lower neutron cross section gas)? For example, imagine you have the abovedescribed gas turbine that uses a separate working fluid to provide heat. Say that it has molten salt coming through a heat exchanger in the core, and then the gas turbine is located in a circuit of tunnel dug out of solid rock, where all the air has been replaced by CO2 for higher efficiency potential, and so essentially forms a closed circuit that cools down passively through the tunnel walls without requiring the active pumping or condensing of water. Is there a term for this concept?

Finally, are there obvious reasons that I'm not finding as much information about the above concepts as I am about Closed Cycle Gas Turbines? Is pre-cooling the Closed Cycle turbine exhaust just not a problem, even without water? Does it offer other benefits?",AskEngineers,False,tuna_HP,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ecm14n/what_do_you_call_an_open_cycle_gas_turbine_that/

Just some background information first:

I graduated in 2016 with a degree in mechanical engineering and then got a job in 2017  as a junior test applications engineering. I left that job after 10 months as the pay wasn’t that great and the commute was brutal (1.5 hour drive both ways).

I then landed a job later in the year as a mechanical engineer in training, however I did absolutely no engineering work there, and mostly hands on activities assembling test rigs. It was a  very small company (9 employees in total) with a terrible working environment. I knew from day one that I wouldn’t last long there - besides the management team, the longest employee was there for 1.5 years. It was not unusual for people to get hired and then quit the next day. So after 8 months, I quit.

Between those jobs, and as of now, I have been working as a fire alarm technician, and have been searching for another job in my field of engineering.

58,I need advice on some subjects related to engineering degree,1576709828,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

Since a few months i've decided to make a career change. Currently I live in the Netherlands, 24 years old and work as a security guard. I've had a great passion for engineering and designing complex structures for a long time but recently i've finally made the decision to stop dreaming and actually work towards it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been learning math at Khan Academy for 6 months now and use The world of Math and Algebra 1 courses to learn math by  spaced repetition, though I usually study for around a hour a day if not more. Currently i'm on 40% on the World of math and I'm halfway through Algebra 1. After Algebra 1 I want to continu on towards Algebra 2 and also start alongside with Algebra 2, Linear Algebra.  After I've finished these 2 subjects and if I fully grasp the concepts of these basic math techniques I want to start working on calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have ADHD(Or what ever you want to label it, shot attention span) and usually these kind of decisions to start a new career or new college are most of the time impuslive decisions. Though when a passion about a subject or degree or anything sticks longer to me than a year or so I know I'm obsessed and really interested in working in that field. 

After visiting alot of schools I finally found the school I want to attent do. Though I got some questions and maybe you can help me out by giving me some advice and I would really appriciate any kind of feedback, that would help me alot! 

Since I'm a real slow learner and i'm taking my time to learn math on my own I'm kind of scared to start the degree at all. I want to go in as prepared ( With math &amp; Science ) so I don't fall behind when I take more time to understand other subjects. Maybe you could help me out and maybe give some advice how and where to prepare myself the best I can for the degree and what steps I should take, I should note that the school also offers 2 courses that will enlist en ensure my acceptance to that school though they are really expensive and I don't want a rushed course to prepare me for school to eventually make me fall behind in school because I did the acceptance test with a rushed course. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a long story and I'd love to tell you more about my journey towards engineering (Werktuigbouwkunde called in my country.) So feel free to ask me anything. And I'd love to review any advice and it would probably help me alot. Also I'm taking advice on what books to read to help me thru my journey. Currently I'm reading ""A mind for Numbers"" which I find really usefull. I use the pomodoro technique to switch between reading and learning and change subjects etc. 

Also I want to start working on CAD Inventor to start 3d modelling and I'm really interested in buying a 3d printer to actually experiment with my models. Thoughts? 

Please don't mind my english grammar, I'm not a native speaker and I'm doing the best I can.

I've mentioned all of this to my boss but his boss is keen on blockading any attempts to make our lives easier.  I've been trying desperately to leave basically since the day I started, and despite a few interviews and helping hands fighting tooth and nail to get me a new job but I've had no luck so far.  

Leaving is not an option thanks to student debt that I need to pay off.  Getting another role in the company will be hard since we just started a hiring freeze.  My gf is just graduating as an RN but job prospects for that position are currently brutal in Alberta as well.  

I'm not exactly sure of what to do beyond leaving the province or switching careers.  We've talked a lot about moving to BC but I can't see that helping my loan/financial situation.  I've been doing a lot of free code camp, several hours a week, but I don't know if that's going to cut it for getting a job on web development.

I'm not looking for answers on what to do but maybe some help with a strategy from anyone that's been in a similar situation?

81,Problem with new car and Car Dealer - water in gas tank / electronics // need advice for friend,1576668648,"Hello everybody I will try to be as brief as possible:

A friend recently bought a brand new car and on the very first day, he fills the tank with gas, drives 15km and car, suddenly, switches off !! Calls the dealer, explains the situation, dealer gets the car, calls the next day and says there was water in the tank that caused the trouble. Friend goes to the dealer, gets the ""removed"" mixture of gas and water and goes to the gas station to complain. Gas station calls back after a couple of days saying they are willing to pay for the damages that were caused. Friend goes to dealer (who also runs a repair shop) says **that despite cleaning the parts were gas runs through, all those parts must be replaced (\~3k euros total cost). (IMPORTANT NOTE: after thorough cleaning, the problem was that one cylinder of the engine was switching off after 3800 rpm)** Gas station agrees and gives money to friend and friend tells the dealer to order new parts and repair the car. Dealer gets the parts, replaces everything gives the car back. **The day friend gets the car back, the same problem occurs after 25km.** Gets the car back to the dealer, explains. Problem seems to have gotten worse. Dealer calls back **a couple of months later (!!!) claiming that the initial water in the gas tank cause problem on the electronics (ECU / ECM w/e it's called, idk the proper term in english) and that must be replaced.**

Friend says that it's not possible that this can happen from water in the gas tank and wants money back or new car.

The questions are obvious: 

1. Is it possible that the existence of water in the gas tank can possibly cause so much damage to a brand new car that is not possible to fix with 1. thorough cleaning 2. replacing all parts that gas runs through and also damage the ECU / ECM? If yes (or no), why is that (in a few - ELI5 - words)
2. Is the dealer bullshitting my friend? He denies responsibility, says car was working fine at the beginning (before the very initial tank fill my friend did) and blames the gas station for watery gasoline.

Thank you in advance.

86,need life advice for choosing a career,1576655573,"Hi All,

I am 25 years old and graduated from the University of Washington in 2017. I majored in Bioengineering and Biochemistry because I was premed at the time and also had interest in the engineering field. I was interested in pursuing a career in medicine because I grew up with type 1 diabetes. After I graduated, I spent a year working as a medical scribe in family medicine and emergency medicine to obtain some clinical experience while applying to medical school. I did not get accepted to medical school even though I had many interviews. When I got feedback from the admissions dean at the University of Washington SOM, she advised me to not go into medicine. She said one of the main reasons why I was not admitted was because I did not have good understanding of a career in clinical medicine. In my application and interview, I had said I wanted to go into medicine to conduct biomedical research and make a difference in people's lives and save people. She also said that I did not appear to have good understanding of myself. In response, I told her that after a year working as a medical scribe I realized that many treatments are limited/not good and that doctors often cannot fix people's problems. I told her that I noticed that working with people is difficult because they are often irrational. I also told her that working with doctors was kind of a miserable job because you see so much suffering that cannot be fixed. I told her that I did not have this understanding when I first put in my application for medical school. When I asked what I should do before reapplying, she said that I should become an engineer instead of becoming a doctor and take a few years to really think about what I want to do for my career.

After working as a medical scribe, I found a research technician position studying autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes. I don't study type 1 diabetes myself in the lab I work for (I currently study rheumatoid arthritis) but I am able to attend many presentations from other scientists at the institute studying type 1 diabetes. Also, the research I conduct related to rheumatoid arthritis is similar to the type of research done for type 1 diabetes. This last year was a good learning experience for me since I always wanted to study type 1 diabetes because I wanted to cure it. Since I was diagnosed at 13, many doctors, nurses, and dietitians told me that scientists would eventually cure type 1 diabetes. However I realized at the institute that people are not going to cure type 1 diabetes or many diseases anytime soon. It's because the diseases are too complicated. There are hundreds of different genetic variants and environmental factors and even random/stochastic processes that happen at the molecular and cellular level that eventually precipitate complex multifactorial diseases like type 1 diabetes. It's so complicated with so many different causes that the diseases are individualized basically. Also, there are major limitations to doing translational research on human diseases because you cannot obtain tissues of interest from whoever you want whenever you want (think brain tissue samples from people with brain cancer to study new compounds to slow progression of disease). Unfortunately you really NEED tissues from patients with disease to do any experiments to learn more about the diseases. Another negative aspect of research is that it feels like the goal is to just push out publications which don't make any tangible difference for anyone really. Scientific research often takes years and publishing in high impact journals is very competitive and takes lots of time/effort and still doesn't make a huge difference in the end to the practice of medicine. Extremely impactful scientific discoveries are often rare. Another negative aspect of doing research is that the pay is low.

So now I am thinking about finding an engineering position. I reapplied to medical school this year but I am not getting any interviews even with a much stronger application. At this point I feel like a job is a job and no one is going to save the world and very few people are going to make a meaningful positive change in the world. Sorry if this realization is very dark but it is just what I am thinking currently.

I am worried finding an engineering position will be difficult since I studied bioengineering in college and have no formal engineering work experience. I feel possibly drawn to working in medical devices such as ultrasound technology but I honestly don't know if this would make me happy. I feel like a lot of people sell out to become software engineers at companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft but I feel like this type of job would make me miserable but I would enjoy the high pay.

(I am worried about money because I live in the Seattle area currently. Living in the Seattle area and other urban areas I assume is extremely expensive and you need like probably 70K to make a decent living. I currently only make 42K per year in research and there isn't much room for moving up in my job with my degree currently. I have to live with a bunch of housemates and I hate it. Money is important to me since I am not from a rich family.)

93,"Engineering Managers: My Time To Leave, Do I Tell You?",1576640525,"In short, as a small business engineering manager would you prefer I tell you in advance that I am searching for a new job or wait until I give my 2 weeks? 

Background: I am the lead (and currently only) design engineer at a fairly small company. Historically my company has employed 2-3 design engineers + a draftsman at a time, but due to the company not filling roles I have been the only engineer for a year now. Things happened, circumstances do not matter, but as of today I realized that it is time for me to move on from the company. My job expects me to stay for the long term, they currently have no clue that I am ready to leave. I can stay as long as I want until I find exactly the opportunity that I am looking for, which could take 3 weeks or could take 6 months. 

Morals: It is a small company, and I care about the people I work with. Not that the company would go under if I left, but they would be in a lot of trouble and put a huge burden on a couple older engineers getting ready to take a step back/retire in the next year or so. I know in larger companies giving 2 weeks is standard as it gives enough time to pass projects, knowledge, etc over to other employees who have a basic understanding of your job. But in my case there is no one to pass my knowledge on to, and the company would not be able to even hire someone new in a 2 week time frame. I feel like the RIGHT thing to do is talk with my manager and tell him that I am going to be leaving some time soon to give them a chance to bring someone new in. I realize this will make it awkward for the foreseeable future as everyone will know I'm looking to get out and they had planned on me staying long term.

94,Is it realistic to enter engineering from technology/management consulting?,1576638988,"I graduated with a Bachelor of Electrical and Mechatronic Engineering, with Honours February of last year. After six months solid of applying for anything and everything I could, I got an offer from Accenture - kind of a shock given almost none of the engineering consultancies ever took me as far as a phone screening, opting for recorded video interviews instead, and rarely taking it beyond a few pre-baked questions about what I know about them, and what I can bring to the company, instead of a real discussion about passion and what I can actually bring to them beyond enthusiasm and a pretty parchment, and of course so many stories about my technical and teamworking skills - I actually have a heap of those.

I talked to Accenture about opportunities, the sorts of work I'd do with them, what I can learn, the sorts of common projects, etc. Tl;dr, new graduate, and not only did they mislead me with promises they could not keep, I have not been happy with the overall structure working here:

Everything revolves strictly and obsessively around money. I'm not solving real-world problems here, and I get only a limited exposure to the client. I don't have anything to do with the sections of the company that talk to clients and determine needs and solutions. I do not do any programming, although I have a list of languages I have at least some training in (C, C++, Java, Python... And then the definitely useless here languages like MATLAB, IEC 61131-3, VHDL, ASM). There are nearly a dozen layers of management, as well as parallel streams for different parts of the business, so even getting to talk to something in a particular part of the business is near impossible to decipher. I don't get to ever work industry-side, and it doesn't seem like I ever will, mainly being pushed into the finance side of government where the projects are admittedly and fortunately convoluted (the bit that I mostly enjoy) and even more business-centric than everything else.

What I have gotten is experience in a project where I just did testing and writing SQL, and that's all they've offered since, various testing roles, Selenium, so I've gotten good at that, and picked up a couple neat tools to make me even better, but it's just out of necessity even though I've not used most of it yet. I've gotten to work with pretty great teams of positive people, and skill up less technically inclined peers. I've experienced Agile (or a rough approximation. Government cannot be Agile, they're fundamentally opposing paradigms), and I've gotten really good at using Excel because it still prevails a lot where other software is likely more suitable, because some business guy knows what it is.

I've been unhappy pretty much since the month I joined though, a little over ten months now, so I've been spending what time I can since I started applying for jobs elsewhere, going to professional conventions, and any industry events I can sneak a day or a couple hours out of work to attend, hoping at least the fact that I'm currently full-time employed and sticking with a job that makes me severely unhappy means something for my ethic, and that my experience working with teams and using Agile methods is helpful demonstrating my softer skills.

I know that engineering consulting, or anything specific like manufacturing, will have a lot of this stuff anyway, that's the 21st century for you, but at the very least I can feel like my work actually means something in the world, instead of existing purely to cut costs and line some corporate customers pockets.

I'm really interested in machine learning, embedded systems, control, instrumentation. My professional experience before joining here was in PLC and SCADA, and I did humanitarian design work overseas, but it feels like none of that matters. I've never heard of anybody entering technology consulting like this and getting out, although I hear of plenty that find that technical doesn't suit them so much as management and they go the opposite direction.

I don't even care about the money - I never have - but it seems like it's all anybody has to live for here. Even most my friends are born with dollar signs in their eyes and don't care about anything beyond getting the highest-paying job possible for the minimum effort. I want something I can sink my teeth into, use existing skills, learn new ones, and overall just be a whole lot more dynamic and fast moving than the snail crawl I live with here. It feels like an eight-year-old could do this if it were legal.

It's depressing that the only advice I ever get is ""Yes, it's possible, no career has to be forever. You should work for us"" (which I do apply) (professionals at conventions and meetups), and ""move overseas, study some more, and get a job in another country"" (primely uber privileged and obviously highly cashed up people online), which as much as I don't care about money, isn't a financially realistic target.

I wish I could say a lot more about exactly what I want to do, because I get a ton of that one from people - just general people, not recruiters or anything - but I can only really say in a broad sense what I do (and don't) want to do.

Although it was always an option to go into the family business, and I did enjoy business-related topics and math; I decided to pursue a degree in biochemistry instead. My family was incredibly supportive of whatever I wanted to do. Unfortunately, I really didn't enjoy any of my biology or biochemistry classes, but pushed onward, and filled my final electives with as many computational, physics, and math-related classes as I could. After my degree, I took an additional year of math and computer science courses and eventually got a job as a software developer. This is where I'm at now. 

I've been working for a while; I'm single, have no kids, bought a new house, bought a new car, sustain a lot of hobbies, have travelled, etc. I realize by most metrics, I'm already set up quite well for life, which I'm grateful for. My only complaint would be: I'm only 28, and I feel like I already did life. Not literally, obviously, but I'm feeling an impending boredom that I don't want to endure for 40 more years. It'd be awesome to take on something bigger.

**Career Considerations**

On that note, my company offered to pay for me to go back to school for engineering and possibly business if I wanted. The discipline I'd pick likely wouldn't be in the same as my family's company, but my family is willing to form a ""new"" branch to their company if I want to get involved. I'm the only one in my generation of siblings and cousins with a degree, so any chance of a legacy is resting on me at this point. I don't feel pressured by this, just a reality.  

I also know a PEng is vitally important to my family's company structure, as they mostly bid government contracts. Whether it's fair or not, there seems to be a deeply rooted bias against techs and EITs, as many of them have been thrown out of or banned from coming to meetings. I'm not going to pretend to know the nuance of this. 

I know I will hypothetically be in a different branch of the company, and that branch doesn't necessarily need a PEng overseeing projects; but I wonder if not getting that designation will negatively impact my ability to take over the company as whole later on. I realize that aspect of the company will never be my discipline regardless, I won't have signing authority, and I'll be taking on the role of a suit ultimately. But I also want to set myself up to be respected by the dozens of PEngs and PTechs that will be working under me. Yes, respect is earned, but I'm more referring to the prejudices in this industry. It may not matter how good I am at managing people or pushing paper for that aspect of the business if everyone thinks I'm less qualified than they are.

**Choosing an Engineering Discipline**

I know my company now would most likely want me to pursue Software or Computer Engineering. This is fine with me, but I don't know if I'll be able to find a position where it'd be supervised by a PEng. I feel like I could easily make a case for pursuing Electrical instead, especially with minors available in computer engineering and/or software.  I assume it'll be easier to find a PEng supervisor in Electrical, but in that case, I'll likely have to apply to a different company with a different sub-discipline after the degree. That sort of sucks, because I really enjoy working with computers, but perhaps this is the wiser long-term business decision that I'll come to enjoy?

**Business Exposure**

Speaking of business, that's another area I'm not super experienced in. How do you learn to run a company? Yes, the company already has accountants, assistants, managers, etc. But how do I learn to manage all those people? How do I learn to manage massive projects worth billions of dollars splashed across the continent, while simultaneously trying to build out a new branch of the company (i.e. essentially running a start-up)? I realize at some point, it'll have to be learned on the job, but I feel like I should probably bring something to the table. It's not going to be too difficult to get a BComm alongside Engineering if I want, but I've looked at all the concentrations and courses and have no idea what matters most. No one in my family took business, this behemoth evolved from one employee over decades. I can't go back in time and see how it came to be, nor do I think that would help with navigating the current landscape.

**Conclusions**

I'm a pretty easy going person... Does an actually easy going person say they are? But I can probably find something to like regardless of the discipline. I was working as a firefighter before pursuing software, so I'm used to range of indoor/outdoor work and stress. As long as I'm solving interesting problems on occasion, I'll be happy.

So in summary, I need some help deciding on the engineering discipline I should pursue (Software vs. Computer vs. Electrical) and what kinds of business courses or experience I need to hit the ground running when it comes to managing a large company.",AskEngineers,False,Winter-Use,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ec531t/advice_for_pursuing_engineering_and_then/

Here are the details of the assignment:  
\-Plan your earthquake resistant design so that it will maintain the greatest degree of stability and strength as possible (while being as lightweight as possible).  
\-Supplies: 50 straws, 12 popsicle sticks, 225 cm2 of brown paper, 10 cm masking tape, 10 construction pins, and 5 rubber bands.    
\-We may bring materials from home upon the approval of the instructor (no duct tape).  
(can use wood, glue, metal, etc.)  
Design Requirements:  
Height: No higher than 50 cm tall, no shorter than 40 cm tall.  
Area: Area of the base must be at least 225 cm2, no larger than 324 cm2.    
Number of floors: there must be at least a total of 4 floors, each floor must be a minimum of 10 cm in height.  
Function:  The top floor will be an open air parking garage.  The top floor must be able to hold 250 grams of mass, even during an earthquake.  Only the first and top floors need to have actual floors.  
Flag: A city flag must fly at the top of the building, the city flag should fly at exactly 50 cm in height.  
Weight: Your structure must be constructed in a manner to make it as lightweight as possible.  
Our instructor is going to put our finished designs on a shaker table and whichever house lasts the longest wins.

TL;DR at bottom

I knew that I wanted to go into engineering but I wasn't sure which field I wanted to go into when I started my degree.Due to this, I had decided to pursue a B.A. in Applied Math at SNHU completely online. I spent about 3 or so years working my way through the degree. 

When I got to my last 4-6 classes, I decided to start looking at universities for civil engineering(what I finally decided to try for). Every university website seem to have said that my math courses would be electives instead of 1 for 1 all because I didn't have a ""lab"" portion thus not being an equivalent. Needless to say I now know the importance and differences of BA and BS degrees (even though I believe applied math should be a BS.) I even reached out to advising at various colleges for information but they basically said that I'd have to apply and send in transcripts. I decided to not do this because I couldn't justify spending the money on fees for the greater possibility of my courses not transferring in the manner that I need. 

My question is would it be worth it to redo the entirety of my degree basically to become entry level in civil engineering at 35+? I can't seem to seem the positive of starting all the way over from square one basically as a freshman so late in the game.

My main focus over the last 18 months has been in two assembly areas where operators screw-assemble mechanical parts together and produce roughly 15,000 units/wk. As a junior engineer, my job has mainly consisted of shop floor firefighting, and implementing lean/automation projects that had already been identified by senior engineers. I have a decent amount of experience in 3D CAD of assembly fixtures and layout designs. I also have some experience in financially justifying projects in both automation and implementing new technologies. However, I have little experience in implementing actual Lean methodologies such as Kanban, kaizen, JIT etc.

At the start of January, I am due to start a new job as a process engineer with a company specializing in the manufacture of high specification products using advanced materials, notably ceramics. The processes include moulding and various grinding operations. Coming from a manual assembly background – I do not have much experience with these kind of primary and machining ops. From what I understand, the role will be fairly independent and it will mostly be up to me to identify areas of improvement, propose, financially justify, and implement projects. I anticipate that it will also focus heavily on lean/process improvement methodologies I stated earlier.

To facilitate some of these requests, my group is planning to create a web-based tool that does this all for us.

I'm getting a more business/customer interaction vibe from this assignment, and having studied plain ECE, I am very unprepared for this. I've been given kind of a very general overview of how the process will go:

1. Planning (I'm doing this right now and this is basically where we are in the entire process so far)

2. Software requirement review with developer - develop formal requirements with the people developing the software for us

3. Make the software

4. Test and beta test the software

5. Release the software

1. A Gantt chart, used to help estimate the schedule and budget for performing steps 1 - 5.

The company culture is still start-up like because of their size. I am a communication systems engineer. I have pretty much been working on the same assignment with slightly different variations for the past 8 months.

The first 3 or 4 months went by extremely quickly as I was learning new things non-stop like how to interface with the product, learning Python and all of the company's internal codebases, figuring out how to set up instruments properly to capture the relevant data needed to characterize the system, fixing problems as I uncovered them, etc.

The next 2 months slowed down but I used it as an opportunity to go back and really iron out all the stuff that I had worked on previously. I prettied up my testing scripts, made them easier to debug and extend, and spent a lot of effort figuring out how to best display my testing results so that others would understand.

For the last 3 months, I have been doing nothing useful at work. I had enough free time that I was able to fully automate my tests which has only given me even less to do. I have been coming in late and only leaving slightly later than normal to offset that, but I really feel like the weeks go by without me having done any actual productive work. I keep asking my boss for more assignments to work on, but most of what he assigns are a slight variations of stuff that I am already doing.

He tells me that he wants me to get trained on other parts of the systems we're working on but hasn't made any time to do so.

I'm talking about plane stress elements.

For quadrilateral elements we use isoparametric mapping with local coordinate system in the ""middle"" of the element, this makes finding the points somewhat simple. For example a Q8 element gets a polynomial P\^4 when integrating the stiffness matrix which results in 3X3 Gauss points for full integration and 2X2 Gauss points for reduced integration. 

For triangular elements we mostly use area coordinates to describe the displacement functions, i dont see how i can find how many points i need for full integration from this. I've tried with generalized coordinates for a Linear strain element (LST)  with P=2 where the shapefunction N = \[1 s n s\^2 sn n\^2) then finding Bq for plane stress, then finding the ""polynomial"" degree when integrating the stiffness matrix.  From this i get 2x2 gauss points for full integration and 1x1 for reduced integration, but i dont know if this is correct. and i dont understand where the guass points should be placed, i guess it depends on the local coordinate system?

57,Using a MAP sensor from a car 4 cylinder engine on a small single cylinder (lawnmower) engine? - EFI conversion,1576523068,"Hello folks,

So lately I dragged my mind into making a single cylinder carburated engine run on extremly-basic EFI system. For that I wanted to use an Arduino (yes, I know, it's an extremly basic and simple device for something like that, but as I noted, all I want is something extremly basic, just to make it work - somehow, so no fine tuning or such) which is going to control the pulses for an injector. The engine is a very basic working Tecumseh 3.5hp engine (BVS153) 4 stroke engine, but that doesn't matter since 99% mower engines have the same working principle.

The way to do that is yet very simple:

 \- Use a Optoelectronic/optoisolated/optical sensor to detect when the coil and the magnet (aka the spark generator, magneto coil) meet when the flywheel is rotating. Using such a sensor would be that I would place the optoelectronic sensor above the main coil, and place something (some barries, something thin and light, a simple stick would do it) on the flywheel where the magnet is located. Simple as it is, when the barrier is placed between the two sides of the sensor, the sensor sends out a signal (logical 1 or 0, depending on the sensor) to the controller (Arduino) and that way I know when the spark is occuring, that is, when to shoot the fuel in... 

 \- BUT, that won't do it, since most small engines because of their size had to be designed the way that the sparkplug would make a spark: firstly, when it has to, at the right time at the right stroke, and secondly, during the exhaust stroke if I'm not mistaken - that is, when it shouldn't, it has no reason. Therefore, that would mean that my injector would have to shoot fuel twice during the 4 stroke procedure, just like the spark timing, but there's no fuel needed at the exhaust stroke, and would clog the intake when the right pulse would shoot fuel. 

 \- To solve this, I realized that I need some other input information of the current stroke. Firstly, I thought about a MAF sensor from a car, so I can detect when the air is being sucked into the cylinder, when the intake valve is open, and using that information I'd know when it's the actual shooting time - but the size of the whole sensor is very limiting. Secondly, I thought about a MAP sensor, also from a car. Since the size of it is much smaller and simpler so fit into the intake. Just like the MAF sensor, I'd know the pressure change in the intake/cylinder whenever the valve opens - I'd actually know the valve opening time and get the proper timing. 

NOTE: I'm currently not looking for any kind of fine tuning or precision, all I want to do make is BASIC operation of the engine. There are many other sensors to think of, like the throttle position sensor, exhaust temperature sensor, air intake temperature sensor and so on. But all I need is some extremly basic timing. 

So, regarding all that above - could I actually fit a MAP sensor from a 4 cylinder engine. Or, does anybody have anything better to recommend?",AskEngineers,False,XGamer23_Cro,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ebjhmg/using_a_map_sensor_from_a_car_4_cylinder_engine/

89,Should I switch majors?,1576460329,"I'm majoring in electrical engineering in college right now, and so far I'm a sophomore. I'm wondering if I should continue with the EE track, or go towards a math major instead (my brain is more mathematically oriented).

I thought I would go into EE bc my mom recommended I go into it bc I'm good at math and bc I don't like biology, don't like chemistry/am not good at it, and don't like physics/am not good at it. I considered doing CS too but after taking a couple CS courses at my college the workload is just way too much for me, and I don't know if I actually understand CS that much either.

I did want to change majors my freshman year to possibly a math major, but my mom got upset with me (I was kind of talking a lot about switching majors last year) and told me to just focus on getting good grades in my classes. She was mainly upset bc it seemed to her that I wanted to switch majors not bc I didn't like EE, but bc the math major would be easier than EE. So I continued with EE.

Now I'm a sophomore. I've been doing more theater lately and ofc with my bad time management skills was not able to really balance between classes and other things that well this year so far, so I got C's in a couple of my classes this semester. One of them was an EE class (hardware class) and the other a biology class (that biology class if I had really worked hard I should've been able to understand more, it was purely bad time management there I think that brought my grade down). The final grades for my other EE class (signal processing class) and a CS class i took this semester haven't come out yet but I suspect I will be getting B's in them.

I talked with my mom about this today and she was really surprised and of course upset too. I was an A student for all of my life until now. My high school was not top tier but it was not a school where you could get A's without working hard.

My mom is really disappointed in me and I'm really sad too. My mom asked me what my plan is, she didn't realize I was ""this bad"" at engineering. I took a signal processing class this semester and I feel like I could understand it (I would get 90s and 100s on homeworks and 85s on tests, but if I really studied more I feel like I could have pulled off A's on tests), it was more math related than other EE courses I've taken, and I got connected with an alumni who was like me, more math oriented and less hardware oriented, so I got excited bc I could ask the alumni for advice and thought I would take more classes in signal processing to bump my GPA up and that I would go into this field of EE since it seems like the only area I'm actually good at. Even after taking hardware classes I still don't feel like I understand much.

Basically I thought I was overthinking it myself when I got 30s, 40s, 60s, 70s on my exams, and other people have told me to not give up after my first 30 or 40, but if my GPA just keeps dropping bc of these EE classes, wouldn't it be worth it both for me and my parents (since they pay for my tuition) if I switched to a major where I could get a better GPA and thus have a better chance of finding a good job out of college? I know GPA doesn't matter much after your first entry level job, but I'm still a sophomore and at least in the next few years will still need a good GPA for internships, co-ops, and eventually my first entry level job.

I also know that GPA isn't everything and I know there's lots of people with worse grades than mine who have great jobs, but I feel like that depends a lot on a person's charisma and how good they are with talking to people. I'm not exactly the most charismatic person and there's definitely so many people out there who are more competent than I am (both academically, technically and skillwise, and charismatically), so at least I feel like I need a really good GPA to stand out a little bit.

I thought it was just me when it was just myself thinking I was bad at EE and that I should switch majors, but now that my mom is asking me what my plan is, I'm really worried. I did suggest to my mom I switch to a math major, but then my mom said I didn't have a mathematically inclined mind and would still get C's (but then I'm like it's also the only thing I'm like good at and kind of like?? And she did say before that I'm good at math?? So idk?? Maybe she means the theoretical side of math??)

I also don't really want to just follow exactly everything my parents say (like if they say do this major I do it without thinking), but my mom has always been a very practical person and I know she cares about a lot and just wants the best for me, so I don't know what to do anymore.

Sorry this is a lot, any advice? Again I'm not the most charismatic person so I can't exactly rely on my charisma to get me good jobs and such.",AskEngineers,False,cherryflip,/r/AskEngineers/comments/eb86fd/should_i_switch_majors/

why is the velocity required for a rocket to exit earths gravity equal to 11.18km/s ?

I thought that the gravity of earth only pushes you down with an acceleration of 9.86m/s\^2 and that you would only need to overcome the weight of the rocket to have it escape earth?

So if a rocket weighed 1000kg for an example, it would only need to exert a thrust of 10000 Newtons to fly for as far as you want it(as long as it can overcome its weight due to gravity and airdrag of course), but for some reason it is still said that you need to fly 11km/s to escape earths orbit.

I thought that the gravity of earth only pushes you down with an acceleration of 9.86m/s\^2 and that you would only need to overcome the weight of the rocket to have it escape earth?

So if a rocket weighed 1000kg for an example, it would only need to exert a thrust of 10000 Newtons to fly for as far as you want it(as long as it can overcome its weight due to gravity  and airdrag of course), but for some reason it is still said that you need to fly 11km/s to escape earths orbit.

Why?

12,"Mechatronics Engineer, is it any good?",1576392610," 

Hey Guys,

I have already completed half a semester of engineering, and I am enrolled in mechatronics engineering. My plan was to finish mechatronics then specialize in robotics, AI, or computer science (masters). I have questions I would like to ask, and get some answers/opinions.

1. My main concern is that I heard from my dean in my uni, that bigger companies tend to take mechanical or electrical engineers instead of mechatronics, as they have a greater budget to spend on a more speciallized person rather than a person that knows a bit of everything. I also heard that mechatronics are usually recruited for small/start up companies? can anyone comment on this and give me your opinion?
2. For the specialization(masters) of Robotics/AI/Computer Science, would mechatronics be the best path for these specialization? or would electical/mechanical have no issues pursuing this path? which would be the best one for this?

3)If anyone here did mechatronics or any engineering degree, have you done any specialization, if so what specialization? Was finding jobs difficult? What do you work in?",AskEngineers,False,Lowercupid,/r/AskEngineers/comments/eavrq1/mechatronics_engineer_is_it_any_good/

19,How to do x-y translation to retrieve stuff from shelves?,1576380689,"I want to have a set of shelves in my basement with an automatic retrieval system.  I want to be able to enter the name of an object on my computer, and have my machine go get that object from the shelf and deliver it to me at the end of the shelf.  I also want it to take an object and put it back on the shelf.

So the question is, how do I do this cheaply, with a system unlikely to break down, that will work fast.

I've got an idea for how to get the object off the shelf and onto a movable platform in front of the shelf.  The question is, how do I move the platform to in front of the object.

I've thought of three ways to do this:

1.  A robot on wheels that can go forward and backward, with a thing on it that can move up and down (like a forklift).  X-position is done by driving back and forth, y-position by moving the forklift thing up and down.

2.  Have the platform hang from two cables.  Have winches pull in or let out cable to get the platform in the right position.  This is basically like a skycam, but it just moves in 2d in front of the shelf instead of 3d in a stadium.

3.  Use a vertical gantry system (like a vertical laser cutter) to move the platform to the proper location in front of the shelf.

The shelves will be 3 or 4 meters long and about 1.5 meters high.  The largest objects to move will be around 4 kg and fit inside a 30 cm cube.  

The fastest this thing will have to work is when I'm putting stuff away.  If I have 10 objects I want to put on the shelf, and I have to wait 20 seconds between each object, that will get really annoying.  So ideally this system will be able to go put an object away and return for another object in 5 seconds or less.

The position accuracy should be probably no worse than 2 cm in the x direction.  In the y direction the platform can't be above the level of the shelf, but it can be as much as 2 cm below the shelf....so 1 cm accuracy in the y direction.

I don't really know how to evaluate the durability, accuracy, and speed of the three systems I mentioned, and I don't know if there are any other possible solutions out there.

What does everyone think?  Which system is likely to work best, or is there some other solution I'm missing?

22,Ever feel like you aren't making a difference in engineering?,1576375198,"From a young engineering student exploring internships and career opportunities to more seasoned engineers, I have a rant about ethics/politics/philosophy/life/engineering.

Growing up I was a natural engineer, really enthusiastic and always building shit in my garage and in my robotics team at school. My parents didn't know anything about engineering but were always supportive and helped me cultivate my interests from a young age. I was a young utopian, really excited to design spaceships/robots/electric cars and what have you. I worked hard in school, got into an elite college, and kept up with my engineering hobbies. 

Now that I have a bit of industry experience under my belt, my tune has started to shift. I've now realized that technical solutions and these cool projects I always dreamed about in my youth *don't matter*. No matter how brilliant of an engineer you are, no matter how ""cool"" the technology you are working on is, at the end of the day, you are serving your corporate master. Your job, at the end of the day, is to optimize the profit-making machines (and build new ones) of a corporation. Whether you are at a massive firm like Raytheon, or a new startup, the bottom line is profit. Whatever cool technology you get to build are just means to that end. 

 Take Apple for example, one of the largest engineering firms on the planet. They have thousands of brilliant software, electrical, and mechanical engineers around the globe working on producing these amazingly intricate swiss watch-like machines. So much technology from so many disciplines are packed into these miniaturized marvels. We as a society spend billions each year optimizing these machines, making them faster, smaller, more aesthetically pleasing and easier to use. But what is the point of all that? To get people to spend as much time on their phones as possible, and generate profits for Apple and the other companies that build software on top of their platform.

I've talked to classmates of mine about this and gotten zero sympathy. The overwhelming attitude is either ""what the fuck are you talking about"" or ""pay me enough and I don't care what the thing is being used for.""

The biggest issues we face as a society, climate change, food scarcity, the rising tide of right-wing ideologues, none of these will be fixed by technology. No matter how many more engineers we throw at the problem, we are stuck. It's a matter of capital, time, and political will.

**So my big question to older engineers is:**

How have you escaped this and managed to find satisfaction in your work? Have you tried anything like Engineers Without Borders, non profit work, research work, etc?

37,Help a scientist tune a PID furnace,1576344210,"I’m a scientist working on a new experimental set up and I am having issues with tuning a PID controller for my furnace. The furnace is a home brew setup: a copper tube wrapped in omega heat tape, which is then wrapped in caowool and some heavy duty aluminum foil. Into that furnace goes my reaction vessel: a 1.5 in OD inconel 718 rod. My experiment goes in a long axial bore in the inconel rod, and a small hole for a thermocouple probe is sunk to approximately the same “depth” as the axial bore on the opposing side. In essence, I am trying to control the temperature inside the reaction vessel.

I would like the system to be able to smoothly bring the reaction vessel temperature up to a set point and hold it there with oscillations of no more than 5 degC on either side. I do not care greatly how long it takes for the system to achieve setpoint (as long as it is less than 24 hours or so), but I cannot tolerate overshoots more than 10 degC. 

I have an omega CNi16D controller which is capable of P, I, and D control. I have been working to tune them with only moderate success. Right now, I am implementing all three control values, and seeing overshoots on the order of 15 - 20 degC, but ultimately the process stabilizes 7 to 10 degC above the setpoint after overshooting. It reaches the set point (250 C in this case for testing, but the experiments will be 300 - 350) from room temperature in under 2 hours which is quite fast. There is a lot of thermal mass here, so the temperature tends to respond fairly slowly to the heat being turned on or off.

So, I am basically soliciting general advice, and I am wondering about several things:

1) Am I overcomplicating this by implementing all three of P, I, and D? Are there simpler ways to accomplish the needs I describe above?
2) Is my heat tape perhaps overpowered for the application? I believe I can set a max output on the controller between 0 and 99%.
3) Would attempting to use the controllers “ramp” function be of utility here?

57,I am a biomedical engineering student interested in EVA and human spaceflight looking for career direction/assistance. Any help appreciated!,1576293876,"Hi! I am a biomedical engineering student set to graduate by 2021. I currently have a pretty good GPA, lots of lab experience (making thin-film, wearable biomedical sensors and piezoelectric energy generators), and a very intense interest in BME as it pertains to human spaceflight and extravehicular activity. It is currently my plan to pursue a PhD immediately after undergrad (yes, I do know how intense and expensive programs are). My goal is not to stay in academia and teach (though that is a backup plan), but rather to take my PhD into the field (industry) so that I could lead a research/development team (I understand that it may take a while to reach this position). I am open to working anywhere, preferably in the US, but abroad as well. 

With that out of the way, here is my dilemma. Because biomedical engineering is such a wide field with a frankly ridiculous variety of opportunity, I had a hard time finding my niche early on in my degree. Now that I have gone through a few classes, I have been able to eliminate a bunch of areas that I don't want to go into, however I have found just as many that I am interested in. As I said before though, my primary interest is in the applications of BME topics and principles to EVA and human spaceflight as a whole. 

For those of you who are members of the field, I am sure you know of the Exploration EVA conference which NASA holds every year so that professionals and researchers can convene and discuss important topics and developments. I attended the 2019 conference, and I have signed up to attend the 2020 conference as well to increase my exposure to the field and its members. When I attended, I discovered that my interest in ""EVA and human spaceflight"" was not nearly specific enough, and that there were a plethora of topics contained within that. This is where I need help. 

I am unsure of where to go from here. I have to start applying for grad schools in a few months, but my ideas for which field of research I want to go into are too vague. I have so many ideas for my thesis, but I don't know which are viable and which are not. Luckily, my UG research adviser and my PI are very knowledgeable about all forms of engineering and have many connections across all disciplines, so (theoretically) I could easily find a place for myself once I decide on a specific, viable research topic. 

**TL;DR:** Biomedical engineering student planning to do PhD on some EVA/human spaceflight topic. Need advice regarding direction and nature of post-school life as an engineer. 

To all EVA and human spaceflight engineers, **here are my questions**:

1. Where (i.e. geographically and in what field) did you find work after finishing school? 
2. Is a government job (i.e. NASA, ESA, or equivalent) my only option? Or is there some opportunity in the private sector?
3. Once I finish school, I will inevitably be in debt, but will the pay be enough to offset the extra schooling? (money isn't really a huge thing for me)

We have desks/cubicles next to each other so when someone get an email from the boss man, someone would say it out loud for brainstorming and I would be confused as hell as to what they’re talking about.

At first, I thought it was a group that he already created in outlook long ago, but I asked one of my coworkers to forward one of the emails to me, and he typed it individually.

I have a system that results in values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... These values strongly follow a Pareto distribution, where value 0 occurs the most, 1 occurs often, 2 less so....

In order to resume production, we need this system to produce an average set of values below a mean of 1.5. We can attempt to achieve this with a sequence of identical events. If this sequence of events fails to make our values come in below 1.5, we have to do something more dramatic and expensive. However, if the sequence of identical events is ineffectual, continuing the sequence of identical events may be futile and waste precious production time, so we may as well do the more dramatic and expensive thing.

These values are dependent on each-other. If we see more 4's, we expect to continue seeing more 3's, 4's, 5's, etc.

So. My questions are:

1. What kind of model can I use to capture the value-value dependence? For instance, if there is a 3, how could I determine the expected value of the next number the sequence would produce? Clearly a simple distribution wouldn't work, because that only captures overall likelihood. Also time is not nearly as strong of a variable as previous value is.

95,Technical Sales Engineer (small corp) vs Design Engineer (big aero corp),1576217171,"After recently getting laid off from a cushy, low-pay, design engineering role at a medium sized company (5 years,first eng job,cut due to budget), I received many interviews and several job offers with better salaries. I recently obtained my professional license (mechanical engineer with good electrical experience) and was at the sweet spot of 5 yrs experience on my resume. A recruiter contacted me about a sales engineering position and I never even knew this kind of role existed for engineers... They explained that they can be higher paying positions and can receive commission (depending on the role, hunting vs farming, etc). 

It sparked my interest and I felt like it could be a good fit for me so I started looking for sales engineering jobs. Soon enough, I had an interview and then job offer from a smaller company that does subcontracts for electronics manufacturing for a wide range of clients (automotive, mining, aerospace, defense, mining, medical, etc). I realized that I would be very interested in working on projects that are constantly changing (different clients, industries etc) where I am the 'technical expert' that is consulted for my engineering knowledge. Most of the time, the designs are 90%  done by the client and my role is almost entirely 'farming' existing clients and supporting their needs and our production. It is my job to make sense of everything and ensure that we win contracts and correctly build the products.

Although the company is much less luxurious than my previous employer (perks/environment/location/culture/etc),my pay is 25K higher and I am feeling much more motivated than I ever have been because of my bigger responsibilities and stimulating projects. Instead of reluctantly dragging myself to my fancy desk with a nice view, I find myself getting up at the break of dawn and adopting healthier habits (sleeping/eating/exercise/less drinking) and am feeling great about going to my new job. I figure this role is good for me and will give me a chance to gain a broader experience in a different role instead of continuing to build on my 5 years as a design engineer. Why not have 5 years design and 5 years technical sales instead of just 10 years in design? Designing for the same product over and over again got pretty boring tbh.

Despite all these positives, a part of me is still wondering if I made the right choice. Maybe its because its only been a few weeks and I will need to get used to the change... but it does feel kind of bleak in terms of office environment and culture. At least everyone is really nice and treats me well. I keep telling myself that the office 'culture' is just a small compromise that I will eventually learn to embrace it...but what is more important is that I am enjoying the actual work and I am doing this to expand my career and better myself overall. Friends and relatives are happy for me that i am enjoying the new role, but nobody seems to understand why I would go with a smaller company. It seems that everyone believes that working for a big, famous corporation is the way to go..so that you can say 'Hey, I work at X corp or Y corp' and you're set. 

Anyway, 2 weeks into my job I was contacted by a big aerospace company that I had applied to for a design engineering role on a fancy product. I figured, I'll go to the interview for fun, just to see if the grass is greener on the other side. It was a huge contrast in environment, massive corporation with gigantic factory. It felt cold and very 'corporate' from the moment I arrived. The interview went really well and I got the impression they were very interested in me for the role. I am awaiting an answer from them to see if I would have the job offer for the same salary. I have to admit, I miss the larger 'institution' with thousands of people, impressive large machinery and world-renowned products... and it dawned on me that if I got the offer I would have to make a decision whether to stay at my current company or not. 

For me, it seems like the 'right' thing to do for myself would be to stay at the smaller company to gain different experience (although I don't even really know how professional they really are or if I would even enjoy it anymore 6 months from now..). However, the fancy big name company would look great on my resume and they pay is the same..and maybe it could be good to work there for a few years before moving on to other types of work experiences like at smaller company. Anybody have any similar experiences or advice? I guess I am most worried that I am disillusioned about my reasons for wanting the experience as a technical sales engineer at the smaller company and that I would be missing out on something bigger and more important in the role as design engineer in the bigger corporation. Any advice or stories about similar experiences would be appreciated!

tldr; accepted a new role as a technical sales engineer in a small company which feels like a good path for my career experience but had to compromise by accepting much blander and smaller culture although I am feeling motivated because of my bigger responsibilities. Two weeks in, went to an interview for fun at a big aerospace company and it went really well. Grass always greener on the other side. If i get the offer, I am wondering if I am better off going for the big company in a design role again and if I am delusional for thinking that sticking with the small company will be a better experience for me.",AskEngineers,False,grownyeti2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ea04su/technical_sales_engineer_small_corp_vs_design/
96,Confused about job choosing.,1576216772,"Hello all,

I have a weird question about choosing a job. I’m currently a senior in college about to graduate in May 2020 with a bachelors degree in Electrical engineering. I am currently working my internship for big X company. My duties there are to help out the power engineers to distribute power across the facility. I am currently being offered a job at a smaller Y company. My job would be a control systems integrator. Both companies have a lot to offer. What I hear from my current Sr. Engineer is “hey I can talk to your manager about offering you a job here, but you won’t Learn much here. All we do here is maintenance on things, and tbh that’s not real engineering. You won’t ever implement new things. At the smaller company, you’ll learn more. You’ll implement new systems, and will actually make more engineer decisions” (so my Sr. Engineer has worked at both the big X company and the smaller y company so he’s had taste of both.) The issue I’m having is, what if where Im currently working my internship, I get a job offer, and I’m sure it’ll be more money than I’m being offered at the smaller one (but not by much since I’m a fresh outta college kid). I’m very confused on whether to wait for an offer at my internship with the bigger company or go work for the smaller company. Any advice anyone can give me? If I take the job and later down the road find another job that interests me more elsewhere, how bad is it to call them up and say “hey guys lol I don’t wanna work with you guys”. I’m just very confused because I have great opportunities at both places but I’m just unsure. Thanks for any advice. 

Also, I have been offered jobs at engineering consulting firms, and I’ve heard you learn a lot working at those places, but I’ve kept them on hold since I really don’t wanna work at a firm and sit at a desk the whole day and make one line diagrams. I’m just leaving these as fall back options if everything else were to fail.

Just for the record I've previously had a cool internship here and it was in a top Canadian company. This will relate to my 'dilemma'. The dilema is people, mostly older folks that work in engineering, tell me that Canadian experience"" is more valuable and suggested that I work at a Canadian company here in Quebec ( I was offered 7 positions at companies such as Bombardier, Pratt &amp; Whitney and a 3D conception company). They also say that I shouldn't have accepted an unpaid internship, despite the fact that I will receive a scholarship AND have rent food and transportation paid for.

I don't know... it kind of brought me down as I was super excited to go on this adventure ( and still am). The whole thing is going to be new to me, I will have a chance to travel europe during weekends, and will have a special internship unlike my colleagues that usually settle for local companies or universities.

I am currently at a point I have completed all of my math, and general sciences and am about to start taking major-related classes. my degree where it would not delay my graduation to switch. I originally chose to go into BME due to my broad interest in general science and my desire for a stable job outlook. Throughout my education, I've realized that I truly have a passion for learning more about the universe and our world, with interests ranging from Electricity and Magnetism to how the human brain works. I have a strong feeling that I want to go into research as I have almost zero interest in product design and development. Currently, I volunteer in an engineering research lab looking into the development of electrodes to receive and transmit signals to and from the brain. Even though my involvement has been little more than assisting Ph.D. students in assembling electrode arrays, I can tell that the lab environment and research, in general, is appealing to me. I understand that a future as a graduate student, post-doc, and eventual Ph.D. is hardly all sunshine and rainbows and that much of life can become pouring your heart, blood, and soul into grant proposals that get rejected or have narrow scope that limits what you can do, but it still seems better than the alternative. It seems to me that Engineering really is the STEM equivalent of a business degree, with everything boiling down to profit and the end product. All of my engineering classes have been narrow in scope and constantly focused on the bottom line. How profitable can it be? Who is the consumer? What does production look like? I don't want to sell things, I just want to learn more about the universe. Physics seems to fit that ticket. Both seem to have opportunities in research, but with Engineering being more stable outside of research. I don't know if the stability matters though if I'm going to hate what I do every day. I don't need to make lots of money, just enough to not eat ramen daily and stress weekly about rent. I'm more concerned about ending up unemployed. Everyone in my life is telling me that Engineering is the only option and to consider Physics is crazy when there's a chance that I could do research in Engineering. Am I crazy for still feeling unhappy? In your experience does it get easier to escape the business aspects of Engineering and the ""Entreprenurial Mindset?""

Is the aerospace/aeronautical engineering field in Europe open to non-EU persons? I'm already pretty clear about the situation in the US with ITAR, but the European case is much less clear to me. It seems like there legitimately are opportunities. I'm specially looking at jobs in:

* Smaller, low-level engineering manufacturers, producing and/or developing aerospace products not subject to restrictive regulations referring to cutting edge technologies, military applications, etc

I know that the last one might sound like a bit of an oxymoron, but there's quite a few products out there (general aviation products and other add-ons) that are quite low-tech.

I'm thinking more of a repair station (MRO) or an airline. Unfortunately, I don't know what regulations govern restrictions in the Aerospace field for the EU.

I'm close to pulling the trigger on a master's level program in mechanical/aerospace engineering in Germany, but if there's no way to get a job over there (even if for a few years, to recoup study costs) then the whole prospect of this project seems a lot less appealing. 

Several years ago I made the grave mistake of studying aerospace engineering in the US; naturally, I was never able to get a job (not even in the mechanical engineering field, not even with honors, internships, projects, and a ton of other ""accolades"" at the moment of graduating...) I don't wanna make the same stupid mistake again.

Any comments, advice or observations would be greatly appreciated; if someone could point me to regulations regarding restrictions for aero work in the EU it would also be greatly appreciated (I don't believe this is covered in EASA regulations, sounds more like a trade law/labor law matter).

63,Perfect vacuum at varying altitudes...,1576098607,"Given that the concept of a perfect vacuum (being 29.92 inHg at sea level) is based on the idea of an exact opposite of atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi @ sea level) - \*\*14.7 psi to inHg is 29.92\*\* (for those who may not know).

While I know ""perfect vacuum"" is not obtainable, but, based on the description above, would the numeric value of ""perfect vacuum"" not change as atmospheric pressure changes with altitude? Or is the concept of perfect vacuum only considered at sea level?

64,Career Advice: Great Benefits vs More Valuable Experience,1576097386,"Here is a lengthy description of my dilemma:

I have only recently begun a new role that I thought would be fulfilling but it has been the opposite. I took the job for the potential of management experience, work in a different field and most importantly great education benefits as I am interested in an MBA. However, the actual work and work environment are not at all what I thought and do not interest me. I am afraid of sort of placing myself in a very specific box in terms of experience. On the education note, they offer to fully cover some set of degrees, however, I need to be here for a year and then two years after the fact. When I initially interviewed, these timelines were not mentioned and the way I had been told about it seemed to lead on that I could immediately pursue a degree. I should mention though that I have been presented with an opportunity at my current job to serve a ""project management""-lite function, but managing something I am not really interested or passionate about.

With that said, I have an opportunity to work at a company that would bring me much closer to the type of experience I want but it is not as ""management"" heavy and I do not have access to a tuition reimbursement program. They do offer employee scholarships but they do not necessarily cover the entire cost and certainly arent guaranteed. I do however have a lot of responsibility and the work is more closely related to finance and optimizing revenue. I have a mechanical/aerospace engineering background and would like to transition with the MBA towards a BusDev type of position. Now there are some other great benefits, but a free degree certainly is quite valuable. Finally, should I weigh experience over benefits with all strings attached?

For reference, I am quite early in my career. Engineering background with \~3 years of experience.

In summary:  
\- Base Pay: Job A = Job B

\-Bonuses: Job A &lt; Job B (historically)

\-Opportunities for advancement: Job A &gt; Job B

\-PTO: Job A &gt; Job B

\-401K: Job A \~=\~ Job B

82,Structural engineering by a non structural engineer - Is this normal?,1576068393,"So I was at a get together over the weekend where I met up with an old friend. We went to school together years back. He was showing me some pretty interesting stuff he's been doing with Autocad inventor, basically modelling machine components and assemblies. I was fascinated because, as a bridge engineer, I don't deal with that level of detail and detailing complexity. He later went into how he also ""designs"" structural components, using the FEM capabilities in Inventor. At this time, I was picturing looking at stress areas in machine parts, etc. However, he showed me some frame systems he designed for a plant. Stairs, walkways, platforms, etc. At this time I was getting concerned be he was talking about how he runs the analysis ""adds extra material"" after looking at the resulting heat map. I on't know what inventor does or how it does it, but I can assure you that my friend isn't keeping up with relevant building codes or applying AISC design practices. He's basically black boxing it. 

Early in my career I worked on petro and pharma projects doing structural design and have been designed and been around platforms such as these. They are at a height that could cause serious injury or death and especially since some of the platforms are over tanks or vessels in plants. We always had a PE perform the design and analysis.

I've been on this forum long enough to know that in the US, PEs aren't really widespread or required outside of civil engineering or roles affiliated with infrastructure projects. I can't help but wonder how this is OK. I'm hoping that he isn't doing something that is normal. My friend is a bright guy and isn't doing anything he shouldn't on purpose. He simply ignorant to what his capabilities are and he's ignorant to what is required to adequately perform a structural analysis. I cautioned to him that he should be careful solely relying on what Inventor is telling him. I just kept trying to asking question on hos approach to loading and evaluating the results hoping that he would realize on his own now or later that he isn't adequately trained to do what he is doing. 

Now, I work in an industry that requires one to have a PE in order to design anything since the public is dependent on the safety and integrity of the structure I design.

Basically, I work as a game publisher, and for my next project I need something to slide atop an acrylic surface. (Think like a planchette on a Ouija board, but the board is acrylic). A planchette has felt covering the feet which reduces the friction on cardboard, but really makes it stick on acrylic. I'm trying to find alternate materials that will let it slide on acrylic.

Sadly I don't really even know where to start finding this. What's a good way to start narrowing down what kinds of materials might have low friction against an acrylic surface? Alternatively, would also love suggestions as to appropriate materials.

11,"almost 30, only armchair engineering experience, do i have a chance?",1576011174,"Hello All, 

So i think i have spend the past few years trying to finally decide what i want to do. I figure, even at 30 its not too late. Ive spend the last 10 doing many different kind of jobs from maintenance to cooking to system admin. I guess i was never happy with just doing 1 thing. 

Well now that ive been through the job ringer so to speak, I have narrowed my passions down. Keep in mind also i have no other obligations. No kids, wife, low rent, not even a partner at the moment. The world is kinda still mine if you will. I work now as sys-admin/helpdesk/product support. The company i work for is a very nice travel technology company. I love the people i work with and the culture is pretty much in line where i live(southern California). I can walk into the VP of technology office any day of the week and challenge his decisions if it came down to it....and he would simply smile and ask why i made such claims. And he would let me talk to him about it.  My point is its really lax and the company is very profitable. Id have a career here if i wanted to do so. 

My problem is i dont have the passion for it.  I could care less about product issues in this case. Im not passionate about the code, im passionate about the machine running the code. Computers were my first passion. Id be a happy little bee running around a server farm installing servers,  figuring out power loads, working on the networking and all the programs that go with that. However, that doesn't mean i dont like coding.....i just dont have a driving passion for it and it get boring to me. 

I have come to also learn that i LOVE mechanics and taking things apart. I mean i can watch and talk about jet engines for example for hours. Parts, how they move, what the movement does and how it all works is where its at for me.  Like how the fuel and oil systems work in a GE LM1500  i think is so cool.....anyway that counts for most things. When i look at a building, i want to know how the power, elevator, HVAC and all the subsystems look like/operate and everything in between. I was the kid on the cruise ship running around with spec sheets instead of participating in the games they had lol. 

The final thing ive come to find, is i love electricity. This usually ties into mechanics, like how an LM2500 generates electricity and how the flow works. How power is generated, stored and transmitted. How turbine systems use waste heat to heat water and make more electricity....thats so interesting to me. 

Also 3D Printing and modeling.  The different driver chips, different filaments and lasers. why 1 material is better than the other. I can talk about all these subjects for days if you let me. 

Anyway, i dont mean to keep going on about this. But my question is, is it worth becoming and engineer at my age? 

I was looking at mechanical engineering, because i understand it best. But is there a field that kind of combines Electrical, mechanical and computer engineering together? I feel like id be much happier doing these fields over this day to day stuff i do now....and i dont feel is that big of a deal (the day to day i mean.). 

Am i thinking way to broad about this? Do i choose 1 and kinda do the others as hobbies? Feel free to tell me im wrong. I have been feeling lost...",AskEngineers,False,BECKER_BLITZKRIEG_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/e8wiyc/almost_30_only_armchair_engineering_experience_do/

18,Tensile properties of grout in hollow CMU foundation,1576000054,"I'm currently looking at a house with a 12"" hollow-CMU, 8' tall wall foundation with a floating slab floor. On 3 (out of 4) of the walls there is deflection, less than 1/6 of the thickness of the walls. The previous owner had a carbon-fiber strap system put in (CarbonLock / ArmorLock) to mitigate further deflection. The anchors for this system go into the outermost floor joist sitting on top of the block wall. Luckily, the two walls with the most deflection are perpendicular to the floor joists, thus giving rigidity to the anchor point beams. Thus, there's third wall (least deflection - 3/4"") where the anchoring beam has nothing keeping it in place laterally aside from the sheer force between the weight of the house and the top of the block (as far as I know). Right now, the plan is to install a bridging system to give lateral support to that beam as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Where my question comes in is from the engineering report where she stated a recommendation to \*also\* core holes X"" on center and to pour a grout-like slurry into the walls, but was not necessary. Now, it's my understanding that concrete has little to no tensile strength without rebar; and clearly there's no easy way to get rebar into the block without lifting the house (not a chance in hell). Can anyone elaborate on the effectiveness of doing such a procedure, with respect to adding tensile strength? Perhaps it's not to add tensile strength and instead a higher compression strength for the straps to compensate for? I have the means to easily do exactly this, but I also want to know if it's a significant improvement as opposed to a, ""well, it doesn't hurt,"" sort of approach.

b. I have guaranteed access to internet with a limit of 1GB per day (4G, although i have never witnessed the network go above 3Mbps (300-400KBps)

**2. Other Parameters that affects the process :**

1. I have about $9.17 (650 INR)

2. 26, Unemployed.

3. Unable to procure manual labour jobs due to lack of physical fitness and obesity.

5. Unable to procure entry level non technical/unskilled jobs due to my educational qualification (i have a masters degree from a tier 2 college)

6. I have no contacts that can aid me in procuring a job, although i have been trying to build a network, i have been unsuccessful as of now (my efforts are to be continued despite the undesirable outcomes.) Superficial analysis of the situation points towards my economic &amp; social status, and lack of noteworthy history between prospective contacts (including former acquaintances). I have even started trying unconventional ways also.

7. Applying online through job portals have been unsuccessful due to under-performing in bachelors degree, as i was at fault of studying engineering without proper guidance or knowledge on how to go about my education. (point to be noted, i was from a small village town and did not have access to internet (and continued to be so until a couple of moths before graduation from college), telephone etc, nor did have the knowledge or contacts that would point in the right direction) 

So, I have concluded based on the information i was able to gather until now, that the best way for me is to become an IT professional [although I am finding the probability lowering due to recent news of recession] as that would be the field i would not be judged based on my looks or physical fitness (or at the least, I believe so. I do hope to improve my physical fitness and address mental health issues if there are any, but getting employed is the priority as that is how i can afford to achieve those things).

I have but momentarily forgotten due to certain situation and decisions I made that I regret.

java, python, c, c++, c#, sql, java script, html, css, matlab, R, Assembly, Verilog, VHDL, php,

Cloud engineer / SAAS / PAAS professional

Data analyst / Data Scientist

Machine Learning Engineer / AI Engineer

UI/UX Professional / Designer

Now I have been trying to figure out what i should do on my own and i have ended up more uncertain and confused than before.

My approach involved Anaconda, as i am unable to utilize the native linux support due to disabled virtualization and my inability to change that status.

I'm currently trying to create a Greenpower project, which to sum it up is where you make an electric vehicle to drive and make it go the furthest distance in a given amount of time (1 hour is the race length).

Me and my friends have currently created a Gofundme with all the details and lots of pictures of our designs etc [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/2020-greenpower-student-project-funding)

I was wondering if anyone could advise me on what I could do to make the aerodynamics even better and what would be a good idea to reduce the drag.

Obviously there are regulations that I need to follow ([Full regulations here](https://www.greenpower.co.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/F24%20Technical%20and%20Sporting%20Regulations%202020%20v1.0.pdf)) However I will sum up the main points as far as the aerodynamics go.

\- The rearmost point must not be further than 80cm from the center of the rear wheels.

\- The wheels must have a minimum track of 50cm.

\- The vehicle must be no longer than 280cm long.

\- There must be a hole of minimum size 60x35cm for the driver to get in and out and the driver's helmet must not be covered by anything (basically the cockpit has to be open)

-worked hard as hell and decided to go back to school so I didn’t have to physically work as hard my whole life and because I talked to multiple project engineers where I worked and became interested in the field (24 years old at the time)

-quit job. Took bunch of classes to catch up at community college. Transferred to university for mechanical engineering.

-got some guy I talked to at the gym who opened up a design firm a few years ago to let me come in and learn how to use CATIA and the aerospace composite molding process (had zero clue about what GDT was and no idea how to use CATIA, only knew what it was and what it did). I did various small jobs here (“model over” jobs where I needed to recreate an assembly in a different version of CATIA, model over all the parts, then delete old the old part bodies and make the ones I modeled as the new part bodies.

Apparently water pressure, like any mechanical force over an area, is affected by the rate of loading. So I can't necessarily place a specimen at a certain water depth with known pressure and assume it would also withstand being dropped to that depth from some height.

So, if my test criteria was to withstand being dropped in a puddle, what would be the appropriate worst-case test stress? Would it be the pressure from impact with the water surface, or the pressure at the bottom of the puddle? For simplicity, assume whatever the worst-case would be for impact pressure (direct hit on mesh I assume). If it's determined that impact with the water surface would be higher pressure than submersion at depth, my test would be to submerge units beyond the target depth to simulate the impact pressure.

Let's say the drop height is 70"", the puddle depth is 12"", and the object is a 1"" hollow plastic cube with a 0.5"" square of mesh centered on one side. **Is the pressure on the mesh during impact higher than the pressure at the bottom of the puddle?**

I have a question thats been nagging me for a while now. I was in an interview a few months ago and was asked this question:

 ""You are ordering a plate with two holes from Manufacturer A and a plate with two holes from Manufacturer B, which you are then assembling on a fixture. Your goal is for two of the edges to be aligned while also being able to pass screws through the holes in order to secure the plates together. What would you tell each manufacturer to ensure that the holes will be aligned?"" 

This was for a large consumer electronics company, so think mass production. I thought the answer was quite simply to ensure the holes were large enough to accommodate the hole positional tolerances from each manufacturer. So basically add the (positional tol. of A + positional tol. of B) to the min. diameter of each hole, and you will be able to align each edge in the fixture while still being able to pass screws through the holes, as long as the parts are in spec.

What I would like to know is, if my phone can be run while plugged in and charging, thus extending the time I can use it why can't this hand tool? Second, is there a way to over ride this 'safety' and convert it so that it runs on AC power and I don't ever have to charge it again? I have seen similar tools that are corded but after spending 300 bucks on this one I don't really want to go buy a differnet model.

I'm not even sure if this is the right sub-reddit to post to but I need some advice. As background, I graduated from UC Davis like 6 months ago (maybe I'm a not so recent grad) with a bachelors in applied physics and materials science. As an undergrad i did a lot of physics undergrad research and a did a few technical internships(they weren't at a big tech company or anything). I've been applying to engineering jobs (software, production, mechanical, electrical engineering) and honestly the results are pretty bad. I haven't had any calls back or interviews at all for these positions; not even for internship positions...

My question to you guys is, am I cut out to *even apply to these jobs*?

I took a few engineering classes while I went to school but i don't have any direct engineering internships or job experience - a lot of my experience is academic research. Honestly I feel pretty lost because I don't want to go to grad school right now since it would feel like i would be going to grad school just because I couldn't get a job right away.  So my goal right now is to get a job as an engineer but i honestly don't know if I'm *even cut out for that*.

Company A: located in my home city, offer runs Spring 2020 - Summer 2020. Industry is engineering design for power industry. Pay is $20 an hour. Very well established company. They design a lot of products/ devices so there would be great opportunity to learn many different things. The company is well touted and respected in this field, with a long historical standing. If I accept I will be working in Spring and Summer as well. 

Company B: located in a nearby city (few hours away), with this city having a significantly better lifestyle for a young person (rated one of the most desirable places to live in USA in 2019). Summer 2020 only. Industry is consulting engineering, working with the electrical group. Pay is $24 an hour + $1k relocation bonus + $500 stipend for food. The company is decently-respected (not as known as Company A) in the field. Small office, it seems like it would be easy to be fairly independent and on my own here. 

If I choose Company B, I will be in a whole new city so I must pay rent/ food/ utilities. Company A is in my home city so my expenses are paid at home. I've calculated it and including rent/ food, the salary is about the same, with Company A probably topping out to slightly more per hour after considering expenses. 

Now for location, Company B would be way better for a college student to live in, and would give me the opportunity to really be independent since I would be living in a whole new city by myself. Location B is very exciting with a huge college life, social scene, as well as out-doors scene. Location A has its perks (cheaper and good value for your buck) but is a boring, bland city with a weak outdoor scene (parks, lakes, rivers, etc) and I have lived there my entire life. Overall, I think Company A has a bigger name in our field (everyone in electrical engineering design/consulting knows this company). But at the same time its been my dream to go to location B (I wanted to go to school there, but couldn't because of financials).

Here is a simplified version of the pivot layout I am using for the steering column: https://i.imgur.com/cUN4Rxh.png

**note:** The holes are not necessary and are only there because originally I was going to use a wooden dowel or pvc pipe as a pivot, but I don't like that idea for a number of design and functional reasons.

So my next thought was to use one of these on each side: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CKNZTNG/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_bDv7DbPG1AT04

I've done a few internships in manufacturing but while I was doing my last one I came to a conclusion that at least manufacturing is reaaaaly boring. Can't stand sitting 8hours at a desk doing excel, word, replying to emails, meetings and maaaybe occasional CAM designing but not to often. I've had a good look at what seniors where doing and the more senior positions they had the more they did email responding/excel/meetings and less technical work like CAM or inventor. I'm a fairly creative person, my girlfriend is studying architecture and I've seen how they do their projects at school. It's a blend of creative and technical work which looks really interesting. On top of that they use many programs like autocad, sketchup, archicad, photoshop. I've been attending a drawing class that prepares people for architecture entrance exams and it has been going well so far. 

From what I heard some architects are paid well and can work remotely from home doing visualizations or something else but I've also heard stories of how architects get paid really bad unless they have 10-15 years of experience. But many of them still gets paid badly even if they are really good at what they do. Don't get me wrong I'm not just after the money but I don't want to have to think trice before ordering a pizza when being 30. years old.

So my question is if  you guys have any suggestions to a good career path for me. I know only I can make a decision but there is just so much conflicting information on the internet and I wonder what you think.

I have done a bit of C++ programming, like I said I'm creative, I was looking at maybe something like gamedev? Are there any jobs that are somewhat creative where there would be some graphic design, with some engineering or software engineering. What I really hated was working 8 hours and knowing I could do what I need to in 4 hours and go home and do something productive. 

I know everyone would love to work remotely and I think it would suit me too but I worry it's kind of an unrealistic expectation.

7,Courses that would prepare students for Engineering in college?,1575827979,"I need some help from my fellow Engineering nerds. I worked as an Engineer for 15 years, then became a high school teacher. Currently, I run a Tech program at a private high school in New England, and am expanding the program.....what should I add to better prepare students for Engineering in college?

Right now I teach a few tech classes, plus I have one full time computer science teacher who teaches Intro to Programming and AP Computer Science. Another teacher does a course about CAD, using the free version of Sketchup. I tend to structure my own Tech courses (Robotics) as half skill-building, and half open-ended projects. 

I have an opportunity to create a Tech school within my school. We would offer a special track for Tech-focused people, they would take longer studio classes, do a Senior Project, and they would get an additional certificate with their diploma. This would mean hiring more people, and offering even more Tech courses. I am thinking about adding Engineering Principles and/or a Wearable Technology class. I could also offer Innovation Studio, which would be for the hardcore makers, with longer class times, and tougher projects. 

So, here are my questions to you guys. 
1) Did you take any Tech courses in high school that prepared you for college? What were they?
2) What sort of skills (Tech or otherwise) do you wish you built in high school?
3) Do you wish that you were more prepared for any specific college classes? What might have prepared you?
4) Can you remember any specific labs in your engineering courses that would be do-able at the high school level? I'm thinking of some of the civil engineering courses that had us doing basic experiments with strain gauges. Any others?

12,Some questions regarding the building of a model engine,1575807002,"I studied Mechatronics/Precision Mechanics for a year before switching to become an apprentice in the area of Precision Mechanics, which I am in for my 4th month now.

In other words, I know rather little and am in way over my head, and I love the challenge.

I really like model engines and began planning on a Vacuum Engine (""Flame Eater"") several months ago and have been coninuing work on it whenever I can find time.

The work is entirely unrelated to the apprenticenship, so please don't ban me for ""Asking about homework"".

There are just a few questions I have to continue on my pet project, some regarding requirements I need to incule in my plans and some regarding ways to even plan some of the parts in the first place.

This will probably be a longer post, so bear with me!

I should probably start with giving you a little information about my project.

The engine runs without lubrication. 

It is planned that steel will run on brass to exploit the property of both metals running with little friction on each other.

The flame will be fueled by Ethanol, so no soot is produced that may clog the engine.

The flywheel has an outer diameter of 100mm.

Cylinder head bore size: 25mm

Cylinder head length: 60 mm

Piston length: 10 mm

Piston diameter: 25 mm (self explainatory)

There is 0.1 mm clearance between each part on the flywheel end of the engine.

My progress planning the engine in Fusion 360: [https://i.imgur.com/qpNML5G.png](https://i.imgur.com/qpNML5G.png)

It is rather self explainatory, flywheel, mountings for the flywheel and excentrics, cylinderhead and piston.

The parts in front of the cylidnerhead that are flying in the air will become the valve control.

An excentric pushing on the bar, which will turn a thin sheet of steel in front of a hole in the end of the cylinder.

[https://i.imgur.com/FxQu7Q0.png](https://i.imgur.com/FxQu7Q0.png)

The end cap is highlighted so you can see the hole that is covered by the springsteel.

**This part of the engine poses the first question I have:**

*How would an engineer go about solving the problem of finding out the interaction between excentric pushing on the arm and finding a solution to the right timing of the valve so it opens and closes in time?*

Solutions coming to my mind are cutting out paper templates and experimenting with those or learning how to animate in Fusion 360. Neither seem amazingly effective to me. 

**The second question:**

*How much spacing do I leave between the bore of the cylinder head and the piston?*

Obviously, if I leave no clearance, the engine will bind up, if I leave too much, the engine will lose efficiency or may not run at all.

I tried Google, but I haven't found anything. Part of the problem may be uncertainty what to search for in the first place.

**The third question:**

*What surface finish do I put on the cylinder head bore and piston?*

If the surface is too rough, uneven spots will catch, no need for overkill though.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to keep most parts to being able to be produced with a hand saw, a file and a column drilling machine.

Lathework is gonna take another 1-2 months to come up and milling will take at least half a year after that.

22,Feeling guilty about possibly leaving my job after a year but should I?,1575775427,"This is my first job out of college. I've been working here for about a year. I've been contemplating about leaving my job lately. The job isn't the worst I have worked in, the main thing I dislike is the 70 min commute I have to work.  I'm not sure if I truly hate the job or if the commute is what is causing me to dislike the position. I just have been feeling really unmotivated and unhappy with the job lately. 

I have been starting to apply and interview for new jobs. But I'm feeling guilty about leaving so early. Every job I have had up until now I have worked at least 3 years. The company was cool enough to let me start before finishing school. 

A buddy of mine interned here in college and worked here for a short period. He warned me to not work here and I have faced a lot of the things he warned me against. 

Also talking to the guy in my position before me on LinkedIn he also faced a lot of the issues I've been dealing with

Besides the ride or die workers here, a lot of engineers/ support staff doesn't make it past 3 years. I put together a Pro/ con list to help me decide whether to stay/ if I'm just being whiny or if the position truly isn't a good fit. 

Pros:

I make good money (first job out of school 70K salary )

Interesting/ variety of work

Hands-on 

Get to work w/t CAD and simulations as process engineer

Spend a lot of time on the floor

I like some of my co-workers

Even though it's in a rural area, I do enjoy the outdoors (hiking, fishing, hunting)

Boss is flexible if I need to come in late/ leave early for appointments ( but I figure this is common everywhere)

Neutral:

A high volume production company that guarantees a short delivery time to customers. Always feeling overwhelmed. Never feel like I get enough done enough, always feeling behind. Talking to my teammates this is the general consensus and it has always been like this. But it beats having too little work and being bored.

Related to above: Boss is always on our ass and isn't realistic with workload and deadlines. Others on my team feel this way as well. I don't dislike my boss but he isn't someone I really look up to or respect as I have for previous bosses. 

Cons:

Small family owned roots. Still stuck in their ways for a lot of things and refuse to change. 

Company can't find enough production workers, have trouble training properly and retaining good workers.

The engineering staff as a whole is overworked. 

Boss requires to proofread all my emails before sending to anyone outside of the company

No flexibility in hours. Have to work 8-5 and take an hour's lunch break. I catch both rush hours. 

I have to work a night shift once a week. I also have to answer calls from production on weekends.

No room for growth. Only one location, you have the same responsibilities no matter how long you have been in the position. The only positions above are the  manager (my boss) and director.

I don't feel a sense of teamwork there. Engineers don't collaborate, not much teamwork in the company as a whole, the other engineer in my department is a negative person/ tough to work with

A lot of things are tribal knowledge at this company so training hasn't been the best. Poor record-keeping, communication, and no standard way to do a lot of things.

An hour away from home makes for a minimum of 55 hour week with the commute 

My friends, family, church, and gym are all in my home town

No MMA gyms in the area (my one hobby I spend the majority of my time doing). The closest gym is 40 minutes from my work.

Not much to do in the town besides drink

Not a lot of younger people in this town

The town is just as expensive to live in as my home town (I live in a bigger city). So you don't get the low cost of living that rural towns typically offer.

I'm enjoying the job a as I am being put in a position to learn a lot on the go, but I'm struggling to do some GD&amp;T work as my company doesn't have a standardized way to analyze it.

Originally I was only tasked with all of the testing for the new design -planning the setup and schedule, designing rig-specific components, and writing the test plans (and eventually test reports) for everything.  However, since the other main designer has been backlogged on other parts of the project, I have now been tasked with defining the GD&amp;T of the entire system to ensure proper function.

I began with using some reference drawings for in house parts very similar to our design.  When using reference documents to preform the stack analyses, however, there are identical scenarios that use different methods to achieve an answer.  And I don't mean that both methods will produce the same answer as long as the numbers are the same, I'm saying that the differing methods produce entirely different results with the same numbers.  When I ask other engineers about it, they give me yet again a different method to tackle the problem.

So now I'm conflicted in my analysis on actually how to calculate some of these stack-ups for the part.  There aren't many online resources that I can find that answer my specific problem either, so I feel like I'm spinning my wheels here and the more people I ask the more conflicted on some of these things I get.

32,Called into HR to discuss bosses bad management style. How to approach situation?,1575750927,"So for some background, our work group is composed of the manager (52 m), and four engineers (24-46 all male). Time in the company for our direct group ranges from 3 years to 24 years. This is a fortune 120 company. The larger group we fit into is comprised of 80 people total including one VP, three directors, ten managers and the rest individual contributors. There is over 900 people in our location, from marketing to finance to engineering. I am an individual contributor with 8 years in the group. 

The work environment regarding the larger 80 person group overall is awesome and very collaborative. Five different work groups come together to get the projects done. Projects range from capital expense of 500k to over 50 million. The overall group is a team that specializes in automation integration and provide services for many divisions within our parent organization. 

To the issue at hand. My boss has been taking agressive and demeaning tones in meetings, both with our team in our communications updates and with other engineers in project team meetings. The general tone he takes is intimidating and often yelling that's heard across the office happens. I've seen him yell and cuss while on the floor at equipment OEM's and literally kick parts around because he's mad. Needless to say a lot of people don't want to work with him due to this. 

The issue I'm seeking advise about is how to approach HR with this as his communication to me has taken the same intimidating and hostile stance. For a while I let it go and would try anything to cool him off. Recently the same things that used to cool him off; accommodating his requests immediately, asking clarification questions etc have not worked. There have been a couple times I have taken a defensive position when he communicates to me like this and obviously that doesn't help the situation. 

Two months ago myself and another coworker who is also subject to this bullying went to his new director level boss to lay out our concerns about his management style and intimidating communication.  The director listened to concerns and said he would need to figure out how to resolve the problems. 

The director has since decided he does not have the tools to resolve the issues as the are continuing. He reached out to HR and I have been pulled in to discuss my concerns with my bosses management style, that's how HR framed it.  I expect my boss to throw me under the bus as my at times defensive posturing regarding his hostile communication obviously reflects poorly on me. I've always met his and other managers expectations for work quality and performance. 

There is documentation from the director regarding concerns of two direct reports regarding our bosses demeanor.  I'm unsure if the director has shared this information with HR or not. I sort of expect HR to protect my boss and take his side. 

How do I go about having this conversation with HR? Do any of you guys have experience with this? Obviously I don't want to lose my job over this, but HR needs to know what's going on.

The wings are scaled so 90% of air passes through on an upstroke. I originally assumed I would use the drag coefficient of 1.28 and air density as if I am near the ground so 1.225 kg/m3. I weigh 250 lb but to build in a margin of error and compensate for the weight of the wings I am figuring on 350 lb.

41,Is Lean Six Sigma green belt worth it outside of manufacturing,1575737824,"My company started experiment with a new line of business last year. Unfortunately it has been a huge struggle and loss for us. We just finished a large batch of order recently by working some crazy hours (8am-10pm) and have to pull addition people from the main company over for help since the group was still in its infancy, shorted staff and inexperienced. Our focus is mainly research and integration, most of our entire production line are made by hand due to the delicacy, pricey and fragility nature of the components. 

I asked my boss if I could find something that could help us improve the efficency of our process and got a go ahead. One of the thing came up is using lean six sigma. It seems to me that lean six sigma is more useful in manufacturing and I'm not quite sure if it would help with our problem or not. 

Since our company is mainly a software company, none of our people have any background in this. I'm myself also just another new inexperienced engineer (5months) so it's like a blind leading a blind. The obvious thing would be hiring a more experienced engineer in this situation but since the group has been operate at loss, we don't expect to be able to bring in a more inexperienced engineer.

I have been working for the same company since I got out of grad school 7 years ago. The job is fine, I made some lateral moves and have experience in multiple applications within the company which I think has helped me develop.
I recently started feeling that I am not satisfied, the job is not challenging anymore and of course I would like to move up (pay and position). An opportunity opened up where they needed a senior engineer with much better pay and position in my old department, I cross all the boxes with the job requirements and more! I chatted with my old boss who loves me and he said that would love to have me back but HR policy is to not give pay and position bumps if someone switches departments. So I was told I can apply for that position at the same pay, and I would get small pay increases every year. Of course that’s a no go for me, they were willing to hire an outsider and pay him good money and wait for him to get up the learning curve which takes 1+ years since this is a very niche application, very low demand and even lower supply for experts there.

That situation made me take a deep look at where my career is and I realized I need to GET OUT if I wanted to advance. I think I need to go work for another company and gain new experiences, my experience beyond my current responsibilities is fairly limited.

My questions are:
- Does it make sense to go on a job interview spree to just get out of my comfort zone and evaluate how other companies would value my services?
- I haven’t updated my resume in years, do you prefer writing the resume yourself or hiring a professional resume writer? I feel with all the HR practices and filters, it could be worth it getting that resume professionally done to increase my chances

Can a Boeing 737 Aircraft, if redesigned specifically for the purpose of doing a backflip, be physically able to complete it?

There are some ground rules that we stated

1. The pilot does not have to be human, can be a computer (in case G forces would cause a human pilot to pass out) 
2. Can occur in any place flyable by the aircraft
3. The aircraft must take off and land on its own (no crash landings)
4. No overuse of rare earth minerals/metals beyond what the 737 already has (I.e. have wings layered in with diamonds for support)
5. Even if the aircraft stalls, so long as it completes a 91 degree rotation and uses gravity to come back to spin back to an even 0 degrees, that is a backflip

For arguments sake, here are some ideas that both sides came up with (keep in mind, all of these ideas could totally be wrong, we’re not engineers)  

Against:

A. The plane would not be able to keep its wings attached to the hull, they would break off due to how much wind resistance would be required to pull up, both from initiating the flip, and especially recovering from it during descent. 

B. If the plane were able to complete half of the flip, if would then stall to an unrecoverable spot and would nosedive into a crash, regardless of how high it was 

C. The speed at which the plane would be going would during descent would cause too much stress on the aircraft to maintain structural integrity

D. It simply is too heavy 

For:

A. If the wings were designed more akin to a smaller jet aircraft (stronger angle along the side of the aircraft), then the wings would be less susceptible to breaking

B. If any plane can do a backflip, that theoretically means that if scaled upward in proportion, other aircraft should be able to replicate the same physics if designed correctly

C. If high enough in its cruising range, wind resistance would be lessened to an extent, putting less stress on the wings and aircraft

D. If NASA can put a robot outside of the solar system, there’s surely a way to simply make a big plane do a loopty loop



So what are your thoughts? Could you use the 737 as a base to make a backflip performing aircraft? If so, how did you do it, or why not?",AskEngineers,False,mataboi,/r/AskEngineers/comments/e72pmg/can_a_boeing_737_aircraft_if_redesigned/
78,DOD Public vs Private Sector Career Advice,1575654677,"
I need some career advice/info, and I figured this would help a good place to ask. This is a little long, but I’d really appreciate some help here. Thanks!

I’m a freshman in college, double majoring in ME and physics. I’m interested in working in either defense or aerospace, but haven’t really committed either way. 

Over the last two summers, I worked as an intern for a DoD research lab. That lab is planning on recruiting me for work after graduation, but I’m not sure if that is the direction I want to go. I don’t like the location of the lab at all and I’m concerned I’d be stuck as “the intern” even after I’ve graduated. 

I also just stumbled across the DoD’s SMART Scholars program, which looks like an absolutely incredible deal. Essentially they pay my tuition, along with about 30k a year in monthly checks, but they require I work an internship every summer and then commit to work at a designated lab for one year per year they paid my tuition. For me, that would be 2 summer internships and then 2 years working for them after graduation. 

My dilemma is that I just don’t know enough about the engineering industry to decide if this SMART scholars program is a good idea. I understand public sector engineers tend to make less than private sector, but I don’t know how much less. Then, I don’t know how much the two years in public sector will influence my career if I choose to move into the private sector.  

So if you don’t mind, I have some questions. If you can answer any at all, I’d greatly appreciate it. 

1. What is the pay difference like?

82,Thoughts on road-based power generation?,1575649138,"As many of you know, electric vehicles recover some of their energy lost during deceleration via regenerative braking. For non EVs this energy is lost as heat/friction. 

There have been a number of attempts at developing road-based power generation (RBPG) platforms - essentially speed-bumps that produce power. What are your thoughts on the overall concept? 

It seems like a lot of the push back has been that these platforms would tax/take energy from vehicles and therefore wouldn’t be true net clean power generation. Wouldn’t this be addressed by installing them where cars are already required to stop, essentially recovering energy that would’ve otherwise gone to waste?  

I’d also assume these would require significant maintenance. Would it be possible to develop a RBPG platform that generates significantly more energy revenue than they cost to maintain? I’d imagine they can be engineered in a manner similar to automotive suspension that doesn’t seem to require a ton of maintenance.

There is also some push back around how much energy can actually be recovered per vehicle on average. For a 2000KG vehicle traveling 15mph it contains roughly 12.5 watt-hours of kinetic energy. What percent of that could theoretically be captured without damaging the vehicle, disturbing the driver, stressing the system too much, etc?

87,My company is changing manufacturing schedules and taking input from employees. Which options look best?,1575640165,"I recently started my first job after graduation working in a manufacturing company that operates 24/7. We might be switching away from three 8 hour shifts (day, evening, night) to something else and the company is polling all employees to get a sense for what people want. We have 6 options available to us that can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/QRdKxie). The last picture is a summary table.

My department (QA) works 6 days a week so I'll have every Sunday off no matter what, and I in particular will only be working day shifts, either 6am - 2pm for 8 hour shifts or 6am - 6pm for 12 hour shifts.  I've never worked longer than 8.5 hours a day, so I thought I would get a feel for what the engineering community thinks of these options before I pick my favorites. 

Things that relate specifically to me:

* My girlfriend who I live with works a relatively normal 8-4 five days a week and works from home on Mondays, and I'd like to maximize time with her where possible.
* I am paid hourly scheduled to work 40 hours a week, but usually I have some extra work and end up working around 43-45. 
* Overtime is calculated weekly (1.5x for every hour over 40 in a week)
* I am only in debt to my parents for school at the moment, an interest free loan that I have the incredibly lucky luxury of paying off as I think I am able to comfortably, so I'm currently not under much pressure to make as much money as possible (although who doesn't like making lots of cheddar?)
* My role is primarily a desk job, so there isn't much worry about me becoming fatigued from standing too long.
* My commute is about an hour each way, so I'm thinking it'd be nice to minimize the number of times I commute.
* I currently get 128 hours of vacation time per year and 40 hours of sick leave, as well as 2 floating holidays.

So, those that have worked both few long and many short shifts, what do you think?  Option C seems to be the most appealing to me at first glance (besides the fewer pay hours,) but I'm not sure how much OT I'd be able to log comfortably on 12 hour days. I have to rank them from 1-6, so I'd love to see how you all would react is presented with the same question.

Initially, I was thinking of using a 4 bar linkage, where the driven link is my input and one of the other links is the output. However, just now I thought about using a cam-follower. The idea is the cam rotates from 0 to 90 degrees, and the cam profile is such that the follower rotates according to the function previously mentioned, but scaled down by a factor of 10 or 100. So for the input from 0 to 90 the follower should rotate from 0 to 72.9 degrees if scaled down by a factor of 10.

My guess would be when the clutch is engaged after a downshift, there would be a spike in torque at the rear wheels, adding to the cars moment. I think people say you shouldn't because they are thinking of corners with highly lateral forces, so the car would lose control if you were on the limit of grip.

B.E. Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering

M.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) 

Experience: 5.2 years (Firmware development, platform development and RF system design over 2 jobs before &amp; after Masters)

7 months internship (full time internship developing the validation platform for a mid-sized semiconductor company)

Current Job Title: Software Quality Engineer (Based in Austin, Texas)

**Current package:** 

$93000 (Base pay)

No bonus plan &amp; stocks that are currently worthless (Company has been around for 10+ years but doesn’t want to go public)

**Job Duties:**

Write C code to test out accurate functionality of the hardware, simulator, instructions and communication protocols. Might soon do some performance analysis.

Assist the RTL team with some test automation. 

Use Bash shell and Tcl scripting in conjunction with C code. Python on rare occasions. 

Analyze test failures, find and file bugs and assist in adding solutions to improve the test suite.

  

**Complete Situation:**

I have been working at my current small sized company for the past year. On negotiating before joining, I could raise the initial salary from $90k to $92k. No signing bonus or annual bonus. Since I mentioned that I was expecting a much higher pay given my 4 years of prior experience. (2 years before masters &amp; 2 years after), they mentioned that once I spend 6 months in the company, my performance will be evaluated &amp; I’ll get a raise accordingly. 

Fast-forward 7 months in &amp; the company is not doing too well. I decide to not ask for a raise until things stabilize. After a month &amp; new funding, everyone in the company got a pay hike to “match industry standard salaries”. I got a hike of $1000 &amp; was told that since I was not with the company for even a year, that’s all that I would get. A few days later, I setup a meeting with my manager &amp; expressed my appreciation for the bonus. But I also mentioned to him that I was promised a review that should lead to a hike 6 months in. I told him that I would wait until I complete a year to approach the topic again. He has always been very accommodating, understanding &amp; is a great Manager. He agreed that it was the right way to approach things. 

Since we don’t have official reviews, during a casual talk with my Manager a while back, he mentioned that he got an overall good feedback (apart from me asking a lot of questions at times). I am planning on talking to him about the raise soon &amp; wanted to have a good case to bring to him. 

Therefore, here I am, asking you veterans out there for some advice. 

Since I joined, I have learnt Tcl &amp; Perl for various projects, expanded myself to help people from other teams when they have technical questions &amp; have generally been very flexible. Have worked with almost every team. I like the work, love working with &amp; learning from my colleagues &amp; love the flexibility of the job. However, I feel that the total compensation is highly inferior to my peers.

Before people say I’m acting entitled, or to do my own research on Glasdoor, Payscale, etc., you should know that I have already done the needful. Being in a smaller semiconductor company, I have compared my company with them &amp; also with the giants.

19,About to graduate - Advice Needed,1575579628,"Hey everyone,

I'm an undergraduate senior studying EE student who will graduate in May. I just want some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

A majority of my coursework the first 2.5 years has been a typical EE coursework - circuits, electronics, low-level programming, etc.

2 semesters ago, I took my first ever course on Machine Learning and Data Science, and have been hooked on it ever since. Since then, I have taken more Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning courses. Last summer, I did a basic EE internship working on electronics, as I failed to get a machine learning internship as I was still new to the discipline. I did well in the internship and the company gave me a good offer (the company is also close to my parent's home, which is a plus). For some reason (i don't even know why), I accepted it as I feared for what could happen if I let that opportunity go.

Now I am 1 semester from graduating and have no interest in pursuing electronics, especially as a full time job. Should I rescind on the offer that I accepted earlier and attempt to find a job or internship in machine learning/data science? Or should I take the safe route at the electronics company? Is it worth taking this risk?

34,Question about stabilization of drones,1575559531,"Hi everyone,

nowadays we see lots of cheap quadcopter drones in the market which are perfectly stabilized. IT seems trivial now, but I was wondering about the physics of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Those drones are stabilized using an onboard IMU (basically a gyro + accelerometer). The way I understand it and see IMUs being used on self-balancing robots is that the accelerometer gives you the direction of gravity on its three axes, and you use this to know ""which way is down"". This is pretty noisy by itself, so we use a complimentary filter or Kalman (or smth more complex) with the gyro to get stable readings.

&amp;#x200B;

That I mostly understand. This works well for self-balancing robot because gravity is the only force the device is subject to, so reading the accelerometer's output on its three axes allows us to know which way is gravity, so which way is down.

&amp;#x200B;

But now in a quadcopter, there is an additional force: the thrust from the propellers. When someone is driving a drone and make it accelerate toward to sky, and controlling it in various positions, etc., I'm having troubles understanding how the algorithm can maintain the stabilization.

&amp;#x200B;

At any time `t`, when reading the IMU, it gives you three forces, one on each of its axes, but how does it differentiate which are due to gravity and which is due to the thrust?

I feel stupid for wondering this because obviously this should be trivial since so many drones are on the market, but I feel like I'm missing something from the physics side.

&amp;#x200B;

The only way I can think this works is:

1. the stabilization algo was calibrated: it knows the produced thrust vs. the command given to motor, and
2. it's a (rapid) iterative process which tracks the orientation at all time. So if at `t=0-` I'm perfectly horizontal in midair, with a certain amount of thrust, at `t=0+` when I'm slightly tilted in an angle, I know the gravity and the thrust force which I was subjected to at `t=0-`, so I can predict which components is due to which force.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that how it's done?

&amp;#x200B;

But then I have another problem: I've seen commercials for drones which you unfold from your bag, throw it up from a bridge, and after a fraction of a second, the drone starts and automatically stabilizes itself. Now that's something I don't understand: when you throw the drone in the air, the IMU can detect free fall, so it knows it is falling, but how can it know which way it is falling. In free fall, how does the IMU know which way is down?

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus question; I know this sounds stupid, but I cannot wrap my head around this question: what exactly does an accelerometer output?

It cannot be the force it is subjected to, because an accelerometer a rest on a table will give you 9.81 N on its Z-axis, but since it's not passing through the table, the table react with exactly 9.81 N opposite (mass m factored out).

Also it cannot be ""acceleration"" either, because when a rest on the table, the IMU is not accelerated, its velocity doesn't change.

Also when in free fall, dropped from a height, the accelerometer outputs 0 on all its axes. How come?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this sounds trivial since cheap, $3 IMU are abundant on the market, but I seem to have reached a deadlock in my brain \^\^

The problem is this boat lost the piece or pieces that originally held the rudder on. Currently a long bolt and nuts are used to attach the rudder. I really don't like attaching the rudder this way. But, I am dumbfounded how it was done originally. The thing is the boat is deigned to be pretty simple to set up. So I'm pretty sure there is a simple solution to this. One issue is the tiller is protruding from the top of the rudder attachment point that blocks the bolt from going in from the top. The bolt has to be slid up from underneath.  

So whatever rod they were using was attached to the chain and slid in from the bottom?  I don't think the tiller was supposed to be removed from the rudder but it is possible. The indention at the top of the rudder attachment point probably has something to do with locking in the rod. I'm very confused. The eyes on the stern of the boat are the same as on the rudder. 

I'm thinking there was maybe a rod and a large cotter pin. Any ideas?

I'm a journeyman plumber gas fitter, and I wanted to a different passion as time went on, so I shadowed an electrical engineer for a couple of weeks, and completely fell in love with this field, and here I am today.

Throughout my journey, I have met many other individuals that definitely share a similar passion, throughout all the different fields. My question to this community is what for you was your inspiration to jump into this line of work? And do you regret not choosing something different, or do you still wake up every single day and love it?

A few months ago, I accepted a job offer from a company that I'm excited to work at, but nobody around me has heard of (which is 100% fine for me).

Today, I got a job interview at Lockheed Martin (from my application a few months ago). For the sake of argument, lets just assume thinks went crazy well and I got an offer. I've been thinking about whether or not I'd retract my current acceptance from company A (which I'd feel really shitty about) to go work at Lockheed and I'm really torn over one particular issue: My long-term career. 

In the short-term, company A seems to be great. Awesome location, good pay, good benefits, boss seems to be really nice, job seems interesting, etc. Lockheed is in a worse location, I don't know my boss/pay/benefits or anything like that yet, and the job doesn't seem *quite* as cool. BUT, it is Lockheed Martin, and I keep thinking about how that would look on my resume if I decided to go back to the job market in a few years. I guess I should be pretty direct: like a lot of people, I've always wanted to work at a place like NASA or SpaceX. Having Lockheed on my resume seems like it would be my best shot at locking down one of those jobs.

The shelf is entirely metal except for some sort of fake wood door. It sits on plastic or rubber casters, which sit on vinyl tiles on a concrete floor. The house has no grounds (very old house, not mine), so I'd guess that the shelf is very isolated and has no way to dissipate the charge.

Is this a sign of an electrical issue, either of the printer or the house? Other appliances don't seem to have this issue.

I have a couple other years experience working in various other, unrelated engineering roles (project management, tool design). I have the opportunity to switch companies and start a role as a project engineer working on building automation control systems (BAS), from design and programming to commissioning. The role has field work involved, which I enjoy. 

The two things that I am potentially attracted to in this role are:

1. I can feel good about what I'm creating. These are projects that are attempting to save money by reducing energy costs/waste. Outside of engineering, I spend quite a bit of time outdoors and thus doing something that reduces our impact on the environment is important to me (the magnitude of this is debatable, I know). This is different from my previous jobs where I was creating things that I did not value.
2. Higher salary ceiling. From my research, controls and BAS engineers earn more than the roles I've been in (HVAC design, tool design).

So, I have some questions for you controls and building automation engineers.

1. One of my goals is to maximize my income. Which path within this BAS field should I be aiming for if that is my goal? I am particularly interested in hearing about niches within this industry that are in demand (I have an entrepreneurial mindset rather than a 'climb the corporate ladder mindset').
2. How do you see the BAS field growing/developing in the next 20 years?
3. What are the skills, tools, and programming languages that I should be shooting for in order to be effective in this field?
4. What are the certifications within the BAS industry that will make me the most marketable to future employers?
5. This is a long shot. One of my 'dreams' is to work at remote infrastructure sites (I like being in the middle of nowhere, on the road). I would love, for example, to work for one of the government programs (as a contractor) in Antarctica, supporting/building/commissioning their infrastructure in harsh environments.
