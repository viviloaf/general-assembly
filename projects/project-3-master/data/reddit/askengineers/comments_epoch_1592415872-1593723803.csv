0,How to get a job in this without a degree?,1593723309,"So I have loved 3D printing since I was a kid.

Keep in mind it was a kit I was working on but I had to redesign it because it was a poorly built design.

It was after getting into 3D printing I got into all kinds of cool things like building rc planes, YT, quadcopters, and laser cutting. I build all my designs except for the RC designs in solidworks and stuff.

1,"I have a question about the use of alternating wavelengths of light in optic fibers to allow for higher speeds without ""Smearing""",1593722217," 

(Idk if this is the best sub for this but) So, multiphase Fiber Optics (especially plastic ones) tend to have a problem with non-linear light, so I was wondering if it was possible to use alternating wavelengths of light in an optic fiber that would be separated by a prism to ensure that this ""bleed"" does not affect signal quality effectively rating the bandwidth of an optic fiber.

so, I send a binary 101

it would be

1. would be the first color
2. would be the second color
3. would be the first color

I guess you would use two photoelectric devices only capable of receiving one of the colors

My dissertation supervisor has offered me a funded PhD position. The group's work revolves around computational modelling of engineering problems using molecular dynamics, CFD, etc. which is something that interests me greatly.

My problem is that I don't know how good the prospects of a PhD in engineering are. I know that I'd enjoy doing a PhD, and that I'd enjoy the more technical jobs that a PhD would allow me to do, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't mind just going into the industry with my masters if that'll earn me significantly more money.

I've done a 6 month placement at a large firm and was hoping to return full-time post-graduation, but they have a hiring freeze in place (much like everyone else), and things aren't getting better any time soon.

My only worry is studying for 4 more hard years, only to be rewarded with a job that pays as much as I could have received with only my masters, or even worse, more unemployment by the end of it all.

17,Can a good job offer be better than Erasmus?,1593707390,"TLDR: After 3 years of studying IT Engineering, I am debating whether to take an amazing job offer which can potentially get me hired in big autonomous driving companies, or make an erasmus as TUM (Munich) which can spice up my Uni experience while fitting good enough in my CV.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 1 year away from finishing my career (Information Technology &amp; Telecom Engineering, Barcelona), and I have been accepted to do an Erasmus exchange to TUM (Munich) on my last semester. However,  I have also been accepted to a very interesting job offer, participating in a pioneer project about Autonomous Driving, which would require me to give up the Erasmus.

&amp;#x200B;

What is better? Erasmus, or this very interesting job offer?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like Erasmus has historically been a nice tool to really improve your CV in some ways, proving that you are capable of living by yourself, learning a new culture, moving to a new place and other kind of challenges. We should take into account that I have lived in 4 different European countries and have learnt its culture and language, so that kinda makes it up if I decide to cancel my Erasmus.  What can't be compensated, tho, is the fact that my Uni life has been really boring and an Erasmus to Munich might be one of my last chances to live that kind of ""experience"" (parties and so).

About the job offer, it is a 1 year offer that is going to make my CV look impecable, and I am 100% sure that if I take it I am going to receive offers from all kind of autonomous driving companies and projects, probably including some of the big ones: Tesla, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, BMW...

My problem is figuring how to gauge the weight of the counter weight and what to use for it or as an alternative.

23,"Possible applications of an algorithm that detects vibrations/oscillations in real-time (frequency, amplitude, direction, and phase)",1593701990,"Hi everyone! 

I have a question about possible implementations/uses of my Master Thesis subject. A friend of mine who uses Reddit suggested I write my question here, because (she said) the community of AskEngineers is simply the best :)

What I have worked on is a mathematical filter that provides the periodic characteristics of a time-varying signal in real-time.

Given one or more input signals (e.g., acceleration, force, position, current) it tracks its dominant first-order sine component, and provides:  


1. Amplitude
2. Direction (if provided with readings from two axes on a plane)
3. Frequency
4. Phase 

This, in **real-time** (obviously not perfectly so, but close enough). To give an idea, for frequencies up to \~50 Hz, it would be fast enough to be used in closed-loop to control oscillatory behaviors or vibrations.

The original signal can be biased, noisy, and time-varying. The filter provides the given characteristics in a continuous fashion. 

The filter was part of a new academic research project... but it was ultimately discarded due to funding cuts during the corona crisis. 

Would anyone know if such tool could have any use in industry? I have the feeling it's a quite advanced piece of software/math, and that somewhere it could add value to some businesses...

I don't understand how grounding wires aren't hot or if/why they're safe to touch or how they're used or what.

I hear that messing with power supply units such as with those for PCs are dangerous because of their capacitors which can carry electricity for weeks (or months), and that they could be discharged. Is that done before they're desoldered? Are each of their terminals connected to each other with a resistor to discharge them while they're still connected to the circuit board?

I saw a demonstration video where a person should stay in their car if a live wire falls on it, but I didn't understand how come it is that the flow would go through a person the moment that they step on the ground outside of their car since it would seem that a person would have more resistance than the metal exterior of the car to the ground.

47,Looking for a precise check valve/ relief valve,1593658506,"Looking for a valve that can help me with a project. 

A simple model of the process is a tank that holds air and fluid. The goal is to cycle fluid through the system while maintaining a constant (vacuum) pressure inside the tank. 

The tank has two openings. The first opening is the fluid source with a pressure of 30 psi and has the valve holding back the flow. The servings opening is connected to a pump with a one way valve. 

The tank is filled with water then the pump is run to remove some of the liquid and decrease the air pressure. Let’s say down to 0.1 atm or roughly 1.5 psi. This is the set pressure that I want to maintain. 

During the operation, the pump needs to cycle fluid through the system while maintaining the vacuum. The pump will turn on and extract fluid. This will cause a drop in the internal pressure. In response to the pressure change the valve will open to maintain the vacuum pressure. 

It’s critical that the volume that leaves the system is the same as the volume leaving the system. 

Some types that I am looking into:

1) Vacuum breaker valve or a vacuum relief valve.  The issue I’ve run into is that most valves are designed to work with gases instead of fluids.

2) I have found some adjustable check valves that I imagined might work for this purpose. However they require a back pressure to close them that is too great.

For example, if I set them to 43 psi. (30 source + 13 vacuum) it will open, but may stay open until the pressure drops to 35 psi. This would reduce the process pressure too much.

I looked around for some valves with higher precision and found these Equilibar products. 
These seem to have very high precision but they will not work as a relief valve. 


In my mind this should be fairly simple, and I think I might be missing something obvious. I haven’t found anything so far that would work for this type of system. 

If anyone knows what I could use for this valve to keep an internal pressure within a precise range I would be very interested. Something around the accuracy of the Equilibar regulators (0.001 psi) would be ideal.",AskEngineers,False,reepicheep05,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hjp0po/looking_for_a_precise_check_valve_relief_valve/
48,Seeking your help in leveraging an OT education to transition into a health science-oriented engineer/designer/developer,1593658458,"Hello! I am a MSc of Occupational Therapy (OT) student from Canada that will graduate from a 2-year program in about 1 year. I have been reflecting a lot for the past 6 months and while I don’t want to go into so much detail about my reflections so I am simplifying a lot of things and leaving out some things, but I believe that I was partially wrong about OT as a profession, and so far the scope and philosophy of OT may not be exactly what I want out of a career. I recently came across this Masters of Rehabilitation Technology (https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/mrt) and after reflecting, I believe I thought that this was what OT school would be teaching and so I believe this Masters of Rehab Tech’s curriculum is in the ballpark of the type of career I was originally looking for (Curriculum examples: Assistive Tech, Wheelchair seating and mobility, Vehicle Modification, Illness/disease science, Ergonomics &amp; Occupational Biomechanics, Soft Tissue Biomechanics, Rehab Engineering design, product design, prosthetics and orthotics). 

***To summarize:***

* I knew that I wanted to help people but being an OT has started to become less desirable based on the earlier paragraph.
* I did my Bachelors in Kinesiology, so I enjoyed learning about how the human body works and learning health sciences. Plus, I have a desire to be hands-on &amp; design &amp; build/engineer things. Plus, I really want to work with high-tech.
* So, in a perfect world, an ideal career that may or may not exist is to:
   * Be someone who has an expert knowledge of health sciences like anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience, ergonomics, and uses that knowledge to do either type of work:
      * Review a patient’s unique medical case to uniquely design, develop, engineer, and prescribe “tools” (e.g. prosthetics, robotics, equipment, assistive tech) to help the patient become functional to do what they need to do.
      * OR, Work for companies to NOT just be a consultant but also actively is part of the designing, developing and engineering of the products or high tech to serve a larger clinical population (e.g. brain computer interface, bionic medicine, rehab tech like power wheelchairs)
* Yet, I’m not entirely sure how to transition into a career like this, and it may not happen in a short span of time. Thus, I do need to support myself financially after graduation in 1 year, so I am open to accepting the required responsibilities and attitudes of OT work. Thus, I am thinking of getting into **Seating and Mobility** work as it seems like this branch of OT work is the most in the ballpark of the type of career I am looking for. For that reason, I am looking potentially into **doing a certification for seating and mobility.**

&amp;#x200B;

***The purpose of this post:***

**Thus, I am writing on here because:** 

* The pros of finishing this OT Masters seems to outweigh the cons so I am leaning towards finishing it, and I cannot do another Masters back to back like the Masters in Rehab Tech as I will be drowning in debt (plus this Masters is offered in America; not Canada). Plus, I am hoping that an OT education is sufficient to transition into the type of career I want.
* I mentioned that I have a general idea of the type of work I want to transition into (putting on a “engineer-ish hat” and “product designer/developer hat”)
* But after reflecting and researching for 6 months, I am having a difficult time on how to make a feasible career plan such as what certificates/courses I should take RIGHT NOW as a student to get my foot slowly in the door and which branch of OT work I could use as a stepping stone to transition.
* **Thus, if you have the time to provide guidance and/or provide mentorship on my career planning, I would really appreciate it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I know that working for an OT role as a means to an end as a stepping stone is not ideal but I didn’t realize what I wanted out of a career &amp; what is important to me and I learned this the hard way unfortunately. I have identified my shortness in thinking so even if you disagree with my thinking process of wanting to leverage an OT education, I gently and respectfully ask that the conversation only sticks to providing guidance/mentorship.**

50,Process Engineer to Production Manager,1593657042,"(Created a new account in case my coworkers stumbled on my real account)

Has anyone made this move before? Can you tell me about it?

I work in manufacturing of semiconductor equipment. We contract for larger companies and process many different part types at once. Our work is extremely technical. I’ve been at my company for 1.5 years. I made a career change to become an engineer and came to work for the company out of grad school. 

I’m a hard worker and I am well liked at work. Because of my prior career, I would describe myself as a good communicator and a people-person. In the past year or so I’ve really taken on this one part type and poured my heart and soul into it. We’ve had some issues that required communication with our vendor and customer, and I ended up taking a major role in these communications. I enjoy working on this part a lot and would be very happy to spend my whole day dedicated to it. The end application of this part is very interesting and important to me, which is why I enjoy it so much. It is also a major introduction into a new business for us, so this account is very important for us.

I’ve been told we are going to create a group specifically dedicated to processing this part for this customer, and I will become the production manager for this group. I’m not 100% sure that my title will be “production manager” since it’s unofficial right now, but that’s typically what the title is for other groups. I’m really excited about it. I’m curious if anyone else has made this move. Pros? Cons?

Thing is, my generator has a ground terminal that is NOT being used but specifically mentions that GFCI won't pop unless it's properly grounded.

After my power went on, I tested to see if it was genuinely my computer leaking power to ground somewhere by plugging it into my GFCI outlet in the bathroom, it didn't pop and ran fine.

The course is called General Engineering as you spend the first two years doing various compulsory modules and then get to specialise in the following two. This is a perfect course for me as I'm undecided about what branch I want to go down, but I'm leaning towards civil and structural engineering. 

I have many practical things I could talk about (super/extra-curriculars) that demonstrate my interest such as an EPQ, visiting an engineering firm, a Mark Evison project, problem-solving classes etc. I am also a very good student and grades aren't a problem, but I want to demonstrate how I developed my interest and appreciation for the subject. Essentially, I am struggling with the part with further reading.

At the moment I've read a few mathematical books such as Simon Sigh's The Code Book as I really love maths. However, I have no knowledge on any good engineering books. 

Hence, I'm curious to know what topics, concepts, theories I should research. Ideally I want to show that I've done further reading, which would allow me to talk about my own opinions on the subject, enable me to bring alternative views and demonstrate critical thinking, show that I've taken initiative and could act as a springboard so that any questions that may arise from my reading, would be answered at university. 

I know that being able to talk about particular areas of the subject that I find most interesting is extremely valuable, but any other any suggestions on demonstring passion for the field are welcomed.

I have a 9w neon light bulb that doesn't work in a lamp that I need it for, a lamp that has 3 more 9w light bulbs that work fine, but it works fine in another lamp.

I tried different combos of sockets and it's the same story. I have 2 new 9w bulbs that both don't work in the lamp I ordered them for. So it's not the socket and the bulb is not broken.

The only difference from the ones already screwed in and working is the amperage. The new ones are 78 mA and the working ones are 65 mA.
Everything else is the same 9w, E14, 50/60 Hz, 230 V, 2700 K.

A little bit of background. I completed my bachelors degree last year on Philippines. I also passed and became a licensed engineer on the same year. After I achieved these I decided to look for opportunities in UAE(Dubai), all of my siblings are here so they helped me financially to be here. 

I believe that being here can give me a lot of better opportunities but it’s harder than I expected. It feels like it doesn’t really matter if I’m licensed here so that made me feel sad. I had a couple of interviews and offers but some of it was very low and it was very far from my place, some of them are not even related to my degree. I’m not trying to be picky but I just want to be practical and I want to grow on the field that I have. 

I have other skills such as graphics designing (hobby), I applied to some but I immediately stopped because I feel that I wont be happy doing work unless its a engineering work. So I just did some online commission, just to have some cash. 

So I had an offer from an Engineering company with a good position. But during my contract signing the pandemic happened so the process of my application got freezed. I contacted them to ask for status but their only respond that the offices are not on operation now. I asked for updates numerous times but I did not have the response that I needed. It made me really sad because I was so excited to start and be exposed on the field but this happened. Anyway, I’m still trying to apply to other companies but it’s harder than ever.

I really need some advice on how to handle this, I know that it’s normal for freshers to experience this but it’s very depressing for me. Also knowing that my batch mates are doing okay I feel so insecure. 

Maybe you have some suggestions on how I can make this free time worth while. How can I handle this situation. If should I learn stuff through online. Tips for interviews and this field in general. Things to consider and rule of thumbs. Anything you can think of, I am open to discuss everything.

16,Idling car vs inverter generator (Efficiency and emissions),1593576963,"I've been looking into emissions/fuel consumption of inverter generators vs a gasoline car engine. 

Assuming  

1) Expected electrical load of around 500w. 

2) A 2.0 litre turbocharged direct injection engine, with a power inverter on the battery/alternator. (90A Alternator) 

3) A standard manufactured inverter generator rated for up to 2000w. 


From my cursory exploration it seems fuel consumption is comparable with the car engine at idle and the inverter generator running at 1/4 load.

With car engines having catalytic converters I assume much lower overall emissions.

I'm curious how this scales up as electrical power demand increases as well. 

This is the page which sparked my curiosity into this 

https://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/features/emissions-test-car-vs-truck-vs-leaf-blower.html


I think the biggest issue may be the cars alternator output at idle, though that can be modified with an uprated alternator. Since the battery provides ""starting"" power to the inverter, at least peak load should be high. 


A 3rd option is a propane fueled inverter generator which seems the most emission friendly, at some cost of fuel efficiency. Though without a catalytic converter I'm unsure of emissions.

A 4th is that some aftermarket companies offer catalytic converters for generators, though I don't think for any low powered inverter generators.",AskEngineers,False,Hardcorex,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hj36ra/idling_car_vs_inverter_generator_efficiency_and/

Overall, the assembly line is about 60ft long and right now there is an I-beam spanning the length of the room overhead with a pneumatic crane riding along it. It is currently controlled via a wired remote (not sure if “wired” is proper terminology considering they’re actually air lines). Nothing huge maybe like a 1,000lb max load hoist. I want to replace this system with a PLC-controlled pick-and-place overhead hoist with integrated hanging scale. I plan on putting some type of distance meter or ultrasonic sensor at each end so I can program it to move a certain distance and then pick/place an object at different workstations along this line. I have a couple questions I wanted to gauge the public’s opinion on:

1) Does anyone have any good recommendations for automated overhead hoists? I’m not moving cargo containers here, just smallish 75lb objects. Everyone I’ve been able to find is made for serious lifting like 10+ tons. Must be able to ride along a standard steel I-beam. Preferably pneumatic.

2) What kind of sensor(s) would you recommend to be at each end so it can be programmed to move, say, 3.5ft to the left to pick up the part, 7.5ft to the right to place it, etc...",AskEngineers,False,DallasTheLab,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hj0qqe/automated_overhead_hoistcrane_design/
25,Are there any ways to make an old imported van structurally safer/or safer in general?,1593566388,"Hi There,  
I am very interested in buying a HiAce or microvan from Japan. The US has a restriction on imports on Japanese Domestic cars, one must wait until the vehicles are 25 years or older. So, I am looking at vans ranging from the early to mid 90’s.  
While I really like the vehicles and the vans’ layouts I have a small concern. Driving in Japan is quite different from the USA. From the little I know about 25 year old Japanese infrastructure, car accidents occured a lot less frequently compared to the US, and people generally drive at lower speeds. Henceforth, driving one of these Van’s in the US is a bit more risky. From a Modern Western perspective 1990-1995 microvans and Hiace vans are rated one star in terms of safety.  
I’ve done my own research and it seems that these vehicles can get totaled pretty easily in high speed accidents.  


 So, my question is as follows, "" is it possible to make these cars safer from a structural standpoint?"" Could adding a large steel bumper in the front protect passengers in the front seats? Is there some technology that exists that could potentially keep people safer. I’m willing to invest money into to make it happen. Even beyond of structural enhancements, any other creative ideas/input to make the car safer. Open to suggestions, I’m all ears.

I am at a crossroads in my career where I've gotten further and further from doing actual engineering work and getting more into technical support. I got my bachelors in BME and had a few internships I enjoyed (the best one was where I was a systems engineer intern responsible for maintaining big robotic chemical analyzing machines, I really had fun at this place and wish i stayed there) but instead of sticking with them I decided to try finding something better. I ended up finding a job as a field service technician for a medical device company a few months after graduating in 2017. It was fine for a while but the work was really basic and there was not much technical work involved. I quit (for different reasons) and tried finding a field service job that was more technical (like lab instruments/laser equipment/bigger devices) but after falling flat in many interviews for several months I ended up getting a job as a TeleHealth engineer at a big healthcare company. It sounds fancy and all but it has to be one of the easiest most dumbed down job ever. It certainly requires some professionalism and know-how with regards to customer service, communications and troubleshooting but a high school grad could do this job. I feel so bad about myself because of how simple it is and I feel like I could do something better. Unfortunately though at this point it's getting harder and harder to find a job I want and is challenging enough because my jobs have taken me further away and don't really qualify me for those jobs, even though I am pretty qualified to at least train for those jobs and excel, but most jobs prefer that I have more experience than I currently have.

I feel the only way to get back to what I want to do is go back to school and get a Masters. The problem is, I think a Masters in BME is going to be just as useless as my bachelors as I am not really specialized in any particular field but capable of understanding engineering fundamentals in any aspect. I was always most interested in the electrical part of engineering and was thinking maybe I could try heading in that direction but I am unsure of how much a pipe dream that might be.

95,Will 5G result in more inconsistent signal strength indoors?,1593470508,"So I know the basic gist is that the shorter the wavelength, the faster the signal is going to lose it's strength as it travels through any kind of medium.

There will be a lot more 5G towers to compensate for the signal strength loss.

However when determining the density of the 5G tower, I assume the signal strength is measured in a standardized environment as a benchmark.

So my question is that maybe the 5G signal strength may seem okay when compared in open air, but would there be more signal strength drop off if inside a building? Especially the layout of each building is different, and I can't imagine engineers will be able to take into consideration how many concrete walls the signal has to go through or reflect off.

The office building I work in already have spotty signals that it can range from full signal strength to no signal by moving six feet to the side.

0,Deck beam connection in a cramped space,1593460222,"Wasn't sure to flair this as mechanical or civil. It would be structural so I guess civil?

So I'm replacing the house's aging deck this summer and I need opinions on the design, specifically the beam and its connections.

It's a small deck around 8ft x 7.5ft, fitting overtop of and attaching to the concrete steps that were built into the house. The steps are firmly attached to the house and move with the house, not the ground, so it's a pretty solid foundation.

[Here is the design so far](https://i.imgur.com/0hl8kkz.png)

So the boards (hidden) are needing to sit on the concrete or else they would be higher than the door frame (unfortunate, I know). The steps are both 7"" in height, totalling 14"" where the post will be placed. In this 14"" I need to fit a post, a beam, and joists. In the photo:

1: 2x6 ledger attached to the concrete steps with concrete anchors

2: 2x6 joist, top flush with the concrete

3: the 3-ply 2x6 beam

4: 6x6 post, sitting on the bottom step

5: the concrete steps, 28"" tall overall

6: 2x4 joist blocks, closest one transparent

7: hurricane bracket

8: post bracket (second one on far side hidden)

The rim and end joists are both hidden in the photo, but the rim joist sits on the end of the beam and also attached with a hurricane bracket. The hidden rim joist isn't supported by (1) but instead a couple of other horizontal and upward angled ""joists"" attached to ledgers on the side of the steps, running towards the house. The maximum supported length for this rim joist is then 56"" or maybe a little more, let's say 6ft.

Anyways, my [city's deck guide](https://winnipeg.ca/ppd/Documents/Brochures/Wood-Decks.pdf) says that for a max. supported joist length of 6ft, I need either a 2-ply 2x8 beam or a 3-ply 2x6 beam. Also, joists are allowed to be 2x6 as long as at 12"" joist spacing (that I'm using) and a maximum span of 10ft, which I don't exceed. The post has to be at least as wide as the beam, and I'm using 2 of them spaced 4.5ft apart (to both fit onto the step).

So in this 14"" vertical height, I have two options:

1) 2x6 joist on top of a 3-ply 2x6 beam, supported by a 6x6 post.

2) 2x6 joist on top of a 2-ply 2x8 beam, supported by a 4x4 post.

If you do the math, option 1 has a post height of around 3"", whereas option 2 has a post height of around 1.25"". I would prefer option 2 as the railing posts will be using 4x4's and I'd easily be able to use some offcuts for the post, rather than buying an entire 6x6 to only use like 6"" of it.

Problem with using the 4x4 posts is that I can't find any beam-to-post fitting that fits within that 1.25"". I guess I could just toenail it in, but that doesn't seem very secure to me.

I had also considered using option 2 but having some sort of concrete paver under the beam acting as a ""post"", but it would have to be exactly 1.25"" thick, something that I cannot find.

My senior year I became interested in geotech and was fortunate enough to obtain a position as a field engineer for a geo/environmental consulting company in the thick of the Covid fiasco.

2,"How novel, possible, and if it is possible, well-performing would this concept for a two-stroke engine with no need for pre-ignition compression be?",1593459002,"First, I'd like to note that I am an underclassman undergraduate physics student and largely self-taught armchair engineer who will soon switch majors to mechanical engineering. As such, my knowledge of thermodynamics is filled with holes, and therefore I'm coming here (for the first time) for an expert analysis on my ideas.

For context, Brayton-cycle engines, Diesel-cycle engines, and Otto-cycle engines all rely on compression before combustion, which takes energy and raises the temperature of the parcel of air, posing temperature control difficulties (especially in the first category, where the thermal environment is continuous). As such, I challenged myself to design an engine that didn't require pre-ignition compression *at all.* It also turned out to be a two-stroke engine, a family that typically requires not only pre-ignition but pre-intake compression. Here is a description of how it would operate:

1. An open cylinder at ambient pressure and temperature would be closed, injected with fuel, and ignited using a spark or glow plug. (Alternately, the air could be pre-carbureted.)
2. The air inside the cylinder will quickly reach a temperature approximately that of the constant-volume adiabatic flame temperature, massively raising the pressure and causing work to be applied to the piston head.
3. The exhaust would expand (adiabatically?) until near-ambient pressure is re-established, at which point the exit valves would open and the piston would be driven back by the rotational mechanical inertia of the crankshaft.
4. The piston would scavenge out the exhaust, before being driven back by the rotational mechanical inertia of the crankshaft, when the exhaust valve would close, the intake would open, and it would suck in intake air at near-ambient-pressure and temperature.
5. At a certain point during the intake stroke, the entire cylinder would close, fuel would be injected and ignited, and the process would repeat.

Note that while I said ""crankshaft"" several times, the work-transfer and volume-varier mechanism could be something entirely different—in fact, it would probably be good not to have a near-constant-speed crankshaft to make the combustion process closer to constant-volume.

So, is such an engine concept novel? I feel that I could be just describing a version of a pulsejet (Lenoir-cycle engine) designed to produce brake power instead of thrust, but I'm not sure. Regardless, could such an engine work at all? If so, how well would it perform and why?

(Note that I'm actually almost certain it would have a lower thermal efficiency potential than all three types of engines mentioned, especially as it seems would be limited to overall pressure ratios around 10 and ""compression"" (expansion) ratios around 5 if petrol is used. Perhaps that could lead to lighter cylinders and thus a higher power-to-weight ratio than at least Diesel, but I doubt it. Hence why it hasn't seriously been considered before.)",AskEngineers,False,GrantExploit,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hi6tcc/how_novel_possible_and_if_it_is_possible/

14,ME Needing Career Advice,1593444908,"I have very mixed emotions about the field and I'm concerned with there being any future in the industry. I've been out of school for about 4 years. 2 of the years at an integration company that I got restructured. I came in at 8am in the morning and would leave at 6pm however my manager said I wasn't working enough even though I would also work some weekends. My boss kept my salary stagnate because I said I had my own method of switching screens in Solidworks rather than using the tab key so he noted I was being too defensive for help in my salary review. There was very poor guidance on projects, other engineers would only cut me down for asking questions like is there any more advanced calculations past Shigley's equations for items like gear trains though I was a fresh undergrad. I was even more confused when the PE on site laughed at me for a design though it was the orientation I was taught in school for being stronger due to second moment of area. The PE requested I design a holding plate with a single rectangular plate. I oriented the 2"" on the ground and 4"" high to get more moment of area for less deflection to be stronger but the PE at this company just laughed and said I was wrong and said it was the wrong orientation. I still to this day don't understand why as when I referenced my statics notes this is literally what my teacher taught us for a single rectangle. I understand if you have an I beam the top and bottom plates take the very high compressive and tensile loads but this wasn't applicable for what the PE was allowing me to design with. When I asked the PE about this he just laughed at me in front of all my coworkers and said I should've known and he put in bad recommendations to my boss. I was already feeling impostor syndrome and it was what I was taught in school. The place was horrible, I was let go and I joined a new company right after by talking to my network and followed my same friendliness and question asking and the response was completely opposite. The entire team supported me asking questions and learning about the products and industry and I had a mentor who helped guide me when I asked about the history of certain parts and items. After a year I had engineers coming to me for part design, team leads asking me about GD&amp;T and I even started putting together teams to solve larger issues. I also helped younger engineers at other sites. My personal reviews were very positive from my boss. I felt like I had finally found a great job and industry as well as positive coworkers. Flash forward to 3 months ago and 2 years into the job. The entire plant is closing and I was let go with my manager and 30% of the site however nobody else in my specific group was let go which really surprised me. Some of the workers called me and said I should've been way further down the line to be let go. The remaining 70% are moved to different sites in the US. I have good recommendations from all of my coworkers, the buyers, R&amp;D department and friends in other sectors within the company however the separation agreements require we can't use anyone at the company as a reference. I feel like it's going to be extremely hard to get a job as I was let go twice in my early career and I'm getting nervous. Is my career salvageable? I feel like with the amount of new grads I won't be able to get a new job and this will look extremely poor to hiring managers.

19,Inexperienced Engineer seeks career advice - how to become a space systems engineer?,1593442755,"Dear fellow Engineers, I really could use your advice!

The title probably gives it away - It's my dream to work in the space industry, be part of the mission and spacecraft design. But now I'm stuck at a job which has nothing to do with space and does not challange or interest me at all. I've defined where I am and where I want to be - but how do I get there?

For the context: Four years ago I graduated university in Germany as an aerospace engineer and spent ten months at a robotics research center as a research fellow. When my contract wasn't extended any more I looked one year for a new job and finally got a position at a nuclear research facility. This is not my dream job, but I didn't really had a choice back then. This was 20 months ago.

I'm looking for a new job in the space industry for one year now, but had no luck. Problem number one is the high competition in this field, too many applicants for too few jobs. The second problem: I'm not really experienced when it comes to the space technology. I have a lot of theoretical knowledge, but what is the value of this, compared to practical experience? And my current job isn't helping at all... in the end a nuclear reactor is not a rocket and there's no possability to design a satellite. Besides that I don't have anything to do with the nuclear part of the facility. I can't gain \*relevant\* experience here and because of my lack of experience I'm not competitive in the job market... kind of a vicious cycle.

My strategy is to learn as much as possible, take certifications and change my job responsabilities from mere technical support to system engineering. It seems to work, as my supervisors trusted me with the development of a entirely new system, which is quite crucial for this facility. It's all autodidactical learning-by-doing but at least I can apply the theory from the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook to reality.

Last year I made the STK Master certification and last week it was IBM rational DOORS. Next month I will add MBSE to that list. The whole last 12 months I've been working on a research paper and intend to submit it to the AIAA Journal.

But I don't think that's enough. What else can I do? I've read that most systems engineers start as subsystem engineers, for example mechanical or thermal or GNC... but how could I compete with someone who does nothing else than this, since his or hers graduation?

Another problem (almost forgot about this) is that I've virtually zero contacts in the space industry. (I'm terrible when it comes to networking. A disadvantage of being an introvert, I guess.)

Recently replaced my house's AC system and while I'm at it I'm trying to be smarter in general about using it efficiently. Collecting some data day by day for how much it runs depending on outdoor temperature, indoor thermostat set points, etc.

I got to thinking... the actual heat transfer rate of the system must vary with conditions. E.g.:

* Indoor temperature 70 F, outdoor 90 F vs...
* Indoor 80, outdoor 80

You'd intuitively think it should be easier to move heat indoor to out in the latter case with whatever temperature split can be achieved from the condenser to ambient.

Is there data available for that sort of thing? How many actual BTU's / hr can be moved depending on the outdoor temperature or the split from indoor to outdoor? Typical rules of thumb?

Unfortunately my thermo and thermal systems design classes were 15 years ago, I wasn't particularly good with it then, and I haven't had to give any of it any thought in my employment since! So if I learned any of this at some point in the past it has long since left my memory.

43,"Semiconductor Industry, Learning a Second Language?",1593389199,"I'm looking for some opinions on a ""most useful"" foreign language to learn, that may have good career opportunities. Just as a disclaimer at the start, I have no presumptions that I would ever become *truly* fluent. But I do think that with the right circumstances and time-frame, could become haltingly conversational.

I work in the semiconductor industry for an equipment supplier as a customer facing/interacting engineer. In my several years of experience I've worked with customers and field engineers all over the APAC region, who spoke primarily Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin as a first language.

I have taken Spanish language courses throughout highschool and college, and while I have found it useful personally, it really hasn't been helpful for my career options. Partly due to lack of opportunity to use it after moving to areas with less Spanish speakers, and partly due to time and laziness, business, etc., my Spanish skills have faded considerably. I enjoy studying a foreign language for personal enrichment, and am setting some study goals for myself. This brought up the thought to me, why not study a language that could be beneficial to my career?

I have spent time in the field in Taiwan and Korea, and knowing at least some of the local language would have been nice.

So that brings me here, I know in my experience I spent the most time in S. Korea, but that was due to a specific project in the country. My bias is that the most beneficial language to study would be Korean. However, it seems that there are more Korean/English bilingual engineers than Japanese/English or Mandarin/English bilingual engineers. 

Japanese seems to have the least bilingual with English engineers, but the smallest market. The largest market by far seems to be China/Taiwan, however Korean companies seem to be partnering more deeply with foreign companies. 

I have seen essentially no lack of European Engineers that can fluently communicate in English and Dutch/French/German, Etc. So, I haven't mentioned them as possibilities, even though I realize they would be far easier to learn than an Asian language. Feel free to disagree with this assessment, of course! 

Just for personal usage, within Asia I would be most interested in travelling in Japan and Korea, so there's that.

I've seen pumped hydro installation costs that indicate that it can be economical in cases where there are dams already installed for other purposes, especially in the case of existing hydro-electricity plants where the turbines are already running, but does this efficiency in cost scale down to residential sized systems.

54,Drug Tests/Marijuana In the Workplace (Story/Discussion),1593368111,"
I know drugs and Marijuana in the engineering workplace has been discussed on this sub before, but I feel as though my situation is some what unique. 

I’ll try to give some background information without giving too much about myself up: 

- Recent Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering Graduate 

- Originally from a country outside of the U.S where weed is widely used and decriminalized

- Early 20’s 

- Studied in the U.S, New England specifically 

Since I finished school back in late 2019 I’ve been stuck home looking for jobs, playing video games and smoking weed with not much else to do.

After searching for employment for a while, I was finally interviewed in early March for a position at a Fire Systems Research &amp; Development company in the New England area. This would be my first professional job in the field since I’m a recent graduate. 

I got to interview in person with the company as this was literally a couple weeks at most before lockdowns and stay at home orders started. I interviewed well and the company was clearly interested in me, I could tell that they wanted to hire me there on the spot as I was a damn near 100% perfect fit for the position. 

The only catch... I had to pass a drug test and background check. (They actually checked my history from my home country AND here in the states) Now I knew that they would drug test so I stopped using THC as soon as they arranged an interview. I took the drug test about a week and a half later assuming I would be clean by then. 

Now before the background check and drug test results came back they had sent me an official hiring contract. They basically hired me before they had any knowledge of my results. They even agreed to pay me my asking salary with no negotiation and plenty of benefits. 

(At this point I’m super excited and happy that I landed my ideal position straight out of school.) So then HR gives me a start date, I think it was the second Monday in March, mind you while still waiting for test results. 

So after waiting for a while the lab releases my drug test results THE THURSDAY BEFORE MY START DATE so like 3 days before I start. 
BOOM results come back positive for THC. I don’t use any other drugs/chemicals, don’t smoke cigarettes and I rarely drink alcohol. 
A few minutes after this I get a call from the companies HR rep. saying that they could no longer offer me the job and that the contract would be terminated because of the positive THC result. 

(Que my heart sinking and my world shattering) 

I tried to reason with the HR rep. and explain that I had stopped using THC and that I would even offer to pay for myself to get retested later on to prove it. 
Well HR wasn’t having any of it and wouldn’t budge and basically reacted like they had just found out I had killed someone. 

Mind you the background checks didn’t produce anything since I don’t have any dirt on my name, not a single parking ticket or speeding ticket, I’m squeaky clean. 

Now I find this reaction was completely out of proportion and unreasonable. However I’m not saying I was automatically entitled to the position and they were certainly in their right to terminate the contract but when the only issue was my (past) THC use, I find the out right termination a bit of an overreaction. Especially when considering the company and the entire country would go on lockdown ~about a week later. I imagine the company had a hard time trying to find a replacement with all the restrictions, and ultimately ended up shooting themselves in the foot. 

I know I did this to myself but I want to hear some thoughts on the situation. 

TL;DR  Got hired for an engineering position right before lockdown, failed drug test because of THC and THC ONLY!! then got terminated. Thoughts?",AskEngineers,False,TisButMyThrowaway,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hhjba1/drug_testsmarijuana_in_the_workplace/

57,"I'm working on my summer project, and just hit my first big milestone! Now, I need to ask you guys some questions and discuss some of my design, mostly about gears and motors, before proceeding development of the next iteration :)",1593362208,"Hello guys,This is gonna be a long and a bit messy one, but hopefully a bit interesting, so please bear with me! 😊

A little backstory about my project and the questions I have, jump to next section if you don’t bother. I’m an engineering student focusing on electronics and computer science, as I’ve only got one year left of studies I spent much time applying to a lot of jobs relevant to my studies but due to covid most of them got cancelled, and those who didn’t, went on with other candidates. Standing there emptyhanded I came up with my own summerproject, with the goal of capturing and documenting the project on github in order to have something of value to show up at future job interviews. After some consideration and minor testing I ended up going with the idea of creating a conveyour belt. As of right now (..many iterations later) I have completed the first big milestone of achieving a pretty solid design of the transport rails and the plates moving the objects. I am pretty happy with the current result and here are some picture of the progress so far:

Overview: [https://imgur.com/Lf8bEop](https://imgur.com/Lf8bEop)Overview upside down: [https://imgur.com/d2OL9rT](https://imgur.com/d2OL9rT)Overview upside down, transport plates: [https://imgur.com/axEIm1s](https://imgur.com/axEIm1s)Short video: [https://youtu.be/j1w8cdFuUAY](https://youtu.be/j1w8cdFuUAY)

Worth noting is that the final version will be fixed to the table and cover a larger area that approximately take up the whole table which measures around 140x90 cm.

The next big milestone in this project is to add gears to the transport rails, attach 1, 2 or more(?) motors and also raise the height of the rails in order to make space for everything. My current (and initial) plan to drive the transport plates looks something like this:[https://imgur.com/paUZSek](https://imgur.com/paUZSek)

For very simple testing purposes I have read up a bit online and generated some (almost) random gears in Solidworks and printed them to get an initial feel for what’s ahead of me. That looked like this:[https://imgur.com/84vlC5Q](https://imgur.com/84vlC5Q)[https://imgur.com/W2n2fpk](https://imgur.com/W2n2fpk)

I have very limited knowledge about gears and the requirements of the motors for a project like this, that’s why I thought some of you guys may have some very valuable input for when I start developing the features for the upcoming second milestone in this project (driving the transport plates).

&amp;#x200B;

And so, finally(!), the things I want to discuss with you and have your guys input on. I have numbered them so you can use the corresponding number if you want to discuss any specific question:

**(1)** As illustrated in the picture on my current plan to drive the transport plates, I will probably use 2 motors, one on each side of the gearing of the transport plates and drive them horizontally in-between the driving gears. The pair of motors will be mounted in the middle of the long side of the rails.I may have to use two pair of motors, one pair on each long side. Is there a way to determine this beforehand or do I have to invest in a bunch of motors and just try it out? The plates run quite smooth on the rails but there is ofc some resistance because of the plastic-on-plastic and edges between rails.

Does anyone have experience with driving similar things, like the transport plates in my project? Are there any solution that may be more suitable for my case, if so, why would it be better? Can anyone experienced with similar things see any direct flaw in my plan? Since I’m new to this area I lack the eye to identify such things 😊

&amp;#x200B;

**(2)** Motors! According to your experience, what kind of motors would be the most suitable for a project like this? So far I’ve read up a bit and am considering some gear boxed DC motors with high torque, an alternative would also be stepper motors (I think), but since they’re more expensive I lean more towards the DC route. Also speed is not highly prioritized at all but I don’t want the conveyor belt to be \*painfully\* slow, therefore, how can I go on about to determine the speed of the conveyor belt depending on the RPM of the motors?There are plenty of alternatives of motors that seems suitable when I have scrolled through all of the Ali-express listings and similar sites, but if anyone feels like they have a great suggestion for my case, feel free to link it (and it would also be awesome to have and explanation as to why it would be a great choice)!

&amp;#x200B;

**(3)** Gears? There are plenty of useful information on this subject online, which I am currently reading up on but if any of you guys have experience with gears and the dimensioning of them, any input would be greatly appreciated. I am using a tool within Solidworks to generate spur gears, but am still not so comfortable with all the parameters of the gears. Are there any parameters that I should especially consider when I want a smooth driven conveyor belt with high torque and low speed?

64,Automotive brake question about rotor weight,1593358290,"Hi! Man I love Reddit, I hope someone who knows what they are talking about will see this and give me some wisdom.

**Question:** When looking at brakes from a performance/track perspective, i.e. heat capacity and cooling during repeated use, how does rotor mass play in vs size? Assumptions are traditional disc brake, one piece vented cast iron rotors, nothing fancy. Also assume pad area stays constant.

Background: College dropout from Mech Engineering. I'm a computer guy for 20 years now. Been messing with cars since forever. Working on developing an aftermarket brake kit. I understand the principles and math involved, as well as practical track experience. 

This is the set of knowledge I am working with, if anything is wrong let me know:

* Tires stop the car not brakes. Given a minimum ability of the brakes to use up the tire traction (engage ABS)
* Heat capacity of the heat sink (primarily the rotor) and dissipation of that heat is what allows you to stop the car again and again. Exceed this ability and brake temps rise until you get fade (fluid or pads over temp) in repeated hard use
* Appropriate pad compound and fluid can raise the working temp range of the brakes to help performance, as long as cold performance is not affected (street use) or doesn't matter (in case of race only use)

Details:

As an example, If I am comparing a rotor size between two brake systems, I am looking for a bigger rotor to be a higher ""performance"" piece. For example I am looking at a 350x32mm rotor (dia x thickness) vs a 380x34 rotor. I would assume greater mass, more heat capacity in the larger rotor. But then I look at the weights, and I find both rotors are 28lbs I being to wonder. As a heat sink they would have the very same heat capacity until fully heat soaked no? 

I am guessing the larger rotor has thinner rotor faces or some other places where the material is thinner in order to be the same weight but bigger. That means vent passages may be larger and overall surface area probably greater, which would infer that the ability of that larger rotor to dissipate heat is probably greater. But lacking the information and skills to calculate that, I have no idea how to quantify it.

**Bottom line: As an engineer would you look at these two systems and infer similar performance with a 28lb rotor? Or is the surface area/cooling factor great enough to make a major difference?**

I suspect the reasons for these choices for an OEM mfr go beyond simple performance. In this case a 350mm rotor with caliper will fit under an 18"" wheel and the 380 likely will not. On the other side, consumers like to see big brakes filling wheels, with flashy calipers, even if they would never ever need the performance. I know there is a mechanical advantage aspect of the greater effective radius with the larger dia rotor, but that can also be tuned hydraulically with the brake piston size(s) so I consider that a secondary factor.

83,Is airconditioning without external unit possible?,1593325256,"Hi, I live in an appartment where an external airconditioning unit isn't allowed (because of the noise). Every single airco designs I've seen so far uses an external unit / hose to get rid of the heat by blowing hot air outside. 

Is it possible to make a design where the heat is effectively transferred to an internal water tank instead? Just connect 2 water hoses to the airconditioning unit. When the water inside the tank gets too hot it'll automatically drain the water (either through the sink or stored for other uses I can't think of right now.). Afterwards it'll just automatically refill via tap water.

The weight on top of the wheels will be about 4kg per wheel at rest, up to a maximum of 16kg on a single wheel (the total weight of the vehicle). The fully collapsed leg should be no longer than 15-20cm and should extend to 30-40cm. The vehicle travels up to 20-25km/h, so the actuator should be able to extend and retract quite rapidly.

97,can I add absolute positioning to this toy robot arm (see link)?,1593298452,"Hi,

So I'm interested in **forward kinematics** (working out end position of a robot arm using known/measured joint angles) for position sensing of the end of a robot arm.  I found a pretty cheap assemble-yourself robot arm kit, namely this one:

https://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?id=375310

You have to pop out the components from a plastic sheet and assemble them yourself. It's just a parts kit.

The electronics shop salesperson told me that unfortunately this kit doesn't have any position sensing, either absolute or relative, just stops at the end of the servos: so you can only use it yourself with the remote control while watching it live, can't automate it or extract any position information from it.

My question is whether I would be able to build this specific kit while strategically replacing the servomotors with more expensive ones that have an additional data line (I imagine that's how it works? - note that I haven't used servos with position sensing in the past.)  So I'd make it exactly following the instructions but I'd replace just the motors with a different one by buying some (at the same voltage? same rough physical size? not sure which parameters I need to replicate) and then changing the programming logic to make use of the additional data line.

Basically is it possible to replace motors in a toy robot kit that has no absolute positioning just servos (motors) with a stop at the end, with ones that have absolute positioning, and have it still work?

How could I do this?  The reason for doing it is then the mechanical engineering would already be worked out! They're right in the kit.  I ""just"" have to add logic and programming, which is easier than trying to come up with it all myself.  (Though still difficult!)

The kit is super cheap as well (about $50).  It would let me get to the logic programming faster.  possible to do it this way? What can I expect?

I've noticed something in particular about AC pumps that pump fluids, with examples being pool filter pumps and hydraulics pumps. They all have a distinct sound in common.

In addition, you can very prominently hear the 4th partial or overtone (and also less prominently but still noticably, the 5th partial) in these kinds of pumps.

We keep all our inputs in a single official word document. It's long and dense - maybe 40-60 pages for an average project. We have to calculate many different things, and often the calculates feed in to each other. Currently we make pen and paper flow charts to show inputs and outputs. 

I'm sure you're familiar with the chaos of a project - client updating specs, colleagues being pulled off or added to the project, oh we need to calculate this extra thing, wait dohicky x isn't deterministic it's actually dohicky r. Maybe this worked when my company was a startup, but now even though each individual calculation is checked by three people looking for different types of mistakes (wrong numbers, wrong logic etc), sometimes more macro problems slip through - such as a change in client input or upstream calc results not trickling down to all the relevant calculations. 

Long setup, but here's the question: how do you keep data up to date between calculations?

Brainstorming I've come up with the following:
- Swap the official inputs word document for an official inputs program where the inputs are defined and can only be referenced (not changed) in downstream programs. Thus downstream calc inputs will never be out of date, and by saving calcs as PDFs we can have history of how the calcs changed from when they were initially made to the final versions at the project end. 
-This would mean switching our way of working to be more code-based than it is currently. We'd have to make scripts to automate our use of our many programs (eg ANSYS), as well as generating properly formatted calculation pdfs. 
-making a master flowchart that shows all calculation dependencies. Maybe there's a way to link this to the calcs themselves so the flowchart knows when a calc output changes, and automatically sends a notification to all downstream calcs.",AskEngineers,False,KiwiHopeful,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hgp4pw/uncommunicated_changes_in_downstream_calculations/

Specs are 7.4v 0.15a with a flow rate of 350ml/min. I do not know its head pressure

From disassembling it I can tell its a positive displacement pump based on the design. That partially explains why I am not happy with it as it vibrates quite a bit but that's literally the design of the pump. From my reading, it appears these pumps excel at maintaining flow even with high pressure.

64,Software/tool to make data noisy?,1593199154,"I know there are tools to *get rid* of noise, but I am looking for tools to do the opposite.

As a background, I am a student working on this summer project. Without going too much into it, we are currently in the process of fabricating (making up) data for us to test our algorithm with, as suggested by our advisor. This is because we need some degree of certainty with our processing methods, before we ask for the company to test things and give us actual data. With the fabricated plots of our output, we will extract the data and run it through our model. Having success with that, we need to test the data when it is *noisy* (like the experiment data will be), and thus we want to add noise to our fabricated data. This would allow us to justify our algorithm.

9,Why Are Non-Obligated Family Members Not Allowed To Attend The Iron Ring Ceremony?,1593142695,"I'm a Canadian civil engineering student that is going into their third year of studies, so my knowledge and understanding of the full details of the Iron Ring ceremony is a bit limited; most of the information I obtained are from Wikipedia and their citations, as well as [ironring.ca](https://ironring.ca).

I should also mention that, to those that are unaware, the *Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer* (Iron Ring ceremony) is a **Canadian** ritual, not to be confused with the **American** equivalent, the *Order of the Engineer*.

From my understanding, the Iron Ring ceremony can only be attended by those who are going to be taking the oath and any other individuals related to those taking the oath, so long as those said individuals have taken the oath themselves already and wear the ring on the day of. Furthermore, I understand that the main reason for this exclusivity is to further reinforce the idea of a tight-knit community in engineering, and the work done by engineers is a serious one.

While I find it good that the ceremony and ring acts a reminder to the bearer that the work they do must be done to the best of their ability, I find it really heartbreaking to hear that my family members (who have no background in engineering) won't be able to witness this momentous event when it is my time to receive the ring. Again, I understand that keeping all attendants to be of those that have taken the oath makes it seems more privilege/honour-like to participate in the ceremony, but is that a good enough reason to deprive my parents, who have supported me so much throughout my life, of the joy of seeing a member of the family being able to join such a prestigious community/career?

Also, I am having trouble understanding as to why the activities that happen during the ceremony is not to be publicized ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192330/http://www.networx.on.ca/~njdevil/mainpage/E_Eng/Academic/jj-ring.htm))? Having the showing of the ceremony be private is one thing, but from my understanding after reading, it seems that we are not allowed to disclose any information about what happened during the ceremony.

So basically, I have two main questions about the Iron Ring ceremony in Canada:

1. Is there any other reason why I can't invite my (non-obligated/non-engineering) family to see me receive the Iron Ring, other than to preserve the comradeship among engineers ([see citation 8](https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192330/http://www.networx.on.ca/~njdevil/mainpage/E_Eng/Academic/jj-ring.htm#8))?
2. Why are we not allowed to talk about the ceremony with other people outside of engineering (e.g., I'm not allowed to make a YouTube video telling my viewers what it's like to attend the ceremony)?

If there is anything that I have said that is incorrect or unclear, please let me know. I wish to understand this as much I can so I have time to mull over the idea of not having my family be with me when the time does come for me to get the Iron Ring, but as well as to able to explain why to them that they can't join me.

26,Request for guidance and/or mentor to help shape a career plan to leverage my OT education to do work that puts on an “engineer/developer/designer” hat.,1593120172,"***Who am I, what help am I seeking, what have I done to help myself:***

I am a MSc of Occupational Therapy (OT) student in North America with a BSc in Kinesiology, and I just finished 1st year of this 2-year MSc program. Although I still have a year left in the program, based on what I have experienced for the past few months, I have come to the conclusion that OT is very likely not what I initially thought it was (more on this later), and considering that we are in a pandemic which makes it a difficult time to find a job, I feel that staying and finishing the program outweighs the cons.

Plus, although my interpretation of OT may have been wrong or just partially wrong, there were things that excited me about OT initially (more on this later) and there is a part of me that feels that even if OT is not what I wanted it to be, I am hoping that I can find an OT related work or non-OT related work (by leveraging my OT Master’s degree) that I at least find somewhat enjoyable that can either:

1. **A) Become my final career goal if it MOSTLY aligns (if not fully) with the type of work I am seeking.**
2. **B) Be a career that can be used as a stepping stone to help me reach the type of career that I am looking for (more on this later) because I do need to work after graduation in 1 year and support myself while doing things on my free time after work to get to where I want to be.**

I will be describing what I initially thought OT was followed with a **priority list of the type of work I am seeking.** While I realize that there may not be a job that 100% matches exactly with all of the things on my **priority list (more on this later)** especially if I don’t go back to do another undergrad\*\*,\*\* but I am hoping that in an age where things are constantly changing, I am hoping that someone out there may be able to help me. **So, if anyone has the time to provide guidance and/or (even better) to be a mentor on helping me on these following things, I would greatly appreciate it:**

1. Help me identify career(s) that MOSTLY (if not fully) fulfills my **priority list** **(more on this later).**
2. Based on my **priority list (more on this later),** I laid out a few career options from my research (more on this later) so it would be really helpful if you could confirm if these options do MOSTLY align (if not fully) with my **priority list (more on this later)**
3. I researched some professional development certifications, but I’m not sure if these certifications are worth getting to help me reach the type of career I want. Some of these professional development certifications/courses are really expensive, so I would love your help in getting direction and confirmation on which of these I should invest in (e.g. certificates, workshops, continued education courses, diploma program, 2nd part-time Masters) to reach the type of work I should get into that meets the **priority list (more on this later)**
4. And also, any direction in what kind of placements could be useful (e.g. doing a neuro placement and use this as leverage in being knowledgeable about neuroscience) would be helpful.

Before I get into my **priority list,** I wanted to mention that if anyone is wondering why I am seeking help from others is because I feel that I’ve done as much as I can the past 6 months on making a career plan (reflecting on what I want, researching potential career paths, doing career/mental counselling, looking up people’s LinkedIn, looking at job descriptions, and doing informational interviews with other professions outside of OT), but I feel that I reached a lot of dead ends on creating a feasible career plan (e.g. if a career path even exists, identifying a career path, if certificates/continued ed courses/2nd Masters would even be helpful, if there is even demand and so is what I am doing worth the investment) so I thought I’d try seeking help.

While I have a general vision of the type of career I want (more on this later), I reached a lot of dead ends in **finding a feasible career** and a **feasible career plan** without doing another undergrad. Thus, in wanting to do something that aligns MOSTLY (if not all) with my **priority list, I need a feasible career plan** **(e.g. what professional development to do, what placements to try, what OT or non-OT jobs to apply for) for these time periods:**

1. **Right now to in approx. 1 year when I graduate the OT program**
2. **Then, when I start applying for jobs**
3. **Then when I do start working, I'm hoping to make a career plan of what I could be doing on my free time**
4. **what I could be doing on my free time to beef up my resume (e.g. doing a 2ndpart time masters)**

I know that making a long-term plan may not be easy, but I feel like I need to know that I am investing in something that will be worth the investment because right now, I don't really have a plan.

***My wrong impression of OT, what is the type of work I was originally hoping to do (this is finally describing the “more on this later”):***

Basically, when I was initially researching about OT, I read a lot of descriptions like “OTs adapt and modifies the environment” followed by reading articles like this where I encountered **environmental modification specialist (#6 on the list),** “OTs are creative and outside the box thinkers”, “OTs work with equipment and assistive devices/tech” to which I knew that OTs work with simple devices (e.g. adapted cooking knives) but I also thought that tech meant high-tech like prosthetics, robotics, different types of power wheelchairs, etc.

Based on how I interpreted OT before applying, I believed that OT is a branch of healthcare where we study a wide range of fundamentals of “hard/concrete” health science (anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience, cognitive health science) and I thought that OT was described as “holistic” because we would study a range of health science fundamentals. Then, I interpreted that OTs use this fundamental health-science knowledge to understand a patient’s unique medical case (e.g. patient’s anthropometrics, understanding weaker side due to hemiparesis, patient’s brain injury, ergonomic and injury prevention, etc) and then start forming creative solutions by designing, developing, engineering, or sometimes prescribing products or technology to help provide patients a “tool” to help them become more functional to do what they need to do rather than the more physiotherapy’s scope of practice where they would use strengthening exercises/techniques and modalities to directly rehabilitate and treat the patient (this is what I thought was the main fundamental difference between OT and PT).

This initial belief of what I thought OT was felt extremely cool and to this day, **I believe a career like this is what I am looking for.** **Simply put, I believe I wanted a career where I more so put on an engineer/designer/developer hat and create solutions to help that patient.** I now realized that with my background in Kinesiology where I enjoyed learning about health-related science (e.g. anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience) + my more black-white logical/fixer mindset (vs the more social, humanistic, and empathetic mindset needed in healthcare) + my fascination with high-technology + my desire to work with my hands to build and creatively design things led me to wanting a career like how I described. I now realized that this type of career that I was describing may be closely describing the role of biomedical engineers, rehabilitation/clinical engineers, product designers, or scientists. Maybe with the exception of product designers or “scientists”, I feel that becoming someone with the title “engineer” will not be possible unless I have an undergrad in engineering (except maybe software engineering), and again, while I do want to put on an engineer/developer/designer hat, I realize that I may not be able to fully be an engineer per say.

Although I realized now that I wanted to put on an engineer/developer/designer hat, I also did want my work to be meaningful and ultimately to help people which is why I initially thought healthcare was a good fit. However, by learning the hard way, I realized that being a clinician in a caring role really meant to be someone who is fundamentally empathetic, social, and extremely humanistic; to which I think my core personality/desire to be logical, creative, and hands-on like an engineer/developer/designer was what caused a disconnect from wanting to work in traditional OT settings or be a traditional clinical OT.

***So to make it clear, this is my ""priority list"" of the type of career I want and needing help shaping a career plan:***

1. 1st priority: To do work that hopefully has at least 1 if not all of the “hats” (engineering hat, developer hat, or a designer hat) --&gt; Ideally, I want work that requires understanding of health science fundamentals to then engineer/develop/design something for patients/clients/companies/corporations.
2. 2nd priority: Putting on these hats is a little more important so the 2nd priority is: “Work requires expertise knowledge of health science fundamentals like anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience”
3. 3rd priority: I’m trying to identify jobs that has relatively good job market demand and is relatively stable (this is important as I do need to do work that is sustainable so I can support myself + future family)
4. 4th priority: I want the details of the job to logical/fixer type of job that ultimately helps people --&gt; To me, doing work that fits within my personality while helping people is meaningful to me
5. 5th priority: For the job to be decently to well-paying (Money is important but at the end of the day, I just need enough to get by)

***What career path have I looked into:***

Without doing an engineering degree and based on what I’ve been looking at for the past 6 months, the careers that checks off some of the **priority list** are:

1. **Product designers &amp; Product development** \--&gt; I’m not really sure how to become one. My thinking is that if OTs are truly someone who can “adapt the environment” and knows health-science knowledge, then my original thinking was that OTs could potentially be a product designer or product developer for variety of tools/equipment/products for wide range of companies.
2. **UX/UI designer** (A path I thought of: Learn digital designing skills through continued education courses --&gt; work for UX/UI for any company --&gt; If I still feel like I want to do something health related, apply for any health tech companies)

While these 2 options certainly have either one of the core skills of engineering, developing, or designing, but I feel like going in these 2 options is a hard road to go on (at least for right after graduation), which is why doing something more OT related may be in my best interest as a starting point.

* **I was wondering what your thoughts are on these areas.**

With that said, these are OT related careers that I think meets some of my **priority list**, so I was hoping to get your thoughts on the following career options, or get suggestions on other career options, what professional development to work on, and help me make a career plan if a career seems like it is up my alley:

1. **Assistive Technology Professional**  

   1. I see posts like this: [https://otpotential.com/blog/non-traditional-ot-jobs](https://otpotential.com/blog/non-traditional-ot-jobs)
   2. **I see that we can get ATP certification through RESNA (**[**https://www.resna.org/Certification/Assistive-Technology-Professional-ATP**](https://www.resna.org/Certification/Assistive-Technology-Professional-ATP)**) but this certification is expensive and I’m not sure what kind of career you can even get into**.
   3. Maybe work for a vendor company and perhaps use this to leverage into being more in a design/development role?
2. **Environmental modification specialist**  

   1. I’ve been told to do SCEM (Specialty Certification in Environmental Modification) certification
   2. I was told that these people help set up homes with Smart Home Technology but it is more so just setting it up and less so engineering/designing/developing, nor would it really incorporate an expertise on ""hard sciences""
3. **Working in something related to architectural firms to help design homes**  

   1. I’ve seen that I can look into CAP (Certified Aging in Place), and SCEM certifications, but again I don’t really know what they do and what kind of jobs to even look for
   2. I am assuming that there is an element of design here but is this really going to provide the work that I am looking for?
4. **Seating and mobility**  

   1. I know that this is kind of in the realm of using technology and making customized chairs so there is component of design here. I’m not sure if this field could be a stepping stone?
   2. I've been told this is an area of OT that requires expertise on those ""hard sciences"" and can use high-tech with variety of different seating technology so this could be something to get into?
   3. I also do hear that this is a dying field and getting a certification through RESNA may not be worth it.
5. **Bionic medicine (working with prosthetics and robotics)**  

   1. I was told some OTs work in these areas and that OTs work with engineers for research purposes. While the actual engineers would design products, perhaps this type of work could provide at least partially the type of work I am looking for (being a more logical work, incorporating “Hard/concrete” health sciences, working with high tech)

***Closing remarks:***

I tried to keep this as short as possible, but I did want to share exactly what I am seeking help with as clearly as possible while also showing that I have also done my homework too. I get if people may not understand how I even got here and think “why did I even choose OT”, “you wouldn’t be a good OT if you want to have an engineer/developer/designer hat on”, “why didn’t you realize what you wanted and switched your undergrad at an earlier time”. To all of that, I didn’t know at the time and this is something I have started to realize during the past few months or so, and I cannot turn back time so I have to work with what I have (plus being in a masters is still a blessing). To those who may feel that way, I understand if you feel this way but I respectfully ask that as I didn’t make this post to do an in-depth analysis of all of my life’s choices, I am hoping that if you have the time and are willing to help, that the conversation centers around helping me shape out a career path.

If anyone has the time and is willing to provide guidance and/or be a mentor in helping me out with my career planning, I would really appreciate your help.

33,Help with building code,1593115026,"Hey all,

I'm looking for someone to help me understand the legal jargon of my local building code (see below). My problem is that a builder has installed a deck frame with zero flashing. The ledger is bolted directly into the rim joist of the house, and although everything online indicates back flashing is a must in that case, they don't seem to want to acknowledge the mistake. It'd be a lot easier to debate with them if I can show it violates the building code. I don't know if it does or not - I don't understand what it all means. Anyway as far as I can tell this is the applicable section of the building code:

**9.27.3.8. Flashing Installation**

**(1)** Except as provided in Sentence (2), flashing shall be installed at,

(a)  every horizontal junction between claddings elements,

(b)  every horizontal offset in the cladding, and

(c)  every horizontal line where the cladding substrates change and where,

(i)  the substrates differ sufficiently for stresses to be concentrated along that line, or

(ii)  the installation of the cladding on the lower substrate may compromise the drainage of moisture from behind the cladding above.

**(2)** Flashing need not be installed as described in Sentence (1),

(a)  where the upper cladding elements overlap the lower cladding elements by not less than 25 mm,

(b)  where,

(i)  the cladding above and below the joint is installed outboard of a drained and vented air space, and

(ii)  the horizontal detail is constructed so as to minimize ingress of precipitation into the air space, or

(c)  at horizontal construction joints in stucco, where,

(i)  the joint is finished with an expansion-contraction strip, and

(ii)  the cladding is installed outboard of a drained and vented air space.

**(3)** Flashing shall be installed over exterior wall openings where the vertical distance from the bottom of the eave to the top of the trim is more than one-quarter of the horizontal overhang of the eave.

**(4)** Flashing described in Sentences (1) and (3) shall,

(a)  extend not less that 50 mm upward inboard of the sheathing membrane or sheathing installed in lieu of the sheathing membrane,

(b)  have a slope of not less than 6% toward the exterior after the expected shrinkage of the *building* frame,

(c)  terminate at each end with an end-dam,

(i)  with a height in millimetres not less than 25 mm or 1/10 of the value of the 1 in 5 driving rain wind pressure in Pa, and

(ii)  at the height defined in Subclause (i), extending to the face of the adjacent cladding,

(d)  lap not less than 10 mm vertically over the *building* element below, and

(e)  terminate in a drip extending not less than 5 mm outward from the outer face of the *building* element below.

**(5)** Where the sills of windows and doors installed in exterior walls are not self-flashing, flashing shall be installed between the underside of the window or door and the wall construction below.

I've been shopping for hot tubs and there's some interesting differences between the brands with respects to insulation. I live in a northern climate, so running costs and performance without power are a big deal here.

Option 1. Some spray expanding foam (either hard foam or soft foam) directly on the fiberglass tub wall.

58,Too late/too difficult to earn an engineering degree with a full-time day job?,1593097633,"Hello all,

I recently graduated with an associates degree in construction management. I'm 29 years old. When I first started going to college in 2012, I started with aspirations of becoming a mechanical engineer, but I was younger, with a lot less self-discipline than I have now. I cared more about girlfriends and having a social life, and did a great job ruining my academic experience. I was in and out of school, taking numerous semesters off to ""figure out what I really want,"" and mainly just all-around ambition-less. Fast-forward to today, I'm a community college graduate - Associate of Applied Science in Construction Management. After finally buckling down in the last couple of years, it's all finally (disappointingly) paid off.

I work a full time job, 40 hours a week, with regular daytime hours. This is an office job, and the first I've ever had. Up until the end of last year, I worked strenuous outside labor jobs (construction), which left me little energy to focus on my evening classes (even when I had the time). I used to act like Calculus was just ""too hard,"" when honestly, I just needed to redirect more focus to appreciate it. Now I feel like if I had buckled down when I was younger, I'd have a degree in mechanical engineering.

Today, I'm debating whether I should take this 2-year degree and turn it into a bachelor's degree in construction management, or if I should start working on an engineering degree.

I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana near the campus of LSU. The community college I graduated from (BRCC) also offers associate's degrees in pre-engineering, which covers all your calculus, physics, and other pre-req courses. LSU has a construction management program which I am half-done with, due to my associate's degree. I feel like I'd be dumb not to finish up this CMGT bachelor's, with all the time I've already spent, but the pre-engineering/engineering option seems so alluring. I just feel like I'd never be able to put enough time in on engineering, especially having to work a full-time job. Also, I expect evening/night engineering course offerings to be almost nothing, whereas LSU offers their CMGT bachelor's program online.

This is outside my normal job, so idk what standards/regulations to meet, and I am not totally sure how to actually make a seat that is skookum but not too overbuilt.

Some context: I do CAD/CAM for flat lasers, tube lasers, press brakes, &amp; turret presses at a small (100 ppl) steel shop. We fabricate stuff like floor scrubber frames, table frames, mounting plates, or whatever for our customers. ""If it's made of steel, we'll make it."" Volumes from one-offs up to \~25k/yr.

He has already started selling tractor seats but now wants to make a flat-pack kit and/or complete welded assembly for a rolling mechanic's seat.

We are currently thinking of a weight rating around 300lb. Since this is America, I wouldn't be surprised if we could just write ""300lb capacity"" on our amazon ad and totally get away with it. But if there are some standards we must meet, I really don't want my ass (or his) on the line for failing to certify with the appropriate governing body.

74,What could be a workaround for thermal simulations when the simulation tool has no CFD capabilities at all?,1593089503,"Hello, everyone. I'm a young engineer working for almost two (2) years in a car radio company. This is my first job right after graduation (also two years ago), so I really have much to learn in the field.

My tasks are all centered about development and design of the mechanical aspects of the car radio. This includes making 3D model prototypes, preparing technical drawings, and conducting mechanical analyses.

Part of our most recent milestone is the development of a holistic thermal simulation for the product, to the scale in which we predict the resulting internal temperatures considering normal or worst product conditions as it is installed in the car. In the development of this process, I took a major part in research and multiple trials in order to get it to be highly accurate, at least in relation to our actual tests. Hence, I'm proud of this process as it is essentially a legacy for the company.

However, the caveat is our simulation tool is limited. The process has been developed without the Icepak or CFD tool for ANSYS, since we only used the base ""Steady-State Thermal"" analysis system. Our company could only purchase a cheaper license of ANSYS, and I don't expect them to prioritize purchasing a more advanced, albeit more expensive license anytime soon.

Since start of development, for products that can be approximated to be surrounded by still air, we were able to make sense of the whole process and get simulation results within 5% of actual test results. However, the time has come that we have to deal with models having fans. So, I humbly ask:

**What could be a workaround for thermal simulations when the simulation tool has no CFD capabilities at all?**

Mind you, I don't come empty-handed. I did my homework and started manually calculating for convection coefficients of all the individual parts' surfaces, considering *forced (external)* or *natural convection,* whichever is appropriate. My main reference is my college textbook: *Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, 7th Edition* by T. L. Bergman et. al.

Nonetheless, I felt the need to ask the wiser engineers in this group for invaluable advice that could point me in the right direction.

I hope this is enough to provide context, as I can't go too much into detail anymore as I risk leaking confidential information. Thank you for even taking the time to read.

I applied for a college not long ago which isn’t catered towards engineering like my last school, however has more variety.

My last school just reached out to me and asked me if I wanted to come back for my A Level studies. They have business links to engineering companies and better equipment than the college I’ve applied for, however they lack the actual learning content and teachers.

I’m looking to go into the renewable sector so I picked three courses at the college I’m looking to go to - Physics, Engineering and Electronics. I was wondering, is the college I’ve applied for better for my route into the engineering sector, or should I return to my old school where the A Level studies are more catered towards your engineering career.

So I'm a recent mech eng UK graduate that has been working at a safety engineering company, that deal with DSEAR/ATEX compliance on various sites. I've been here for 4 months and although the job isn't terrible, it isn't something I see myself doing for the next 2+ years. 

I would like to go into the robotics field but I feel like this work experience isn't very relevant. If I have to be completely honest, I feel like this job isn't really relevant to anything. Here is what I do at my job:

* Inspections on electrical kit to make sure it complies with DSEAR/ATEX standards. 
* Hazardous area zoning on sites be it has hazardous or dust hazardous. 
* 2D CAD hazardous zoning drawings for clients
* Consulting with clients on recommendations on what they should do to solve issues regarding compliance on their sites
* Writing up area classification/inspection reports to be delivered to clients post inspections

I've been to various sites such as power stations, military, chemical, food and gas production. AstraZeneca, BAE, DRAX, EDF etc..

I am specifically inquiring because I mentor tons of high school and college students and what I see on Reddit doesn’t align with my experience.

I have an ME degree from a University and have been applying to manufacturing environment roles mostly. I have been filling out one application for every round of COD modern warfare during this time, as financially I’m in a good position and the extra pay from Covid lowered my motivation (maybe 50-100 total mostly LinkedIn easy apply)

I see posts on here all the time with 100s of apps and no response. Months if not years of searching. And I have had no such issues even during corona

My three ideas for the discrepancy are as follows.

1. The university matters way more than I thought and most people are not getting past some glass ceiling or filter due to that. This is based on the fact that both companies I worked for previously wouldn’t really interview entry level candidates that didn’t attend a topish program.

2. Many engineers are not making connections or networks to the level I am. 4 of the 10 first round interviews have come from references and I have reached out to maybe 10% of my network so far.

3. Engineers typically don’t interview well. I was a competitive public speaker in school and find interviews actually enjoyable. Objectively I’m pretty good at them and I frequently give speeches that receive high praise so it’s in my wheelhouse. Plus I feel like a lot of the gotcha questions for engineering and manufacturing are easy once you know what they are.IE: how do you talk to VPs, how do you manage conflict, and what’s a time a project went bad are all spinable to be positive about you.

5,Electrical Engineering or Electrical Engineering Technology?,1593052725,"Hi all.

This semester I'll be a sophomore at a local 2-year community college. I'm currently enrolled in the college's AAS in Electrical Engineering Technology program. I'm undecided if I want to continue with the program, however.

From how I understand it, EE Technology is a more hands-on, blue-collar approach to electrical engineering, which involves more design-work and less hands-on experimentation and installation. This is fine - I'd like a job that puts me in more physical situations and away from a desk. I also don't particularly enjoy math or physics classes, and EE Technology seems to require less of that.

That said, I have a few concerns.

First of all, from how I gather, it seems that Electrical Engineering has a much better outlook, salary-wise. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says Electrical Engineering Technicians make an average of [$65,260 per year](https://www.bls.gov/OOH/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineering-technicians.htm#tab-1), while Electrical Engineers make around [$101,250](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-1).

Secondly, most 4-year colleges in my area (I live in Southern Illinois, if it helps), don't offer a follow-up to my community college's Electrical Engineering Technology Associates Degree.

I suppose what I want to know is whether it's worth pressing through and growing more accustomed to mathematics, physics, and a stationary desk-job for a shot at a much higher income. Or, should I stick to Electrical Engineering Technology, which seems more physical and less theoretical, yet doesn't offer as much in pay? I'd like the extra income, but don't want to shoot my brains out if it turns out I loathe the job or can't handle the stress.

10,"I've also joined the ""DIY"" ventilator trend! However, my inspiratory pressure sensor has a lot of ""pressure"" noise! What can I do?",1593045070,"Hello everyone. I'm a second year Mechanical Engineering student and for a month I've been working as a hobby on my own ventilator!  

I have a compressed air cylinder going into a regulator (regulates to 0.6 Mpa) and that goes to a proportional valve. Right after that, a T connection, where, one end goes to the pressure sensor, and the other end goes to the patients circuit (a real one that I bought). And, at the end of it, a test lung (just a cheap silicon one). And then just a solenoid valve to make the expiration.  

Below, is a picture of the pressure waveform. The top one is filtered (moving average) and the bottom one is raw. I am trying to make the raw waveform as good as possible specially when the pressure being to rise (which is the worst case). The closing noise seems to be much easier to handle, because sometimes it gets much lower depending on some configurations. However, the rising noise, is ALWAYS there.

[https://i.imgur.com/a7KUsHr.png](https://i.imgur.com/a7KUsHr.png)

The only way to make it a good ""rise and fall"" waveform is to increase the rise/fall time, which is unpractical given the inspiration and expiration times. In that picture, the rise time is around 0.5 seconds which is okay (i've seen some ventilators and simulators). And of course, if I decrease the rise time, it only gets worse. I also implemented a PI controller to make sure the valve won't open ""X percent"" instantly, but gradually instead in those 0.5 seconds (always from 0%).

The controller works with the filtered signal, and I can always target a pressure with good accuracy (from 4.5 cm H2O to 8 cm H2O in this case, which is a very low difference - that's why the noise plays a big role here).  

I've tried increasing the tubes diameter, moving the pressure sensor further away from the valve, switching to a different pressure sensor with different measurement range, changing the T connection to another type, increasing and decreasing the length of the tubes, and lots of other configurations. It never gets better, only worse.  

The ONLY thing that actually works is to measure the pressure at the Y connection, very close the the patients lungs. The raw signal is perfect (better than my filtered one). However, a lot of ventilators don't use pressure sensor at the patient's airway (I've seen a lot of videos), which is super odd to me.  

Another thing that I was thinking is that the orifice of my proportional valve is  ø1.6mm, which requires more pressure to work properly (\~ 0.6Mpa).  

There is another one of the same series that is ø2.3m, which works in lower pressure (\~0.3Mpa). And another other which is ø4.0mm (0.12Mpa). Sadly, I don't have those.  

If I increase the diameter, I can decrease the pressure and maybe these noises will be lower??

I know I have a lot to learn but I've been trying to solve this for a week. Any ideas??

ps: Just to be clear, this is not electrical noise. I've made measurements, some tests, and there is a low pass filter in the circuit.

# What's the difference between a Professional Energy Manager (PEM) and a Certified Energy Manager (CEM)

📷

I'm currently studying for the CEM exam and will be taking the 2 day study prep course this October. I'm studying the AEE Energy Management Handbook but also came across the Energy University website which offers free online courses to nearly identical topics and noticed that site offers an exam for PEM. I'm assuming both are very similar titles and it's just a matter of the awarding authority but would like to hear some input.

If anyone has also used the Energy University programs to prepare for the CEM I would appreciate your input as well. Thanks in advance!

I work in energy efficiency for a state-owned utility in the US northeast. I haven't heard of the PEM, either as a requirement or a qualification but it could just be a regional thing. In NYC at least, there is an energy code that must be met in new and existing construction which is allegedly reviewed by the Dept. of Buildings. Typically when plans/drawings are submitted, they are self-certified that they meet all applicable codes and standards either by a registered architect (RA) or a professional engineer (PE). When it comes to evaluation for energy code though, a CEM is also permitted to stamp instead of an RA or PE giving it some actual utility beyond some letters after your name.

My opinion was that the test was annoyingly oversimplified after having come out of an ABET accredited engineering program. I believe that it was developed so that anyone related to facilities could take it, meaning that you didn't have to have the strong mathematical foundation that engineers typical accrue through undergrad. I took it following the four day course offered by the AEE - for some reason I thought that was a requirement for sitting for the exam? Either way, as part of the course they provide you with another book (in addition to the handbook) summarizing the training. Every question on the exam could be answered by reviewing that particular book for examples or explicit sections of code. The exam is open book so as long as you manage your time well and you have that resource, there is really no acceptable reason why you wouldn't pass. My studying consisted of tabbing different sections of that review book for relevant examples and I very easily received a passing score. I am sure you won't have too much difficulty.

Thanks for the input and I really appreciate the insight on the exam. Since I'm taking the two day fast track course and work in mechanical (HVAC) engineering, I'm going to go through the reference guide and mostly focus on subjects related to other trades and economics prior to the course.

I also took one of the offered courses by the Energy University and it offers good refreshers on topics but is not as detailed as the AEE documentation. It appears they offer a PEM certificate through their site as a simplified alternative to the CEM.

First of all: I've seen similar questions in different posts but I'm not sure it's been quite answered yet. If there is, do not hesitate to refer me there. Thanks!

I recently graduated from university with a B.Eng Aerospace from a Canadian university.In the last while I have been applying for basically anything I feel I have a chance at: Internships, Technologist position, Technician position, Entry-level engineer, even Intermediate-level engineer. These from al fields from Electrical, Mechanical, Manufacturing, Aerospace, Controls, etc.

Most of my applications go into a black hole from which no response is ever heard from.The ones I hear of tend to be something along the lines of ""Thank you but no thanks, someone else has more relevant experience than you do""Lastly, I just got off a call from a recruiting company that wanted to hear more about me but their main negative was the ""lack of relevance experience for the job""

Unfortunately, non-paid or low-paying internships were not an option for me as I had to pay for my own tuition by working odd jobs non-related to the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what am I missing? How do I get said relevant experience as a recent grad?

51,Proper drill bit for hardened steel?,1593008434,"I've got an old gun; an 1895 Mauser.  It's a fun toy but if you study the history of the Mauser action you find that there was a safety feature that was added to the design sometime between 1896 and 1898.  Obviously, my gun does not have this feature.

The feature itself is nothing but couple of holes drilled in the bolt.  The purpose is - in the event of a primer pocket failure - to allow gases to vent from the firing pin cavity into the magazine rather than to be vented in the operator's face.  Sounds like a nice feature to have!

I pulled my bolt and tried to drill a hole.  TRIED is the operative word.  All that drill bit did was polish the dimple that the center punch had made.

A new drill bit is in order.  Both to replace the one I ruined and to drill through the bolt!  

I've not found any hard information (pun most definitely intended), but I'm guessing that the bolt was made of a low end tool steel.

And so, I'm thinking of pursuing a writing-focused position in engineering.

68,What path is my current job taking me down? Should I finish my degree in Mechatronics?,1592989461,"Hi engineers,

If you don't want the backstory skip the first two paragraphs.

I'm an mechatronics degree dropout, I dropped out at the end of the 2nd year (4yr degree) due to a number of reasons - not sure if the reasons are of significance but its probably best summarized as a lot of pain caused by family problems and self management. Ended up cutting them off, ditching the abusive GF, and finding out I'm a textbook case of ADD in an adult.

I failed 3/4 of the courses in the last semester, so I decided to stop. I was gutted to have given it my best shot and to fail so hard. I didn't see how I was ever going to get into the field of work I wanted to get into. I'm super passionate about engineering and building stuff. I always have some engineering related project going on. 

I did a warehousing job for about half a year and then found an opening at a small fabrication shop and managed to get the job. We've gone from it being to 4 of us to now having 9 staff in the span of 2 years.. I really like it. Its like working at a startup - high paced, fast action. Lots of chaos and processes still need to be implemented as we go and when we get some spare time operating procedures are added.

The other staff consist of one qualified  fabrication engineer, and misc other backgrounds. No engineers with any theoretical knowledge.

It's been decided that we are going to develop a product that our workshop will create with some level of automation - I'm in charge of it. To me its a big project. Can't really say what it is. We're about 4 months in and essentially it is just me working on it. I expect it to take a year to develop. I'm doing the project planning, worked with the patent lawyer to find out that we had freedom to operate, concept sketches, made a plan, just about finished the prototype CAD model and analysis. Am almost ready to have it be built by our workshop. Later comes the electronics (will probably do the PCB design - have done this before and got it signed off by an EE), then programming (reasonably confident here) .. its a lot to take on. Current management doesn't have a clue about anything engineering which makes it a bit tricky. At uni I was always crap at studying for exams, but give me a project with well defined goals and I'll work till its done.

I love what I do. Just sometimes I wish I had someone to mentor me. Everyone else is busy beavering away and I'm tucked in the corner working on this project, bouncing ideas of other stuff during lunch etc.

I'm working on getting my Solidworks Expert certification (have CSWP already), and do the workshop engineering drawings as required and other task when it gets especially busy (order stock, manage incoming/outgoing goods, invoicing - was secretary assistant for a few months). I feel like I'm gaining some experience. It feels like this job is my chance to prove myself as a nothing nobody. Its driving me to make this project a success.

I think I should continue to work where I am for some years. After that, how could I up-skill? Perhaps I should try to get hired at some company where more mentoring and guidance is available? I use engineering related discord communities a lot as a support, sanity checking of results and as a bit of a mentoring group. It's a godsend at times when I need to bounce some ideas. 

One day I would like to be a ""real"" engineer, although you might be able to argue that I already am one.. My last year at university was hell, so I am not particularly keen on going back but that may have just been due to the circumstances.

76,100 pound MMA BAG stress points.,1592965530,"I recently hung my punching bag from the beams in my garage.

I have also added multiple arrangements to the hanging system. The bag is hung from the ceiling in this order by equipment listed below 
———Beam——-
—Bag mount ——
(1) One large carabiner ( width 1.75in, length 4in)

(2) A Heavy duty Spring (Rated: 250lbs)

(3) Carabiner ( Rated: 12kn/2697lbs)

(4) Climbing strap Stitched loop nylon ( Rated 5000lbs, 60cm X 1.7cm)

(5) Large carabiner ( 3in at widest point)

(6) Swivel (1.5 in, 4in)

(7) Small chain ( .75in, 4.5in|||| total chain length is ~15in)

(8) Attached to smaller carabiner ( largest point width 1.5)

(9)Bag top metal triangle (2.5in) 

———100 pound bag———
From bottom of bag to beam is 9.75 feet.


All triangle points are reinforced by 550 cord(10) that is wrapped around the swivel (6) and held together with a square knot and two safeties. They hold ~80%of the weight. This is to soften the “metal on metal points” (8:9)and prevent ware to the non-replaceable top metal triangles(9). (If the break it’s hard to repair)

For purposes of these questions, the bag is assumed to be static at all times.

My questions are:

(1) how much weight/tension is on each given point in the chain of attachments where each accessory connects to the other end.

(2) Where are the weakest points and why

(3) how does the spring reduce the stress on my beam so it doesn’t shake and make sounds.

90,Is my power strip setup safe?,1592944054,"Hi, I'm new to this sub, so I'm sorry / will edit if it violated any rules.

I was today years old when I learned that power strips aren't as safe as I thought they are. I've always owned at least two power strips for mostly light usage (rarely heat-related appliances).

In my (shared) room, the outlets are badly distributed. The one nearest to my desk and bed is near the door, so whenever I connect the power strip there, it's cord gets tangled with the door, and I can't move my bed or desk to another place. I stopped using the door outlet and now using another outlet that's a little further but I can put the cord behind two beds headboards (my sister's and mine) so it's out of the way.

I have a long corded power strip and a shorter one. Both have four outlets each. The longer one has a broken switch (the little pulp broke, so I took it apart and bypassed the switch completely. Stupid, I know, but I'm not using it for high voltage appliances), but the shorter one is working well. I connected the longer one directly to the wall outlet, then since it doesn't make it to my desk, I plugged the other strip into it.

I only have between two to (rarely) five devices together in this setup, usually to the second power strip:
- My battery-less laptop and screen are permanent.
- A fan is sometimes plugged in (and it can be moved to the door outlet).
- Occasionally a phone charger.
- Rarely an epilator.
- My sister sometimes would use the other socket on the same wall outlet I'm using for her hair straightener.

Is this setup safe? I wasn't worried before as I am using it for a long time now, but after learning about fire hazards from multiple power strips I am worried.

For clarity, the longer outlet's pulp was busted because I used it with a washing machine and didn't switch off its heating settings. It's when I learned I shouldn't use strips for any appliances that use heat. I don't connect my laptop or screen to it anymore, I use the shorter one with the working switch for them instead, and switch it off when not in use.

Also, I searched a lot and found conflicting opinions. So I decided to ask for my specific case.

I am a mechanical engineer (B.Eng) that graduated from a Canadian University in 2015. During my university years I did a lot of Co-op terms with general contracting engineering companies. Despite my engineering degree to be in Mechanical, all of my work experience has been in Civil engineering on the biggest projects in Canada. Currently I am a construction Manager with a solid experience in civil/construction management.

I will be getting my Peng pretty soon (Submitted my application). And currently looking to move to Europe somewhere where I can get more experience in the civil field. I can only speak English and Arabic, and only have a Canadian Passport. I am also studying for my P.M.P. certification.

I am thinking of moving to work somewhere in Europe.

With that being said, What are my chances of landing a job in Europe? preferably in Swiss (As I have some family there). Do you think it is better that I go and enroll in a university for a masters degree? does that give me a higher chance of getting a job? or would I be able to get a job with just B.eng, P.eng, P.M.P., and 5+ years of experience?

1) Motor like a stepper to turn the bar from 0-90 degrees. Issues arise because it’s a small footprint lowish cost consumer product, so motors with enough torque to lift 10 pounds 14 inches away from the center axis might not fit the bill.

8,Advice: Should I go over the Project Manager's head to present a design to the team?,1592932109,"I'm about ready to reach a boiling point with my current PM, and am getting frustrated with his constant rejections of my design.

So I've been working as a design engineer for around 9 years and have been at my current job for a year. I've also had a lot of successful designs make it into production. The longer I've been here, the more often I have been placed as the main designer on the more critical projects, and have usually been assigned to the most senior project manager.

Our work is structured a little strange in a couple of ways. First, there are no officially defined roles or titles on our team (except for the manager), so people are assigned their roles based on their strengths.  The other is the experience level on the team. There are three people who have less then 12 years, including one fresh graduate, and the other six have over 20 years of experience. It trends that most of the older people are doing project management/higher level projects while the younger guys are doing the dirty work.

I've mainly been paired with the most senior engineer on our team and we are a dream team. He pretty much lets me run free on designing and brainstorming until he finds a concept that he likes, we will then share it with the whole team and get feedback. Most often the design gets the go ahead so we will then work together on getting the fitment, hardware and tolerances right. About 90% of our designs get praise, and eventually move to production. Because of this, I have become a trust worthy designer to the team and continue to get put on the funnest design projects.

Enter Jay, who has 3 years more experience then myself. Jay is an extremely disciplined, tedious, and analytical engineer but lacks design skill and creativity to pull left field designs out the box and get them to work. Which is ok as he's really great at the more tedious side of engineering, so is not often placed in the design role. He's also the first one in a design review to tell you everything that is wrong with a design, which can be helpful at times, but is not always helpful when looking at a new concept. 

Well Jay has been assigned to manage a pretty import project, and I was assigned to him as the main designer. Let me tell you, I've given this man more flushed out concepts for a mechanism then I have any project ever, and each one is like a brand new start from scratch idea... and he's refused to show off any of these fresh concepts with the team because he doesn't think ANY of them are polished enough. Every time its the same bullshit: because these designs are just concepts, he can only see the problems, which can and will be addressed after review. The one he finally did finally show off, was some simple ass design with a lot of custom machined components. Problem is that he picked by far the most expensive design that I pretty much made with out of spite. 

Our project is now in danger of getting pulled because of the cost, meanwhile I'm sitting on a treasure trove of concepts that haven't seen the light of day. Our performance is both suffering, since I'm sure the team expected more out of me. What do I do?

I'm ready to go strait to two senior engineers and just show them my concepts so they can pull rank and get this project back on track, but I know doing so but be a huge blow to Jay and possibly tarnish our relationship.

I also don't want to pigeonhole my career in one industry, especially if I'm not really enjoying it. I've decided to pursue opportunities in the Embedded Systems/Hardware design field. Although I do have internship experience in the ES/HW field and now hold a MSEE, my current job in the power industry is very different. I create schematics and program relays using logic statements, but this is not as in depth as microcontroller design or C programming. My concern is that Recruiters and HR personnel will immediately disregard my application since I do not have the full-time experience they're looking for in this specific field, which has been the case so far. 

My questions are: How did you manage to use past experience in one engineering field to land a job in another field that you had no experience? Should I expect comparable salary to what I'm making now or consider an entry level position?

14,I've applied to two engineering graduate programs (mechanical and industrial) and I'm undecided which to pursue. Can you help me decide?,1592928523,"First, my background: I'm a PE structural engineer working for DOD. I already have a master's degree in structural and another one in engineering management.

I can choose between two online graduate programs. The out-of-pocket cost is the same. Thanks to the GI Bill, I'll be *making* money as a student. Plus, it'll give me something to do outside of work (I need a new hobby.) Here are my options:


**[MS in Mechanical Engineering at New Mexico Tech.]( https://nmt.edu/distanceed/msme.php)**

**Pros:**

• The program would build on my existing skillset as a structural engineer. I want to either study solid mechanics or explosives, and I already have a decent background in those subjects.

• It would make me a better candidate for a research lab job with DOD. They mostly hire mechanical and electrical engineers. I would have new career opportunities without leaving engineering.

• NMT is well-respected name in engineering. Probably the best engineering school in the Southwest.


**Cons:**

• NMT is notoriously challenging. I'll be struggling to strike a balance with my work schedule and classes.

• Many of the high-ranking engineering jobs simply require a degree in engineering. Would another degree really help me? Especially since I already have a master's in structural.




My second option is **[MS in Industrial Engineering at New Mexico State University]( https://catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/engineering/industrial-engineering/industrial-engineering-master-cience-industrial-engineering/):**

**Pros:**

•  Easier curriculum. NMSU professors are known for being more lenient graders. That would be nice as I work full-time.

• It would qualify me for another job series: [operations research analyst](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1500/operations-research-series-1515/). Not quite the same thing as engineering.

**Cons:**

• Operations research analysts have loose educational requirements. I probably could qualify for an OR job with the credentials I have already.

• There are much fewer operations research jobs within DOD compared to engineering. If I make the switch, I'll have less flexibility in terms of career opportunities.

• As a new ORA, my prior experience as an engineer wouldn't help me. Yes, I'd have experience, but it wouldn't be relevant to the new job, which could cost me seniority.",AskEngineers,False,Roughneck16,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hehexe/ive_applied_to_two_engineering_graduate_programs/

***A bit of background***

Currently working as a reliability engineer at a startup with 1 year of experience, got approached by a recruiter for a contract role at Apple. Current role is very stressful but there's a lot to consider and I'm not sure whether the move would be worth it...

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Role - Reliability Engineer** 

**Pros**

* Located in NYC (Manhattan), lost to do, never bored, don't need a car
* Decent pay (90K)
* Decent benefits, unlimited PTO, WFH, relaxed culture
* No direct manager, lots of influence and control over how processes are defined
* Opportunity to work on a lot of different products

**Cons**

* Don't like NYC (I've only been here a year and it's COVID season to maybe I'm not giving it a fair shake but I miss hiking...)
* Crazy overtime, since it's a startup I'm expected to work long hours and have multiple nightly calls with team members in Asia which means I'm working 14 hours a day without bonus compensation
* No direct manager, no support from team members. I essentially feel alone in my role, all my learning comes from seminars, textbooks and articles. I wish I had a manager who had more experience in a similar role so I could focus my career growth
* Multiple hats, since this is a startup I'm expected to work in fields outside my comfort zone and I feel like the energy I spend on that work inhibits or reduces my career growth

**Current Role - 12 month Contract Reliability Engineer (Apple)**

**Pros**

* Good pay (150K)
* Access to top end equipment, tools and coworkers. I'm hoping being in that environment will really accelerate my career growth as I'll have experienced coworkers to learn from
* The products I'll be working on are more user-centered. Currently the products I work on are more remote and don't have as much user interaction which is a big area of reliability that I'm interested in

**Cons**

* Located in Cupertino, I lived in Cupertino while interning at Apple before. While I don't hate it, there isn't a lot to do... I am an introvert and COVID-19 may be a problem for a while coming so maybe this isn't a big problem.
* Contract role, I spoke with the hiring manager and he said the role was contract because they didn't have headcount available to hire a FTE which is encouraging but I've read a lot of contractor horror stories so I'm a bit scared
* Moving, I'd have to move from NYC to California. I only moved to NYC within the last year so it's not like I have a lot of possessions.

Power outages are getting really bad (12 hours a day) and the diesel which powers the back up generators is scarce. Currently, you can buy an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) but it good for only the lights and \*\*sometimes the standalone AC.

The project is to utilize the UPS that can supply power during these outages for the lights, internet, charging laptops, and a fan for about 12 hours. I would preferably like to buy tools/parts stateside to later build over there (they don't have home depot).

The biggest challenge and main focus is the battery. Old car batteries are cheap but are not efficient in retaining juice. Maybe using a crankshaft battery could compensate for this by releasing small doses continuously. I could possibly attach it to a bike.

They  all use different systems and processes so it's not a case of plugging  into an existing system.

Ideally they each  have access to a single tab within a sheet with 20 tabs so I can keep  it all in one place. Alternatively, we may have to have separate sheets  for each. Would consider other options too.

Personally, I'm thinking it either travels the same direction of the car, another possibility I have thought is that it impacts with the air passing on the car as it travels thus making the emissions/gases slow down or halt and just go straight up into the atmosphere.

36,How fat would a tower going all the way to space be?,1592894255,"I thought about how high could you build a tower and thought at some point while going up gravity affects weight differently and then i thought about counteracting weight to the base with some sort of constant steady propulsion system in orbit. In starship troopers there was a man-made ring around the earth, with shuttle docking systems, living quarters, etc. and in Gundam 00 there's a similar ring like structure held up in orbit by towers placed equidistant from each other at three points around the globe. I have absolute faith in humanities ability to make crazy fantasies a reality. I think the tower method would maybe be the safest method for building a massive ring around the planet as failing systems wouldn't necessarily allow it to fall from orbit. So before the ring comes the towers, my question is how fat would these towers have to be and how much usable space inside the towers would you have?

I’d like to try and replace the bronze bushings, in a small induction motor based exhaust fan, with ball bearings. Can anyone think of a reason why this might be a bad idea? 

The current bushings are the “spherical type”, which I assume compensates for minor misalignments.

43,Tips on creating small wooden springs?,1592883659,"Hi Reddit! This summer I have been challenged by my high school engineering class to create a wood-only cantilever structure which can sustain a heavy load (approx. 15 kg) while weighing as little as possible.  As I brain-stormed with one of my teammates, we thought it would be interesting to implement smaller wooden springs at the point where the load is applied in order is assist in distributing the load.  After 3D-printing a spring shaped mold and soaking a small piece of wood, I proceeded to wrap the wood around the form and let it dry.  Unfortunately, the dried wood ended up splintering quite a bit and did not maintain the intended shape.  I know similar springs have been manufactured for larger scale projects (VitalWOOD Mattress springs) and smaller spring-like potpourri exist, but I’m unsure of how they achieved this task.

For those who don't know this is essentially mechanical engineering but with some more in-depth mechanics classes instead of design/systems classes. In retrospect I would have just done mechanical.

I used to want to become an aerospace engineer because I thought the idea of space travel was amazing, but then I realized the hours most aerospace engineers work and I found some hobbies outside of school and now I realize I don't want to work 50-60+ hour work weeks. 

Unfortunately, I don't really know what type of engineering I want to do right now. My first internship was kind of an R&amp;D role where I helped develop and test sensor systems for mechanical systems such as gear boxes. I enjoyed this work and found it fairly interesting except the frequent paperwork.

This year I have an internship with the same company doing manufacturing engineering where I design and implement improvements to a cell block with a plasma cutter and a CNC Mill. I enjoy the fact that I get to do some actual design work (calculations and light CAD), but I don't want to become a CAD slave. 

How do I figure out what I want to do from here? The R&amp;D job was pretty cool at times but in the end I don't find working for a company that makes basic mechanical components very fulfilling, does this matter? The company has good benefits and pays pretty well from what I've heard.

I also recently found a master's program at my school for Engineering Data Analytics which I could see being very useful for engineering jobs in the near future but I'm not exactly sure what kind of career path that would lead me down. Is this master's even that useful or does it seem like an unnecessary addition for an mechanical engineer?

84,Negative evaporation rate and the practical impact of it?,1592843514,"For a hypothetical example, let's say we have a cold water bassin (let's say around 10°C and that it is kept at 10°C), in a room at 25°C, 50% RH. If I'm interpreting the equations for water evaporation correctly, then the evaporation rate is equal to

E= (25+19v) * A * (x_s-x) 

where v is the speed of air above the water bassin, A is the area, x_s is the humidity ratio of saturated air at the bassin's surface temperature (10°C) and x is the humidity ratio of the air at room temperature and RH. Let's suppose v is 0 and A is 1, with the above stated conditions we have x_s = 0.0076 kg/kg and x = 0.0098 kg/kg, meaning the surrounding air already has more water content than the maximum possible water content of air at the water's temperature.

The evaporation rate seems to be negative given the fact that the humidity ratio of saturated air at the water's surface temperature is lower than the room's air humidity ratio. What would this indicate? That water in the surrounding air is condensing into the bassin? I was always under the impression that water at any temperature would evaporate if the surrounding air is not at 100% RH, but these equations would seem to indicate otherwise. This also seems to run contrary to the recommendation that lowering the surrounding air temperature will help reduce the evaporation rate?

I'm trying to design a small aluminium part that can be (lightly) press fitted to a 14mm h7 shaft. According to [this chart], h7 is designed for close running fit rather than press fit. As there's no easy way to replace the shaft, I'm trying to design around the h7 shaft. That chart suggests that P7/h6 is the press fit with the most clearance, but P7 for 14mm shafts has the range -0.011mm and -0.029mm. AFAIK, h6 has the range 0 and -0.011mm, and in contrast, h7 has the range 0 and -0.018mm. To achieve press fit with a h7 shaft, does the bore need to have the tolerance -0.018mm and -0.038mm? Because this is non-standard, can it be machined with (relative) ease?

3,Can't decide between Mechatronics/Controls or Aerospace track,1592821044,"Hi guys,

I'm currently nearing my third year of mechanical engineering (gotta choose electives soon) in Germany and am quite torn between my two interests. 

I've taken controls and really liked it, and if I were to go down this path I'd do the Mechatronics Masters to patch up my lacking electronics knowledge. I know there are jobs where you only physically model your system and implement the control loop on a microcontroller i.e. a job where deep dynamics knowledge would benefit more than electronics knowledge. If I look around on job sites, however, all the mechatronics/controls jobs all involve some electronics to some extent. I'm also not talking about the PLC type jobs, but rather ones involving more control theory.

On the other hand, I've always really liked planes. Ideally, I'd be in the US where there is an abundance of GNC type jobs where my two interests align. But I'm under the impression that the European market has a much lesser demand for these skills and they aren't as accessible to the ""average"" engineer? It seems to me that in aerospace, at least in Europe, you have to be among the Top 10% of your class to even have a shot at doing something involving aerospace after you graduate. Structural/Design/Fluid work in the context of Aerospace would definitely be cool too, but controls would certainly be my first choice.

Does anyone have any tips or experience regarding the two areas? My worst fear would probably be to be forced to take a job wholly unrelated to my interests/my studies, so before I choose the electives (followed by the Masters degree) I definitely need a good dose of realism....

I didn't know of Graduate Certificates before this, so I'm guessing they don't mean a ton on their own in employers eyes. As an undergrad I enjoyed learning controls and programming a lot and can certainly see some benefit to learning more about Mechatronics as a Manufacturing Engineer later on. I don't know if I'd finish up the Masters in ME the following semester (coursework only), so I may soon be looking for a job with just the certificate, or the first half of a Master's degree (coursework only). Either way in the long run I'd be looking at an MS in ME with a Manufacturing focus, but with slightly different coursework. I guess I'm curious how an employer would view my decision, and how either route may better suit me later as a Manufacturing Engineer?",AskEngineers,False,runPMC72,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hdiiv8/with_a_bs_in_mechanical_engineering_should_i/

My wife runs a small business which requires her to measure out very specific weights of powder. 4g here, 5g there (of mineral make-up, for the record...!). 

So far her production process has been manual and time consuming. We have young kids, so time is precious. In an effort to improve output efficiency, she purchased a particulate dispensing machine. 

This is essentially a large hopper sitting on a very sensitive scale. This shakes the relevant amount of powder onto a chute which then dispenses into a container. Simple but effective. Would be great for providing coffee grounds, or dried goods. 

However, the power is so fine (eg foundation) that it starts to collecting on the chute, making the final measure inaccurate and less than requested. This then requires manual top up - pretty much negating the efficiency argument.

The most straightforward fix would be to ensure that no particulate can gather on the chute. 

Does anyone have experience with this kind of thing? Is there a surface I can spray on for example?

Consideration must be given to the fact that the product will be applied directly to the skin, so the non-stock surface must not contaminate the powder in any way.

I've basically learned and nearly mastered everything in our area - I understand the product function, product testing procedure and equipment, PLC programming, mechanical design and overall function of the lines, pneumatic circuits, electrical circuits, safety systems, sensors, etc. I've done a few small mechanical design changes over the past few years, but the last year or so I've started really delving into mechanical design to further improve cycle time on 10 lines and have whipped out a few designs. I love the flexibility I have in my job and like the technicians and operators I get to work with every day.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss has advance through the ranks - got his associates degree and was hired as a technician, got an Engineering Technology degree from the local small college and was the first and only graduate in their program, was promoted to engineer, and has been an engineering supervisor after his boss took engineering manager 12 years ago. Basically over the past 6 years my boss has had a hands off approach to everything I do. I've never really had to check in with him, performance reviews he just says I'm doing great, etc. But when it comes to things that I consider important - he won't give me an answer and it is getting worse. Early last year I whipped out a design that would turn a pair cyclical stations into a continuous flow and eliminate some maintenance requirements to the tune of about $23k each and would pay off in about 2-3 years. He never put in for funding after continuous reminders.  March of this year one of our sister plants sent us some tooling improvements that amounted to $6k and he wouldn't give me a straight answer on whether I should  wait to order it or if we even had funds available to order it. It seems like over the past year or so every time I have asked him a question he won't give me a clear answer. Over the past years I've noticed he screws off a lot at work - if he answers the phone or calls somebody 80% of the time it is not work related. He is either wheeling and dealing on Craigslist, listening to the church gossip phone tree, talking to his friends, making appointments, etc. His wife doesn't work and his kids are out of the house. I hear from him every week that he is either tied up in a meeting over a year old quality issue or he is being hammered in production line output performance meetings. He tells me every week that he has nothing more to say on the quality issue (root cause was found 9 months ago), but continues to go to the meetings. A coworker also told me the coordinator of the line output meeting could care less what my boss has to say and is okay with our performance. My boss has also always had this fear of being laid off and having to lay people off. I seriously think that he won't tell anyone no and goes to every meeting he is invited to because he fears losing his job, even when we were are doing great in the middle of a economic downturn.

&amp;#x200B;

Now his inaction are affecting my job performance. I've come to the point that I need decisions, money, etc. and he is just blowing me off. Otherwise I really don't have a lot to do. I am sitting on my butt for 40 hours a week trying to find busywork just to stay occupied. It also drives me crazy because I know there are things I could be doing that could actually make a difference if he would just give me an answer. Any ideas on how to deal with it?

&amp;#x200B;

  
tldr; boss is basically a useless middle manager and won't give me clear answers, doesn't request funding, won't tell any of his fellow managers no, and spends half of the 60hrs a week he works screwing off. I love my job but I am starting to resent my boss. Help?",AskEngineers,False,gamefreak32,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hd1r0o/how_to_deal_with_a_useless_boss/

**Setting**: WWII-era inspired epic dark fantasy. Keeping the technology level near that time period is important. 

**Magic system**: By carving a rune into a solid object, one can alter the object’s physical properties. Some examples, increasing or decreasing weight, density, or temperature; altering rigidity, color, or luminosity; and, sublimating or melting (the latter two would be one-time uses as they would render the object uncarvable). A runecarver may also set the conditions within which the affect will take place (i.e. when the rune is touched, rubbed, struck, etc.).

82,How do engineers make decisions when designing parts?,1592705902,"Hi!  I am a maker.  I design mainly in Fusion 360, but I also draw, I create my projects on a 3d printer and a cnc router.  I would like to ask how engineers make decisions when designing parts, specifically my question concerns the issue: what causes that in the design phase the engineer makes a decision to draw a given line here and not others.  I realize that my question may seem a bit naive, but I assure you that it is not.  Despite my short adventure of creating physical objects for several years, I have invested a huge amount of time in discovering the secrets of engineering, materials science, statics, software, simulations, design, drawing and the like.  I know that this is not an official or academic path, but I love what I do, I love to grow and I'm curious about the world, that's why I ask this question here to professionals.  

So ... Is a specific solution, such as the shape or number of ribs in the structure first drawn as a loose sketch to fit the design, and then simulations are carried out?  Are the materials selected in terms of physical or economic properties?  Are the fans selected to match the appearance, or is the appearance of the designed parts adapted to the properties of the fans?  How do I know that in a given place I should use three smaller screws, not two larger ones?  How does the engineer decide that from a pair of parts one will be vertical and the other will be horizontal, and not vice versa?  These types of questions are on my mind. 

 Of course, I realize that most answers depend on the design and other factors, but does that mean I have to do calculations and simulations every time?  And if these calculations affect the appearance of my part, then I need to redesign it?  And therefore, does every project that I want to be as close as possible to perfection need to take so much time?  How it really works in practice, in professional design.  On the one hand, I watch movies promoting products, where smiling actors / engineers sit at the computers or with a sketchbook and design beautiful objects with perfect properties, on the other hand I finish burying the Internet on some strange looking pages and ""read"" studies full of incomprehensible mathematics, or in other words, I fall into another rabbit hole of secret knowledge.

84,How to tell job that I have a new job soon after starting?,1592702117,"Hi, I'm just looking for some wisdom. I have been interning at this electronics company for the past 1.5 years. I graduated with a degree in Aerospace Engineering in May. The electronics company offered me a job in January that i started right after graduating. It was my only solid job offer at the time, so I took it and I've been working full time there for a little more than a month now. I don't much care for the job honestly, I don't understand what's going on (even at a basic level) most of the time since it's mostly a industrial engineering job and i did not spend the last 4 years studying that. I just got an (better) offer from a from a large aerospace company working in the exact department that I want to work in. I am going to accept that offer, but I have a little bit of a situation that I'm not sure I know how to work through yet.

So, the start date at Aerospace Company is the 27th of July. Before I even had heard back from Aerospace Company, I had requested vacation time from Current Electronics Job From July 2-13. I will be out of town for personal reasons, can't really cancel that unless I absolutely HAVE to. How do I bring this up to my current job? I figure telling them as early as possible (so early next week after I officially get all the stuff squared away with Aero Company) would be best. I have never given a formal 2 week (or in this case \~1 Month) notice since before this I've only worked in restaurants and only really needed a verbal notice. Is the best course of action having a F2F with my Manager, then sending him a formal notice after that? How do I navigate around the whole ""vacation"" part?

My GPA in undergrad was a 3.22 when I ended (though my major (engineering)GPA was 3.37). I really wasn't prepared for a master's right after undergrad, and especially not for living pretty far away from family for the first time, going from a semester to a quarter system, in a new field of engineering that I really didn't have much background for, and to top it off, had major visa issues my first quarter that could affect my future stay in the country I've been raised in. I didn't know this at the time but I'm pretty sure I also have ADHD. Anyway, I did terribly my first quarter and got put on academic probation. I did much better next quarter but could have done much better if it hadn't been for housemate issues where things got violent and ended up forcing me to live out of the lab for the second half of the quarter. I started the last quarter but a family emergency finally forced me to take an educational leave and attend to it for most of the quarter and the summer. I came back for the second year, retook the classes from the first quarter that I hadn't done well in. They had been changed so a lot of the content was still new but I did much better this time around anyway, same with the rest of the year. I still had major challenges this year as well, like being scammed, getting into a sticky housing situation, and being dragged into court proceedings, so it hasn't been easy at all but I managed to hold my own. My GPA at the end of the program is a 3.30, which seems to be around average, maybe on the slightly lower side, for the people in my year of the program. 

My research has been slow because of the setbacks from my first year and now from labs being closed due to COVID but I'm on track to finish it up even with all that. My advisor has said I can absolutely use him as a reference wherever needed and is even trying to track down people who can help me get my foot in the door.

Lower costs of attending my state school (UW-Madison) but with less Aero/Astro jobs or move to another state school that costs more up front (tuition, cost of living, etc) but has more specific job opportunity for my interests?

Intended major: Mechanical engineering 
Intended minor: Economics 
—
Long version

I’m a (HS) senior starting to apply to colleges. The way I see it, I have two major options. Either staying in state attending my state’s school (UW-Madison) for lower tuition/ eventual debt, less cost for moving, other expenses,etc OR moving out of state to another state college with higher tuition (due to being out of state) but having more eventual job prospects. For reference I’m planning on getting a degree in mechanical engineering and minoring in economics and would likely want to get a masters in mechanical engineering at some point in my life (not sure when) and would like to ultimately be working in the aerospace/astronautical industry. 

I’m just wondering (mainly from a financial aspect) is it better for me to take advantage of lower in-state tuition and lower cost from other aspects, like moving expenses, possibly in-state scholarships but having barely any aerospace/aeronautical companies compared to moving out of state and spending a little more upfront (tuition, higher moving expenses,etc) but having more job opportunity that is relevant to what I would like to work in as well as build a more “specific” job resume in the aero/Astro industry. 
What I really had in mind was the west coast state schools like WA or possibly CA (but cost of living seems kinda high). I’m also considering the mid Atlantic/northeast area too.

I’m trying to find a way minimize the debt I get into while retaining some amount of financial security by living in a area that has multiple job opportunities. Or is there another option I haven’t considered? I heard my aunt tell me to go to a college/location I would like to eventually live by because it’s easier to find a job by the college you go to rather than moving after college to where the “jobs are” then settling there. 

P.S I wanna get a mechanical engineering degree over a aero/Astro engineering degree due to having more job flexibility in hardships (I.e now, unironically)",AskEngineers,False,Redditor-Benny,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hcpzlw/in_state_college_lower_tuition_less_job/

14,Secure loads to gearbox shafts,1592668557,"Hi folks,

I have a sculpture that is designed to rotate over 3 axes at max. 30RPM and is mounted on an aluminium disc. My plan is to use 3 of [these geared steppers](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/precision-planetary-gearbox/nema-17-stepper-motor-l39mm-gear-raio-501-high-precision-planetary-gearbox-17hs15-1684s-hg50.html?sort=p.price&amp;order=DESC) and secure the sculpture to the Z-axis shaft, but it's not quite clear to me how to (economically) secure the motors and the load to provide 3-axis movement. I see that the maximum radial and axial loads are around 150N, and because the load is around 8kg, I could perhaps save myself from using additional bearings and just rely on the bearings in the gearboxes. Is it correct that if the load is accelerated and decelerated slowly (&lt;1.88m/s^(2),) the 150N force limits won't likely be exceeded?

My current plan is to mount the Y-axis motor to the shaft of the X-axis motor using a shaft flange like [this](https://ozrobotics.com/shop/8mm-key-hub-18024-high-quality-universal-aluminum-hubs-are-key-locked/)

Similar for the Z-axis motor. However, the force ratings of these flanges are usually not provided. Also there doesn't seem to be a good way to limit axial movements of the flange. I've thought about using circlips, but I'm not sure if they have sufficient strength to resist a 8kg load.

Does anyone know of a good way (or a good reference) for providing 3-axis movement to a 8kg load? Is it reasonable to expect the bearings in the gearboxes to adequately support the load, given the 150N axial and radial force ratings?

Any advice appreciated.

29,Deciding between two job offers,1592638151,"  

Hello!

New grad here. Just finishing up my Master’s in ME. I recently have received two job offers, both about equal pay (one has higher pay, but less benefits, vice versa). Both are relatively new companies and both growing tremendously. I am stuck on choosing which company (they’re both great).

I will call this Company A, I interviewed at the company and it seemed great to work at. They are in the entertainment sector (I won’t describe specifics because they only make one product currently). I met all the staff and they all seem great and overall seems like a great work environment. I’ll be one of the several engineers there. Everyone, including me, are all around the same age (mid to late 20s). It seems like I will be working on improving their product and I like what they do.

Company B is an energy group. They will open their first location in August. I will be one of the first few hires the company has considered. I spoke with the CEO and he seemed awesome to work with. The company will be almost all engineers with amazing experience. And I can continue to grow in the energy sector.

Before I tell you what I am stuck on I want you guys to know the three things I consider and I ask myself for the type of job I would like to work at and in order of priority is:

1. Work Environment. Will I like the people that I am going to see every day? 

2. Growth. Will I continue to grow as an engineer? 

3. Pay. Is the pay fair for me? 

So both companies’ pay is fair so that won’t be a part of consideration. 2, growth, it seems like if I go to Company A I can work there for a while but if their product loses popularity or just isn’t as innovative any more, I’m afraid I will be limited in the future for jobs or where I will end up as. Also, because of the limited number of engineers at this company I don’t know if I will be learning much here versus just developing product. 

Company B is an energy group so there is usually a decent amount of jobs in this sector (where I am located) and I think this company will stick around for a long time. Also, since there will be a lot more engineers and senior engineers, I think I will be learning a lot. Lastly, I will be given a pretty high title starting so that’s a plus. 

Lastly, for the work environment. I have no idea what to expect for Company B because they haven’t even opened yet. But I feel that Company A seems just fun to work at. 

**TLDR:** I guess I’m just trying to figure out overall which direction I should go as an engineer. More towards a specific product and development in the entertainment sector or towards research and development in the energy sector. Also, the entertainment company seems great to work at, the energy company I have no idea, but it seems the CEO is nice.

I would appreciate any feedback!

I'll try to make a story short. I live in an area where defense and space is booming. I currently am going to school and I'm at that fork in the road where I need to start choosing some things.

My plan is to take Aero (because why not) as an undergrad and do a MS in Computer Eng. I've scoured the faces of reddit and quora, and have only seen a BSAE to a masters in CS.

I want to be able to get a great/good understanding on how things interact with each other (I would have loved a mechatronics degree, but my school doesnt offer one). I've an interest in seeing both programming and hardware and having it interact with the world. 

Eventually I see myself starting my own company due to the experience I've had in my previous careers.

How viable is this path? I'm not asking for what undergrad to pick. I'm curious if I'll ever get to that point where I would utilize that knowledge. 

TLDR: I want a broad knowledge of engineering (ME or AE - because why not) and then want to specialize in Comp Eng. Mechatronics is not an option for me, the school doesn't offer it. I just want knowledge and I feel like this is the best route to it.

47,Career Advice (BSME 2021),1592604128,"Hello reddit, I'm a junior in mechanical engineering, and I am coming up on several decisions that will probably affect my career path in the foreseeable future. I want to ask some specific questions, which will unfortunately be formatted in an inevitable rambling way. I'll apologize up front for that.

Currently, I intern with a petroleum company, which pays very well and has really good benefits. However, after two terms as an intern I have come to learn that the work here is not very technical. For now, that's not a problem since I am inexperienced and it will be a while before I can become more of an asset in that respect anyway. 

However, down the road when I want to move forward with my career, the most common path here is to become a supervisor and eventually a manager. Some people go on to get their MBA and move into business. After working for some time, I've found that I am not very fond of the business side of things to be completely honest. It's fine I guess, and I know that I will have to deal with it to some extent regardless, but it calls into question the future of my role in this current organization where management is the only upper level position that I have seen. For my first question, is this common in engineering, or is the petroleum industry specifically is more business-leaning and less technical?

Secondly, I have done research for two years and have maintained a good GPA so far, so graduate school is not out of the question. I've looked on Reddit in a few other places, and most engineers seem to recommend entering industry first rather than going straight into grad school after college, unless you plan on getting a job at a university. From what I have gotten from the full-time employees here, this company will mostly only give funding for MBA's, not so much for technical degrees. For any engineers with a technical masters degree (eg: Masters in Mechanical Eng., Masters in Material Eng., etc...), how did you get your degree? Did you do it right after college, or was it through a company? Has it been useful in your career? Also, is the nature of your work more on the technical side (by that, I mean what one traditionally thinks of when you say engineering: solving problems using mechanical/electrical/etc... design, less so project management and contract deals)?

TLDR:

Question 1)

I intern for a petroleum company. I am happy with the job and its benefits, but it seems that the work is far more business-oriented and less technical than I anticipated. Is this more specific to the petroleum industry, or is this common in most engineering fields?

Question 2)

I am looking at the possibility of getting my masters. The company I intern for now usually only provides funds towards an MBA. I am not a huge fan of the business aspects of the industry (even though I know to some extent they are inevitable in engineering), so I would want to go a more technical route. Every person that I have spoken to has suggested that I should not get a masters degree right out of college unless I want to work at a university. For engineers that have gotten a more technical masters degree (eg: Masters in Mechanical Eng., Masters in Material Eng., etc...):

\- Did you do it through an employer, or right after college?

\- Was it worth it in the long-run?

\- It the nature of your work with the degree similar to what you have learned? Has it been useful?",AskEngineers,False,H_Watson21,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hc9tqy/career_advice_bsme_2021/

Never the less, I don’t think I can ask anywhere else, because my google “research” yielded me basically nothing. 

First I want to tell a bit about my situation. I currently live in Europe, in Moscow, to be exact. I have just finished my first year of university in the field of power engineering with a speciality in hydraulics and liquid dynamics (engineering programs in here are a bit wonky, so it might sound weird). Within the first year, I have studied mostly core subjects, so I barely know anything about my field. But the basic knowledge I got (manufacturing processes, CAD skills) fueled my passion for engineering. 

So my question is, with the tiny amount of useful skills I have, can I apply them anywhere? Are there any international problem-solving competitions or something like that? Maybe websites where I can practice my creativity and skills? Should I develop my own project without looking for a competition? Where do I get ideas for that? 

I do not live in the US, and my university’s extra-curricular engineering teams (my english isn’t perfect uhh) aren’t accepting anybody within their ranks due to the pandemic and probably lack of projects. Plus I am not nearly good enough to be a part of them. 

Of course, I can simply develop my skills by myself. Read books about the subjects within my field, get better with CAD, C++, Excel, etc. And I am planning on doing that too. But now that my first year has ended I feel a bit dissatisfied. I know that in order to be able to understand the interesting stuff I need to get through this mass of boring and abstract subjects.

We are a small company. I am 'the' mechanical design engineer with a background in aerospace. We have a controls engineer, systems, electrical etc.

No thought in the 2 years since the start of the project has gone into the dynamic stability of the platform (I only joined this year, and immediately identified the issue).

83,"What is the Difference between DOL Starters, Variable Speed Drives and soft starter",1592564746,"A few years back, some developments were made that promised to usher in a new era of manufacturing. First is Industry 4.0 that revolves around the next generation smart connected factory. The second thing is the Internet Of Things (IoT), which is a considerable shift towards a better, smarter, and connected ‘things.’ With technology booming, every object is now connected to it and has access to information.

Manufacturing is a growing industry with machines and assembly lines, which is fueled with a high degree of automation. Supervisory Control &amp; Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS) are universal industry standards. So now, the question arises how exactly is IoT relevant to manufacturing, and how does it play a role in your industry 4.0 initiative?

To begin with, IoT goes well with SCADA and DCS. The information you generate with the help of SCADA acts as one of the data sources for IoT. Their primary focus is on monitoring, controlling, and analyzing machine data to improve your productivity and top line. 

### SCADA SYSTEM AND WHAT IT CONSISTS OF -

* **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs):** They are basically hardware components that interface with machines and control them. Their job is to interact with sensors that are present in the machine. All the parameters that require monitoring come with it. **PLCs** and RTUs are your interfaces to the world of machines.
* **Data Acquisition Systems:** This is what you call a centralized system that gathers all the data from PLCs and RTUs. The connectivity can either be wired or wireless. And, OPC (OLE for Process Control**)** is a recommended way to get connected to your hardware.
* **Supervisory Systems:** It is a system that allows you to monitor machines. They also perform real-time condition monitoring, raise alarms when thresholds are breached, ensuring that your machine is working properly.

### The Internet of Things:

To make it easier for you, the Internet of Things is an amalgamation of advances in connectivity hardware, cloud computing, data networks, and big data processing. IoT starts where SCADA, DCS, **HMI**, and Historians end.

When talking about a typical factory, it is an extremely heterogeneous environment which has grown organically over a period of time and, in some cases, even decades. Some of the challenges they have seen are-

* Machines that are equipped with different kinds of PLCs and RTUs, they support different protocols.
* All the multiple **SCADA systems** that come from different vendors, each of them have a specific line or a set of lines. Machine data is put there, but so are data islands. Moreover, SCADA systems are only capable of saving a limited amount of data, so it is safe to say that historical data is not preserved for more in-depth analytics.
* Moreover, the legacy machines that are not connected, they end up lacking in providing the right kind of instrumentation.
* Assets such as energy meters that are left behind and have never been connected due to cost overheads. Yet the information that they provide is vital.
* In the end, existing data Historians can be a data source.

Here’s hoping that this article provided you with a perspective on how IoT is relevant to your business and is your ladder to Industry 4.0. You can get started by connecting a couple of your assembly lines to a modern IoT platform and then see what impact does machine data analytics has on your business.",AskEngineers,False,madzmaxz,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hbyqyr/what_is_the_difference_between_dol_starters/

85,"Career advice: graduate job, masters degree, combo?",1592564474,"tldr at bottom

I'm currently a senior in Australia (US citizen) and going to graduate by the end of the year from a dual degree program with degrees in EE and CS. For a while now I've been trying to figure out what my best options will be after graduation, and I'm still as indecisive as ever. 

My long term goals (5-10 year) include working for a robotics/autonomous vehicles or space-related engineering company (eg Amazon Prime Air, Cruise, Blue Origin/SpaceX and similar) in the US. I've heard these companies highly prefer graduate level education (PhD/masters) and related work experience when it comes to hiring, and there's not a lot of places to get related experience in AUS.

In terms of my work experience, I'm starting a new part-time job soon doing software engineering (robotics related) and it's meant to transition to a full-time offer once I graduate. I've also got an interview with a place I interned at soon for an electrical design position that's more in line with what I would like to do (hardware focused). Both of these jobs would pay reasonably well and I'm sure would be good experience (not just a cog in the machine of some giant megacorp) but I am not sure if that's better than a masters. Additionally, I could work part-time with the software engineering job while pursing a masters, which may be the best course of action.

In general, I am not sure if it would be better to go straight to full-time work after graduation, to try to get a masters degree (research for ~2 years, coursework for 1), or attempt to split the difference and work part-time while studying a masters (which would likely take longer). The software/cs subreddits seem to think work experience is king, but I am unsure what the engineering perspective on this would be.

TLDR: is work experience or a higher degree (masters) best long-term to get a job in the US for a cool robotics-ish company",AskEngineers,False,great_cs_throwaway,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hbyouy/career_advice_graduate_job_masters_degree_combo/

Anyways, I started working  in March as a field service engineer for a company that makes products to treat water. Because of covid I was put in testing since we weren't doing as much traveling. Now I do enjoy testing and the troubleshooting that comes with the field part I can't help to think that this isn't what I want to do. The company and especially my manager are great and treat me extremely well  and because of this it would seem like a bad idea to look for another job.

94,Is a P.E. worth it if I am not planning on staying in MEP Field? Asking as a Electrical Engineer,1592544705,"
I am looking for career advice on what type of jobs I should be applying to. 
I recently graduated with my Master's in E.E. with a focus on Intelligent Systems, but I am currently working as a E.I.T. (Engineer in Training) in New York City. 
The reason why I am in this field was to obtain a P.E. license so I can potentially open up a practice in the future. I feel in love with the idea when I was an undergraduate taking power system and controls classes.   However, For nearly two years I have worked under a P.E.(Professional Engineer), and with my Master's I can be eligible to take the P.E. exam next year.  I am thinking of shifting my career in a technical role because the MEP field is extremely boring and repetitive  The current scope of my job entails designing campus upgrades/renovations following proper guidelines for campus projects(mostly hospitals) . The work in itself has its perks(social, salary is the only 68K) but the lack of technical challenges is making the job really boring. I don't enjoy doing basic load calculations and drafting for most of the day on AutoCAD or Revit. I assumed the job prospects of getting a P.E. would be more interesting projects and solving bigger projects than circuiting receptacles and lighting fixtures. 

Going back to school really convinced me I should focus my efforts on RF Engineering or something in line with power systems (utilities or defense), because of future growth, technical challenges, and the salary are much better. I am looking to take the next year to refresh my memory on basic engineering theory so I can have a stronger background. However, before I do that I want to know what you guys think in terms of my current situation? Should I waste the next year going for a P.E. or just start the transition into the type of job role I want. 

What other types of future growth prospects are there for P.E. Licenses, which offers technical backgrounds? Are you able to work for major companies, if so which ones?",AskEngineers,False,-Dusty_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hbuwj3/is_a_pe_worth_it_if_i_am_not_planning_on_staying/

1,Asking for advice on potentially changing my internship project at a large company,1592535008,"Hello everyone, this is this first time posting on this subreddit and I'm a little anxious to see what kinds of responses I may get. I'm hoping to get some advice about what I should do in my current situation. 

I just started as an ME R&amp;D intern at a huge company that develops personal computers and printers. My project for the next 12 weeks is to design what is essentially a lap-desk. In the process of doing so, I'm going to be practicing a lot of the ""design thinking"" methodologies, gaining lots of CAD experience, and learning the entire manufacturing process of my design.

While these are all really good learning opportunities that will undoubtedly improve my skills as an engineer, for some reason, I just don't feel like it is very engaging or interesting. I completely acknowledge that I am an intern and we don't always get to work on huge projects, but many of my fellow interns at this company are working on things like ""printer head research"" or ""computer hardware enclosures"" or secret projects, but I'm just here designing some furniture.

 I talked to a few of my friends and peers from school, and they believe that my project is good for a few reasons: 1, since I'm in R&amp;D, it's hard to assign an intern to work on something brand new in a truly meaningful way (especially with remote work) and 2, it doesn't matter what my project is, but rather what I learn and what skills I gain from the project. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is if this project is really worth my time and whether or not I should request a new project?

4,Need help choosing a ranging sensor for a Halloween project,1592529284,"yes, I'm getting an early start on this, but I have some extra time nowadays...

I want to build [this project](https://learn.adafruit.com/synchronized-eyes-with-two-hallowings?view=all) for Halloween--a set of synchronized eyes for a ghost/cat/pumpkin. Normally, they move at random, but I would like to mount a sensor in front of them and update the code so that, when an object is detected, the eyes focus on the object, and follow it while it's within the sensor's range.

The sensor would need enough accuracy and range to be able to focus the eyes within the field of view. I imagine the sensor would need about a 120-degree wide by about 45-degree vertical sensitivity, and perhaps 0.5m out to about 6m. It would be nice to be able to mount the sensor outside (or have it work through a window) so that it can follow the kids who come trick-or-treating. (cackle cackle)

From some browsing around, there are a lot of potential choices, such as ultrasonic, miniLidar, or even a Kinect, but I'm not sure which would work the best for this purpose. $45-50 (USD) seems to be the cost of a unit to meet my reqs, but I also have time to order from aliexpress if I can get a higher tech unit for a more reasonable price.

6,Is a Masters in Environmental Engineering a good idea?,1592522115,"Hi All,

I have a B.S. in Biology and three years of experience working in water resources regulation for a state government. I'm considering pursuing a MS in Environmental Engineering. I'm wondering if this is a worth while investment?

I would like to stay in the field of drinking water/waste water. Currently I regulate, but my ideal career would be more of project managment/meeting regulation for a utility such as a waste treatment plant or municipality. 

My motivations: 

1. My current agency has more positions for Engineers, and the salary is much higher. Even if I never take the PE my salary would be higher.
2. I believe it would open up doors to work elsewhere. I currently feel pretty stuck and I'm not sure what skills I'm learning in my current role that will advance me in my current organization or allow me to pivot somewhere else in the future. 

Concerns:

1. I'm worried that it is an ""easy"" path. The program I'm looking that is most affordable and online. The undergraduate program is ABET accredited and it's part of the State university system. It does not require as many rereqs as other programs. I'm concerned that without  BS in Civil engineering I still won't be eligable for many jobs. 
2. I have no background in CAD or design. The Masters wouldn't teach me this.

Another post in AskEngineers got this more to the forefront of my mind enough to post this question.

I currently have 10 years of experience as an HVAC/Plumbing Engineer, licensed in 3 states.

First five years of my career I hated this industry, worked for a tiny firm doing garbage work, had moved across the country to take this job at a firm of 10 people.  I had no friends because everyone in the firm was much older than me, and the work wasn't even remotely rewarding.  It was ""hey, I'm the contractor and just installed this RTU, can you get me a permit after the fact?"" type work because we were the cheapo shitty engineer in town.  Whatever, they ran out of work, laid me off, and I moved to my current firm.

Love my current firm, it's a much larger A/E firm, we do a lot of great work.  I have great coworkers, have made a ton of great friends.  The work is much better, much more rewarding.  I've climbed the ladder relatively well and could have a great career here.  Salary has been pretty good, much higher than at my previous firm.  Things have been pretty good the last 5 years, and continue to be.

Here comes the inevitable however. 

However, I grew up in a manufacturing family, always thought I'd end up in Aerospace.  My grades were crap, I took my first job because it was the only one I could land.  I've since learned quite a lot about thermodynamics, HVAC, Plumbing, etc.

Space has always been in the back of my mind, and I would LOVE to contribute to that industry in some way/shape/form.

I'm more interested in the design side, I'm not super hip to working on the facilities team for these companies essentially doing exactly what I'm doing now.  I'm talking about getting in to, I don't know, designing pipes or the HVAC of vehicles, launch equipment, etc.  (Just throwing out ideas as examples, am mostly open to things, depending.)

Although I understand it may not be easy, are my skills transferable to say, SpaceX/etc, or any one of their subs?  Is it even possible to move semi-laterally?  Or, am I doomed to start over at entry-level with the disadvantage of being 10 years out of school?

Any advice on the best way to go about this, recruiters, etc.?

My wife is probably not going to be up to relocation, but that's something I'll just have to work on, so it's not entirely out of the picture.

32,I’ve done almost nothing. Please tell me the it gets better,1592496208,"Hello everyone. I graduated with a bs in mechanics engineering in May. I got a job with one of the top 5 dod contractors. The job is in manufacturing and processes. It’s not what I have a passion for, I want to be in the design space but I figured the best design engineers understand how their parts are manufactured. I also felt grateful to even have a position lined up given the current state of affairs let alone one that pays so well. 

With all of that being said I am now finishing my third week and I have done almost nothing. I have been assigned to one project at this point. That project is in the design phase, we have a pdr towards the end of the month. We had to put together some slides for the manufacturing side of things just to give the customer the understanding that we knew how we were going to build this thing and what the steps might look like. Now I was given the project from an engineer that actually just transferred but a decent amount of leg work was already done. That being said the days leading up to the draft slides being due I felt like I had a decent amount going on but nothing crazy. Before and after that however I have done nothing. The team meets once a week for half and hour. Otherwise I have been sitting in my office reading old technical documents and what not and every so often I get out and walk the shop floor. 

I am assuming that because I am so new that I am being baby stepped into this and due to the project I was given being in the preliminary design phase there’s just not a lot for me to do. Please tell me that this career can get better, I can’t imagine doing this for very much longer. 

Any other general tips for a newcomer is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I would also like to add that it almost seems as if the interns that started around the time that I did are doing more stuff being shown more. Neither of them are on a project they’re more so doing general stuff around.

What I’ve seen in my research so far are linear servos that have a programmable controller, and seem to function like a “standard” servo motor. I have also seen linear actuators with built in limit switches, with and without potentiometers. My understanding is that a linear actuator without a potentiometer will travel from the beginning to the end of it’s stroke, but not have the capability to stop and start at specific positions within that range if motion.

We did not design this, I have no drawings, and it is a massive undertaking to fully disassemble everything to measure.

So what's displayed on the web-app is the current position of each of the 8-servo motors as images that are rotated based on the servo motor position, in real-time.

Currently, I have the pi running a python script which reads the analog values of each servo motor and have it sent to a Flask back-end web-app (hosted on the pi as well). But I'm a little confused on how I should go about generating a front-end for this, specifically how I can get the front-end to constantly render with the new incoming values from the backend.

So sorry if it doesn't make much sense (more than happy to clarify further)! Would love to get some ideas from people! :))

TLDR: Working on a mini-project involving a simple robot crane/arm and I'm trying to have a web-app render the real-time position of each arm based solely on the analog values of each motor!

They also mentioned there is enough water on our planet to cover the entire planet completely if the land were flat.

This got me thinking about our modern technology and how much of it does not work in an aqueous environment. In fact, we do a lot (like coating steel or jacketing electronics) just to prevent moisture in the air from damaging our precious tools.

So I got thinking, how would our tools change if we were ""aquatic creatures"" and lived our lives completely submerged in water?

  
There would be no fire beneath the surface, of the water, so forging tools out of metal would be difficult. Iron would rust pretty quickly. Electronics as we know them would probably not exist.

* 23 Years old, have a degree in Business

* I didn't take Physics, Calculus or any other hard sciences in high school. I was always afraid of STEM because everyone always told me how hard it was. 

* Also,  I did a lot of drugs, bad ones. Started in high school and I was using on/off for a while. I'm 1 year clean now and something that's been helping me stay clean is learning math again. I go through textbooks on my own. I had to do a lot of review and I'm currently teaching myself linear algebra. Turns out I do like math, I just never had the discipline as a kid to put in the time.

* I've always loved working on mechanical things. Cars, motorcycles, when I was heavily involved in my schools FIRST robotics team in high school and just loved it, ended up being the mechanical team lead, I would be there till 9-10PM and would have to be told to go home.

They are caused by vehicles passing over them and the suspension motion interacting with the granular surface and over time pushing the surface into waves that become real truck breakers for mile after mile.

What I feel is needed is something attached to each truck/trailer that acts out of step with the suspension driven, wave-forming motion to gradually flatten out the waves, essentially by doing what the wheels are doing but in the wrong place and more so. Ideally it would be something mechanical, driven solely by the motion of the truck but active hydraulics could be used if needed - the advantages in terms of road and truck maintenance costs and also increased travel speed and safety should cover it.

96,Major crossroad in career path coming up - hoping for some insight or tools to help decision making,1592417025,"First off, I realise this may come across as humble bragging as I'm in a fortunate position compared to some on here, so apologies if it does. However, that doesn't change the fact that a decision I make in the next few weeks will probably change my career for the rest of my life. 

Before Covid, I was working in a gig economy industry, self employed and on very good money, but long hours, long commutes and working with some fairly undesirable people (the part of the industry I work in has a rep for it).  Contracts rarely lasted more than 6 months, but the industry was booming, so it wasn't too difficult to line up the next one. I had also had an offer on a house and mortgage accepted, which has now understandably stalled.

Covid came along and everyone was let go, but with an understanding that when procedures are in place to start up again, everyone will be re-employed.  I get updates every few weeks from them, so I am confident I would be able to return.

In the mean time I managed to secure a Project Engineer role with an offshore engineering company, working from home.  Started off doing mostly project managing and scheduling but I am now carrying out more technical jobs - calculations, design, analysis and the such like.  I just had an informal review the other day and when they move back into the office they want to give me a full time staff role.  Initially this would mean a 30-40% pay cut but with room to move up with more experience, healthcare, pension, paid leave etc. and on top of this they've even offered to to pay to put me on a part time masters! 

If I take the job, the house purchase will either fall through or we'll buy it but won't be able to afford the mortgage (we're looking for our ""forever home"" and this would be our 4th attempt at getting a place!)  If I don't take the job I am in the hands of the gods as no-one knows whether the other industry will return to it's former self.  

On paper, it seems like a no-brainer, as the new job is an incredible opportunity, but I've already jumped industries once in my career so I know how tough it can be.  My previous job is exciting and very well paid; but people can and do burn out, leaving me to think if I will regret taking the opportunity in 5-10 years.

(FYI I am in the UK)

So, I'm wondering if there are any insights or experiences older and wiser people would like to share that could help with my decision? Or perhaps some useful tools that could help evaluate the pros and cons I may not have considered?

98,Environmental Engineer with a Mining Engineering Degree - Canada,1592416236,"Hello guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I am gonna start off with a brief intro about myself. I graduated with a Bachelor of Mining Engineering degree back in 2018. I was not able to find any mining related jobs after I graduated since I do not have any mining experience and there was not much mining jobs at that moment. I ended up working as an Environmental Technician in a small local environmental consulting firm (not engineering consulting, just environmental services).  After talking to my manager, I was able to change my job title to EIT and have been working under an environmental engineer (the only engineer in our company), therefore, I have 2 years of environmental EIT experience now.  The works that I do is mostly technician work and sometimes I involve with projects that is kinda more engineering-related (such as Phase ESA but pretty much it).

I have 2 years of environmental experience now, and I am planning to move to Ontario or other provinces that pays better (since I am so underpaid as an EIT). My question is that if I continue to pursue the environmental engineering career, would my education background (mining engineering degree) has any negative impact/problem in the future? I talked to a lot of people and my friends, and most of them agree that you gonna learn everything again on the job anyway. So I assume having a mining engineering degree but not environmental, should not constrain me to become an Environmental Engineer? Or you guys would recommend me looking for a mining engineering jobs instead, if so, would my environmental experience gonna help when I apply for mining jobs? I mean I am gonna apply mining and environmental once this covid is over...but just wanna hear some other opinions.

Sorry for the long post, just the fact that being underpaid and confusion with my career plus this pandemic, really stressed me out...

What are your opinions? Di you regret it? Would you recommend it to your children?

What are some exciting projects you have worked on!?
