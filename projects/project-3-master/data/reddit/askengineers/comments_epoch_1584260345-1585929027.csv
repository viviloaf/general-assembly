5,"I have absolutely no employment, I’m kinda freaking out, constantly being rejected on my applications. Spiraling into depression and need your guys help.",1585925341,"I graduated in December 2019 with my degree, and I have filled out hundreds upon hundreds of applications. In that span, I’ve had several dozen responses from companies that weren’t automatically “no”. They’d call me, and we’d have a number of conversations. Sometimes I’d get in person interviews if they were local. Regardless, it always lead me down the same path: rejection.

I have fine tuned my resume after speaking to numerous recruiters and resume experts. I have had mock interviews. I don’t think I’ve bombed a single interview, i answer questions calmly, concisely, and honestly, and I try to remain quick on my feet. The furthest I ever got was a third interview with a company, after they flew me across the country to interview with them. They gave me a tour. Multiple people spoke with me. And then we had lunch. And I was rejected.

At some point my parents implied I was being kicked out. This was before the pandemic. I got a couple retail jobs that weren’t hiring full time, and I also started driving for Uber. I still tried to stay on top of applying for engineering positions. I just really needed income right now. I moved in with my buddy for really cheap (thank god).

Since the pandemic, both of my retail jobs being non-essential caused me to be laid off. Uber is all I have, and it’s slowed down tremendously to the point where it’s almost not even worth it to waste the gas and waste the time getting in my car.

I have had suicidal thoughts about all this. I’m not going to go into detail about those because this is an engineering sub, not a psych help sub. I’m mainly feeling as though 4 years of college was a compete fucking waste. I took these hard courses and lost sleep to study for exams and it all ended up for nothing. My GPA is even a 3.5 for crying out loud, I assumed that was really good. I dunno anymore.

Hi all,

I apologize if this is not in the right subreddit, if not please point me in the right direction. I own a small manufacturing company ( light manufacturing/ optical sorting/ distribution/ engineering). We deal mostly in the automotive industry, but are right now helping a few customers with urgent respirator components.

Of course business is down due to all the shut downs, but we are still an essential company and have to be up and running. We are a family company and we are doing everything possible to avoid layoffs etc ( myself and management have taken pay cuts to keep all of our employees whole and at full pay).

With this extra time we are going to have on our hands, a few of us were thinking of starting to make surgical masks ( non N95 100% cotton with a insert for the user to put in a filter of choice). We would donate a major portion to hospitals , fire, police etc., but look to sell to the public and other companies that are requiring their employees to be at work.

Does anyone have any suggestions on who to contact or where to even start as far as getting into the marketplace? We are located just north of Chicago.

A person that can take an ambiguous goal, determine the best practice, then build systems, processes, and training materials so that a regular person can actually do the work.",1585859911,"At our 25 person, direct to consumer E-Commerce company, we are trying to grow rapidly. The only way to scale, at least as far as I can tell, is to build good systems so that each area of the business can operate efficiently, effectively, and handle the growth without it being utter chaos.

I really hate it when people are just constantly putting out fires, and we've worked really hard so that that doesn't happen, but it's getting harder as we get bigger.

The problem is in building the systems. It's been very, very hard for me to find someone that thinks systematically and can handle most of the phases of a totally unsolved problem. At the moment, I am the only person who has been successful, despite testing half a dozen people.

**Here is what the job hypothetically entails:**

1. I give this person a big unsolved problem in the business. For example, inventory management. We want to never stock out, but we also want to store as little cash as possible in inventory. Plus, inventory can be raw material or finished goods, and the raw material can be used in many different products.
2. They need to basically become an expert on inventory, in our context, and determine the best theoretical practices for how to think about and approach that problem.
4. They have to get relevant stakeholders onboard with the solution.
3. Then they have to put together some type of IT system to actually manage the workflow (or at least design/architect how it should work for a developer to actually put together).
5. Then they have to create training materials and poke yoke it so that a non-expert can be effective working inside it.
6. And finally roll it out and manage the deployment so it's successful.
6. And then rinse and repeat on a new problem.

I was thinking systems engineer, but I don't know if that quite covers it, since that seems to be more IT/network oriented (I don't know for sure though). Business process engineer?

**They hypothetically have to:**

1. Be able to identify the best practice (or very close to it)
2. Architect a solution
3. Develop the solution
4. Make it dead easy for other workers
5. Deploy it
6. And do this across many different domains (maybe it's inventory, then it's PPC, then it's something in marketing, and so on)

I basically want to try to hire a person who can do this for me, as right now, I'm the only one that can really do it in the company. We have excellent people inside the individual roles, but they are generally working within systems that I established vs establishing their own systems.

Maybe I'm trying to find a unicorn. I just don't know. I have no experience outside of my own companies, so I just don't know what's out there, or what's reasonable to expect. We don't have the budget to hire a whole team of engineers (such as if each person was really good at one step in the process), but maybe that's the only way? I don't know. 

I want to find this person, but I don't even know how to advertise or search for it.

67,"Quit my medical device sales job right before the pandemic, how do I find a med device sales job in Canada? I’m really struggling.",1585837771,"Hi guys,

So just to give you some background, I (25/M), have a 3 year diploma in Electronics and Communication Engineering and a 4 year bachelors degree in Biomedical Engineering. 

I reside in India and graduated in 2016. Right out of college I landed a job at my dream company and I’m sure this is a dream company for a lot of med device sales people, Medtronic! I worked as a sales executive for a particular business and worked my way up to become a Territory Manager for 6 states in Western India and Maldives. I got trained in one of their devices and have supported more than 100 implants in the OT for the same. 

Now, here lies the problem. I have always had a dream to relocate abroad and started my Permanent Residency application for Canada through the Express Entry skilled labourer program. It took a lot of hard work and effort and I received my PR after a year and a half in February. 

Back then the COVID-19 pandemic was not that severe and my manger and top management were always kept in the loop about my decision to relocate so I resigned and served my notice. Now, I am without a job and will be flying to Canada in mid April. I have applied for every single medical device sales opening I have come across in the last 3-4 months in Canada and have not gotten a single positive response. 

Yes, the most obvious way to do this is try for Medtronic in Canada and while I am in touch with the HR there, nothing seems to be working out. I am well aware that I may not get a Territory Manager role directly and might have to start again as a sales rep and I am okay with that. I am really passionate about sales and consider my interpersonal skills to be my strongest asset. 

I am also aware that I might have to take up a minimum wage job probably at Walmart or Tim Horton’s. What I want advice/guidance on is how do I contact recruiters? I have connected with more than 250 medical device professionals and recruiters based in Canada on Linkedin and while most of them responded, it was still a dead end. Literally zero prospects!

I am sure I am doing something wrong here, right? I am 25 and already have almost 4 years of work experience in the medical device industry and I am qualified. What should I do?
I am jobless and scared right now. I don’t want to leave the medical device industry. I really really love my job. I know the work life balance is crazy and there are no ‘working hours’ but being on the field and meeting customers for sales calls, sometimes for case support while also dealing with literally everything from pricing negotiations to inventory is what makes this so much fun for me and at the end of the day, it’s getting a chance to make a difference in someone’s life, no matter how minute the difference. Moving into any other sales job would be an option but I know that my passion is in this industry. 

Can you guys please guide me on what I should be doing? I just need to get in front of a recruiter and I know I’ll do it justice! 

Thank you for reading!

So some of my initial thoughts:-

\-Encourage shoppers to buy more per visit and visit less

\-Live publish footfall on the internet so shoppers can see when it is busy or not

\-Have all shelf stacking done when the store is closed to shoppers

\- Avoid crowding in certain areas (meat, bread, milk) of the store by increasing the size of these areas or setting up a corden in store

\- Do not allow entry without some form of mask

\- Reduce variety of products to speed up shoppers decision making and time to find stuff

\- Drastically expand click and collect as the most efficient and minimal contact way of selling

\- Remove contactless limits

\- One way traffic in aisles

At the more extreme end:

\- No key workers (such as NHS) allowed in store - special delivery arranged for key workers. Stops turning the supermarket into an extension of the hospital

\- Switch to the Amazon store model where there are no tills and everything is done using face recognition(I have no idea how this works)

\- When the time comes, only immune(antibody +ve) people can work in supermarkets

\- Track every persons use of supermarket (limit to 1 per week) only allow them to go to local supermarket - quarantine the whole area if anyone in that supermarket catchment tests positive",AskEngineers,False,JimJammer8888,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ftms6d/covid19_making_supermarkets_safer/

If you're looking for engineers to interview for a school assignment or for your job hunt, this is the right place! The AskEngineers community has compiled a list of hundreds of practicing engineers across different countries, industries, and specializations to help answer your questions about what they do in their job, how they got there, and offer career advice to those that need it.

**Note:** Please be courteous when requesting an interview. Everyone on the list is doing it on a volunteer basis only, and they are not obligated to respond or help you. Our users reserve the right to deny any requests for interviews and/or personal information. Harassment will not be tolerated and will be reported to the authorities.

###How to use this list

1. `Ctrl + F` the engineering discipline, country (e.g. US, UK, Germany, etc.), or other criteria you're looking for looking for. If you need to be able to verify someone's identity, search for `Available for e-mail?: yes`

1. Parse through each search result and message up to 3 users that you think will be able to answer your questions. **DO NOT shotgun PMs to every user!** If you don't intend to interview everyone, don't waste their time by sending messages that you won't respond to later.

1. If the first few users don't respond within 24 hours, try messaging another user.

---

###Interested in conducting interviews?

By signing up, you're volunteering to let high school students, prospective engineers, and new graduates PM or e-mail you with interview questions. Typically with students it will be for a class assignment (i.e. Intro to Engineering), so questions will be about about work, how you got into engineering, ""do you have any advice for..."", etc. Think of yourself as a STEM Ambassador.

You will receive anywhere from 1-4 requests per month on average, with some surges in January, July, August, and December due to new and graduating students. While these lists usually have over 100 sign-ups and is set to contest mode, which prevents the same users from getting bombarded with requests, engineers in an in-demand discipline may get more requests than average.

####Requirements

1. **At minimum, you should have:**

0,Should I drop out of med school for CS or engineering in 3rd year?,1585789058,"I need your help to decide what I should do. I am about to make a big decision.

I  am not from the US, so in my country, medical education is different.  It is 6 years after high school and I am about to finish 3rd year. I  have a lot of reasons to leave medicine, I literally hate it. I always  loved math and physics but I have made a mistake and chose medicine. Now  I want to switch to CS or engineering but I have some concerns about  it.

Firstly, engineering and CS  degrees in my country take 5 years (1 year english preparation in it). I  am 21 years old so I will be 26 years old when I receive it. Isn't it  too late? I would have been 22 years old when I finished it if I have  made correct decision at first. Also I would like to get phd in CS or  engineering/physics related fields to do research, so I will be even  older when I complete my education. It is too long and I have already  lost 3 years in med school. Also I'm afraid of being unemployed. If I  switch, I can get into one of the best universities of my country and I  can complete it with high GPA but nevertheless I will be 26 years old  and I think they don't want to hire 26 yo new graduate.

Also, my parents want me to be a doctor. They won't like this idea but Ican convice them.

What  should I do, should I switch to CS or complete the medical degree? Is  CS worth it? I am not doing this for higher salary, I always loved math  and physics I was the best in high school. I also learned some C++ and  C# in highschool but I thought being a doctor could be nice. Now I think  I can't complete medicine it is really too boring and I don't have  motivation to study it.

I don't really post to reddit much but here goes nothing. This is also sort of a cross post from the SDR subreddit, so sorry if you're seeing this twice.

I work for a small company that develops products and I am in the planning phase of developing a Software Defined Radio.

The SDR device will include RAM for waveform storage, and a FPGA that will incorporate JESD204. Although it will be able to store and loop waveforms it will also have real-time functionality at high speeds. The SDR will use CAT5/6 for communication to a PC, and will use an API. The SDR will have support for some 802.11 protocols, amateur bands, V2X, LTE protocols, potentially some camera (FPV/) bands and down the road I will add support for additional cellular protocols. It will have a maximum continuous bw of 400 MHz and a minimum of 8 MHz. The frequency range will be from 75MHz to 6 GHz. The SDR board will have functionality to also act as a VNA. It will also have functionality to work with Open Air Interface (OAI), GNURadio, and LuaRadio. There will be additional software (GUI) to support the VNA functionality and potentially the camera functionality as well.

Please PM me or leave a comment if you would be interested in a device like this.

Topics are very subjective and interpretation-dependent as well. Please ask questions if something is difficult to understand.

Short description(s) of problem(s) as in questions:

· How to deal with (non-religious) ethical and moral dilemmas while working in relevant industries?

· How not to be bothered by working for “dirty” businesses?

· Are all (engineering) companies only driven by money, profits, shareholders, etc.?

· Is there an industry and/or a discipline of science and engineering that has less of these issues?

· Are clashes with personal values good reasons for refusing to work in a given company or an entire industry?

· Should a person like this just stick with academia or e.g. consider using their skills in stuff like humanitarian aid instead?

· Will moving to a bigger country with a larger economy help in finding “meaningful” work?

Background of my education and career:

I am about to finish my more theoretical master’s in Materials Science and Engineering with my current major being Fibre and Polymer Engineering at the “top” institution for engineering in my country (small welfare country, small markets, mostly imported goods, etc.). I have some industry experience (research and \[product\] development, and production \[management\]) from e.g. Forest-Based, (Bio)chemical and Biotechnology Industries. Thesis has taken a very long time as it moved on from being application-focused towards more fundamental research (also due to the fact that I had to find a new job, i.e. working for my institution now as well), i.e. company (small start-up with venture capitalist involvement I think) wanted to take a shortcut and skip straight to productization.

I asked many questions about things that bothered me during our initial tests, but there was always a “convenient” excuse from the Chief Technology Officer and then Product Manager (now with a “higher” title, also my advisor from the company) on why we did things in a certain way. They also never revealed their “full plan(s)” to me, there was no written document or anything like that. Many decisions were made “on the go” based on either something they thought of, I discovered or mentioned, etc. As I was attempting to finish the writing process, I just could not do it. Obtained “proof” was way too “shaky” for the claims that we were making as in a lack of proper characterisation techniques and claiming that a not-fully understood natural phenomenon was successfully exploited in our researched application. There was also so much research data and calculations that there was a lack of real focus and such. Reached out to my supervising professor as we had kind of operated without involving him too much, hinted at my frustrations, etc. Whole situation was basically such that the company was doing quite a lot of marketing hype based on very limited testing as in calling it “revolutionary”.

I felt like I had been (somewhat) lied to this whole time with unrealistic promises of e.g. research article publications and so forth (I am interested in doctoral studies). However, when you are busy with executing time-consuming work, literature research, calculations, etc., you have less time to focus and think critically. They are still offering to cooperate in this journal article sense, but initial promises were “insane” as in being completely clueless about the quality and impact of our performed work. As if I, a mere student would indirectly solve how a natural phenomenon that scientists are still struggling with can be exploited in a manner that enables a practical application to function in a very “clever” manner by doing very limited and rudimentary yet time-consuming and massively data-generating experimental work. Like this was a classic case of “we have a result that we want from these tests by doing them and then we will publish it in a highly-ranked scientific journal to boost our company image”. They must have thought that I was a complete idiot or something, anyone with a decent brain would be suspicious of such claims. Alternatively they could be the idiots, I do not know at this point anymore. They seem like glorified salesmen to me now that I am looking back on all of it.

Moreover, while they were at least open about it and hinted about potential issues early on, I was only paid for six months and then there were “sudden” issues with company financials. I mean it could be true since they sort of seem desperate, but it is still very suspicious as in their plan was probably just to do some quick testing, exploit a student in some sense and then move on. So new tests are under development, etc., but coronavirus makes everything very complicated right now and I cannot continue laboratory work for a while. Mind you I am not a very trusting person anyways and something always bugged me about the whole affair. I do not know if people who do not really know me often assume that I am not the brightest person around or at least believe that I would be easy to manipulate as I am heavily introverted, keep to myself, focus on essentials, prefer to think things through, need time to process new information, etc. Like maybe the company people thought that they were dealing with at least a quite a young and naïve person. I am slightly older compared to how a “typical person” in a similar situation would typically be as I am already in my early 30s.

For some more context, my bachelor’s was more practical (Materials Technology) from a much less-known institution with a broad focus on different materials and personally specialised in Structural Design (Steel Structures) and Wood Materials during said studies. I had many difficulties in finding a thesis position, so I had to do a more private project for a contact from a previous summer job. Like e.g. one possibility for a company progressed somewhat, but then the person who was to confirm the position was being very evasive until finally telling me that there was no job. Economy of my country has also not fully recovered since the Global Financial Crisis and now a new one will likely hit this place really hard due to the coronavirus, etc. I as a young person (traumatised due to childhood and teenage bullying, clueless of my career interests, depression, etc.) struggled to find my place in all of this for five to seven years into my adulthood and it is still not easy even if I am more experienced and educated, more confident, not shy/socially anxious anymore, etc. nowadays.

I have only had short-term jobs overall, but at least they are from my field or a related one. It is also typical in my country to work during summer times when studying. At least I cannot focus on e.g. working on the side while doing full-time studying as well. While most of my other roles were more basic ones or at least less serious, I had a Production Management job that was basically me being in charge of an entire medium-sized mill (supposedly the largest mill on the entire planet for producing a specialty product) for a while so that the Mill and Production Managers could get their summer holidays. I was put in these shoes with a fairly short training and only two summers worth of working as a regular “grunt” in Production for a different company.

This job opened my eyes to how a typical “toxic” sales-driven company (owned by a private equity fund manager and company management) really operates. Production volumes and sales, i.e. profits were prioritised above all else. It did not matter if machinery was unsafe to use from time to time (e.g. there was a steam explosion inside the used process equipment with a boiler hatch firing out at a rapid velocity during a weekend, a real risk if someone had been at the wrong place at the wrong time since a minimal number of workers was used on weekends), regular proactive maintenance was skipped, work was so hectic that accidents due to personnel mistakes began happening with a really bad injury (an operator’s hand likely never fully recovering from what happened), there was missing safety equipment regarding potential danger hotspots, personnel with knowledge of processing equipment had been fired with no one having a full overview, etc. Only reactive repairs were done with me also having to make decisions between quick repairs to get production back to full functionality immediately or to do a proper check-up so as to potentially have more long-term benefits. As all members of Middle Management of the mill were seemingly afraid of losing their jobs and with Top Management being very controlling and power-hungry, I believe I made the right decision to turn down a more permanent job at that company. Like with bad luck I could have probably ended up in jail myself if I had remained in that place.

I only wanted to become a professional in science and engineering so that I could work in a development-oriented position(s) involving e.g. materials and product development, ideation, research, experimental and testing work, production scaleup, process optimisation, production management, etc. Took some courses also from related fields (e.g. Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Management) since my field is very interdisciplinary. I have also studied relevant multidisciplinary fields so as to understand e.g. Business, Global Trade and Politics, and Economics better, but I do not understand why e.g. money has such a huge role in everything nowadays. To me it is just another resource that has been overemphasised compared to its original purpose which was to enable trade. Add very brutal, fierce and ridiculous competition on top of that and you have an engineer who does not want to work in the industries anymore.

In conclusion I am becoming very disillusioned and frustrated with my field at least in an industrial sense since I have witnessed some really strange and questionable business practices. I do not know how people from other engineering disciplines feel about these things, but I am becoming increasingly disappointed in the “real world” of engineering. It could be that since my master’s studies have had this “Circular Economy” and e.g. Climate Change as major underpinnings, I am expecting too much already with most industrial activity still relying on older, more linear business models. A lot of the more “ecological” solutions are practically marketing talk currently and it took me a while to snap out of these claimed progresses since “successful businessmen” from large corporations were giving us students all these amazing speeches of a “better future”. Yeah, even I was fooled for a while. I mean of course I somewhat knew that there is an increasing amount of greed involved when money becomes more of a focus in anything, but this has been far beyond my wildest dreams.

Page 3: representation of subwoofer, labeled with 3.5mm from TV, power in from outlet, power out to speakers

Page 4-n: representations of each component with specified data/power connections.

The closest existing software I know is a PCB design package like EAGLE, but I want ""one level,"" up.

48,High quality encoders vs high quality gearboxes for slow precision applications,1585738069,"Hi everyone - my background is in electrical (specifically digital logic design) and I've been toying with the idea of creating an astrophotography mount. However having learnt all this electrical stuff it means the realities of the mechinical side are a mystery to me.

So the given the requirements speed is almost a non-issue (the earth's angular speed being 7.29*10^-5 rad/s) it's all about having enough torque and stiffness to move a mass smoothly and accurately. In this regard I would think that using a high quality absolute encoder on the output axis and tuning a PID loop after using say a wormgear for the reduction would solve an arbitrary number of mechanical problems. 
Some example encoders: https://au.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Broadcom-Avago/AS38-H39E-B13S?qs=0ns%252b%2F2Cp7jFzuqjoJquqaQ%3D%3D

Or should I keep watching ebay and grab some high reduction second hand strainwave gearboxes when they're available?

Personally I would lean towards the encoder option, because realistically the output is the important part, and solving a mechnical problem with an electronic control loop would probably be easier for me than designing a better mechanical system.
Hopefully a sufficiently tuned PID loop would overcome some of the mechanical failings in that part of the design.

55,Is it bad to hammer on linear actuators?,1585722155,"I don't know if this is the right sub but I thought if anyone would know it would be you people.

I'm making a height adjustable work bench and was hoping to use linear actuators to adjust the height. The problem is that the bench will be used for woodworking/metalworking which requires a lot of hammering and since the strongest point of a table is above the leg I plan on positioning the vice over the legs which is where the linear actuators will be situated. 

Will this put too much stress on the actuator and cause it to jam? 

Would hammering potentially cause the actuator to back drive which would lower the table and also put the other actuators out of sync? 

Is there a better option for raising the table that would be more suitable to shock loading?

57,The college I will be going to is getting a new engineering program. I have a few questions/concerns about it.,1585720828,"I'll start off with some context. I am currently a high school senior (in America) who is thinking about studying engineering in college. Where I'll be going is a private liberal arts college that is growing past its pre-engineering curriculum, and will now offer full degrees in engineering.

Since the program is new, I have a few concerns. I am not sure if they are valid concerns, but to me it seemed worth looking into. First, the program does not *currently* have ABET accreditation. After talking to one of the professors, he laid down a few facts for me. According to him, it is in the process of getting ABET accreditation. He explained that once members of the first class graduate with an engineering major (the class of '23), the school will receive accreditation retroactively after an 18-month period. Accreditation would not apply until the August after I graduate in 2024, as that is 18 months after the class of '23 would get their degrees. 

Before I get to my questions, there are a few more details that I would like to put out there about the nature of the degree offered. So, I thought it was a little strange that there is just *an* engineering degree offered. If I went through the program, I would get a bachelor of science in ""Engineering."" Instead of there being many different degrees, there are different concentrations, also called ""tracks."" There are three tracks offered: electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering. The curriculum has an engineering core that then splits the tracks far from each other. Right now, chemical engineering seems the most appealing, but that could change.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the questions:

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a risk for me to go through this program, generally speaking?

Will I be able to get a job right away, or an internship in college with the pending ABET status?

Will the degree in ""Engineering"" look off to employers/graduate schools?

Am I better off studying something else that I am interested in?

61,Am I Becoming too Specialized too Soon?,1585712243,"
     So I am on track to graduate with a BS in civil engineering this May. I’ve grown a passion for water and hydraulic systems and water resources in general. Going into engineering was stemmed by my past experiences. I grew up working on cattle ranches and farms. I always enjoyed building things and solving problems and running the irrigation systems. Irrigation was the kick start to my passion for water. The summer between my sophomore and junior year I started an internship at a consulting firm that specializes in irrigation engineering. It was supposed to be a summer gig but they hired me on to continue working throughout these last couple years of going to school. I’ve now excepted a job offer with them as a full time engineer and I’m very excited to continue to learn design and build these large and complicated systems. 
   But I’m wondering if I’m becoming too specialized too early into my career. I’ve always been one to analyze all options and try to think ahead in my life and look at how decisions I’m making now will effect my future and the level of content I feel. I wonder if I’ll ever start to get bored of just irrigation and I’ll want to branch out to work for a city or a consulting firm that does more. 
    Again as of now I’m very excited and motivated to start working full time with this firm. The PE’s are great and very knowledgeable. But my question is would a firm hire a guy let’s say with 5-10 years experience in just irrigation to work in a firm specialized in something else in water resources? I also have aspirations in developing technology for developing countries when it comes to managing and saving water, but maybe that’s another post.

The cabinet is essentially just a frame with 4 posts welded to panels at the top and bottom. The side panels and door all bolt onto the frame. I believe it is all 12 gauge carbon steel. Each post has a flange running top to bottom with 1/4"" holes evenly spaced for mounting things. I also have supports/mounting rails running horizontally between posts for mounting stuff (somewhat similar to a Rittal cabinet design).

The power assembly weighs about 800 lbs and has to be mounted in the upper half of the cabinet. For simplicity's sake, you can just consider it as an 800lb box. Currently, my idea is to have a subframe within the cabinet made of bolted or welded 1.5"" square steel tubing to support the load but this adds a good amount of weight and takes up a lot of space in the lower half. Is there any feasible way to securely mount this using the 1/4"" holes that are already there? Would 12 gauge steel be strong enough to support all that weight if mounted correctly?

When I put that line into a spectrum analyzer, the signal is significantly lower than specified (uV compared to .5V, and similar power decrease). My question is: does the shape of the insulator affect the signal on the inner conductor? It is only a small portion of the insulator, and I checked that there is not continuity between inner and outer conductors. 
The part I am working with, when powered off, shows a short between signal and ground pins (no R at all). Internal circuitry is likely opening this, but at the very least I expected some resistance or open.

As R&amp;D is not essential for production, the engineers (and other non-essential staff) have been forced to use our vacation days starting from the 25th of March until today, the 31st. However, we were just informed today that this period will be extended to the 10th of April. 

I have been searching for laws pertaining to employer scheduled vacation time and it does seem to be completely legal, except for the fact that they have us only a half a days notice before this took effect.

Is engine efficiency this closely related to peak torque and overall mileage? That is...let's say an engine's air/fuel mix is closest to stoichiometric at 3,500 RPM.

98,Non-engineer question about solutions to ventilator shortage.,1585671622,"When I hear that we are discussing the possibility of rationing ventilators and maybe even resorting to hand pumping bags to ventilate patients I like most people feel a sense of dread.  

I see MIT is working on designs to create a paddle system to pump the manual bags off of a electronic motor but am still worried about the ability to produce these units in numbers needed in time.

Just as some background I am neither an engineer nor a health professional.  In fact I am a dairy Farmer so I am aware that my question may be naive and I am very ignorant of medical devices.  I am busy just trying to keep my farm running,  or I would take the time to educate myself more before asking the following.  To be honest I don't have the time to research this and I am sure smart people exist here to say whether there is any merit to a thought I've had.

In my industry we use vacuum pumps that have either a mechanical regulator, (adjustable spring actuated) or a digital control box that varies the speed of the pump to balance the vacuum at a preset pressure.  

In order to create the squeezing motion on a teat a second vacuum line runs on the outside of a rubber milking tube.  This tube is by default tight on the teat but when vacuum is applied outside the tube it opens up, then releases to create the squeezing motion, and repeat.  To create  this ""on off "" effect we use a electric magnet device called a pulsator.

Here is a short video showing a pulsator.[pulsator](https://youtu.be/zExHAt-DvZw)

These pulsators are a common item in the dairy industry and my sense is that there are excess pulsators, as many dairy farms have been ceasing operations, and if the farm is not resold it is common for a dairy supply company to tear out the old equipment.

My question is if we  if we could create a pressurized pipeline instead of a vacuum pipeline and use the pulsators to mimic the breathing action?  

Creating something like this with already available materials that don't need to be manufactured.
[design](https://photos.app.goo.gl/n4LP7Kc2oEcxVPQ58)

I hope if nothing else this starts someone thinking about ways to rapidly solve this problem and maybe some outside the box thinking.

Some common companies that have these types of pulsators in case you are wondering would be DeLaval, Boumatic, and Lely.

18,An Ethical Dilemma: Non-essential Travel during COVID-19,1585625255,"To be up front, I am not a licensed Professional Engineer, nor does my career lead to or require professional licensure; so formal codes, etc. while helpful, are only tangentially related to my case.

I work for a defense contractor in the US.

Legally, where my work takes place, non-essential travel is suspended. Defense contractors are considered essential, therefore we continue to travel as usual.

This also makes sense conceptually; just because there's a plague on, doesn't mean the country doesn't need to continue to defend itself. A delayed or cancelled defense project may not impact readiness now, but may further down the line delay capabilities that could save lives and enhance the effectiveness of its soldiers.

However... not all of our projects are for the national defense. There are some commercial projects we manage, and I am currently a key engineer working on such a project.

The company's stance is that because we are a defense contractor, ALL of our travel should continue unimpeded.

However, I disagree. I believe our commercial projects should be suspended, and travel should only continue for defense projects.

By refusing to travel, I may grind the multi-million dollar project I am working on to a halt. This would also cause my coworkers to not have to travel.

I believe both Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture/Marine Engineering a solid foundation for aerospace engineering, but am unsure as to which is ""better."" On one hand, MechEng seems to be the basis for Aero, with Aero being a concentration of MechEng. This seems like a good choice as it seems to have lots of versatility in career choices regarding engineering, as well as solid pay and stability. However NA&amp;ME seems like a solid choice too. NA&amp;ME seems to be a concentration of MechEng too, with some electrical engineering thrown in as well. And like Aerospace Engineering, NA&amp;ME seems to deal with many engineering issues in a similar way; harsh environment, demanding mechanical capabilities, specific materials. And of course, there is the idea that both disciplines deal with a vehicle moving through a medium. I've heard that the difference between an aircraft and a submarine is the medium that they move through. I've heard that NA&amp;ME can even be applied to spacecraft design and engineering. Is this true? Additionally NA&amp;ME seems to have higher potential earnings on it's own than MechEng.

I’m technically a mechanical engineer but I’m just a software developer now, it’s been years since I’ve had to do any classical mechanics.

He has a motor running at 3450 rpm and he wants the strike speed to max out ~ 200 rpm, with an idler pulley after the downshift gear to make a v belt as the control to engage the hammer with the motor.

The things I’m unsure of are: how do you calculate angular speed with something that isn’t a perfect circle, for the cam? And how would you calculate the angular speed for a [v belt](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSfTjMqGSB7Jx1Le-oy5cP_vgFA3cd2vgB-JJagtVTolcR88r702YJh2vSPOA&amp;s )/the final gear that determines the strike frequency when there’s an idler pulley in the system that doesn’t fulfill the no-slip condition when it isn’t fully engaged? For this last one, I’m assuming that the mathematical equivalent is “the idler pulley at max rpms (in my instance 200 rpms) is also the full tension no-slip condition, so you can functionally ignore the idler pulley then with regards to the strike frequency as all three gears would then share the same linear speed of the belt and their angular speeds would then only depend on their own geometries”.

 That heat is then being transferred into the enclosure therefore you should account for it in your cooling calculations? 

Since a majority of the electrical power is being converted to mechanical energy then should you just assume that the remainder is adding to your heat load? 

Where it gets a little tough to wrap my head around is what about the heat generated by compressing the air and increasing its velocity?

55,Bad engineering boss might be threatened by me? Advice?,1585583761,"Hey, all! Long post ahead. Here's some background:

I'm a 24-year-old man, graduated in May 2019 with my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Spent a few months in a PhD program at my alma mater, found it wasn't for me so I went into industry. This is where the fun begins.

Made the dumb mistake of biting at my first offer in December; very small company that makes electrical cables and assemblies. Place covered in red flags: management was openly sexist and a ""boy's club"", a 2960's ""we've always done things this way"" mentality for starters. Interviewed by then-retiring senior engineer who had been with the company for a few decades, another engineer we'll call ""Steve"" (my to-be boss, 23-year-old with a mechanical engineering technology degree), and a sleazy car salesman type we'll call ""Dave"" (in his 50s, not qualified to manage a company but pleased CEO enough to be let in).

They offer me a role for fair pay and benefits, I accept (unfortunately). Get into the role and start in early January. Hell begins.

See, Dave is a sweet guy if you're a man -- so thankfully, he liked me. He would bullshit about his horses and his lawnmower and his Mercedes, I'd smile and laugh, et cetera. He respected me for my background and I respected him for his kindness towards me.

Not the case with Steve. See, Steve was the only engineer at the company besides me and the now-retired engineer. He was now responsible for everything -- product design, quality control, manufacturing support, etc. He was a cool guy when I met him, liked Call of Duty and was part of a frat at his university which he missed (no surprise). He was also now my direct report.

Wasn't so cool when he started to realize how much I brought to the table. When we got audited for ISO9001, I offered to Dave to create standard work documents for all our processes and manufactured assemblies. In private, Steve said ""you haven't been here long enough to do something that complex. You still have a lot to learn"", etc. Keep in mind Steve had only been with the company for a year and my degree and experiences made me more technically qualified than him.

Dave loved the idea; in his words, a ""fool proof way"" for production to work. I agreed to make one to start. Half way through that document, Steve started to stack up other, less relevant work for me to work on -- like cleaning and sweeping the engineering area, or helping production make assemblies (which definitely wasn't my job, I wouldn't have spent 40k on schooling if I knew I'd be doing that!).

With crunch time, I managed to make the standard work documents and finish all my assigned tasks. Auditor liked them too (big surprise) for their controllability and accountability. Steve was stone-faced as we walked around the plant with the auditor and Dave.

That was in February. Since then, my tasks have only gotten more demeaning -- more assembly than ever (typically all week), he doesn't trust any drawing or customer quote I make despite those things being in my job description (and, therefore, has basically revoked that activity from me).

Since the virus hit the US, we haven't closed our doors as we're considered ""essential"" by our manager, Dave. I do some work from home, but only under strict supervision. At this point, the only thing I do is create datasheets for our products, all while Steve watches my screen AND webcam (so yes, he is currently being paid to watch my screen the entire day). He's cut my lunch break from 1 hour to 30 minutes, and tries to make it clear to our now other engineer that I'm not to be trusted with ""anything technical"". The other engineer has analyzed the situation and in a parking lot after work, has explained that Steve is a douche with a power complex and poor managerial skills (to which I agreed)

Another idea is that he's threatened by me in some way. Not only is Steve not very smart or capable, he's lazy. He spends most of his day in his office on his phone or playing games on his PC, and only works unless truly necessary. He might be worried that because I'm more technically versed than him, more motivated to go above and beyond, and older than him that I may take his job (which absolutely isn't my desire).

What does one do in this case? My work life is miserable. I haven't touched a drawing or technical document in weeks and has been demoted to assembler and datasheet writer. I'm trying to find a different job already, but with COVID-19 comes a huge hiring freeze. Hell, I took the day off because I don't feel well and he's holding me accountable ""still expecting work to be done"". Let me know what you guys think.

My system is an 8kw solar, tied to a 7.5kw commercial version solar edge 240V inverter with a LG Chem 10kwh battery.

The question is

How can I reduce ware and tear on the inverter and battery?

Every night the small load on the system drops the battery to 90% and every morning at 8am it charges to 100% in 1 to 2 hours. 

Is using a small load bad on the inverters or would a bigger load be better and easier on the inverter?

Would draining the batter over night more be better?

What kind of loads do inverters dislike? Dc/dc switching power supplies, motors/inductive, resistive?

I will eventually connect it to the grid, but I am building my house and using this as construction power, LED lights, battery chargers and saws.

Would running a motor with a weight provide voltage stabilization, inertia to the system?

I can't seem to draw the battery down during the day as my 8kw solar is more than the 7.5kw inverter can output. The battery voltage is 400v dc.

My inverter battery and auto transformer are all mounted in my basement where it's 60 degrees year round. So I don't think thermal will be an issue. Just trying to make my system last longer.

I currently work for a Fortune 50 company, and I have been at it for about a year. I make about $87k after bonuses in a low-cost of living area after college with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering, which affords me a comfortable security blanket.. I've done a combination of smaller capital projects ranging from 50k to 150k but every project has been a mess of me guessing what to do based on what people tell me since none are based on what my degree told me. Sometimes there is tribal knowledge that everyone knows but no one knows to tell me, and I have no guidance on what to ask until I later make a mistake. I'm told to ""not be afraid to ask questions,"" but I don't know where to even start if I don't have some guidance. 

Sometimes operators are dismissive, jaded about the low pay rate, and don't want to help me. Others go out of their way to help me but sometimes tell me conflicting things compared to other operators, so I'm left confused. I don't want to generalize to how women such as myself act, but I defer to being agreeable and wanting to make others feel validated so I agree with everyone but I want to find some right or safe conclusions about how to do things. The plant supervisor often tells me ""I'm asking YOU - figure it out yourself."" The operators being unhelpful, it's not exclusive to me - the plant supervisor has issues asking operators to help him perform lock-out-tag-out testing during an equipment fire in a timely matter.

I have no basis of comparison to work off of what is expected but I am often thrown into projects and then expected to know what I'm doing with little to no training of safety or how things work. I'm worried that I'm picking up bad habits concerning safety, time management, people skills, and learning right-from-wrong with the lack of appropriate training and oversight.

61,Multiple variants test station automation concepts,1585577651,"Hi, I wonder if any of you guys have any experience within concepts of testing stations that handle multiple variants of a product? 

For example lets say we're producing motherboards in a computer, 5 types that all have different dimensions and we need to test these towards electronical standards and make sure they actually work with recieving and transmitting data. The test stations and procedure look alike, say connecting 2 cables in the back and both of them in the computer/device that tests the boards. Although since the boards have different dimensions they all fit differently in this testing device hence the need for multiple device stations/easily movable fixtures (that are dimensioned for all these 5 types) that connect into the stationary testing device.

I'm interested in concepts that removes the need for having several stations/fixtures with the result of only having 1 station that can handle all 5 types of mobo's tests.

0  sr / cp   cr / cp

cp = cos(pitch)

as a result, this block (matrix\*omegas) recalculate angular velocities from body frame to euler

It got me thinking... formula one teams now claim that a formula 1 engine is up to 50% efficiency which is incredible. Although I do have one question, does the efficiency claim involve the use of utilising the exhaust temperature etc to generate electricity which is sent to motors that add additional power? 

As realistically I don’t doubt for one second that the engines are more efficient than previous years or your standard car engine. 

Although my thinking is the core engine is still exhausting a lot of useful energy.. let’s say it’s 30% efficient and by utilising the exhaust to create electricity of an additional 20% then that’s where they are getting the 50% from.

the original bearings had 2Z shields, so far i hadread the 2R shields better from the ingress of contaminants, but the original decision oem was 2Z why? longevity?  
so what do you think?  
is it really necessary to go with 2Z, well its high rpm and you could say high dust ingress problem

83,Field engineered positive pressure ventilation device - for COVID ARDS response,1585550461,"Disclaimer: I’m a mechanical engineer and while I have decades of experience in industrial applications I have no real experience in working in healthcare settings.

I am putting this out for discussion because I am interested in meeting the desperate need of COVID patient airway ventilation devices.
Let me know how this idea can be improved upon.

TLDR; use full face SCBA masks and SCUBA regulators in addition to large bottle compressed gas cylinders to provide “good enough” type of field triage for COVID response.

Problem basis: we do not enough medical ventilators to supply the coming wave of paTients with COVID-related respiratory distress symptoms.  The few are coming off production lines now are complicated and costly but perform superbly at their function in a hospital setting.  I will assume that we cannot meet the supply needs in the accelerated timeframe required to head off the coming wave.
Is there a an off the shelf type sol’n that we can use that is “good enough” for field treatment of ambulatory triaged Lvl B COVID ARDS patients?

Field ventilator Requirements:
R1:must provide positive pressure air supply to patient
R2:must allow for coughing without delivery device coming off
R3:must be triggered by patients own breathing
R4:must have adjustable air delivery pressure
R5:should be relatively comfortable for patient
R6:should have means of sterilization
R7:must be affordable (less than $1k USD) for expected treatment lasting 1 week
R8:must have means to capture pathogen on exhalation
R9: should have means for O2 delivery to increase FiO2
R10:must not allow for any reverse flow into air supply line
R:11:should allow for positive pressure during exhalations circuit for alveoli inflation 

So perusing used inventory on online markets I see a large number of Self Contained Breathing asparagus masks and regulators going for ~250bucks on average.  Having a pre-engineer background in confined space firefighting, being a recreational SCUBA dive and having been an engineer in both commercial and military industrial settings as I believe these devices can be modified cheaply to provide a quick and dirty means to provide air to patients with severe pneumonia and in the early stages of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The supply air can come from 50l compresssed air cylinders that rent from less than 10 bucks a bottle.  I know the air is not “medical grade” but in a pinch it could work. For slightly more $ the tanks could be swapped to certified breathing air.  
For regulators I I like the SCUBA regulators over SCBA types since the diaphragm is much more readily adjusted to adjust to provide better control of delivered air plus, most mid grade second stage regulators have a “East Breath” feature that uses the Venturi effect to “float” the second stage diaphragm making it much easier for a shallow weak breathing patient to suck air.  A full face dive mask is viable but there a lot fewer of them out there so I’d like to investigate modifying a SCUBA second stage into a SCBA circuit.
Anyway requirements R1 through R7 are fully met with this type of solution.
Requirements R8 through R11 require some tinkering to implement.
R8 considerations:
The exhalation path would need to be modified to include a HEPA (ideal) filter to capture possible pathogens, this would serve the field technician by reducing the demand for their own respiratory PPE and many field patients could be attended to in close proximity of unprotected visitors(family). The exhaust path from the mask will need to be directed through some sort of filter so that coughing fits don’t exhaust virus into the outside environment.
R9 considerations:
A nipple with dual inline ball check valve to allow for therapeutic oxygen to be delivered into the patient’s breathing environment.  The nipple can even be mounted directly to the polycarbonate face shield with appropriate supports to prevent cracking shield.  Perhaps it could be added to the rubber seal material with some sort of sealant applied?  This might be uncomfortable for patient.
R10 considerations:
This is met by second stage regulator’s diaphragm and needle valve.
R11 considerations:
I had family that used a CPAP in their final days and I recall positive pressure being used on exhalation.  This had the effect of holding open the alveoliwhixh would allow for better gas exchange ( akin to plunging your nose while exhaling into your closed mouth will clear sinus pressure momentarily if you have sinus congestion) so there should be a side stream of supply air bypassing the second stage regulator that does just this.  This could be a simple gas regulator throttled down to achieve the low pressure ~0.25#

I have to stop because I feel that I’m rambling and my battery on this device is nearly dead. I’ll recharge and check back in with you folks later tonight and proof read this submission then too ;)

94,How did you build your freelance engineering business into a full-time job?,1585525237,"Hey folks.  I struggled with where to post this  ( r/smallbusiness or r/freelance for instance), but decided this is a pretty specific question and I'd like to get some input/advice/experience from other engineers.  This will be a bit lengthy.

To date I've got about 12 years of mechanical engineering experience, ranging from a small DoD contractor, to a utilities metering company, to now  being an engineering manager at a large corporation.  For the past few years I've had a side gig that's ranged from doing freelance work for random people found on Craigslist, to actually partnering with old colleagues on an array of projects - even subcontracting some of my work out to them (SW/FW type stuff).  A little background on how it evolved:

In 2017 I was starting to get pretty fed up with my job at the time, and coincidentally was approached by a colleague who I used to work for at his prior company.  Long story short, we had kept in touch and continued to be colleagues and friends.  He had started a new company and was working a few projects, so I started doing some work for him on the side using Onshape.  I loved it.  I had always respected and appreciated working for him, and the new projects were far more interesting than my day job.  Aside from that, I fell in love with the power of Onshape to be able to collaborate and work remotely.  So I did what anyone would do.  Had a kid and while on paternity leave, started an LLC and acquired my own Onshape license.  

For the next four months I worked like a madman, juggling the new kid, designing and building my website (I had ZERO experience, or desire to build websites), and trying to find clients that would be in addition to the work I was doing for my colleague.  I tried Upwork, etc, but quickly decided that was NOT the sandbox I had any interest whatsoever in playing in.  

I set up the company to offer the following:

\- design for inventors

\- additional engineering resources for startups/small companies without a dedicated engineering dept

\- Onshape specific services

With a combination of scouring Craigslist for hours on end, and referrals, I obtained a very modest amount of clients, ranging from agriculture, lighting, and energy.  I had 20 hours a week to commit, and this kept me pretty occupied until the end of 2018.  All in all, I made about $20k the first year, which I thought was great, but soon realized my rates were FAR too low.  Nonetheless, what I learned during that experience was immense, and I was just about to pull the trigger on trying to take it full-time.

Then I got a job offer I couldn't refuse, accepted, had another kid, and for a period of time kind of let the business die down, only doing very small jobs and putting in less than 5 hours a month.  I loved my new (and current) job, and was so busy with the kids that I couldn't commit to it anymore.

Well, now we've kind of settled into a rhythm and I'm looking at picking it back up, but with a different picture of my ""ideal client"".  Thought my job is relatively safe, the mess going on with this virus further solidifies a main reason I started the business in the first place:  diversification of income.  

Now as I said, I love my current job and have no desire to leave in the near future, but down the road I do see myself as owner of a small business, centered around engineering and design, that both sells it's own products, and provides design services for other companies.

After my first year experience, I no longer have any interest in working with inventors/visionaries who don't understand basic engineering and manufacturing limitations.  Not knocking them whatsoever - I just don't have the time or patience to deal with it.  Moreover, I need to be able to charge what I'm worth, and a random person with a unique idea isn't going to pay $150/hr+ for design services.  

Also, at some point this thing needs to allow me to move out of the world of trading dollars for hours.  I've read **The E Myth** and understand that right now I'm more of a technician, but have gained enough experience to start looking at working **on** the business vs in it.  That would all come in time of course - I am not tied to needing to do all the fun engineering work.  I like doing business dev and networking with others.  What makes me happy is putting others in the position to succeed and flex their design muscles, while still leaving a nominal amount of time for me to sit down and do some design myself.

Now for the actual question (s) for those of you that have done the following (roughly):

started freelancing on the side &gt; maybe hired out some of the work to others to help scale &gt; started making your own products

How were you able to find your ideal clients?  

When did you hire on someone to help, be it a contractor or employee?

When did you decide to start making products, and how did you determine what to make?

My business has been set up such that I can do work 100% remotely, and I'd like to keep it that way as much as possible.  I've done work for clients across the country, and some around the globe.  I love the flexibility that provides.  I realize at some point I'll need to have somewhere to assemble/test, and if I do start to offer products, obviously along with that comes a permanent space that would be needed, but that's a few years down the road.  Ideally I'd like to offer engineering/CAD services as a major revenue stream, possibly outsourcing alot of the lower level work to subcontractors - either engineering students/interns in the US looking for some income, or even places like India/Malaysia.  I've talked to/worked with designers from those areas and wouldn't have an issue with it.  Again, I want to stop trading dollars for hours at some point.  This revenue would kind of help feed R&amp;D work at some point to start offering products.  That's the overall, long-term goal anyway.

Things that are extremely important to me:

\- Being able to run the business mostly remotely once it's set up and systems are in place

\- Being able to offload the lion's share of the work, leaving me to do business development, exploring new opportunities

\- At some point, creating a physical, viable product that would have my company name on it and I could say ""we made that""

I realize #1 and #3 are a bit at odds, but it really goes back to working **ON** the business vs **IN** it.

I understand there isn't much crossover. There is biomedical engineering but I'd rather  learn one of the specialties that I could always apply back to biomedical if I wanted to (maybe I'm being stupid?)

Basically, I wanna get into the field of Robotics and wanna do it from scratch - from designing, building all the way to controlling). Everything as a hobby, as I will start working for Siemens(dual/cooperative studies), but it will be in the Smart Infrastructures Division - a lot to do with Building Automation, Optimisation of energy use, etc... - that may help a bit, mainly in the programming/control area, but Robotics stuff isn't the real focus of the branch, that's why I said it'd be personal interests, not really exactly because of the job. The skills I'll need for the job are discussed by the Uni and Siemens, since this is a Dual Study Program, so, my question here has nothing to do with my job, rather to my wish to learn Robotics stuff. 

Background and further info:

- I am taking an online course and am learning C++. 
- I have only high school, but I have taken the 3 Calculus and Linear Algebra classes already (learning stuff is also a hobby), and my next step would be Differential Equations (just got &lt;&lt;Advanced Engineering Mathematics, by Dennis G. Zill, 6th Ed.&gt;&gt;) 
- I am also learning some EE stuff with &lt;&lt;Fundamentals of Electric Circuits, by Charles Alexander, 7th Ed.&gt;&gt;

I know I will definitely have to learn the things I mentioned above, but I am sure there are other things I could already start learning.

- MATLAB:  It's good to know, but mostly for... and when you...

Say I like to have hot baths. Now I used to just full it with hot water which takes 5 minutes, it's a big bath but the hot water system gets water hot so it fills at a decent rate. But that felt a little wasteful because the water starts cooling down after 30 minutes.

I keep adding hot water until I'm red like a lobster.

Anyway, am I wasting a lot of money by running the instant gas hot water unit for a longer time at a slower flow rate, even though it's still heating the same amount of water all up. And ignoring that I may run it hotter than normal as I adjust to the heat. If I run the hot water at 1/8th the normal rate for 8 times as long, is that burning 8 times as much gas? Or at such a low flow rate does it require 1/8th as much gas so it costs the same? I'm guessing inside there is some kind of heating element that responds to the rate of water flow by passing the heat to the water at 1/8th the rate, so the gas flame needs to be ignited for only 1/8th the time it would have been blasting at the full normal flow rate.

My question for you engineers is - tell me fourteen ways they could have done this better.

My experience with potato cannon technology tells me that they could've jerry rigged some PVC contraption to fire a light line over to Andy and [slide over whatever food was needed.](https://i.imgur.com/w11sS56.png)

32,would it be better to major in MechE or ChemE instead of BME for undergrad?,1585465652,"hi! i’m a sophomore in HS right now. i WAS planning to major in BME but i’ve talked to a few BME’s, MechE’s, and ChemE’s on here and this discord sever filled with university students in preparation of the PE and FE exams. anyway, i’ve gotten a bit of insight into all three of the choices i listed above but i’m still having concerns even though my principal investigator for research suggested CE or ME.   

my original plan was to major in BME @ JHU then grad school in BME. i wanted to become a researcher in clinical and translational gene therapies, however, i’ve heard that researchers take the chance of wasting their life away on one research project and sometimes it doesn’t pan out. i’ve also heard that BME’s are relegated to lower level equipment supervisors or glorified biotech’s.   

i’m just hella stressed right now because my dads insurance only covers me till 26 and due to personal issues i need to get out of the house ASAP. hypothetically speaking, if grad school doesn’t work out, i need a good undergrad major where job outlooks are either rising or always on the lookout.",AskEngineers,False,-molecular-biology-,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fr1szl/would_it_be_better_to_major_in_meche_or_cheme/
33,My manager is setting me up for failure,1585463048,"I am using a throwaway as well as avoiding any overly specific details because you can never be too careful but I would like anyone's advice on how to handle this

I have been working a little over a decade in my industry and I have been at my current job for around 2 years.  I noticed around 6 months ago some drama started where my project was having resources pulled from it and moved to higher priority projects.  This is nothing new and I have dealt with this before and I even completely agree with the company doing this, but the problems came when my manager wrote me up for falling behind on my project.  I literally can't get tests run because the technicians are told not to work on my project and I am not supposed to or qualified to setup and perform testing myself.  Now I am being pressured to hit deadlines that the project is nowhere ready for but it looks good when the project is reported out to do so.  as an analogy lets say I was building a house.  The walls and roof are not on the house because my manager sent the framing guys to another job, but I am supposed to have carpet in by next week so I am told to go ahead and have installers lay carpet.  I explain the carpet will get rained on but my manager doesn't want to hear excuses and just says carpet needs to be in by the deadline no matter what, so I have installers lay carpet on a slab foundation and my boss is happy with the result.  this short sighted managing has already caused the project to take even longer as I have to go back and redo things that were already done because of this.  I would like to quit but nobody is hiring now and I like paychecks.  Even my manager's boss seems to be on board as far as I can tell but I don't trust him enough to bring this to him and risk him siding with the manager who he likes and it makes things far worse far faster, so at this point I am following my manager's direction and just getting ready for failure.  I have spoken with coworkers I trust and they have said my manager is problematic but also because my project is lower priority due to a huge rush on a few other projects, that my experience is far worse, but not exactly different than what they are used to.  

On the bright side, if I do get fired, having a job loss around this time will not raise any red flags with employers considering the economy. 

I would love to stand up and flat out say this is shit and is going to blow up in my face, but I have explained the risks in a more polite manner and my manager simply doesn't care about my concerns.",AskEngineers,False,Annony4456,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fr1azg/my_manager_is_setting_me_up_for_failure/

55,"No motivation at work, just don’t care. Need help, what should I do?",1585422705,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve been out of college for 2 years. First job I was there for 1.5 years. Hated it. Found a really cool job I’ve been at 2 months. 

The same thing is happening at this job. I just don’t care about my work. I don’t care to overachieve. I don’t care to try really hard. I don’t know why.

I was extremely motivated in college, always wanted to work on fun projects. Create the best work I could create and get a good gpa and have an impressive resume. At work I just don’t care. I go to meetings and I tell them what I’ve done and I know they’re disappointed in my output but I just don’t care. This happened so much at my last job and I thought it was because I didn’t care overall of the products our company produced. So I found a job where I really like what we do and I’m starting to notice the same patterns. I don’t know what’s been happening with me, I just have a couple theories. 

I’ve noticed a repetition in jobs, my first internship, my last job, and now this job. The bottom line is I have absolutely zero motivation when I’m given meaningless tasks that have no impact. I try to think about it logically and I come to the same conclusion, trying to detach my emotions. I feel like I’m not given the support I need. My first tasks assigned to me my team have just treated like they were back burner tasks. Not caring whether they’re achieved or not. No one wants to help because my tasks aren’t critical to anything. They’re not necessary components at that exact moment in time. I’m not given support, I just keep being told that this other person would be better to talk to. Feels like no one wants to help. I look at another peer of mine and his work is highly desired, it’s needed by other engineers NOW, so he’s given a ton of support and help because they need his stuff to work for their stuff to work. Meanwhile I’m at my desk bs’ing away and no one really cares whether I produce work or not. So I just lose motivation. I end up being on my phone taking long breaks and not producing much work. Bottom line is they don’t care whether my work is accomplished or not so then why should I? 

My last job I had, my manager was highly detached completely from engineers work flow. Basically we were told our project was over budget and at this point everything we do was just extra for the customer since we met all of our deliverables. The general attitude was “it’d be nice if we accomplished this but it doesn’t matter. We already met all of our deliverables.” Like ok? So basically what we do now doesn’t even matter? I lost all motivation. I wouldn’t fulfill or accomplish my tasks but it was whatever, they just gave me more time since we had a couple more months before delivery. I just had no desire to overachieve because my team didn’t care whether I did or not. I know what I’m capable of. I know when I have meaningful work I always go the extra mile to succeed. 

On the previous project we were under budget and behind on delivery. I saw first hand what our product did and it made me passionate to make it the best product it could be. I worked with the people who used our product and it just made me want to make it as good as it could be. 

Fast forward to today, my team is not helping me, mostly because I’m new and they’re busy with their own work and they don’t really want to train me. Not that they intentionally don’t want to but they have a lot of their own work to do. I’m given small tasks and I end up procrastinating on them. One time I overachieved on a task because I was given a lot of time on it so I told myself I’m gonna do it as fast as possible. I did it in 2 weeks vs the 4 weeks I was given. Reported to my team lead because I wanted a bigger task. Was told by my team lead that I’m ahead of schedule and don’t have any work now. Wow. All motivation was destroyed that day. I could’ve worked on other stuff in preparation for future tasks, I could’ve gotten better and gotten a better understanding at other things done at our company. So many things I could’ve done but I chose to do nothing instead because I just lost my motivation. Now i have a task and it’s small but I just don’t care to get it done quickly

What should I do? I know everyone’s general advice would be to talk to my manager. I feel like I’m not at that point yet. Because like I said, there’s so many other things I know I could’ve been doing to help me become a better engineer, I just don’t care. Has anyone been in this position before? I used to be passionate about my work, I used to want to be a great engineer, now I feel like I just show up to get paid and if no one wants to help me and no one cares whether I produce or not then I just don’t care, because I’m getting paid anyway.

My name is Mohammed, 23 years old, I am an engineering student in Morocco, studying mechatronics, especially for automotive. I am in my final year, 5th, I am currently in my ""End of studies Internship"" as we call it here, so that i can obtain my engineering degree in ""mechatronics for Automotive"".

**- Why did i choose this field ?**

I was in my 2nd year of my preparatory classes when i had to choose, (Different system compared to what y'all have in the U.S. or Canada and many other countries). I wanted to choose Software engineering, where in my Uni, they studied how to develop web apps and mobile apps, pretty much it, but i wasn't so sure about it, something within me wanted to experiment with robots and embedded systems. At that time, mechatronics was just created as a new field in my Uni, so I searched what is was and what it offered, I liked it. Multidisciplinary field, where there is Computing, and Mechanics and Electronics, NICE ! I chose it, wasn't accepted, my grades where not enough. So i was ""put"" in IT, network systems and telecommunications. I passed a whole year, didn't like the head of the field, matter of fact she didn't like me 'cause ""I skipped the majority of classes"", typical of me at that time, but now i regret it, i could've learned much more about engineering and IT and had much better social life. So i was determined to change my field, but it wasn't possible. I persisted on sending enough emails to the director of my Uni, meeting with him wherever i could, bombarding him with physical folders containing all the documents necessary for the transfer, all he had to do was sign them and it's #DONE.
At the end of that 1st year, i was accepted, although i already did an internship of one month in an IT company, i was more that happy to finally make it to the field that was my 1st choice.
The 2nd year comes, i am a mechatronics student now, and i dislike the majority of my professors. If a new field was just created, it wasn't going to be full optimal until at least 3 years, 'cause it was a lot of work recruiting competent professors and having all the equipment necessary for practice. I forgot, i didn't learn from the experience of another field that was created a couple of years ahead, at that time, which was Industrial Engineering. Would've learned from the experience of fellow students if i was there, at the Uni, during events and such. Another problem was that i had to add a couple more elements to that years program, like Databases, Automatics, Thermodynamics. But it was alright, i can adapt ! I had a whole year of pure theoretical knowledge, a bit of practical on the side, on my own, 'cause there wasn't a lot to do at the Uni anyways. On top of that, i didn't have a good internship, i had to do it in an after sales service of cars. Dull internship, hated the experience. When i was sitting there making some stupid maintenance of the cars, my colleagues, them, worked with subjects, like AI, machine learning, production &amp; fabrication of cars, etc.
I am in my 3rd and final year, i had one semester left, didn't do much, i was so disinterested, the other is this one where i had to have an Internship in a company. Luckily for this internship, i learned from my past mistakes and landed in a good multi-national company. When I had to pass the interview, i was so afraid to lose the opportunity that i made it clear i would do anything as a subject. It suited them well, they gave me to work on a subject that was pure VBA coding to manage their Excel files.

---

**- What I want ?**

I don't know what to do in my engineering career. I did an IT internship when i was at my 1st year in IT, i then did a 2nd internship in Quality management, and my 3rd and most important internship of 6 months is in VBA programming. I am kind of lost really. I don't have a specific direction, and I don't have that ""something"" to guide me. So today i figured out I would start searching for the possibilities of carers that i could choose from. I have to specifically know what i want to do rather than follow the current, and have the market dictate where and what should i choose. I will also search scholarships for Masters abroad, like in the US or Germany and what not, and I don't know whether i should find a job or have a MSc in another country.

I figured i would first post a message on Reddit communities, i'll post it on many subreddits, hoping that someone would read it, if someone is having the same dilemma as me, or if someone is willing to provide me with advice (i would totally do the same, if that person needed advice on other things, you never know, just help a brother out !!)

Now I read a lot about how to do this and thought that I knew how to do this. Then I talked with a friend and he explained me some steps and options that I didn't think about. This would be my plan now but you can defiantly let me know if it's not a good plan. 

1) Make a model

2) Test the model on a small part of the data and look if it will overfit. (Use a small part so the computer doesn't have to run for to long)

3) Once you have an overfitting model you can start changing the parameters to combat the overfitting and hope that it works on the rest of the data.

I know it's not the most detailed plan but this is what I have now. Now I'll list the parameters that I will change to stop the overfitting. My question here is if there is a best way to change the parameters. Maybe to always change a certain parameter first or some other tips like that.

82,Why does my centrifugal fan spin in one direction when off and the other direction when turned on?,1585351296,"Newly installed bathroom ceiling fan in my condo on the top floor of a tall building. There's a lot of air trying to exit my windows and vents (coming in from the hallway) due to the stack effect of the building. When the fan is off, it passively rotates, due to the general air flow (pressure differential). When I turn it on, however, it reverses direction. In both cases, it's directing air from the room outside via the ducting (since that's how centrifugal fans work - changing the spin direction should change efficiency but not the direction of air flow).

I cannot figure out why it rotates in one direction when off, due to the natural air pressure difference, and the other direction when turned on. Shouldn't the ""passive"" direction be the same as the ""active"" direction (turned on, forcing the air in that same direction)?

I should also add that the ""passive"" direction is not the direction that the centrifugal fan should go - the ""active"" (motor turned on) direction is the normal spin direction for a centrifugal fan to be most efficient.

I am a Canadian who graduated as a mechanical engineer in late 2015. Before my last year of university, I had an internship with an electrical utility. While there, an old engineer told me about [LFTRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK367T7h6ZY). I spent months researching nuclear power, only to discover that this knowledge did little to help me career wise. As oil was in a slump when I graduated, there were few jobs, so I went traveling and returned in early 2018. I did temporary office jobs until I was offered a salary Service position with talks of moving me into a Engineering role. Several months later I was let go and here we are. With the new found freedom I've been asking what I would really like to do as a career. 

During my internship I was intent on renewable energy, however I do not believe humanity is at a place to effectively use renewables exclusively.

I'm currently a  second year Chemistry (BS)/Physics (BA) double major looking to go to grad school for probably Material Science Engineering as it seems to be the best combination of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering. Financially and research wise, it seems as though material science engineering has great potential for me.  My ultimate goal is to do meaningful research but also be able to run my own research firm eventually.

My question is how should I structure my Chemistry and Physics classes now to get more of an engineering side of things instead of just the pure science. My school allows for a good bit of choice in electives in the Physics major after taking the required classes. I already have Calc 1-3 under my belt and will be taking differential equations next semester. I will also be taking Experimental Physics. Analytical Chemistry, and Biochem, along with a possible gen ed or business class.

I have two tanks of fixed volume and a known pressure. Between these two tanks is a valve. 

Tank A at P0a and V -&gt; Tube -&gt; Valve CdA -&gt; Tube -&gt; Tank B at P0b

I also need to be able to exhaust Tank B to the atmosphere.

I need to calculate how long this valve should be open given the starting pressure of each of these tanks. I think differential mass flow **won't** be negligible, since Tank A isn't significantly larger than Tank B, so as the gas from tank A flows to tank B, the mass flow rate will decrease (enough to affect the calculation).

I'm designing the frame of a road vehicle, I'm located in Ohio where snow and road salt are prevalent. All vehicles, which are made of steel, tend to rust away into nothing in the course of 15-30 years.

One requirement (which may be unrealistic) is for there to be minimal effect of corrosion on the function and safety of the vehicle after 30 years of daily service. Ideally with no washing or maintenance of paints or surface coatings. 

Ideally, I would just make the frame out of 316 or 304 stainless - but cost and availability seem less than ideal.

Aluminum on the other hand, particularly 6061 and 6063, seem to be widely available. Structural shapes (I beams, rectangular tube, c channel, etc) of all shapes and sizes seem to be more readily available and much cheaper than 316 or even 304 stainless.

But, how will unanodized and unpainted 6061/6063 aluminum be affected by road brine induced corrosion are 30 years?

I doubts there are any direct answers to that question so instead I would like to rephrase the question: corrosion wise, how does 6061/6063 perform compared to mild steel when subject to road brine? (for driving roads) particularly when both are unpainted/uncoated/unanodized/ungalvanized/etc.

41,Ideas for an effective cooling system for my sonicator,1585262609,"Hello, I'm running a sonicator to do various extractions and emulsions in liquids. These are really cool devices that use ultrasound to create cavitation and rip open cells. The issue is that it generates a lot of heat. This is less than ideal when extracting sensitive compounds from plants. Presently I've been using dry ice to pull heat from my sample. Samples are 100-500 mL and are held in glass beakers (I know, I may upgrade to stainless at some point for thermal conductivity). I use a water-ethanol bath with the dry ice in it which gets to -40 - -20 F this works well. My samples need to stay between 35 - 50 F. However going to the store and buying a large brick of dry ice when I only need a quarter of it seems wasteful. 

I'm looking for input on a better way to cool this. I don't think a chiller is a good option for me as they're expensive and I don't have a ton of money to throw at this. 

My sonicator is rated at 250W I don't know how efficent it is but I think 100W of cooling is a possible target.

I think a DIY solution is what I'll go for. Right now I'm considering TEC cooling because its simple however I'm not sure its capable of getting to that wattage. My other plan is to deconstruct a minifridge and create a cooling system with that. I have a vacuum pump and consider myself technically capable. So I don't think creating an evaporative cooling system is too far fetched. Unless it totally is.

My question is basically is there a method of cooling I've overlooked? Do you have any thoughts on the viability of the two methods I've mentioned? Thank you for your input.",AskEngineers,False,Braeden151,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fple2x/ideas_for_an_effective_cooling_system_for_my/

43,"27 YO Engineer let go a month ago and still unemployed, what do I do from here?",1585261642,"Hello, so a bit of background I'm a 27 year old mechanical engineer living in a manufacturing hub in the Northern Midwest and I've been unemployed for about a month.  Since graduating in 2016 with a MechE degree I've had 3 jobs, the first was at an Aerospace company as a Product Engineer.  This job I enjoyed, but it was an extremely negative and stressful environment, and I got the feeling that something negative was going to happen to my department.  Sure enough 3 months after I left my department was downsized by half.  My next job was a manufacturing engineer position that I left after 10 months.  The position was not what was described, in that it was just copying data rather than the manufacturing engineer position described.  The last position I had was another Manufacturing Engineer position where after a year and 5 months my position was eliminated as part of a company reorganization.  It's also worth noting I've been in an MBA program since January of 2019, with an expected graduation date of Dec of 2021.

Since being let go I've put out between 5 and 20 job applications per day(mostly for Manufacturing Engineer or Project Manager positions), and begun studying to try to become Six Sigma Greenbelt certified in addition my coursework and trying to stay sane while practicing social distancing.  Despite all this I've found an issue getting phone interviews let alone face to face interviews.  What am I doing wrong here, and what should I be doing differently?  I'm struggling with this, I can feel my depression(I've struggled with this multiple times in my life) coming back, and it's driving me to question if my career is done.

I feel like I’m not helpful. My bosses don’t give me enough work, so often times I’ll finish and won’t have anything to do.

85,How can I negotiate starting pay with the state of the economy?,1585191367,"There's a lot of complexity in this situation so bear with me and I'll try to explain it the best I can. 

I've already received a job offer from my internship I'm working at for when I graduate. I tried to negotiate for a higher amount at the time even though it was a decent offer because I think that I'm worth it. I am the only person that knows some of the processes at my plant as well as I wouldn't have to do any on-boarding along with praises from the GM about myself and another coworker being some of the best interns that have come through. At the time I was told that they don't do negotiations and their pay scale is in the top percentile for new hires. It was a fair offer so I took it. 

Fast forward to this week. I denied an offer on Monday because it was a job I wouldn't enjoy as much as my current and they offered less. I've been working with a recruiter that reached out to me about an out of state job. The job was advertised at 80-90 starting but it was a generic reach out not to someone like myself being a student. I have the years experience that they want but because I'm a new graduate I get devalued. The recruiter has told me I'm the top choice and to expect an offer this week. The number they threw at me(non official) is north of what I got offered for my current internship but less than what it was advertised at. 

I'm really happy with it but there's a couple things to take into factor. It's out of state into a higher cost of living area. Military BAH is $1782 vs. $1131 for my current internship. I have connections where I am as in a side job and connections to get things done. Along with my local friends. I really do like my current internship a lot too. I like the company my coworkers and what I do. 

I'd only need to make $7812 more to make up for the difference in cost of living(rent only) between the places which I think I'll get that. But I still would like to stay where I am unless I get a better offer than I think. With the state of the economy is it wise to approach my internship and ask for a higher starting pay than I already agreed to? I've been laid off for 4 week because of COVID19. And to complicate things even further my company just got bought out so we are under a new name and I believe we are on a hiring freeze. Do I have any footing here? Advice? 

I would just like to get paid what I believe I'm worth and enjoy my job. I believe either opportunity I would be happy at but  each I would like more than what I'll likely get offered. I would like to use the upcoming offer as leverage to get a better offer where I'm at if it seems wise to do so.",AskEngineers,False,gome1122,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fp3xph/how_can_i_negotiate_starting_pay_with_the_state/

I originally started as a chemistry major at Carroll College due to wanting to work with nuclear power, but as my classes dragged on last semester I realized that what I really like are the overall applications of energy more, and that physics is my favorite subject, so I spent this semester with an undeclared major finishing up my CORE credits. As this semester comes to a close, I've come to the determination that what I really want to do is electrical engineering. My school does have a 3-2 program with connections to institutions such as Columbia and Notre Dame, and my GPA is good, but in doing this the 3-2 program will need to be 4-2 for me, simply due to the semesters that certain classes are offered.

On the bright side, this gives me more space to take physics classes, which I really don't see any downside in, as well as an extra writing class or two, and I'm not really worried about he extra cost due to the degree I'm seeking. However, my question is whether or not extending the time at my LA school from 3 to 4 years will affect my chances of being accepted in a program by a different school.

99,Really Trying to Figure Out What to Do,1585173555,"I feel frustrated because I have a very hard time pinning down the kind of work I am good at. I feel like I am good at a lot of particular things, but they are particular.

* I'm generally very big picture in my mindset, but I am still very precise when it comes to solving technical problems.

* I love technical design of something. I'd love to design mechanical systems, but then incorporate a strong working knowledge of electrical subsystems. I get completely sucked into the process of design, as if nothing else even matters, from the interface of something to the ""how to make it"" to the ""what systems do I have available to integrate into this thing?"" It's like a disease and I can't stop when I get involved in something design oriented. I.e. something as basic as a personal project of designing a workbench that I could use in my apartment consumed me. I ended up making a shelf that doubles as a workbench, maximizing the utility compared to the space. 

* I am highly conceptual in my thought as well, so abstract problem solving is also one of my strengths even though I have a strong mechanical aptitude.

* Strong at coding. I've seen people who are quicker, but I tended to fall in the upper tier of people in my classes whenever there was coding to be done.

* I enjoy managing people less as a taskmaster and more as an organizer, i.e. this person is particularly good at this, that person is particularly good at that, and  I can leverage those abilities towards a ""grand vision.""

* Solving problems by how things interrelate on a grander scale. I.e. paying to and predicting TRL based on my understanding of physics.

I'm just kind of in pain about this right now, I feel like I have so much to offer and do but I've just been in a situation that hasn't panned out for a couple of reasons.

My degree is a B.S. in physics, GPA wasn't that great (I have ADHD/Generalized Anxiety Disorder/Major Depressive Disorder and did a lot of slacking in school). It really stung because when I managed to be motivated, I was actually one of the better students, getting scores on exams that are well above average. Medication was working wonders too for a while, but it was also causing problematic side effects. 

I don't need meds to be a creative designer of things, and honestly they'd probably hinder that particular ability.

I've done a bit of project management in aerospace and I was a coronavirus layoff, so now I'm really just trying to figure out my new path. They liked me a lot at the last job and want to give a letter of rec and said they'd take me back if they got more work, but I want something more technical than project management. The workplace was a strong environment for me since I always felt like I had to be doing something since I was on the clock, so that made it easy to actually work, and by actually working consistently I was a solid employee. And that was doing stuff that I'm not even particularly apt for. 

I feel like I just need to get myself into a technical role that is also creative/strategic and I'll knock it out of the park.

Unfortunately I'm still a little lightweight on engineering experience, though before I got laid off they were about to give me a basic engineering project to design a test setup.

Some stuff I've thought about working towards, based on what I've mentioned:

* Mechatronics.

* Design engineering.

* Systems engineering.

The subject matter doesn't matter so much, it's literally more of the technical problem solving. I.e. from mining to manufacturing to aerospace. I'm frustrated too because I LOVE mechanical design AND I LOVE coding, and I'd love to combine those things.

I have a lot of private student debt from the previously undiagnosed medical disorders.

17,"I have my decision, however, I am curious to know what other engineers would do.",1585162084,"Hi Everyone, I hope you are well. 

I graduated from university at age 24 as a mechanical engineer, so I took 2 years longer than I should have. I got a job immediately, in a graduate program. I was with a group of 2 Diploma electrical engineers and 1 Bachelor's electrical engineer. 

I was super bored as I finished my 2 year program in 8 months and it was honestly so boring. My bosses are all electricians and we provided maintenance to the chillers and generators at a bank and also maintained their data centres. I got really bored and I could see my future and it looked bleak. Something would go wrong and I'd pick up the phone and call the vendor, they'd come fix it and done. 

Hence, I constantly looked for a job and found one (still waiting for it in writing). 

Fell inlove with the job description: 
-Pump station
-Pump and mixer selections
-FEA reports. 

Nothing compared to my previous job. However, this job is R6000 (South Africa) less in salary. 


I decided to go for the experience and take the job. Money will come but an experience like this must be worth the loss.

20,Problems coordinating with structural engineer in regards to my shop drawings,1585152508,"Hi everybody, I need a bit of advice/help.

My questions are at the end of this rant.

I'm working on new home that's being completely framed in steel.

I'm the fabricator and erector.

I have an outsourced team for the shop drawings whom I've been working with for about 10 years and I've had no issues on large steel projects until now.

&amp;#x200B;

The clients architecture and structural engineer are refusing to verify their own drawings.

At first in the beginning of January they issued stamped and signed completed structural and architectural drawings, as the weeks went by my outsourced engineer and his team who is working on the shop drawings kept finding mistakes, and the structural engineer kept sending updates as we progressed with the shop drawings. This forced us on March 9th to completely stop the shop drawings due to so many changes. 

We requested that the structural engineer and architect send us completed stamped and signed drawings. So they sent a surveyor, checked everything, marked center columns and spacing and what not.

Now we received these drawings, and we sent him some markups to verify dimensions.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what he said:

 \-Please provide shop drawings signed and stamped by your engineer.  Sorry, these are the rules. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get it anymore, the structural engineer along with his architect doesn't review the mark ups that we sent him and doesn't confirm to anything...

&amp;#x200B;

From what I'm understanding is he wants us to complete all of the shop drawings (which we can't due to some unverified beams/columns/ dimensions) sign and stamp them and send to him?

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, who's responsible for verifying dimensions and confirming to existing drawings and why?

Is this standard practice in Canada to send all the shop drawings stamped and signed first? and then the structural engineer reviews and confirms everything?

What action can I take if the structural engineer is still refusing or ignoring my mark up requests?

So, I've been at my company for a year, and my wife is a month away from delivering our first child. Our doctor told me that I cannot go to ANY meetings since if either one of us caught the virus, my wife would have to deliver the baby without me, and then our baby would have to be quarantined from us for 2 weeks after birth. 

I work in manufacturing, and my duties are 50% production support on the floor and 50% office/admin. This meant I have to attend production stand up meetings every morning. Normally this would be no biggie since I'm a part of the leadership and need to be visible, but since the doctor told us to isolate ourselves, I have sent out emails giving out my phone number to all the supervisors and managers, stating that I'm available 15 hours a day via phone, and will be on site 50% of the time and working from home 50% of the time. Our company is asking managers to advocate working from home as much as possible, which most managers have done - engineering office is a ghost town - while production keeps going. Policy is fair enough.

Now this is where my manager has asked his team of 10+ engineers to remain on site as much as possible, and that engineers still attend production meetings in person to ""show visibility"". Now, even without going to the meeting, I am still on site and running around at least half the day. I sent an email saying I'm 100% on board with supporting production, but I simply can't go to the meetings in person. So he pulls his boss into the email chain, who told us we have to be there to support our operations for business needs. 

Today in an email response to the company COVID policy update, where the managers were concluding that the company has ""eliminated in person meetings"", I said that my manager is still forcing everyone to be physically present. Now our CEO emailed me back saying they will support my decision to stay home, and to talk to my manager and HR to figure out the details. I haven't spoken to my manager since.

I have several emails saved where I have informed production people of my schedule and intention to be present but avoid meetings, emails where I explain why I cannot risk going to meetings every day, as well as emails where my manager keeps asking me to be on site. I can't get a doctor's note explicitly saying I can't be on site since I'm not a patient at my wife's OB, and my own doctor can't do it since I'm a young, healthy male who's low risk. The note we got from the wife's OB says I have to practice distancing, but not specifically meetings. 

I'm not sure if this is a bad situation I've created for myself and if so what I should do, but I think my reasons are justified - I don't want to risk not being able to take care of our child for the first 2 weeks of her life because of an unsympathetic manager from work, but at the same time I do need the job to pay bills. Almost everyone on the team is questioning the manager's decisions, and I intend to find a different job as soon as our child is born and the society calms down.

I saw at the store they sell swivel hooks which use a couple lag bolts to attach directly underneath a ceiling joist. I made my own for two reasons... 1) the ones at the store are almost $30. 2) I'm very handy and have lots of hardware laying around. My landlord is worried that when I hang the bag it will be too much for the garage joist to handle. She is also worried that the bag moving around will cause damage to the garage door or the garage door opener. The hanger I built is almost centered in the garage from front to back and is about 6 feet in from the side wall. It's not in the way at all for the garage door to fully open. Here's is how I built the hanger... I screwed (2) 2x4's together and have them spanning axrossed the top of two ceiling joists with a couple inches sticking out past the edge of the joist on each end. I secured the doubled 2x4s to the joists using 3"" wood screws down through the 2x4s and Into the top of the joists. Before I put the 2x4s together I notched a small rectangular shaped hole in the center of the bottom 2x4 and placed a 3"" mounting ring through the rectangular hole leaving the plate which the ring goes through (which is approx 3"" square with 4 holes for mounting using screws) on top of the bottom 2x4. Then I placed the top 2x4 over the lower 2x4 and plate and screwed them together. Then on the underside the ring sticks out approx 1"" and I attached chain rated for 200lbs doubled up using 2 caribeaners rated for 150lb each. The chain extends down approx 2 feet and has 2 carbinears attached at the bottom which then attach to the 4 chains coming from the punching bag which j have not actually hung yet. Also at the top caribeaners I attahcced another length of chain which extends to each of the two joists, go over the top of them comes down the other side and is attached to said joists with large screws. I did this in case in extremely rare chance that the mounting ring which is rated for a couple hundred lbs were to break. I'm just hoping an engineer will give his or her blessing that the joists will definitely support this and that it won't somehow damage the garage door or garage door opener so I can show my landlord.

From my experience with these IMUs so far, it seems to be the case that the mounting matrix is a transformation that's applied to the vectors that the IMU generates, whether it be accel, gyro, etc. For example, the IMU generates a set (is this called a vector?) of raw accelerometer data, XYZ. The API from InvenSense then takes this raw data, applies the transformation (which in the ICM20948 is stored as a quaternion unit), then passes the new accel data set to the main application. 

new accel = Q0 \* v \* Q0', where Q0' is the conjugate of Q0

The thing that I'd like some help on is how this applies to the game rotation vector. The GRV, from what I've seen, is a 6-axis quaternion value based on accelerometer and gyroscope readings. Based on the above observation, I assume that the same process would be done to these readings so that the resulting quaternions are in reference to the body orientation, and not the IMU orientation. 

Would this mean that I just multiply the raw quaternion readings with the quaternion unit that the IMU holds the matrix in? Q0 \* Q1

Or do I treat that readings like I would the accel data? Q0 \* q \* Q0'?

47,Advice for struggling intern?,1585100667,"Hey guys. I'm an electrical engineering student, currently in 4th yr.

He wants to make some visors to give out to the people on the ground, and asked me for advice. I have access to a 3D printer, but I figured it will take too long to print a dozen or two of the parts for these visors, so I suggested he get one printed, and then make several silicone molds, and start casting them in resin to scale up the production. This is what he wants to make.

51,Can we redesign the ventilator for this epidemic ?,1585094491,"I don't have any engineering experience or much medical knowledge but I understand the basic principle of a ventilator, this idea may be stupid but I'd love to know if it's been considered.


The scenes i've seen in Italy and in other places around the world from the past few weeks are showing a big issue involving both a lack of space and equipment. Multiple people in rooms on seperate ventilators spilling out into the waiting areas and corridors of hospitals.  


Until now ventilators have been designed to treat individual patients, (as it should be). However it's clear to see now that if enough people don't get access to ventilators this is what will eventually lead to more deaths. 


The government announced today about NHS nightingale, a pop up hospital in the excel centre. If we can redesign the model of a typical hospital for this epidemic, can we temporarily redesign the way we use ventilators. 


Rather than building thousands of small individual ventilators assigned to each patient in each bay, would it not be possible to have a bigger single ventilator in the center of 4 or 5 beds with multiple breathing tubes coming from the central machine. Along with dividers to keep patients apart.  Id have thought this would lead to less materials overall but more patients gaining access to a ventilator.

83,quaternion based quadcopter / drone - PID controller,1585059184,"Hello everyone :)

What am I trying to do? - I'm building an attitude controller and I'm trying to understand how to derive the error angle between the desired angle to the current angle - So it will work even with big angles like upside down or with large angles that not necessarily close to the hover angle.

At the moment with a PID controller, I managed to make the quadcopter angular rate 0. And for adjusting the attitude and make the drone hover I'm changing the angular rate by calculating the error between the current angle to the hover angle (0,0,z). 

That works well for small angles (angle &lt; 60 degrees ) close to the hover angle but I want the controller to manage to derive the error even when the quadcopter is upside down or doing a loop. The error will be used later to determine how much power to send to each motor.

Because of that now I'm changing the code from Euler angles based calculation to Quaternions which should be faster and work better for 3D rotations. How can I determine the error between the current state to the hover state (q = 1,0,0,0) with quaternions?  - and it should work for large angles.

88,Is it normal to feel this way as a graduate engineer?,1585052797,"Hello everyone I have been working as a graduate civil engineer for half year now here in Australia and I am very confused about my situation, please help:

1. My job is to assist my supervisor with civil tenders, so I usually look through the project documents, do materials takeoff, contact subcontractors, chase up quotes, do a price comparison, and send everything over to my supervisor to sum up the price with labour, plant... and submit. The thing is, our company as a demolition company has not been doing a lot of civil jobs, and as far as I know I am the only one who is doing civil takeoff. But of course they want to start getting these jobs. My supervisor (a project manager not a civil estimator) has a lot of other obligations and I have not been able to get a lot of feedback or been told a lot of details or insights. Sometimes my supervisor doesn't even have the time to actually look at what I have put together and submit the tender. And since we don't have enough experience or an actual civil estimator in the office, most of the time if I'm unsure about things I would have to use google (for example look for subcontractors through google) or learn from the feedback from subcontractors (cuz they got confused by the RFQ I sent them). I have been involved in around 15-20 tenders so far (mostly bulk earthworks, foundations) and we have not won any of them yet. To be honest I am worried that I will not be able to grow as much as I need to staying here, or not be able to gain the confidence and knowledge to move forward to another company. Of course I know as long as I want to I can always find things or ways to learn, and I don't hate what I'm doing really. But the tenders just come one after another and I am already doing my best finishing what I have to do. I wanna know if most graduate engineers would usually have to figure out things by themselves like this? Or it's just I'm not good enough to get things quickly.
2. I'm confused about my working hours as well. It says I'm suppose to work 38hrs per week on my contract and that's what I have been following. I start at 8 and finish at 4 if there is nothing to rush. A lot of times I do need to stay longer, the latest until 5:45 as I remembered, if there is something needs to be done. There were twice that I had to work during weekends at home when there was too much to do ( not that anyone told me to, but my supervisor did mention once ""so if you have any free time......"", then helped me setting up remote access from home after I asked). I thought I have been working for enough hours (maybe even overtime) but only today I figured out (heard from our receptionist) my supervisor thinks I have been leaving early. I did notice most of the people leave around 4:30, but I thought I didn't have to take my lunch break (figured out today I have to take it by law). I had doubt before about the time to finish work and have asked around, but no one has given me a clear statement ever. I always say goodbye to my supervisor when I leave but was never told to stay. There was one time after I've just finished a task given to me and thought great I'm leaving on time today. When I was saying goodbye as always my supervisor said ""so you're leaving early?"", I was a bit confused and asked ""what I'm suppose to leave at 4 right?""  ""no I'm joking haha see ya"". Looking back now why didn't my supervisor say anything then? There has been a few occasions that I have to deal with my personal stuff and required to leave early or leave for a couple of hours during work. But I always let him know no matter he is in the office or not (just as my supervisor told me to) and have always made up the hours before or after. And it's been half year now why couldn't my supervisor just call me in and correct me if I have been working under hours? And today I asked a few of my coworkers, one said ""yeah it's 38 for me too but they're like you work 9 hours a day but when things happen say if you're late or you need to go to a doctor they'd pretty flexible"". Another guy just started last month has 40hrs on his contract.

I really don't mind if I need to work more, and I really want to improve and do a good job. If there is opportunity, I also want to be an architect in the future so I think what I'm doing now it's very useful. I know it all takes time and I would have to repeat things so many times to be good at it, so I'm not planning on giving it up or change a direction in my career. But right now I feel like I am a bit stuck and very confused about the workplace culture. Also I'm I the person who complains too much and doesn't do the job?!

90,HELP: UV Light Sterilization &amp; N95 Masks (Healthcare Worker),1585049000,"Hello,

I am an ER doctor and as many of you may have heard there is a severe mask shortage that is putting all healthcare workers at risk for infection. We are essentially at the point where we are reusing N95 masks after leaving them to dry out in a bag for 3-4 days/baking in an oven (70C).

My shop is exploring the possibility of rigging up a box with UV lamps to sterilize them; however, we were cautioned against this as there is a possibility that: ""N95 masks can be degraded by UV light because it damages the electrostatic charges in the polypropylene material. It is unclear how long the masks can be exposed to UV light before they are ineffective"". 

Reportedly this is from the N95 manufacturer, however, we are getting desperate for quick and efficient methods to turn around masks and we would like clarification for what this REALLY means for us practically (we are wayyy past official recommendations/approvals). 

1. Do you think UV sterilization would impede the filtration capabilities of the mask? 
2. Assuming both UV light and subjecting the mask to heat (oven) both eventually would degrade a mask - which do you think would preserve its life the longest?

Please let me know whatever you think!

I will try to keep this short..I graduated with a B.Eng and specialized in water resources engineering and I've been working in the professional services industry for \~2 years.

I want to pursue post graduate education and I am stuck between the M.Eng, MEM, and MBA routes as followed:

1. M.Eng - This program would be a civil program and I would take an additional certificate in finance/management. This program would allow me to broaden my technical knowledge and skills (I am quite interested in infrastructure planning, urban/smart city planning) while gaining a couple courses in business which is what I am looking for. In this route, maybe I'd pursue an MBA later in my career and hopefully get an employer to help with the tuition.
2. MEM - Great program which seems to bridge business and management for engineers. Problem is, not many options in Canada and if I pursue a program in the states it might be so expensive the ROI is not the greatest. 
3. MBA - Seems like a good way to gain a lot of business and management knowledge/skills/networks but very expensive and wonder if it is premature to pursue an MBA with only \~2 years of experience.

21,What could explain the presence of oxygen in this sample of (what I presume to be) A36 structural steel?,1584992494,"Here's an XEDS spectrum of the sample in question, merely identified as an ""iron-rich particle"":  [https://imgur.com/a/7qHiuEW](https://imgur.com/a/7qHiuEW)   


Would oxidation introduce this amount of oxygen into the steel—even if the steel is actively a part of a building and has therefore been coated in the appropriate protective paints and so forth?  


From what I can find, A36 steel doesn't have oxygen in it to begin with ( [https://www.theworldmaterial.com/astm-a36-steel/](https://www.theworldmaterial.com/astm-a36-steel/) ). So that's the best explanation I can come up with. But, if this *is* the explanation, wouldn't we expect the steel to be reddish due to oxidation? Or can oxygen be introduced into the steel without turning it very red?  


Here's why I ask, in case you're curious: One 9/11 truther argument is that red/gray chips were found in the debris which are actually ""thermite"" that was used to bring down the building. My counter-argument is that no, this is merely the reddish paint that was applied to the steel before the building construction, and the gray side of the chips are just part of the steel that flaked off with them.  


For this explanation to work, the molecular composition of the steel used in the building would have to match that of the gray side of the chips. The spectra of both are nearly identical, but what I'm struggling to explain is, where did the oxygen come from?

23,Would it be possible to sinter complex shapes ceramics in water vapor plasma with flash sintering or use liquid metal/liquid glass to apply isostatic pressure and perform flash sintering in that environment?,1584990226,"I have been research for a week and have not been able to come up with any bold ideas for my proposal. th a professor which is the last class I needed to graduate this semester to move into my full time job across the country. However, my university halted all research activities so now my professor is wanting me to write a 7-10 NSF proposal in under a month. The topic he wants it to be on is one step formation of high temperature conductive ceramics in complex geometries. He wants a main proposal concept and a small backup one in case the first one fails. 

I have been researching for 2 weeks and have not been able to come up with any concrete ideas for my proposal. I was looking into papers on how people use plasma generated in water to create nanoparticles and wondered if it would be feasible to apply this concept into sintering. By having my complex part acting as an electrode in water, it could generate a thin layer of water vapor around it as it heats up and then generate plasma around the part. At the same time, applying pressure from the top into the water, to create a isostatic pressure environment so the heating is uniform. I have read papers that say some adsorption of water into the ceramic part actually aids in the sintering as the water will increase the conductivity of the ceramic. 

Another idea I had was would it be possible to use liquid metal/liquid glass to create the isostatic environment for the complex part and then have the current run through the part to generate the internal heating that is needed for flash sintering. 

My back-up idea was to use a cnc machine to machine the green body or the graphite punch that applies uniaxial pressure in our sintering set-up with complex shapes/geometries and then flash sinter to see how the resolution is. 

I have been looking for other ideas but nothing is sticking to my head and my professor says that if my proposal is not of decent quality I will fail and lose my full-time job offer.

34,High-efficiency vacuum motors for automotive flow benches,1584982745,"I've been looking into flow benches for automotive work recently, and have been considering rolling my own as a way to learn and also save a huge amount of $.

Other than overall system design, the largest present bottleneck seems to be power consumption.

For those of us with wimpy 120V mains voltage, a high power flow bench capable of testing reasonably high flow low-end motorsport parts can quickly approach somewhere in the region of 100A of current draw on startup, and a continuous draw of &gt;50A.

From what I've been able to tell, the highest efficiency vacuum motors out there that are generally used in this application top out around 40% efficiency.

Is this really as good as air movers get? This is not my area of expertise, so if this is the state of the art I'll just accept that it is what it is and move on.

See here for the most commonly used motors, which are generally considered to be the best reasonably priced option available: https://www.centralvacuummotor.com/flowbench.htm

To throw some numbers at it, let's say I want to flow something like 600 CFM (~283 L/sec) at 44"" suction (~1118 mm H2O). Higher suction would be very much better, but I'll take what I can get.

Are there better or more efficient ways of skinning this cat than stuffing 8 of the 119563-120 units in a box and telling them to all suck as hard as they can at the same time?

39,"Confused about connecting Laplace transforms to transfer functions, any help?",1584973618,"Hello, I'm learning about Laplace transforms and transfer functions, for simple control theory. I think I get the main idea but I'm getting stuck on some physical intuition details.

For a simple undamped mass on a spring example, I get the idea behind setting up Newton's 2nd law to give us m\*x''(t) = -k\*x(t) + u(t), where u(t) is the input and x is the position, and then rearranging, taking the Laplace transform, and rearranging again to get:

G(s) = x(s)/u(s) = 1/(m\*s\^2 + k)

and I understand the idea that this is the response of the system to an impulse, i.e., Dirac Delta (t), or just u(s) = 1. My trouble is when I try connecting it back to my physical intuition for the system. For ex, I know that if we drive the system at the resonant frequency, w = sqrt(k/m), then it should be unstable and diverge, and I see that that freq corresponds to the poles, s = +-j\*sqrt(k/m), in the s-plane.

Here are my main questions:

1. If we assume we just hit the system with the actual impulse, like a sharp quick hit, my intuition is that it should oscillate forever at the resonant frequency, the one above. But the transfer equation is telling me that x(s) = G(s)\*u(s) = G(s), which has components at all values of s. I know that to get the actual time domain representation we'd take the inverse Laplace transform of this, and I'm sure it would tell us that it's just cos(w\*t) or whatever, but what does it mean that it has amplitudes in the s-domain at other values of s? For ex, for s = -4 + 2\*j, G(s) != 0, so that means it has some component of exp(-4\*t)\*cos(2\*t), right? I assume the inverse LT cancels all these components out but I'm still confused about the physical meaning.  

2. Similarly, if we apply just a step function, u(t) = 1 for t&gt;=0 and u(t) = 0 otherwise, the LT of this is u(s) = 1/s, which has components for all s. So if we apply this to the same system, it seems like it should be ""hitting"" the values of the poles some amount, which makes me think the system would have to diverge, but intuitively that doesn't happen (just pushing a constant amount on a spring doesn't cause it to explode). Is it the same idea somehow, like the parts at the poles cancel out?  

3. If we have a spring system with a damping force b\*x'(t) now, that becomes b\*s in the denominator of the TF. As b increases from 0, the pole moves off the j\*w axis in the s-plane, so it'll be some value with negative sigma and pos/neg w. I see the math there I think, but intuitively it feels strange to me that if the pole were at, for ex, s = -2 + 3\*j, then \*that\* value of s would cause the damped system to diverge, but the same driving force but without the exponentially decreasing component, so just s = 3\*j, wouldn't...why is that?

41,Seeking Career/ Work Advice (Engineering),1584972597,"  

Hello all,  
 

Several months ago I created a post regarding my unhappiness at my place of employment.  
I’ve made some changes since then, and, surprise!, I am back at square one.  
I’m not going to mention the companies that I’ve worked at, but what I’ll say is this, these are one of the most desirable places to work for, especially if you are an engineer. As bad as it seemed at the time, I’ve completed one of my goals (bucket list), so at least I have that going for me.  
 

I quit company A after a total of six months due to personal, health related reasons (and monotonous tasks). Work was not as boring as it seemed, but it could definitely be more engaging. I don’t think that I’ve burned any bridges, but the manager “seemed” upset that I left so soon (six months) after he stuck out his neck for me, and that’s completely understandable.  


Now, I’m working for company B, it has been a month so far, and let’s just say that I’m not impressed.  
Work is still within my career path, just a different field. 

The issue is, I really want to go back to my previous company. I know I’m not giving the new place a chance, but I really dislike the culture and place. My team seems to be engaging, but again, I’m not impressed.  
It might also be fear of not performing to acceptable standards. Everyone here, company B, is very knowledgeable. It feels as they are on another level of engineering, very impressive, but also intimidating when you come off the street as a new hire with little to no knowledge of the procedures or skills necessary to perform required tasks (I have no idea what I’m doing and feel like an idiot most of the time).  
 

Other issue that I’ve noticed is, I feel like I’m burned out from engineering. I love science, don’t get me wrong on that, but I just don’t find the actual engineering work interesting anymore (i.e.: who cares?). It looks that I prefer academics to an actual real-world work. This of course affects my goal list, since I wanted to get a Master’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering, but again, what’s the point if I’m not going to stick around it or work in it (I’ve made career related goals few years ago, and just dropping them off seems like I’m giving up and not giving this field a shot).

Should I write an e-mail asking for a position at my previous place of employment? Or should I stick around here for a little bit more? Or should I just try something different for a little while? I dislike dropping engineering since I gave about three years of my life to work in the field, and approximately five years of university work.  
 

Please throw me some opinions/ suggestions cause I’m currently at a loss right now and need to get myself moving in the right direction since I’m not getting any younger. I’m also very close to just saying, f!@# it and quitting w/o anything lined up.  
 

TLDR.: I dislike my new job, and possibly feel burned out from engineering. Should I ask for my old position, or get out of this field temporarily, if need be, permanently?

56,Second Bachelors vs Boston U's LEAP program for engineering?,1584943869,"Hello engineers of Reddit! I could really use some advice! Thanks in advance!

I have always been interested in engineering. I started college as an engineering major, but switched after the first semester for various reasons. I am about to graduate with a degree in Economics. After completing some internships in economics, talking with professors, industry, etc. I don't think econ is for me. I would like to get back on the engineering path again, and am considering a second bachelors or masters for non engineers. I am specifically interested in aerospace engineering (or mechanical with an aerospace focus).

My question is, should I get a second bachelors or do a program like Boston University's LEAP, which allows non engineering majors to get their masters in engineering after taking some undergrad prereq courses? 

A few things to note: I am a Colorado resident, and would like to attend CU Boulder if I go the second bachelors route. Also, by the time I start an engineering degree, I will have completed Calc I, II, and III, Physics I and II, and Chem I and II. Based on the website and other things I've read, LEAP would take me about 2ish years to complete while the second bachelors would likely take closer to 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Does having a masters in engineering but not a bachelors set off red flags for employers? Does not having the technical bachelors undermine the credibility of the masters?
2. In term of job prospects, would a masters in MechE from Boston be better than the bachelors from CU?

I have lots of interesting opportunities to work on spacecraft subsystems, both physically and theoretically, and I am told I am good at my job.

I´m a 20 year old male starting my undergraduate career at a State College in South Florida with the goal of transferring to a University (either Texas A &amp;M or University of Florida but leaning UF). I have considered many majors, some of them engineering disciplines but I am currently set on Chemical Engineering. Unfortunately, I am not starting at Calc. 1 but at the lowest math, ¨Developmental  Mathematics¨ AKA remedial math and will be taking Intermediate Algebra next after passing my current math course which is on hold due to obvious reasons. I feel it will take me at least 3 years to catch up, then pass Calc. 1-3 and linear algebra plus physics and chemistry courses. I have the gen ed courses to take on top of the engineering pre-reqs, which is why I´m calculating I´ll be in the state college at least 3 years before seeing the University. Can I risk burning out? With say an English or Economics major I would do 2 years at my state college and two at the university and then I´m done.  After graduation my goal is either:

&amp;#x200B;

A.) Go to Law School to become a patent attorney.

B.) Do a post-bacc year or Special Masters Program followed by medical school. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I choose B. an engineering degree is not necessary but if I do A. I need the engineering degree (that or a P.h.D in a science discipline but I prefer a BS in engineering).

Of course shortening the width would be much harder as you would have to swap out or re-weld the whole suspension in order for it to fit. At the minimum, what tools would you need to do something like this? If done properly, would this ruin any structural integrity to the vehicle?

6,[Advice on Engineering Mathematics],1584820532,"So,
I started to study Differential Equations on my own, since I will start Electrical Engineering in September.
- Books I am using: Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 6th Edition by Dennis G. Zill. However, for the DiffEqs themselves, I kinda use Differential Equations with Boundary-Value Problems, 9th Edition, by the same author.

It's a loooot of stuff, so, I'd like to know what topics are the most important ones, so I could give them an extra emphasis. 
I mean, in the real word, what do we find the most? 
Those nonlinear higher order DEs that we can only solve with MATLAB, for example? Because if that's the case, one should focus on Numerical Methods, maybe. 
Or do we also find first-order ones, for which we can use the specified methods? (Linear DE, Substitution, Separable Eqs, etc...) 

- I know that Laplace and the Fourier Integral Transforms will be of great importance. Is that what I should actually focus on? 

- Should I dig deep into PDEs or is that something for a Grad Student? 
I mean, my degree is a normal one, BEng and I was checking the MIT Material and I didn't see that much of PDEs (apart for some simple Fourier Transform stuff), so I was wondering whether that is something I should focus on atm(as an undergrad). 

- I am already aware of MATLAB. I will learn that once I am done with the C++ online course I am taking. 

So, my question is basically, what is the most important stuff I will have in my degree that I will also encounter in the real world applications? 
Is it Higher Order DEs? Is it System of Linear ODEs? 
Is it DEs that I will solve using Laplace and Fourier Methods? This kind of stuff. 

Some extra info:
-I am brazilian, but live in German and will study ,,dually"" - So, I will study and work at the same time. 
- I will work for Siemens and my Business Unit is Smart Infrastructures (I will have a lot to do with Building Automation and Optimisation of Elect. Energy use)
-This is the official part. But one also has Hobbies. Mine are Robotics. So, you guys may consider that when stating your opinions. 
I want to be a robotics engineer later on. (I don't mean having a Robotics Engineer degree. I just would like to be able to build my own silly stuff haha.)
-And yeah, as you see, I don't have much of a personal life, am pretty fine with that and spend most of my time on online learning(can't pay for physical stuff as of now. The lil money I get is spent on books and online courses) 
-At the moment I am studying Electrical Circuits (Book by Charles Alexander and Sadiku), C++ on Udemy (Tim Buchalka's Course), Arduino (but this is something I use to practice my knowledge acquired in the first two courses mentioned) and as I said, Engineering Mathematics. Thats what I learning atm.

I am a bit of a noob at engineering so please excuse my lack of correct terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all, first post. 

&amp;#x200B;

Short Version: I feel like my chemical engineering degree is great for designing things with the high level knowledge I gained (e.g. heat and mass transfer, fluid mecahnics, process control etc) but I have no clue on how to make and build the things I design myself. I would like to build some a[lgae photobioreactors](https://www.google.com/search?q=algae+photobioreactor&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enAU731AU732&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02TtFyBzj9D83Evcm6KS9e4fFdFng:1584779091353&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjE-qWWkqvoAhXtILcAHaj4AY0Q_AUoAXoECA4QAw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=585) \- but not sure on how to piece together materials (e.g. plastic / glass), weld things, do basic programming (arduino? PLC?).

Should I enrol in a trades degree part time? Any advice on self teaching? I've never used power tools or machinery. I want to become more practical.   


Background:

I graduated in Chemical Engineering a few years ago and worked as a Project and Process engineer in a few different manufacturing factories (food/beverages &amp; personal care products like deodorants/shampoo) for a few years. I did a few projects where I designed factory upgrades, but the mechanical fitters and electricians basically did all the building for me, and my electrical engineering colleague did the programming. 

I then decided I want to work on sustaianble tech. So I started a PhD working on algae biotech (trying to make bioplastics from algae biomass). I have some cool ideas for photobioreactors (transparent reactors that grow algae by allowing sunlight to penetrate the liquid medium full of nutrients) - but I want to build prototypes myself. I am not a very hands on person, but want to change this. I want to build and tinker but for example, I wouldn't know how to cut wood, weld metal etc for myself.

How can I bridge this gap and become a better engineer? I feel like I'm all theory, and I feel embarassed by this. I wouldn't be able to tinker around with my car engine or fix a broken pump myself.

Any advice on what to do? I feel like a trades school (mech eng / electrical eng) would be useful and I would get trained up on different equipment. However, it would not be tailored to what I need to know - though I feel like I need a foundation anyway. Or should I try just learn online? I don't have own any tools myself though.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for your help in advance.

34,What is the expectation of a newly hired Field Engineer on the first few weeks of the job? I am just starting a new job and feel as if I'm expected to know everything.,1584755999," Firstly sorry for the long post, i tried to give as much detail as i could to make my question clearer. TLDR at the bottom. 

 It is currently my second week on a large civil projectas a Field Engineer. Firstly, my first two weeks have started out during the Covid -19 pandemic and i have logged a total of 110 hours while my site super has been self isolating for 100 of 110 of those hours. 

 The first week the assistant super has had me attempt to memorize every detail and drawing of the 22 floors of building we will be erecting, if i ask any questions he will not answer with anything of use and will just say ""i don't know everything"", leaving me to fend for myself. Now i would not mind this if it wasn't for the fact he has me doing his job as well, i am measuring and ordering concrete, finding the specified mix types and strength, dealing with emails i have no business dealing with, organizing large pours and locating material he had shipped to site, forgot to log and lost, while he surveys! (An aspect of the job i should be doing), i have also been logging all material tickets, legal documentation on inspections and filing it in the complicated system they haven't had a second to explain to me.   

 Tomorrow on saturday we are working. I have scheduled in a large pour, that he expects myself and a co-op student to be there to coordinate. He will be there too though, so I'm not sure why he would need our help, or expect us to coordinate. 

 Granted, I understand the fact that its a tremendous opportunity for me to show my worth at this company, but i can't help but feel like I'm being thrown into the fire with no direction, and my first instinct is to think that maybe i am being set up to fail. I haven't received any pens, paper, books or anything to log notes in, i had to buy those myself because when i asked they just said ""we don't have any"". 

Oh and im making 16$ an hour after all is said and done these past two weeks because i am salaried while having to pay 115$ per 2 weeks to get to work by transit. 

 Can anyone explain to me what should be expected of a straight out of college field engineer like myself? And am i over reacting or am i being thrown into a fire? I would like to change the dynamic we have to make everything more efficient but i am not sure where to start.  

TLDR: I am, in my opinion doing the job of the assistant super (Ordering Material, coordinating trades to schedule work, making emails &amp; being forced to make emails) while the assistant super does what i expected to be my job (surveying, data management, and miscellaneous work.) When i ask questions, i am told that he ""doesn't know everything"" and basically tells me to figure it out myself. All this while our site super is ""working from home"" due to going out of the country during the covid-19 pandemic.

I am working out a project for our farm where I’d like to pull equipment out of the mud. 
When I arrive I’ll lower my blade into the dirt and start winching. I’ll move towards the equipment first but by pushing dirt with the blade I become heavier than the force needed to pull the tractor with seeder.

I calculated the newton needed to be between 6800N and 27,250N (at 0.25 - 0.5 m/s) but that’s assuming I need to pull the full weight and I don’t think that that accounts for lack of friction with wheels and the tractor helping as well.

I’d guess lessening of frictions by wheels is offset by the wheels pushing mud but my question to you is how do I account for the tractor helping to move?

43,How to Make a Skateboard Propel Forward with no electricity?,1584730716,"What if, instead of either pushing off with a skateboard (and falling on your ass countless times) or buying a ridiculously expensive electric skateboard with no controller, you could simply bounce on your board to propel the wheels forward? Many longboards and skateboards have thin frames that add bounce, so is it possible to transfer that energy with no electricity? 

My first ideas were a pump mechanism such as what a salad spinner uses (possibly called a spiral plunger?). The corkscrew could spin and go downwards as the board is pushed down, and the board would slowly come back up as the wheels spin until all the energy is released. Another question that arises would be how to transfer that spinning energy to the wheels in an effective way. Would gears under the board, belt, or chains work of some sort? Or would too much energy be lost? Pumping down on the board has been used in many carving longboards to make the boards go faster, but that requires skill and moving side to side to pick up speed. Is there any possible way the energy from simply pumping or bouncing down on a skateboard could possibly make the wheels go faster? Not sure if the spiral mechanism would work. 

I would love to try this out by trial and error and eventually create one myself, but I just can't wrap my head around what mechanism could accomplish spinning the wheels. Friction motor maybe?

I'm fortunate and grateful that I have a job and have little worry of losing it, but unfortunately have been identified as critical staff, and required to be at the plant to support the process line.

I'm pretty stressed, but my company has stepped up cleaning (public areas cleaned every 2-3 hours), and mandated telecommuting for non-essential staff, so the office where my cubicle is fairly empty. I also have guidance to minimize my exposure to the shop floor, but I'm still expected to execute my projects which requires coordinating with contractors and the shop floor. 

The guidance from the federal and local government is pretty unclear, we definitely have at least 200+ people on the shop floor, but workstations are pretty far apart, about 10ft at least in our process line. People are not on top of each other.

59,I Quit My Job With Nothing Lined Up,1584712272,"Hey all,  
  
I recently quit my job (with two weeks notice) with nothing lined up (for more thorough background feel free to read my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerchange/comments/fhofmi/i_quit_my_job_with_nothing_lined_up_no_longer/)) - I live in the US and worked as a process engineer for almost 2 years. In a nutshell, the company I just left was incredibly and massively toxic and miserable. Every day my heart would just race just by sitting at my desk, and I'd silently have panic attacks almost on a daily basis. I just couldn't take it anymore. Call me entitled, lazy, or whatever. But I'm in this situation now and I don't regret it.  
  
Since then, this coronavirus thing has gotten crazier and I'm fairly certain that a lot of companies are either not interviewing at the moment or are even having hiring freezes. I have a couple of questions that I'd love to gain your perspectives on:  
  
1. **How should I format my resume/cover letter?** Do I eliminate the mention of months in my times of employment in my resume? If I continue to list ""Present"" as the ""End Date"" of my most recent place of work on my resume, that would be lying... I'm tempted to say that I've been laid off instead of quitting, because hiring managers might find that to be in a more positive light? Or if I do say that I quit, I should say that I quit for personal reasons to take care of family, and that my responsibilities to my family have gotten more time-consuming as the months went by and I ultimately had to take off from work? Or something like that... Either way, I will definitely wrap up whatever my explanation is with a positive and reassuring note that my life is stable now, everything is okay, and that I am 100% committed and eager to get back into engineering work (or whatever).  
  
2. I'm also not opposed to applying for technician positions, especially if they're in the industries that I'd like to break into (electronics manufacturing, fiber optics, medical devices). Would my applications for these positions be automatically thrown away if they see that I have engineering experience? The way I see it, technicians are usually the ones with the actual practical knowledge of how things work and get done, so I would actually enjoy breaking into one of these industries by gaining this direct and valuable experience. **How do you suggest that I approach applying to these technician positions?**  
  
3. How many of you are in the same/similar situation as I am? What are your approaches to this?  
  
Again, I might be coming off as entitled or something, but I really couldn't take being in this company any more. I know I made this decision and put this upon myself, but I would really appreciate your advice and insight.

 Our team created the non-electronic earplugs with the stepless noise control for those who are tired of this constant noise around: in office, at home, on the street

When closed, earplugs drown out many annoying sounds: a working coffee machine, a kettle, knocking on doors, steps of colleagues, noise from the road, etc.

When opened, the noise is practically not drowned, so that you do not have to remove the ear plugs every time.

In intermediate states, the noise is not completely drowned out, but it becomes quieter to one degree or another.

Noise reduction is regulated due to the rotation of the wheel, comparable to volume control on a tape recorder.

75,Interviewing elsewhere after signing an offer,1584673495,"This is a bit convoluted, but here’s the situation:

I recently graduated and was recruited by two companies, company 1 and company 2. I’ve previously interned at company 1, I loved it, my manager and I have stayed tight, and I wanted to go back. Soon before graduating they posted an opening that was perfect for me. I applied and contacted my old manager, and the next two months involved him saying he would reach out week after week and blaming HR for the hold up, and eventually saying there was a hire freeze until the end of the year. January, I reach out again for updates, and he says he’ll move forward, but still nothing. Soon after, I land an interview with company 2, let company 1 know my timeline is tighter, and finally 1 schedules an interview. I interview with both, company 2 is awesome, I land an offer, let company 1 know again that I have X deadline to consider an offer from them, after still hearing nothing out of them. They don’t make the deadline to my disappointment. Mind you I’ve been trying to move forward with this position now for 5 months. I accept with a signature company 2s offer, and don’t hear from company 1 anymore. 

I was prepping to move to start my job in a few weeks. Due to the virus, company 2 just contacted me saying they had to push  
back my start date a couple of months. I very much fear the possibility of getting laid off before I even start. Company 2, being a more medium sized and less profitable company, is less financially stable than the large conglomerate that is company 1. Now today, I get an email from company 1 saying my manager has been traveling for a long time and they’d still like to move forward with my candidacy if I’m still interested. I haven’t responded yet. 

Is it unethical to go forward with interviewing with company 1 even though I’ve signed another offer for the sake of a back up plan if I get laid off from company 2?

1. How clean does it have to be? Everyone I talked to hasn't been able to give a measurable amount of cleanliness. Answers have ranged from bare metal to hit it with some 200 grit. Our product engineer found the phosphate doesn't really impact the Loctite adhesion. The splines will be masked during powder coating and supposedly those masks are 100% effective but whether they'll be 100% effective in a year is a big question. The print only gives a diameter on the press fit and a surface finish, which I can set up to check but it doesn't really say anything about cleanliness. All our internal specs mostly deal with cleanliness of hydraulic systems which are orders of magnitude cleaner than this has to be. 
1. How do I check that it's clean? It seems like a visual inspection should be more than enough but the powers that be don't care for that and would rather not see it on the PFMEA. Having no spec to check against makes it extra difficult.

Main structure is made of 4x4's sunk 3 feet in concrete with a platform of 5' x 7"".  Adjacent and attached to the 7' side of this structure will be 2 more 4x4's which I was going to also sink in concrete and install vertically, with a 10 foot run to the other end with 2 more 4x4's sunk in.

93,Tidal vs Wind: How intermittent is wind?,1584645021,"Take power available to a wind or tidal turbine as P = 0.5\*ρ\*A\*v\^3. Considering the density of water vs air, a tidal turbine in water of the same size as a wind turbine in air would have more power available for extraction, even factoring in faster wind speeds.

Take an onshore wind turbine of diameter 100m (area \~8000m\^2) working at 15m/s wind speed. For a tidal turbine in a typical tidal current of about 2.5m/s, it needs to be 50m in diameter (area \~2000m\^2) to have the same power available to it.

We know that tidal turbines are much smaller than this. 

So I'm wondering, how much does the variable nature of wind / the reliable nature of tidal energy mean even when a tidal turbine is made much smaller than 50m in diameter it is actually still competetive against such a large wind turbine? I'm finding typical tidal turbines to have higher capacities than typical wind turbines. Is this because the rating for a wind turbine has to be an average number, and the nature of wind is so intermittent that this number ends up below that of a tidal turbine we know to be much smaller than the above? Or are the capacities given for wind turbines assuming optimum performance, and the reality is even worse?!

Or, have I got my numbers completely off, and wind speed of 15m/s is too generous? If we reduce to 10m/s, the tidal turbine only needs to be 27m in diameter, which is still larger than I've seen.",AskEngineers,False,pastiehands,/r/AskEngineers/comments/flfqiw/tidal_vs_wind_how_intermittent_is_wind/

I have been following a guide about the calculation of supply pressure for a closed loop system but it seems to be wrong according to a friend of mine.  
[https://imgur.com/a/OMCLDiy](https://imgur.com/a/OMCLDiy)  


According to a guide I was following,  


1. The required pressure for Point B is the sum of Pressure loss in the vertical pipe and the Outlet pressure required in point A  
B = A + Pressure loss  


2. The pressure in Point C is the pressure in Point B added by the pressure loss in the Pipe BC  


3. For the pressure in point F, Choose which of the two points has higher pressure (D and C)  


4. Continue what you are doing until you reach the supply area.  


I am having some doubts in this guide since according to what I have read, by installing a closed loop piping system I am supposed to get a lower supply pressure required.  


Each outlet requires 50psi or 300+ KPa and by following the guide above I have solved that this system requires 3000+ KPa.  


Can anyone please discuss how a closed loop piping system works and how to solve the supply pressure?

19,Feeling really discouraged as an EE undergrad that is supposedly graduating in July.,1584581769,"I have a daunting feeling that I'm gonna be a crappy engineer with a lack of creativity in this domain. I know that Analog Designers (what I aspire to call myself someday) must be creative and be able to think outside the box. But here's the problem:

I often feel like an idiot discovering common knowledge. I am in the top 10% of my specialization and I definitely do not feel like I am there. How am I supposed to know when to efficiently use a capacitor/inductor if in these God forsaken 4 years of EE no one has ever told us how to design a schematic. We only solved problems like robots.

Sure, I think I am able to learn how to use those (I know as a matter of fact how to use capacitors for filtering DC, filters and decoupling, or so I think I do), but I am ashamed of not already knowing this. Who's gonna hire me this way? Of course, I will try to read even more on Analog (planning on Razavi this summer). I acknowledge the fact that you are not supposed to be a walking textbook, but still... When I figure out that I am missing a ""common piece of knowledge"" that I was supposed to know it makes me feel really intimidated because of the thought of other potential ""pieces"" that I do not know about.

The only thing I know is to identify transistor stages, current mirrors, a little bit of digital gates and how to choose dimensions for them, I'd say amplifiers but that's a stretch (I am familiar with A, B, AB classes), transistor behaviour, how to use laboratory instruments, a little about microcontrollers and that's pretty much it. I have had an internship in testing. I enjoyed working in the lab but my mentor did not like me. Whenever I asked him a question he looked weird at me like I was asking what colour a banana has. I think I did well there, but they did not offer me a job afterwards. When I find an op-amp in a circuit I rarely even know what its purpose is if it's not connected as one of the textbook examples (inverting/non-inverting, summing, log, integrating, etc). I have some software skills and by that I mean algorithms, mainly C, matlab and verilog. I think, I think I have a good understanding of the pn junctions and of the crossection of a mosfet. 

I do not know. I feel like me being in the 4th year of EE as a top of the class student is a big joke.

I usually answer a lot during classes and I do it well, but even though this, I feel like it is not enough. I am aware of the impostor syndrome. It feels s****y.

I only feel good about myself when I receive a good grade but that's only for a little while before realizing I actually know nothing about that field and only the basis.

Sure, I was a TA in analog integrated circuits. Don't ask me how. I felt, ugh, not deserving to be there and teaching those kids anything and I don't know if I did a good job. I was offered to be a TA in digital integrated circuits as well. Sounds good and promising. What am I even victimizing myself here about? Well the thing is: I bet that if I were to interview for an Analog or Digital job in the field I would mess up big time by not knowing how to answer or what to answer because of not having that knowledge or by not realizing how to do something easy on the spot and actually feeling stupid. I feel that my classmates that did not understand these classes as well as I did would perform better than me.

If only I had been given a chance at a job in this domain it would have meant the world to me. But I haven't been given it.

Teachers really like me and think highly of me, which usually puts even more pressure on my shoulders and I am ashamed to tell them that I feel the opposite.

I wanted to quit University last summer. I don't want to be a dipshit with a degree, I want to be an engineer.

It doesn't need to move each that quickly or in perfect sync. I know linear actuators exist but they are fairly expensive, so I am looking for alternatives.

I'm currently in my last year of secondary school, about to face my exams and unsure as to which of my offers I should accept for university (I'm going to uni in the UK so I have to declare my major upon applying). I have spent the last few months mulling over my decision, read and watched every advice thread and video about mechanical v.s. materials engineering, but I'm still torn.

My Manager has been difficult to say the least in terms of laying out requirements for this project. I've drafted a requirements document and I worked with the rest of the engineers on the team to make sure the requirements include their needs for the board.

My Manager really could care less about the requirements, and I can't design a project at all without a set of requirements.

55,New career path in Control/Automation/Industrial Engineering - need advice,1584505230,"This is a little long. Thank you ahead of time for helping me out.

A little background on me to start, I've been in various IT systems and operations roles for very large cloud environments and Fortune 500 companies. Cloud, data center, virtualization, networking, storage programing. I also never bothered getting a degree of any kind. I've always has an interest in Automation Engineering, and have managed to land a Control System Analyst job and a large mining operation. The role/team seems to be 50/50 Instrumentation &amp; Electrical and IT systems engineering supporting the DCS/PLC/SCADA workstations, servers, and industrial networking. They're going to train me on this, and I'm also working on a A.S. Industrial Electronics &amp; Electrical from Penn Foster that I'll hopefully turn into a B.S. Electronics Engineering Technology from Grantham University. A nationally accredited (versus regional like a State U) isn't likely to impact my career in anyway, especially with an ABET certified program. I don't care about EE vs EET or going to a better on campus state school at this point in my career. 

I am very much done with working in corporate IT or general IT overall, and would like a new challenge.

First piece of advice I would like, does this seem to be an effective way to transition to Control/Automation Engineering? How well does my IT Systems Engineering background transfer? I already make pay range between $75k-$90K in jobs I've had, so I'd rather not have to back track to entry or mid level IA/Control jobs paying much less that that. I see some IA/Controls positions with $120k-$150k or more. Between my IT background, the current Control System role I've beginning and Industrial Electrical, Electronics, and EET does this seem like an attainable goal?

Second, how much hands-on, in the trenches are IA/Controls troubleshooting, soldering, running wire, fixing motors or robotics, etc. I would not rate my hands on mechanical ability as being exceptional and was just wondering if technicians handle that or engineers. I am competent enough, can and will improve this skill, I'd just like to gauge how good I'll need to be.

Third, I may pursue a regionally accredited Master's degree to mitigate having two nationally accredited degrees as some employers may be a stickler about the requirements. An ABET and regional accreditation would balance each other out somewhat, especially if the master's is related. Unfortunately, with the national accredited BS my regional options are limited to SNHU, APU, WGU an a few others. I can't get an engineering MS, but I would like one to complement engineering. My list:

1. MS Logistics/SCM/Operations Management - This could maybe give me a similar education as Industrial Engineering Technology program 
2. MS Information Technology - IT Networking, Software Development, Data Analytics
3. MS Data Analytics - Python, SAS, SQL data analytics program
4. MS IT Management - Technical Leadership degree. MBA lite + technical
5. MS Project Management - Project Management focused MS
6. MBA - Really not interested in a business or management style role, but perhaps it could be a good one

There are others that could be useful. As I said, I'd like to augment the IA/Controls/EET background. Logistics especially, the goal of creating a ""Industrial Engineering lite"" sort of thing.

68,"""How Do I ethically transfer jobs"" - post-lawyer consult update!",1584490428,"Thank all of you that joined the conversation in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/fegr2a/how_do_i_ethically_transfer_jobs/) in which I was concerned about IP and legal issues related to switching jobs to a company that does similar work to my current employer.  I got some legal advice on the topic and here is the update:

* Expert legal advice for your particular situation is critical - many details of your Non-compete and Non-disclosure will affect your unique situation. All you need to do is look for someone who does ""Employment Law"" and get a consult
* In my particular situation the lawyer recommended *full disclosure to both parties* \- both my current employer and my new employer - in the event that an offer for new employment is made and I accept it (in no circumstance should you let your current employer know you are looking for another job, of course)
* Before a job offer is made from New Company, take your NDA/NC to their hiring manager and their in-house legal team. Fully disclose the terms of your current agreement so everyone understands the situation
* In fully disclosing to both parties my intent to change employers, lawyer recommended I seek signed indemnity from both parties: from my current employer a statement that if I abide by terms of the NDA/NC they will seek no damages; from new employer that if I accept employment I have indemnity from any legal action that could be potentially taken against them. In legalese this is just doing the right thing and making sure ""everyone is ok"" with the situation. This advice answered my biggest question, I think. Lawyer recommended it was a good idea to bring them into this indemnity process should the situation arise
* Non-competes usually have a time limit - mine was stated in my NC form. Legal advice was to not even work on something similar to items covered in your NDA/NC until after the period specified in your NC
* Whether your work is patented or in-process of being patented doesn't really change the equation. Listing titles of patents-in-process in your resume/CV is fine. 
* In the event that somehow all your best efforts fail and action is taken against you, you want to make damn sure you have no company materials in your possession. (You shouldn't have these items in your possession anyway) This means even if you worked from home time to time and you had company documents on your computer, it is a good idea to have an ""expert"" erase those files and document it. If you have workbooks/lab notebooks in your possession, well, you REALLY need to give those back to your company before you leave
* A final tidbit - usually your NC will have some item related to the idea that the NC can't prevent you from finding a job. You really don't want to violate NC based on this because now you will have to prove in a court of law that it was impossible for you to find a job elsewhere. Doesn't sound fun - not a clause that is often relevant but I'm mentioning this because I felt it was interesting

Putting a bow on all of this, speaking to the lawyer really calmed my nerves about the whole situation and both ethically and legally, I now know the correct action to take and things are much clearer.

69,Any good (fee) alternatives to PLM?,1584489698,"So my company seems to have a problem with file management. We have solidworks PDM with a workflow, but only the design engineers can see it. Manufacturing, purchasing, quality... nobody else can see PDM. Then we also have Sharepoint, but not everybody knows how to use that, and the file tree is a big mess. When we’re done with a design release we zip up a bunch of PDFs and an excel file and email a link to the folks who need it. This is inconvenient, but not as bad as when people are just emailing files around and not using the latest versions. To top it off, some random person went around deleting files the other day and we’re losing time trying to recover what they deleted and find it all. 

So, other than getting a PLM system is there some sort of way that we could keep track of where in sharepoint a file is located, what it’s for, if it’s the correct version, and that sort of thing? I’m picturing some sort of a shared room excel sheet, though I’m not sure how to make that navigable for dozens of people and many thousands of files.

1,My complete disagreement electric car with no gearbox.,1584446960,"&amp;#x200B;

I will never agree that electric car dont need gearbox here are my points

1) Yes it can run without gearbox but how efficently???

yes tesla is running fine actually in my opinion not fine

So lets  compare bmw m5 f10 which have lot worse coefficient of drag i think around 0.33 or more and tesla p100d if I remeber around 0.22 weight is very similar but it doesnt matter so much for acceleration at high speeds because then much important is coefficient of drag

So tesla have around 620wheel horse power my m5 which was tuned to 720bhp crank should have very similar wheel horse power so definitely not more. 

Here are stats for high acceleration speeds

100-200 tesla 8 seconds my m5 6 seconds!!!!

Now crazy part 200-250 tesla 11 seconds !!!! my m5 6!!!! with more shitty aerodynamics .

If tesla had gearbox they could do better than 6 seconds both these tests definitely. Maybe dont need 

7 speeds but say 3 or 4 speed.

I know electric motors have torque from zero but torque is nothing without RPM!!!

10rpmsX700nm torque is 7000 but at 10000rpmx700nm (just theoretical example)  now you see how much power we got :)

If it was available with 1st gear at 60km/h all avalable rpms and torque it would have fantsatic power then switch to 2nd gear and continue :)

With high gear motor cant spin fast and cant produce all available power instantly its just plain physics.  If it was say 7 speed sequential gearbox it could very quickly spn to its 18000rmp get to 70km/h then next gear etc. Question is how many speeds we need I think 7 would be too much but at least 3 would be nice or even 4 or 5 depends how much more expensive then is gearbox. 

yes its doing ok till 100 but with huge expense for large motors crazy expensive inverters large batteries etc etc, with 7 speed sequential gearbox even 200kw  motor could probabaly do very close to these numbers  from 0-100 they run away from one problem but create other with huge batteries additional weight etc etc.  Yes this gearbox is expensive but so are electric motors and batteries.

Most popular answers I always read is that electric car dont need gearbox because of these reasons:

1) Electric motor have instant torque it doesnt stall yes but torques is nothing wihout rpm torque plus rpm create power. It can run wihout gearbox but not so fast.

Yes it loose efficiency with gearbox  for around 10% but as you see in my stats lost perfomance in acceleraton far exceed these losses. 

tesla is not efficient for sure at high speeds like 160+km/h towing uphilll etc ect all because of geariing in my opinion. One gear will never be enough for all situations.

My solution and I ask your opinion about it:

1st front electric motor is optimised for different speeds as rear motors with around 70% diffrence.

Basically its optimised for highway speed at around 130km/h 

Rear motor gear ratio is optimised for low city speeds and fast acceleration and at high cruise speed we can swith it off.

This alone would be already very nice improvemnt 

Then more advanced version simple 3 gear manual or sequential gearbox for rear I dont think its super expensive . 

First of all customer driver can drive without chnaging gears car could do it but if you want fun and situation asks you can switch gears.

Here is interesting thought and question:

Maybe we dont even need clutch because for petrol engines we need clutch because we cant turn off ice engine evey time we switch gear with electric motor it would be very simple. when we switch gear electric motor is discnnected and when gear engaged we continue accelerate. I dont think 3 or 4 gear manual gearbox is super expensive for 50000usd car. If you want drive effiecntly ok drive with front motor which is directly attached to wheels then you have slower acceleration want drive faster engage rear motor swith gears etc. 5 or 6 speed sequential gearbox cost around 7K with 3 gears I think should be less and with smaller power requirements. Maybe it would be 3K or 4K but then we can make smaller electric motor which will consume less smaller battery less weight and more effiecient. I more than sure single gearing is not good for range also especially at high speeds.

Im just imagining in my mind attaching lets say 500kw leectric motor before my m5 dct gearbox and out gearbox in 7th gear there is ni way it accelerate very fast. Now lets put gearbox in 1st gear it will accelerate to 140km/h and then revs super high rmp and consume shit load of power...

truth is somwhere in middle I think electric car dont need 7 speeds but 3 or 4 for sure. Even if we forget acceleration and how much we loose time between switching gears for towing high speed very small speed city driving it should be usable. I think consumption also is too much even in city because it much harder to accelerate say imganibale 3rd gear rather than 1st gear 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

P.P.S Im not trying to make from myself now super clever god but its rather opinion and question maybe im wrong if so prove it with NUMBERS AND MATH eg engineeering explained  on yotube but even this guy didnt proved it with his formulas.. just repeating same nonsense like everyone else we dont neet gearbox because negine dont stall and torque available from 0 rpm 

BS BS BS and again BS

now ok lets imagine BMW diesel car with 500nm perfect diesel engine which have all 500nm available not from 2000rpm but from 0 I would still use gars because engine at 1000rpmx500nm torque will get less power  compared to 2000rpmX500nm at 100rpm and 500nm it have very little power

not just repeating thory from other people...

[P.PS](https://P.PS) because what I see everyone usually is like a sheep if one did this I continue without even analyzing or thinking deeper... I have feeling it happens on much larger scale not only for normal people... 

It took so many years until we came to electrc car but batteries were there aready very long time and duing last years there is not so huge chnages in abttery tehnology.

Another example it took almost 30 years for someone to figure out simple thing about aerodynamic wings in formula 1 racing when technology was already there - I mane wings in planes just neeed for cars to do in opposite direction... = downforce :)

It is very confusing for me because now I don’t know what is the one shown in the pump curve characteristic Q-H curve (flow vs. height).
Static head or pressure head? 


Please do not copy-paste Wikipedia because I already read the concepts and could’t grasp the idea entirely that’s why I am asking here.

Pump head is a function of:

* Static head or Elevation head (HS)  /The static head is the 'lift' on the discharge side plus the 'lift' on the suction side. Static head measures the total vertical distance that a pump raises water. It has two components: static lift and static discharge. The static head of a pump is the maximum height (pressure) it can deliver.

* Pressure head (Hp)

* Dynamic head (HV) / due to the motion of a fluid (kinetic energy)

* Friction loss head (HF) /is due to the frictional forces acting against a fluid's motion by the container/

Also know that if you want to calculate head you use the following formula.

*Head pressure in international units*

H= P/ρg
Head (meters)= Pressure/density •gravity 

*Head pressure in imperial units*

Head(feed)= 2.31•P/ Sp. gr

Conversion factor= 2.31
P=Pressure
Specific gravity= Sp. gr

Pressure which is depended on density can be calculating by rearranging the formulas above.

Pump head is a constant property while pump pressure depends upon the liquid specific gravity.",AskEngineers,False,ealdorwolf,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fjoydc/what_is_the_difference_between_static_head_and/

38,Help a Physician Make a PAPR for COVID-19,1584377906,"(Cross post from r/hackaday with external links removed)

I am a physician practicing in Northern Virginia. My office is seeing possible COVID-19 cases daily, and I identified a positive case last week despite extremely restrictive testing criteria. We have run out of personal protective equipment for my staff and I am writing to request help with a possible solution.

I placed orders with every vendor I could for respirators in early January as soon as I heard of the outbreak in China, but these were cancelled and diverted to the hospital. We are currently down to a just a few days' supply of masks. Two of my staff do not pass a fit test for any N95 masks, and so even if we had a sufficient supply, this wouldn't work for them. As the CDC has removed the requirements for airborne protection for healthcare workers, our corporate leadership has refused to help us.

I have two ideas for how I can protect my staff.

1.  Adapting an Older PAPR  
I found an older [3M Breathe Easy PAPR](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/437283O/breathe-easy-rbe-for-responders-powered-air-purifying-respirator-systems.pdf) in good condition, but all the batteries I can find are too old and the replacement filters are prohibitively expensive. To get this to work, I need to figure out:  
\- A replacement power source that I can plug into the power supply on the PAPR  
\- A way to adapt the respirator's filters to fit more commonly available filters, such as the [3M™ Organic Vapor Cartridge/Filter 60921](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Organic-Vapor-Cartridge-Filter-60921-P100-60-EA-Case/?N=5002385+3294780264&amp;rt=rud)
2. Creating a PAPR  
I have also created a [homebrew PAPR](https://imgur.com/gallery/jPrXFXl) from a paint hood, a[lithium powered air pump rated to run for 10 minutes (I could plausibly handle a case in that time period), and a spare filter. For this to work I need:  
\- A quieter air pump  
\- A way to secure the filter to the pump (if it dislodges in an affected room it would contaminate the inside of the pump)

I'd love your thoughts on either of these. Neither of these devices is going to have the pressures or flow rate measured, and of course it won't be tested and approved by any agency, but as our alternative is to use a surgical mask, anything we can come up that's patient-appropriate with will be safer.

I have an experiment we are running which involves catching a very heavy object moving very fast with industrial nets. 


This item weighs 90 pounds, and is moving at 340 ft/s. I initially had some issues with units which is why I deleted the old post and posted a new one. 

Here's my math:

I'm using the basic KE impact force equation. F*distance=.5*m*v^2. So F= all that divided by distance.

Here are my numbers:

F=(0.5)*(2.79 slugs)*(340^2)/3.28 ft.

I calculated the mass in English units to be in slugs (90/32.2). 
I used 3.28 feet as the distance to make it an even 1 meter for my SI calculation double check.

When considering all of this, I get:

F=49,165 lbf, 
where the units are slug*ft/s^2 (which I believe is lbf)

So I test this by doing the same in SI:
Weight=90 lb= 400.34 Newtons
Velocity= 340 ft/s= 103 m/s
Mass= 40.82 kg

So I do the same thing.... 
F=(.5)*(40.82)*(103^2)/1 

Where 1 is 1 meter.

F=216,529 Newtons. My units end up being kg*m/s^2.

So this translates to a force of 48,677 lbf. 

So these numbers are very close. However, a netting company estimated the impact force to be over 350,000 lbf. 

This seems extremely high. I want to make sure that my numbers are correct before presenting this to be the correct impact force. 

Can someone look over these numbers and tell me what they think?


370,000 lbf seems extremely high. Even for a 90 lb object moving over 200 mph. I want to make sure that my calculations are correct before I say why I think the impact force is 10x lower than a company estimate.

55,Planning to start a rocket club in my uni as an undergrad petro eng student,1584335774," Hi. So before I give my explanation for my decision, I just want to give you guys a heads up about this decision of mine. First of all, I'm a petro eng student. However, I want to get a job that is related to rocketry as that is where my interest has diverted now. I did some research regarding this here on ask engineers but also other online forums. The conclusion that I have to come is that yes, it is possible for me to get a job as a petro eng grad in a rocket related job (however I will have to polish my personal skills and some of the technical skills such as the basics of engineering i.e. the strength of materials, thermodynamics etcetera). Therefore, to achieve both of these, in an efficient way (or at least that's what I think of), I have decided to start a rocket club at my uni. This would help me in accomplishing these goals that I just mentioned now.

Below I have listed the pros and cons of my decision:

Pros:

1 - Leadership

2 - Able to learn rocket math and rocket related software and skills.

3 - Improve the impressions about rocketry in my country

4 - Strengthen other engineering fields in my uni by the creation of rocket club as it would involve help from telecommunication, mechatronics, electronic etcetera.

Cons:

1 - Challenge in managing studies with the rocket club stuff (but when there is a will, there should be a way).

2 - Tight daily schedule. One thing missed. The whole thing in the air lol

These are all the pros and cons that I could think of now, you guys can let me know perhaps more about pros and especially cons when starting one from your experience or your friend's experience. Also looking at these pros and cons, would you also suggest an alternative way to mine for me to accomplish my goals or what I am thinking to do is a good decision in your opinion?

My main reason for starting one is to hit multiple targets at once such as leadership skills, communication skills, rocketry related skills etcetera.

&amp;nbsp;

The issue with turning my current bed into a murphy bed would be the weight and height of the bed itself and the adjustable base. Currently the bed weighs about 300lbs and is about 27 inches tall. 

I’ve been messing around in sketchup to make a [3D model of my house](https://i.imgur.com/IwXdYno.png) and also coming up with designs for the bed

Here are some photos of my current design for the frame to hold the bed and base. [frame w/o bed](https://i.imgur.com/wvGpkxL.png), [underside](https://i.imgur.com/sknBGRx.png), [w/ bed &amp; side pannels](https://i.imgur.com/JjF0uy2.png),[frame blown up](https://i.imgur.com/a7uR4TU.png).

&amp;nbsp;

I have no idea if the above would be over designed or under designed or how I would even figure that out. When I designed the frame I based it off of using 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/16 wall aluminum square tube and I have no idea if that would be strong enough or not. While designing the frame in the pictures above I made it so that I would be able to swap out the top section of the bed in case I end up getting a different frame or mattress with a different height. I was designing it so that I could adjust it from 20 inches to 30 inches in height. 

Another thing that I am not too sure of is what type of system I could use for lifting the bed, I was thinking that I would need to use hydraulics. I also have no idea if that would be the right way to lift the bed and what type of safety mechanism it has incase it was to fail.

**Job 1:**

My first option is basically staying with my current company and being reassigned to a different project. It would involve relocation, which has a maximum reimbursement of $1500 because the move is less than 100 miles. 

The pros of this option are moving to an area with a significantly lower cost of living, a workspace that was just renovated less than a year ago, in building cafeteria, in the summer with food trucks, and working a reverse engineering job. In the interview I got along really well with the person that would be my boss, and several co-workers on the team are already people I know. It's also at a company where I have experience with their processes.

My salary would be $57,000/yr, which adjusted to the cost of living (taxes, rent, etc) where option 2 is would be $63,000-$67,000 per year. It is a contract position with an indefinite contract period and uncertain long term placement outlook. Previously I got a performance bonus of $2700 and a raise of $4300 after a year of work. An additional benefit is that this option is a lot easier to find workshop space for woodworking which is a hobby of mine and a reasonable way of making cash on the side.

To a certain extent I also feel a sense of honor in staying with this company. They paid me full salary for basically a month for doing nothing while looking for a new project for me. I'm worried leaving could burn bridges. Despite working for this company being not the best, the co-workers have been extremely good and very helpful with helping me to learn in my early career.

**Job 2:**

A quality engineer role that would not require me to move. Unlike option 1 I don't know who my coworkers would be or even what the work environment looks like. With the coronavirus situation it was an interview done via skype with a manager working from home. It is in quality and manufacturing support and the pay would be $66,000 per year. It is a job through Aerotek and I've heard their long term placement outlooks are a lot more stable than my current company.

There are a lot of unknowns in this job, but the money is a lot better and I don't have to move.

A reasonable benefit to this job is that it stays 2 hours closer to family. Admittedly one of those trips is still a 9-10 hours car drive away even when living closer.

Job 1 I have to make a decision by Monday, Job 2 I don't yet have a offer I have only been told that they still have to interview another candidtate but they my odds of getting an offer are really good.",AskEngineers,False,Tankninja1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fj6daq/having_a_tough_time_deciding_between_jobs/
79,Masters vs Bachelors Degree,1584298265,"Hi all, I’m currently an engineering student at my local community college planning on getting my bachelors in materials engineering, but in the process of looking at universities to transfer to I’ve come across JHU’s duel enrollment program that boasts finishing a masters in 1 year after completing their bachelors program. Hopkins was already becoming my first choice for transfer (although possibly a bit of a reach), and after learning about this program I’m even more interested. 

Ideally, I’d like to finish my bachelors in materials engineering, and then get a masters in biomed engineering (I have yet to confirm if this is a possible option, but it seems like it should be). 

What I’m curious about is others experiences with a bachelors vs a masters degree (exactly how beneficial or necessary it is or isn’t in the work force), and also the pros and cons others have experienced in selecting different fields for the two degrees. 🙂",AskEngineers,False,rockthatboat,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fj6anc/masters_vs_bachelors_degree/

I graduated from Chemical Engineering in 2017 and am lucky to in IT consulting since then. Many of my friends, who stayed in pure engineering, are looking to move to what I'm doing because of (A) volatile industry and (B) lack of career progression. I'm kind of surprised because I have always been a little jealous of them because they're working in what they graduated in. So my question is - should I feel bad about staying in IT?

My head is about to explode as I can't figure this out, I've tried different setups for 4 days and I'm defeated.


I included a very professional [diagram](https://i.imgur.com/zuOG7Rh.png)
My old electric water heater died, and I installed a new one that doesn't deliver water at all when you open a hot water tap.


It's placed in the same place than the older one, with one exception, it's a little bit higher (about 20cm) and it's an horizontal model instead of a vertical one.


The interior of the heater has 2 ""pipes"" at different heights, the cold one that enters is lower than the hot one that exits. It is possible that the wall pipe that feeds it with water is now a little lower than the top of this internal pipes, but I upgraded the water pump and It should not have any problem (it can go as high as 45m and the distance from the pump to the heater is barely 15m with less than 10m in height.)


I have yet to plug the heater because it sais in the manual that you first have to open a hot water tap, let the air go out, and once water it starts flowing, then plug it. But water never flows from the hot tap.


It's been more than 2 weeks since I had my last hot shower. Please help me figure this out!

97,Why is lightweight concrete not that popular/used extensively for buildings?,1584271863,"Background: I am doing a dissertation on a hybrid sample of lightweight mortar by using polystyrene (as lightweight aggregate) and phase change materials. From what I know so far, LWC doesn't have good thermal mass and I hope to prove that phase change materials could counter that. 

Phase change materials absorb/ release heat to change phase. So in summer, PCMs would absorb heat and keep the ambient temperature within the comfortable range. It is different from other systems of storing heat as PCMs store latent energy and not sensible heat energy.

To introduce the topic, I was describing how buildings use too much energy for heating/cooling and that it is cheaper to reduce this need for energy than to produce more energy. After thinking more about it, it only describes why PCMs are being added and nothing about the link to lightweight concrete. 

I believe that I should focus more on lightweight concrete but I do not know why it is not as common as a building material. I did some quick research online and I could not really find out exactly why it is bad. 

TLDR: Do you have any experience with Lightweight concrete and can tell me what is wrong with it and why it is not replacing normal concrete instead? (Other than the massive decrease in compressive/flexural strength) I am not looking to use it as load-bearing members if the strength is the only argument.",AskEngineers,False,Harunoooo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fj0039/why_is_lightweight_concrete_not_that_popularused/

Hi guys,

I was wondering if I could get some advice on where to start with the following problem.

Context - I have a piece of equipment generating heat inside a metal housing.

Problem - need to determine the steady state air temperature of air inside metal housing

Known -

* no forced convection
* inside air is of known humidity and starting temperature
* inside air volume is known
* metal housing material / geometry is known
* metal housing conducts away heat to ambient air of 20 C (room temp),
* heat generation of equipment in Watts is given

What equations or relations would be a good starting point here?

Before this role, I got an MS in Physics in which my thesis project involved C++ and parallel programming, and worked a few months in machine learning freelance roles.

In my current role, it's 100% work remotely, but I have to stay in the US. I've mostly worked on image processing with Matlab, but have also worked with C++ a little, along with Python for deep learning. I've just started on a project using OpenMP. My current salary is $100K/yr, but the base salary will be increased 10% and I'll also get a bonus of around $15K-20K per year starting in about a month from now.

I like the job in that I get to work from home, my boss is alright, and the work is challenging enough but not too stressful. The downside is I don't really have teammates or a mentor to work with as I mostly only communicate with my supervisor, so maybe my professional growth has been limited. I'm also concerned about my career as I've spent so much time in this role using Matlab that I haven't gotten to use that much C++, Python, ML, and DL.
