0,Chemical Engineering and Computer Science Dual Major,1589745468,"I'm entering my last year as a student majoring chemical engineering. I am also working towards a minor in computer science because I find it interesting and some programming skills can't go amiss. I only have 4 classes left - 2 chemical engineering and 2 computer science - to finish my declared studies, but they have to be spread out over a whole year (because of when they are offered). 

As a bit more background, I have already interned with 3 companies over a cumulative year and a half and studied abroad in 2 countries. I don't really need more work experience and I'm eager to finish my degree. 

I have 2 possible courses of action:

I can be a part time student for the year and try to find work to pay the bills and fill my free time. Getting a job may be challenging in the current circumstances and near my school. I'm not sure how being a part time student impacts my existing loans, but I do think I'd be able to avoid taking out more loans.

I could, if I pushed myself and took 1-2 summer classes, finish a computer science major too. It would be a bit of a crunch, but I've had hard semesters before. I would definitely have to take out more loans to pay for the next year full time.

Is it worth the extra cost and effort to finish a computer science major also? Are there any other options I should look into?

9,Micromanager causing high turnover - What recourse should be done to reduce?,1589738189,"So I'm currently being loaned out to a different thermal group than I'm actually in on paper and have been for the past 6 months. This group is 10-15 people, but for the previous 3 years, it was no greater than 12. The turnover in this group is very high, in my opinion, and I believe the root cause is the managers management style. At his core, he is a micromanager who cares more about optics and perception than the actual work being done. For reference, in the last two years he has been the section manager, he has had 3 people leave the company entirely and 1 person change to a different group. I didn't work there when the other 3 left, but the members who knew them stated they left primarily because the managers overbearing and untrusting nature became too much for them.

At this current point in time, I know 2 of the remaining 13 members are searching for new jobs and 1 is looking to change groups. Now, being essentially a rental, I don't have to deal with as much flak, as I could ask for a reassignment and get moved in a matter of weeks, so he needs me more than I need him at the moment. Some examples of his past antics are as follows;

1. Monitoring people on skype and making sure their time on Skype reflects what they enter into their time cards
2. Weekly meetings with a PowerPoint presentation showing what assignments you had, what work was accomplished, and what progress you plan in the week. This generally is an hour long meeting and the PowerPoint takes an hour or so to construct on average 
3. General over monitoring of his subordinates. This involves walking by desks to make sure you are there, calling you to make sure you're available, and sometimes holding more meetings to see what you have done today.
4. Daily progress review meetings that take 15-30 minutes 

So, I should mention this standard is not held by everyone. Generally the 40+ year old employees or ones with 10+ years in the section do not have to do most of this. So, I fit into the category of younger employees with less time in the company. Recently, an intern turned employee asked me if this is normal, and I decided to be honest with them and tell them that, no this generally overbearing and is probably a direct cause of the high turnover. He has asked me to be a reference as he seeks different groups to join or if he decides to leave the company altogether. 

So, my question for the managers, HR, or anyone else that had a similar situation is what can be done to overcome this? Your manager is the biggest hurdle in promotions, raises, and general advancement in the company. If you cause them problems, those goals become even harder. In the past, I had a discussion with him that this reflects poorly on his trust for employees and creates negative repercussions. He basically responded with ""this is how we have always done it"". I know this is untrue because most managers I work with don't do anything like this. Maybe a daily section meeting were each person does 2-3 minutes of talking, but nothing like his meetings and daily reviews. My main worry is the high turnover is reducing experienced talent and it is making larger projects harder to handle. This is one of the core reasons I'm looking to move on.",AskEngineers,False,dreadknot65,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gljxrc/micromanager_causing_high_turnover_what_recourse/

My Dad is a Civil engineer and for the longest time I wanted to be a civil engineer.  But as I got older I started taking things apart, and putting stuff back together.  My Dad got me an apprenticeship with his friend as an Automechanic and I loved it.  I decided that I wanted to try for a mechanical engineering degree.  I know that a degree opens me up for a spectrum of opportunities as far as jobs go where I get to work with different types of things.  And I am fascinated by how they all work.

20,Design a cam and lever arm system: Way to calculate lift duration of lever?,1589721704,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a ME by training so please bear with me. I'm trying to design a cam and lever system where the cam is acting on a lever to operate a mechanism on the other side. Here's two pictures of the setup I drew ([https://imgur.com/a/M5ioVY8](https://imgur.com/a/M5ioVY8)). 

&amp;#x200B;

Circle 1 is the cam follower, and circle 2 is the cam. I'm interested in the theta of circle 1 as a function of theta of circle 2.  The cam is quite simple (semi-circle with a triangle on the other side). The issue I'm having is that a) the cam comes into contact with the lever at multiple points as opposed to a more typical cam follower and b) the lever pivots.  I'm also trying to control the duration that the lever is lifted by using a follower shown in the second image, and it is adding another layer of difficulty in calculating it. Are there resources for calculating or modeling a cam system such as this? Up to this point I have been playing a game of trial and error which each piece I 3D print, but it has been slow and hasn't given me the results I'm looking for. Most resources I've found are concerned with designing the cam and assuming a follower which contacts the cam at one point, whereas this is more the opposite.

Some components have a COTS item selected as a baseline - I collect the mass from the manufacturer or from the spec sheet.

For the mechanical components I don't trust the CAD mass properties. At the present we only have the concept CAD; a lot of this shows solid volumes where there should be internal structure. For those parts we should be developing in-house I have estimates using basic geometry. For the parts I plan to subcontract, I've created a mass properties worksheet for the supplier to fill out.

I'd like something more sophistocated to track the design's mass and confidence interval over time. It would be good having the option to input a 10% confidence 'best case' mass, a nominal mass, and a 90% confidence 'worst case' mass, and then either calculate the results or have a Monte Carlo to show an overall confidence interval. Or maybe to show the 'possible' mass saving options to trade those options against cost (like going with composite materials or smaller COTS devices). I'm not sure how to implement this.

25,Most relevant Masters degree for someone trying to pursue work within the UN (B.S. in EnvE)?,1589715939,"I am a recent environmental engineering graduate who works at a consulting company doing soft civil/water related projects. I'm still trying to figure out the career path I want to take but I know I don't want to pursue a PhD. 

In general, my ultimate career goal is to work internationally in developing countries and specialize in water resources engineering related projects. My B.S. was heavily focused on surface and wastewater treatment. I'm ""teeter-tottering"" between getting my masters in a more narrow EnvE subject but recently the idea of pursuing a MPH has been floating around. My apprehension with pursuing a MS in EnvE is that I'm just going to pigeonhole myself in a niche topic, pay a boatload of money for a masters only to not pursue academia and instead work in industry which is ultimately what I want to do. I'm favoring a MPH because I think that can feasibly be completed online so I can continue working concurrently instead in-person courses/working in a lab if I pursue EnvE. Additionally, I also have more interest in public health than politics/international affairs in regards to choosing a masters program.

I also understand that for most UN positions, it requires a masters and variable years of experience, ranging from a minimum of 2 to double digits which I don't have as a recent college grad.  Currently, I have three internships under my belt with one of them turning into a full-time job, a little under a year as a research assistant focusing on wastewater, and my degree. This is why I really want to carefully decide whether I want to pursue a masters and if so, what kind - especially since what I'm aiming for career wise is a long-term goal. Also, realistically, what are my prospects in getting a job in the UN as an environmental engineer?

OR would it be better to perhaps look into other consulting companies that do international work (more of a short-term goal). The company I work for right now does do work internationally but these types of projects abroad are more geared towards the Env Sci employees.

There is a group on another world that is made up of Humans and another race called Larrad (picture ewoks but smart engineer types.) and the Larrad have a ancestor worshipping religion that abhors waste. They believe to throw anything away is disrespecting the creators of something which relates to disrespecting god. Throwing something away is a sin, but using something up is a virture. Like if they knock down an old house they'd straighten the nails to be reused and the bricks might be put on a shore line for erosion resistance. If you burned old magazines to be rid of them that would be a sin but if there was a purpose, like cooking food or warming your house its ok. Also if you kill an animal and just leave it thats wrong, but if you kill it and eat it, thats fine.

Something similar to [this image](https://s.alicdn.com/@sc01/kf/HTB1xmMrdmWD3KVjSZSgq6ACxVXaP/Hot-Wound-Spring-Coiling-Suspension-Compression-Machine.jpg_300x300.jpg). We are experiencing numerous problems with the main shaft (the one attached to the gear box at the end) and its keys. The problem is that the keys are crushed under high torque and then damage the keyway.  
We are trying to build a replacement for the shaft and buy/build new keys.  
The problem is that the main shafts keyway has been modified over time with no kind of documentation so we don't know the original dimensions. I tried contacting the original manufacturer (Fairbank Brearly) but they seem to be out of business.  
We analyzed the shaft material and it's something similar to EN 1.7225 steel and it is case hardened to roughly 3 mm depth.  
The Outside diameter of the shaft is 2.625 inch (66.66 mm).  
[This is the way shaft and hub are coupled](https://imgur.com/a/KY1Qtx0). There is another identical keyway on the other side of the shaft. The shaft needs to freely slide (linear motion) while simultaneously rotate the shaft with huge amount of torque (more than 10000 N.m).  
According to ASME B17.1 we should use a squre 5/8 inch key for this shaft which seems the correct choice and it's similar to the original keys. Then length of the original keys are around 125 mm. The problem is determining the size of the keyway on the shaft because the tolerances provided in the standard are for when the key is stationary in relation to the shaft. The key is screwed on the hub but it should freely slide on the shaft in the axial direction. What are the dimension and tolerances we should use for the keyway?  
What type of  material should we use for manufacturing the keys?",AskEngineers,False,pedih,/r/AskEngineers/comments/glaz8t/how_to_determine_key_material_and_keyway_size_for/
36,Hey engineers got one for ya,1589697915,"My brother and I live in the same apartment complex, but different, adjacent towers. In fact, we are right next to each other, which most of the time is is awesome. We get to see each other more, and we split the WiFi. Here’s where you guys come in.

42,Pathways for a career change with a BS in Industrial Engineering?,1589688076,"I graduated with a BS in industrial engineering in 2017, and have since been working totally non-engineering roles in the pharmaceutical space.  My positions have been numerous, for I have switched jobs more times than I can count.  Currently, I have an administrative/coordination type role for the facilities/engineering, but not an engineer title, nor the compensation to match.  I'm starting to fear that I have not run around in circles, but run into a dead end. 

At this moment, I don't have much career mobility after all the changes.  It starts to look terrible when a candidate has 5+ previous jobs, none lasting a year.  But a true reason behind this is the work is not inherently interesting (not engineering), or pays incredibly low.

I realize in this present climate, it's tough to find a new job or move around.  I had some applications in process, which froze or died 2 months since the initial phone screen date.

Though I studied industrial engineering and earned my BS in it (and passed the USA FE exam in it, thus being an EIT, with no applicability to any role thus far), I hoped to leverage that a bit. I work with databases, and I have worked on systems for manufacturing (ISA95).  So I applied to grad school, a MS in data analytics engineering, got in, and realized this was way too niche and expensive for an intangible return.

My main question is asking for advice on what actions I can take at this point.  I'm not going to grad school due to the cost and no relevancy to my current role, also it would require full-time commitment on campus.  I currently drive 100 miles round trip for my job, where I'm treated like a clerk and with no involvement in projects which could help my growth.  Internal mobility into a project engineer role/etc is impossible.  In fact, I was offered my current role when I interviewed for the project engineer role.  Being 3 years into my career, with this degree and experience, I feel (and quantitatively know), that being at barely $30/hr is unacceptable.  Especially the fact it feels like a dead end.

I have a friend who earned a BA in biology.  He had trouble as well finding a lucrative job.  After half a year in retail, he did various IT certifications online, and now secured a SDE job, 90k base or so.

I'm wondering if something similar is right for me.  My friends in CS/IT suggested it.

A bit more background:  I did not originally go into industrial engineering.  I was ChemE, and collapsed from the stress, going on medical LOA.  Switching to IE after returning to school was a way to consolidate past credits and have a somewhat easier degree completion.  I admit that IE is not the most specialized major, barely anyone outside of our program knew what we did.  But what I want to make of that in the present... is either specialize it with additional coursework, or perform a career changer..?

My interests outside of work definitely lie in the world of computing.  I've built several PC's and (regrettably) become the point-of-contact for all relatives needs.  I designed several websites for associates' restaurant businesses, and hindsight being 20/20, I should've gone for ECE or CS. 

But I am where I am now... and I lack a path forwards, which is the most upsetting thing.

I would have to stay in college a few months longer which delays a possible paycheck and adds to my student debt (even though I have a scholarship for tuition).

Add on top of this that I haven’t found exactly what I’m passionate about and it leaves me in a bit of a conundrum. Will the benefits outweigh the costs (to the best of your knowledge)?

Weird thing is I can't filter the noise out. See circuit below. Resistors are 470ohm each (voltage divider since tach signal is 15V), capacitor is 0.1uF ceramic, zener diode clips it at about 5V.

Any idea what's going on? Is the zener diode doing something weird or is the noise ""airborne"" and bypasses the capacitor? Or is the capacitor not fast enough to filter out super high frequency?

72,Where does the extra torque come from in automotive torque converters?,1589646547,"I've been watching and reading a lot of explanations on torque converters in automatic cars. I think I mostly understand the functioning:
1) Crankshaft turns impeller
2) Impeller blades push fluid vortically toward the outside and axially toward the turbine
3) Fluid turns turbine, connected to the transmission, and is turned toward the center and back toward the impeller
4) Stator redirects the fluid on the way back to the turbine, so that it collides with the turbine blades at such an angle as to ""help"" the engine turn the turbine.
5) When the turbine speed is close to the impeller speed, there's no multiplied torque.
6) But when the car is accelerating and the turbine is close to a standstill, the torque ratio is as high as 2.5.

And that's where I start to get confused. How is it possible that the returning fluid is providing 1.5 times the input torque? I would think the loss of KE to the collision with the turbine and the stator, and also to heat and turbulence, would require that the force applied to the blades to be LESS than the force originally applied to the fluid, so all else bring equal, the additional torque should be less, too (e.g, resulting in a max torque ratio of 1.8). This is assuming that the turbine is close to stationary so that little to no momentum is transferred from the fluid to the turbine before it returns to the impeller.

Can anyone tell me where I went wrong, or explain where the extra torque is coming from? Is there a difference in radius that I've missed, similar to a gear ratio?

78,How exactly is ME/EE involved in the fields of Thermo/Fluid (for AE aplications) as well as Controls (for AE aplications or Mechatronics applications)?,1589644381,"Hello. I am currently a CS student and I have been thinking about switching majors to either Mechanical or Electrical (with a focus on Electronics) Engineering. I have been watching MIT lectures, reading wikipedia pages about equations such as Navier-Stokes equations and Control Theory but still can't quite put my finger on how and where they are used daily. I just want some help to know what exactly these topics really are, so that I more confidently decide which program to choose.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thermo/Fluids:**

What attracts me in ME is fluids and thermodynamics, for applications such as aerodynamics and propulsion systems, but not limited to that. Steam generators and Wind energy seems really interesting. I feel curious about this (I love physics), but really know nothing about it nor what to expect. How is it applied daily? ME brings me mixed feelings because materials, structures and manufacturing sound insanely boring to me. But I guess I like fire and learning about rockets specially, maybe there could be an application for that. In highschool I found Hydrostatics and the basic Carnot Cycle to be rather dry, but I had an awful teacher. If that is what upper level fluids and thermodynamic courses look like, then I guess ME is not for me.

But if it is more like studying **laminar and turbulent flow** (how the smoke of a candle behaves is a cool way to visualize what I mean, or the exhaust of a rocket leaving the nozzle), then that would be pretty fucking cool. However, I can't really picture many applications for that, daily, in the industry. Seems more like niche problems for niche engineers at companies such as SpaceX, and unlikely that I will be able to make a career out of that. Is this more far and wide reaching than I think?

&amp;#x200B;

**Controls:**

My other option is Electronics Engineering. I have a lot of background with circuits (I am an electronics technician), but all of that background was from a heavily practical standpoint. I learned all I know about circuits without a single Calculus class, so I think I really did not tackle the actual theory involved. Now, I do not have any love for circuits, but I do not hate them passionately either. One thing I find interesting is the control of robots and drones. Supposing a drone has 4 propellers, it can be slightly thrown off balance due to wind or turbulence in the air. This lack of balance makes the drone spiral out of control unless a **control system with sensors and feedback loop** intervenes and brings it into control again by controlling the power output to each propeller individually. My question here is, is this the 'Control theory' that keeps getting mentioned as I research this, or am I understanding something wrong? It seems like this field is reachable by both EEs and MEs, with preference for EEs. Is that true? How do I work with that? Is electronics engineering the best choice? Can I reach that with Mechanical as well? Or should stick with CS for that kind of application?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am dropping CS because I do not enjoy the pure CS applications, I honestly do not find interesting how a computer processes an image to decide if there is a traffic light in it, and I do not want a job programming bank financial systems. However I really enjoy programming (reasonable experience with C in Arduinos, and a bit of experience with Pascal, Assembly, Python and VHDL) and I want to use A LOT of it in whichever engineering I choose, because it is such a powerful and easy tool to use. And I mean stuff like C, Python, Java, not PLC programming. I have been thinking about studying Machine Learning to use them on the Controls topic I just mentioned, if that is applicable.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Industry:** Food Manufacturing  
&gt;  
&gt;**Experience:** &lt; 2 yrs w/ BSME, MSME in December  
&gt;  
&gt;**Interest:** Aero/Mech. Design/Other Manufacturing Industry

*TL;DR at bottom.*

Good morning! I'm a fresh-faced ME working for Fortune 500 food manufacturing company in Ohio. After a handful of internships around the nation I caught the eye of the plant manager at the headquarters location and have relocated there while I finish my degree. It's a decent offer ($70k, Medical/Dental/Vision/Life, up to 7% 401k match, target 5% AIP with 0-200% potential, 2% holiday bonus). If I was wrong to accept that and it's a crap offer then let me know, but I didn't feel I had much room to negotiate on a starting position offer anyways.

Working in food mfg isn't exactly the most attractive position in mechanical engineering - from my impression there isn't really much design work being done by an engineer and most of it is general upkeep. However, the company is known to really promote vertical growth of their motivated employees and it wouldn't be uncommon for me to end up in a plant manager position within a decade or pushing towards a senior executive position at the corporate end. I come from a family of successful businessmen and everyone is strongly encouraging me to stay here where I'm already established and to climb the company ladder - but I'm curious what other engineers might say. Not having any established engineers in my support network has often left me feeling like I'm pioneering my own direction which doesn't feel great sometimes and this is that time when not having a mentor in my field has me feeling a bit directionless.

This company is stable, and even during times like we are currently experiencing they remain in full operation because frankly: everyone's gotta eat. The culture is second-to-none and it has plenty of inspired people to work alongside. But I'm still so curious what lies on the other side of the fence. Should I try to jump into another field? I did alright in university with a 3.5, my transcripts are sound except for a year where I floundered due to some health-related and home issues. I feel I could push my way into another industry well enough, but I don't know for sure and would love some advice. Is it worth leaving such a steady job offer?

I've always been interested in aerospace and mechanical design, I did really well in rocket propulsion and machine design, but I can't tell if it's more wise to ride it out here. Sorry if this was a bit rambling, if any clarification is needed I will happily do so.

The problem is that I'm not sure if I am ready or qualified for most jobs. I want to know if I should continue learning through my own self-study and project-based learning to gain new skills and projects to put on my resume or dive right into applying for jobs. 

 For most job listings, I would say I meet 50% to 90% of the qualifications/ requirements. I am proficient in a lot of things, however, I seem to be missing a few skills I see recurring in job listings (ROS, Gazebo, kinematics, networking, machine learning). Also, lots of applications seem to ask for Master's degrees. Another hindrance is that I am unpublished and my GPA is 2.3.

I personally feel as though I would do great in an entry-level position. I have a passion for what I do and although I may not have mastered all subtopics of robotics, I am eager to learn. I've done a few robotics-adjacent projects at school one of which is a team project we won a school award for.

I am not sure if my hesitation is stemming from imposter syndrome, which has stopped me from pursuing opportunities I was qualified for in the past, or a grounded urge to make myself attractive as possible as an applicant. I am afraid that if I wait for longer, can I miss job openings.

I am not under any extremely urgent time crunch to find a job. My dad and I have an agreement that as long as I work for his business, he will support me financially until I get a job. I am not a fan of this setup and my discomfort in it is pushing me to find employment sooner rather than later. However, because I am working and studying by myself, I am afraid of learning new skills on my own will take a long time.

It seems like it would be quite expensive, 30kg is quite heavy just the raw materials of these tiles. Anyways I'm very interested in producing a material like this myself. I'd need to figure out the right viscoelastic material to use and somehow get the right sized bubbles inside. In the alberich tiles, there are a few layers, I think basically there's this polyurethane ''foam'' with different sized microbubbles, there's also larger ''macro bubbles'' to deal with low frequency sonar. 

I've seen someone make a sort of foam material from silicone caulk glue, perhaps the process would be similar to that? 

Any ideas on how I can make something like the alberich tile?

63,Questions about my experience in my first week at my first internship (Manufacturing Plant),1589512532,"**This is a long post, so if you have experience mentoring interns in the manufacturing industry but don't want to read all of it, you would really be helping me out by just answering the last few questions in the last paragraph if you have the time.**

*Background:* I am a senior engineering student finishing up my last semester this upcoming fall with just 8 credit hours left. I've started my very first engineering internship this week at a manufacturing plant.

On my first day outside of orientation my mentor set me up in a conference room and told me to get to know the processes and my coworkers. I took this as watch a shit ton of training videos on the e-learning website, and when you pass through any of the break rooms introduce yourself to as many people as you possibly can. I just figured with a company all about safety it wouldn't be safe for an intern with no experience to walk around a manufacturing plant with huge machines  and forklifts running 24 hours a day.

Well, apparently this was the wrong assumption because at around 2:00PM (where at this point I had already spent upwards of 5+ hours watching videos on training, processes, and safety in the plant) my mentor meets pops in and pretty much tells me I need to do more than just sit in the conference room on my laptop. I was pretty frustrated since it's my first experience in an engineering internship and I really had no idea that what I was doing was completely wrong. However, I took his advice and headed into the plant for the rest of the day and pretty much walked the lines and identified each machine in each line that I saw in the videos I watched earlier in the day. I figured the next day I would introduce myself to operators in production and ask to shadow them. 

So far I feel like I've been doing a pretty good job staying out of the conference room and shadowing people and making sure I stay busy in production and have been scheduling tours with different departments. I've definitely learned a lot from the operators in production, overcame my fear of striking up conversations with random people, and have met some great people. However I'm still frustrated by the lack of structure in this internship and have absolutely no idea if what I'm doing is what my mentor wants to see.

Don't get me wrong, I really like my mentor as a person and I can see how it is too much to ask for someone to completely derail their work schedule to make sure the intern feels comfortable, but I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. I don't even have a work schedule. I just show up at 7:30 AM and work until about 5:00 PM. Do I work weekends as well? 7 days a week? I don't fucking know!

So basically I just want to ask Engineers that have been mentors to interns, is this typical for internships? Am I being too much of a baby-backed bitch? If you work in the manufacturing industry, what would you want to see out of an intern in their first week? Is it too intrusive to ask others in the Front office if I could eat lunch with them?

I didn't have industry experience as I thought I wanted to go PhD and professor route, but at some point in my final year in BS realized that I like having free time to do other things. I am now realizing I want to save up enough money and retire early and pursue other artistic passions, social work, etc with the assumption that these ventures pay nothing. To get to early retirement, I would probably need to work for 15-18 years (hopefully less, but likely will take more time...) 

I started my first job last year in a rotation program at a major defense company. First rotation is meh, did not learn a lot of technical skills. Currently trying to find second rotation -- there's one in supply chain which wouldn't be too technical either, but lets me work from home and I could use the time saved commuting (1.5-2 hrs) to learn something useful. I want to switch out of defense, hopefully by the end of my third rotation. The problem is that I fear by not having a hard technical skills/experience that are in high demand, I won't be hired at a high paying role, especially in a different industry. Currently making \~$100k (I think I'm very lucky to be making this much), but if I don't increase earnings or worse get a pay cut, retirement will be pushed out much further, and I can probably say goodbye to pursuing other ventures. For my second and third rotations, I want to develop some attractive skills either on the job or outside of it. What kind of skills are in high demand and pay well that I can learn?

84,Can I get away with using 2 bearing blocks? [CNC Lathe],1589487786,"https://imgur.com/a/cxkQzdU

Hi!

I'm wrapping up CAD for my CNC lathe project.

I'm wondering if I can get away with using only two linear bearing blocks instead of 4 as I have now. Intended use:

-Drilling a max of 1"" holes in mild steel

-Acting as a support with a live center running a max Depth Of Cut of 0.075"" on mild steel on 16"" long shaft

Specs:

-All plate 3/8"" (~9.75mm)

-Square tube 1.5"" x 1/8 thick

-Linear rails on Z axis are HGR25

According to Hiwin, I can get away with 0.33Kn/M on each block perpendicular to the rail. The distance between the tip of the tailstock rod and the closest bearing block is roughly 215mm. I should be able to apply 300kg/660lb of force at a 45 degree angle up and away from the chuck while staying completely in spec for applied moment between the two bearing blocks. With a 2x FOS that allows 300lb of force based on my napkin math.

Do any of you guys have experience using linear rail like this? What do you guys think? I have no idea on how to go about modelling drill forces. Even if my numbers work out there are things I'm probably not considering that I should be.

I’ve been approached by several people in the company regarding my degree and career plans, two of which (both engineers but in different departments) seem at the moment to be competing (for lack of a better term) for my commitment.

8,I'm a student and would like some advice from you guys.,1589469937,"Hey Everyone,

Sorry for the long post but I literally didn't know who else to ask.

I'm an engineering student who's doing his bachelor's in Applied Electronics and Instrumentation in a self-financing college. I'm in the second semester of the third year of my course. The entire course is four years.

I'm quite skilled in C programming and has helped my seniors with their final year projects before with my programming. But some of the faculty really see me as incompetent as I'm not as skilled with actual electronics. What they were implying is anyone could just 'type stuff into an Arduino' and make things happen while doing the same with analog circuits is where the skill is at. It's not that everyone else in the class is extremely good with electronics, I think my enthusiasm for programming puts them off. I liked making things and as a child my parents really didn't trust me with electronics after a certain incident with a car battery, a bulb, an exposed wire and my index finger when I was 5. Later on we bought a computer at home and I started tinkering with it and got into programing. It was not something I chose, things happened in my life and that is what I ended up being good at.

I do like analog circuits and can make basic bridge rectifier, 5V power supplies, counters (with 555) etc but I would really like to get better at my trade. We're suppose to submit our proposals for final year projects this month. I really want to do a project that will help me learn more and is not so simple my faculty will belittle me. All this also has me doubting whether I'll actually make it in the industry.

So, you people have been through college and is probably working in the instrumentation field.

I am having trouble thinking through the phase changes of water as we heat up the system.

We start with 500mL of water and slowly ramp the temperature from room temp to 300 C. So the water should begin to boil as the temp approaches 100 C, but since it is a closed system, there is nowhere for the steam to escape. I am mostly confused about what happens above 100 C because the water should continue to produce steam and the vapor pressure will increase, but also the density of water decreases as temperature rises, so the liquid should expand and take up more volume in the chamber.

Our pressure gauge reads that our final pressure is about 18 MPa at 300 C, and based on the water phase diagram this means that the system should be completely water. So I am mostly confused about what happens during the ramping up process.

I've read two articles on the topic: one is on modeling discharge form an pressure vessel, which in principle is what happens when the exhaust valve open. The other is on modelling the discharge form automotive poppet valves by means of mass flow rate.  
The problem maybe my lack of knowledge of fluid dynamic or the language barrier , but I haven't gotten further with the two methods.

[article 2](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00348-017-2478-8.pdf)

In the first article, I can't find what units are used, so i used SI-units (meter, pascal,etc.)  
The method of finding a pressure change during the process is based on calculating the change in density while it flows from higher pressure to lower pressure (equation 12) .

 I think, there must be something off with the units, since my first calculation resulted in a value of 83. The value compared to the density of air (1.3 kg/m^(3)) is quite big.

the initial conditions were   
density 1,34 kg/m^(3) , temperature 2176 K, gas constant 287,058, Gamma 1,35, 

mach 1, throat area 5.2 E-06 m^(2), volume 4,48 E-05 m^(3)

As i understand the logic of this method it allows to calculate to change in density at a given time and if I subtract the instantaneous density changes from the initial density i can plot the rate of change in density. the rate of change in density can then be used to find the corresponding pressure.

Did I make an error on the units ? Calculations were made by a computer so there can only be input error so I checked the formula for error, but It looked okey.

So, I haven’t been able to get through to him a lot lately, and having to work from home makes it so much worse.

Oh, and those two senior engineers I was telling you about? They work on the other side of the country! I’ve never met them in person, despite talking to them every day (and at least I have good communication with them, but they get really busy, too).

I want to attend a full-stack development Bootcamp to start a career in technology, just an entry-level position for now. 

Get an electrical engineering bachelor's, I am about to get an associate's in business administration so I can focus on my associate's for transfer in engineering to then enter a 4-year institution to get the actual title. This might take about 5 more years but it's okay.

50,how do engineers demonstrate their skills?,1589425057,"I'm a student and prospective engineer curious about the engineering career. There's got to be a reliable way employers, especially top ones, evaluate candidates for engineering, which correlates strongly with engineering performance (right?). But is there a way to represent yourself to \*small\* (or rather medium-sized) companies if you're highly skilled?

The reason for this question is: when I look at job postings and hear about competitive employment and the like,  I mainly hear about ""What degree do you have"", ""where did you go to school"", ""do you have gaps in your resume"" etc. To me that's all bullshit. Why do we evaluate engineers based on superfluous (at best!) politics and heuristics, not their engineering skills? 

I know networking and peer-relationships play a big role in hiring for companies, often even more than job postings. That's good, I because I bet peers know in general how they rank relative to eachother. I don't believe a PhD is actually required at most jobs who list it (just want a position to seem more 'researchy' and capitalize on the surplus of PhD--but does this actually lead to better value/outcomes for the employer?)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6zolal/engineers\_that\_had\_bad\_grades\_where\_are\_you\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6zolal/engineers_that_had_bad_grades_where_are_you_now/)  Are degrees and gpas and resume gaps the best measures people have at measuring engineering skill? Because arguably these college degrees don't give you much better engineering skills until you get sufficiently specialized. What would be better is actual \*practice\*, (edit: at least until a certain point, or if you want to explore more diverse avenues, etc. I don't think all education is \*worthless\*--far from it, but there's \*got\* to be more relevant criteria for discipline skills) 

Is there a component I'm missing or is practice not valuable between employers, only # years of experience is (which is not always greatly correlated with skills! [https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-142-4-200502150-00004](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-142-4-200502150-00004))

I'm not asking if its possible \*in the general, societal case\* whether all people can be in exactly the position they deserve. I'm asking how engineers in practice today, who apply their smarts and discipline to this area, represent their skills as best they can to projects of various stripes. Can you help me with this problem?

I'm looking for as least-cynical replies as I can possibly get on the internet  🤞

63,Am I calculating air volumetric flow rate incorrectly?,1589417192,"I am working on a project that requires measuring a device's air consumption at various states. The system is set up such that a tank is charged to pressure, and then the device begins to consume air. No more air is supplied to the tank during consumption, so the tank pressure will decrease over time. The device will vent to atmosphere. 

I am able to measure the pressure and temperature of the air inside the tank. Since the air pressure is decreasing from a fixed volume (from the tank), my thought process is to apply simple gas laws to calculate the mass of air inside the tank at various times. Knowing mass m1 at time t1, and mass m2 at time t2, I can calculate the mass flow rate \[m1-m2)/dt\], and then convert this to volumetric flow rate. \[Using a computer to do this several times per second\]

Have I approached this wrong? All units/conversions check out. The numbers I am getting are off by enough to make me think something is fundamentally wrong with the calculations.

Also would like to add that the tank is being used instead of a flow meter because the device consumes different amounts of air at different states, requiring numerous flow meters to cover the flow range ($$$).

They have been very supportive going out of there way to give me advice on applying to grants, editing my resume, and being patient with the project I'm working on(it's a completely different physics field than mine, but still computational physics).  And this is all before I even worked there.   


I'm doing a remote internship this summer, and despite not even working there, it's been a great experience. They're paying me really well too(28 an hour). The reason I'm asking this is that my experience reconsider my goals. I always wanted to work at NASA, but the national lab I've been associated with seems like a dream place especially to do physics. If I want to make a good career, I need to make a good relationship and interning for the next 5-6 years for my PhD could do that.   


That's why I wanted to ask and whether I should focus on the national labs instead of going for an OSSI/pathways internship. People at NASA, how has your experience been?

Some traditional areas like Mech E and EE can also be technically transferrable (within their domain), but opportunities are much less than SWE and doctors/physicians. It's all luck and a little of social/soft skills if you're not SWE or physician. 

I'm non-traditional engineering, and I've only recently begun my first full-time job, but it isn't all that different from my internships that I had more than 5 years ago. I just have to be a lot more meticulous with my calculations. It's like being given a pass/fail exam where only 95%+ is pass (the other 5% is coming from co-workers or self-checking that can hopefully can catch any mistakes that didn't throw an error). The pace is also exhausting, with constant overtime at least every other day. I assume physicians would be under the same conditions...but physicians actually make good money (although their tuition is high).

SWE tuition would be the same, work stress would be the same as other engineering, and pay would be above average for engineering - and on par with physicians if you manage to get into a top tech company with stocks (of course even at a regular tech company without stocks, pay is still much better than any other engineering position). 

It's like unless you're absolutly obssessed with mechanical mechanisms (e.g. car hobbyist) or DIY circuits, there's no point going into traditional engineering. 

Downside of engineering is that, unless you're an expert in a specific domain with high demand (of which there aren't that many) , if you get laid off, you essentially start from zero when yoi look for your next job. That's not usully the case for SWE or physicians. 

I mean an engineering degree is better than a bachelors in biology/psychology/english/etc. But for all the work put in (with a potential masters that's needed if you want to be competitive during the job hunt), it just seems like SWE and physician would be a similar amount of work with much more reward. (SWE may be less or more work; physician would be like a bachelors + 4/5 more years, not bad). 

The most reliable way to increase your earning potential is with experience, but if you pick a job that doesn't give you that experience (e.g. non-technical support role), or the experience is not transferrable, then you severely risk your earning potential if anything happens during your career.

Referring to the video above, I have a question.

At 00:57 in the video, the author says that ""the motor driver (shown as a DAC in the video) is given discrete voltage samples as input, and then the driver  is a \*physical piece of electrical hardware\* holds the voltage constant for the period between the samples.

**Q1.** Am I right if I think of the ""physical piece of electrical hardware"" as the PWM peripheral of the microcontroller followed by the gate driver and the inverter? 

Reason being -

1. The discrete voltage samples (say, Vcontroller) from the controller firmware are first converted into a duty cycle samples by a simple formula duty = Vcontroller/Vsupply. (Vsupply is the supply voltage of the inverter)
2. The duty samples are then provided to a PWM peripheral inside the MCU which will output PWM pulses (having frequency, say, 20Khz &amp;) having duty cycle equal to the value of the duty samples.
3. These pulses are now given to a gate driver chip which then drives FETs/IGBTs etc. in a H-bridge inverter.
4. The motor lines are connected to each of the legs of the inverter, which take the voltage from the inverter. And the inductive effect of the motor helps in averaging out the inverter output voltage.

 So basically the PWM peripheral along with the inverter does the DAC work including ZOH handling.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2.** I want to model this DAC block in a S-domain, (like done in the video at 9:32). I was thinking of modelling it same like the pade approximation shown in the video, something like,

G\_inv = K/(T\*s + 1) 

where, 

T = 1/PWM\_frequency = 1/20KHz = 50usec

And gain K.

Is this correct?

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3.** I am confused with the K term. 

Is keeping a gain of 1 ok (like done in the video)? If not what should the gain be?

I’d like to experimental determine the amplitude and frequency that best accomplishes the design parameters I desire, so I need to find a vibratory motor with adjustable amplitude and frequency. I’m hopeless at all things electrical, so if possible I’d like to have those controls integrated into the motor instead of trying to control amp/freq with an external power source. Running off of standard U.S. domestic voltage and freq (120V 60Hz) is a must as well as this will be a normal consumer product.

I’d also like to keep the expense and weight of the motor as low as possible, although given the energy required to induce soil “liquefaction” (I know it doesn’t actually become a true liquid, please don’t hurt me) it will probably have to be a few pounds.

Can someone point me in the right direction?

25,Recycling of wastewater onto unit operations (Environmental),1589338528," Hi there, I'm trying to figure out how to do/design recycling of wastewater onto unit operations.

Every time I look over at resources they pinpoint to reuse of the wastewater effluent elsewhere instead of back to the original stream. I may have been looking over the wrong keywords. I can't find info of the design of recycling in Metcalf &amp; Eddy too.

This is pertaining specifically on nitrification. At this point I am peering over trickling filters but I'm trying to do a mini lab sized experiment of something else that can show ammonia reduction via recycling and there aren't any schematics or rule of thumb on this with the exception of statement by [this article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09593339309385373)

Recycling seems to fly over my head on how to execute if there's any references for the design (how it looks like) or help on where to start would be greatly appreciated. (Or even if there's a better term to use on what I should google on since it keeps on referring on reclamation and reuse part)

Currently I have an engineering internship for the summer in CO. I am originally from TX.

However, I would get an overall better experience such as better connections, more productivity and more privacy. However, going virtual would allow me to save money on food, rent and general expense, and allow me to stay at home with family.

38,Deflection beam spanning 17ft. Quarantine project: Fish tank and pad,1589326380,"Hey,

I know this scenario is kinda ridiculous.  Blame it on the quarantine or whatever.  

So I’m looking to install a fish tank that weighs between 3000-4000lbs total.  And I want to install a slate tile pad under the fish tank. The pad is about 8ft. X 8ft. 

It will be installed in the center of a my living room, size: 17’ x 40’. 

There is a basement under my living room. 

The floor joists span a total of 17 feet.  

I looked at the joists and they say LPI 20Plus.  They are 11-5/8”.  They are 16” on center.  

The span chart says that a 17 foot span =
Live Load 
L/480=53
L/360=71
Total Load =90

I do not know what any of that means. 

I do know that the deflection for natural stone is recommended to be at least L/720. 


So the practical application:

How many jack posts and 2x4s do I need in the basement under where the pad and fish tank will be placed?  What kind of support do I need under the pad so that it never cracks?

Thank you,

P.S.
The OSB is above the joists has a thickness of 23/32 PERF CAT. Span rating 24 o.c.  Building code performance category = 0.688” - 0.750”. 

There is hardwood flooring above the osb.  The wife wants the pad as close to flush with the floor as possible.  So I’ll be cutting out a 8’x8’ square of the hardwood flooring for the slate tile.  

P.P.S. Thank you if you read this far.


Edit: the slate pad will be installed directly on the osb.  On top of a 1” cement board.  

Also, the osb in the basement has some mildew on it.  Is that going to be an issue where I probably should not remove the wood floor and installing a pad on top.  Thanks again.",AskEngineers,False,shonofnight,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gin4ek/deflection_beam_spanning_17ft_quarantine_project/

But now that this available my first instinct is to do it since it seems like a bargain as I'll only be paying 10k for tuition since I can retain my free housing for my university and that's not including the possibility for grants/TA. 

I guess my question is do y'all think pursuing this MS degree in this situation is worth it?

0,The physics of the self-watering cat / dog bowl.... applied to a 55 gallon drum w/ hoses and/or pipes.,1589258529,"I'm attempting to a create a self-watering sub-irrigation setup for my first ever garden.  Mixing 5 gallons of fertilized water at a time seems unnecessary when I have a couple 55 gallon drums that seem like they'd be perfectly capable for this process.

Long story, short.... I can set a 5 gallon water jug, mounted upside down inside a kiddie pool (w/ ""fabric pots"" that are just the $1 reusable Walmart / Dollar General bags), and when the water reaches the desired level -- the mouth of the jug -- the water stops gurgling out and the rest remains in the jug.  This is easy enough, as certain cat and dog bowls operate the same way.  What I'd like to know is the physics of why this works and if it should be theoretically possible to attach multiple multiple hoses and/or pipes to an air-tight 55 gallon drum, thereby watering multiple kiddie pools at the same time.  I know there are float valves that can easily accomplish this task for me... but I can get a used 55 gallon drum for virtually the same price as a new float valve.  Plus, I'd enjoy understanding the physics behind my experimentation.

I've experimented a few different ways to make just ONE hole on the bottom side of the drum work with this concept.  A simple 1/2"" ball valve will work as expected.  But when I attach a single garden hose to 1/2"" hose barb adapter to said valve, the water does not stop.  This makes absolutely no sense to me.  I had originally started with multiple hoses &amp; tees... didn't work.  One short 8"" hose... didn't work.  The single 1/2"" hose barb directly on the spigot... didn't work.  The spigot itself, however... does work!!

So what do I need to make his work with multiple pipes or hoses? Or am I simply limited to one output?  If I need to raise the drum higher, I can.  Or if I need to place a larger (1""?) valve directly on the bottom, I can do that as well.

Last week I finished my associates in mechanical engineering technology. It is from a local college that was very affordable, but by no means a big name school. I went this route as I had an interest in engineering but was not sure if I was smart enough for it. Well, I thrived and finished with a 3.8 GPA. I have taken through calc 1 and calc based physics, but most of my other classes were not calc based. 

I am currently planning on transferring schools in the fall (I cannot take any more credits from my current school) to finish my bachelors in MET. However I am second guessing and wondering if it would be worth retaking a handful of classes to get a full mechanical engineering degree. I have approximately 3 semesters to my bachelors otherwise. I have a lot of interest in going to grad school for human factors engineering which more than likely will happen after my bachelors in MET.

Pretty shit GPA, but I was struggling with some mental health stuff during my junior year. I've had 2 internships at oil &amp; gas companies &amp; 1 part-time work experience in IT as a technician. I've got plenty of school projects and several leadership positions in engineering organizations in my university as well as some scholarships/awards. I've been applying to jobs non-stop (in the hundreds) and never gotten anything past a second interview. I've had my resume looked at, practiced interviews, etc. and still no luck. I know the current pandemic is putting a damper on the economy so that's not helping either. 

The thing is that I was planning on working at least 3-5 years after undergrad and then pursuing an MBA. Since I haven't been able to find a job, I'm thinking I should apply for an MBA as a backup. Finance isn't a concern - I'm lucky to have family that can afford to support me but I feel that rather than being unemployed for months I should at least do something (an MBA in this case). Yet I read so many posts advising me against this due to my little work experience. I can continue to apply to jobs for months and years but it makes me uncomfortable to be unemployed and not in school and I feel that it'll reflect badly on my resume.

The graduate metallurgy programs I was accepted into primarily focus on work related to the steel manufacturing/mill industry which isn't somewhere I would like to work for the rest of my life. Would it be worthwhile to still get a PhD or Masters in metallurgical engineering or ceramic engineering from a university even though the school seems to feed a industry I am not intending on working in? The project they have that will fund my schooling and housing is in the steel manufacturing industry and they would like me to intern for them during the summers most likely.

I'm not the best with words at all and can make a much better impression in person, so the idea of talking like this weekly is scary. Another contributing factor is I don't usually talk about serious subjects conversationally. I'm just very embarrassed and I really would like to improve.

I go to a college that is known for engineering and all of the students around me are brilliant, so I feel like the graduate students and research professor will look down upon me because I don't have any excuse to be speaking like an idiot.

66,Career Advise Needed for Engineer Wannabe,1589210588,"Hi all,

Hope everyone is healthy and well.

I've been in a bit of dilemma for a while. I graduated exactly a year ago with a non-engineering degree (in STEM) and I was lucky to land a position as a packaging engineer. I was pretty excited for the job at the beginning, but after a few months of working I feel like I've hit a plateau in terms of learning and career progression. Mostly because there's very minimum technical aspect involved in my job (or the field as a whole from what I know). Don't get me wrong, I fully understand that I still have so much to learn. What I meant by ""technical aspect"" is really the process of dissecting a real life problem and make logical decision from investigating. The issue is that all the problems in this field is too straightforward (either you know it or you don't) and there's not really enough thinking involved. My day pretty much goes like: writing emails to make sure people are aligned, writing specification (pretty much just copying and pasting), writing assembly instructions, doing some tests to see if how the package perform (which is quite meaningless because a experienced engineer can just tell what will happen from the beginning), and meetings after meetings. 

After a while I just feel like this is not something I want to do for a long time. I like engineering because it applies scientific knowledge/methods to real life issues. But I don't want to work on the issues in which the answers are given from the beginning, and if I fail that's because I've never seen it before. 

Also another issue is that all the components I work on are actually manufactured by other companies (suppliers). I don't really participate in process of ""engineering"" them. I just tell the suppliers our expectations and make sure their design meets the standards. (even thought most times they know their design will pass our tests because they've been working with our company for years). Sure I learned something about manufacturing practices but it's not nearly enough as someone who works on the supplier side. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Should I continue this path or find another? Any recommendation is highly appreciated.

I understand well the grinding principle, regarding the rotation speed and all, as there is a lot of information out there. But there is barely any information about how the material is moving from the inlet to the outlet.

From my understanding, the natural flow of the inlet material is ""pushing"" the material foward and into the outlet. There can be some angle in the inside liners that will also help with the motion, although most SAG mills I see seem to have straight liners. I've read that some have air circulation inside that also move the material foward.

Hello. I’m about to return to studying engineering in September after previously dropping out a few years ago. My issue is that I have to decide between a Mech Eng course and a Robotics course at 2 different universities.

When I previously studied, I found the mechanical modules much more enjoyable to study, but I find robotics projects and products more interesting and see it as an area I would potentially like to work in. The university offering the mechanical course is much better than the one offering the robotics course in terms of employment and student satisfaction. 

My question is basically is it more important that you choose a discipline that you find easier/ enjoyable to study rather than interesting?

The system consists of a collection box 250x250x250mm in a intermittent stream that only flows in heavy rain. Within the box is a 80 pipe from side to side in the middle, with lots of small holes drilled into it. From the end of the 80mm pipe, there is a 25cm ag hose connected that descends about 3m over 15m run to the actual tank.

When it rains, the box fills up fine, silt to the bottom, flotsam over the top.  But while water does flow through the hose to the tank, it only comes through in a trickle and I can hear lots of gurgling and bubbles.   However, if I put my finger over the end of the hose for a minute, then the hose completely fills up with water and from that point on it flows like a fire hose!   The hose flows at max capacity and there are no air bubble at all.

Obviously standing out in heavy rain with my finger in the end of a hose is sub optimal.  So what can I do to make this system self initialise?

1. Bigger hose?  I can easily put in a 35mm hose
2. Even up the fall/run?  There are a few ups and downs in the hose, with a bit of effort I could level the run to remove local maxima.
3. More holes in the collection pipe?  Would more head pressure help?
4. Some kind of spring loaded auto-finger on the exit of the pipe that only releases once there is adequate pressure in the pipe?   Maybe just a one way valve so it can't suck air???

89,Electrical engineer working as an application support engineer for 1 year. Slowly starting to feel like I may be limiting myself.,1589175340,"To get the a few things out of the way—my job is incredibly easy and it pays well. I do not have a problem with my current job. Basically, I work as technical phone support for factory machines. It’s not what I envisioned myself doing, but I adapted to the role so quickly that I actually don’t mind it. 

However, it isn’t “electrical engineering” per se. On my resume, I could probably twist some of my skills to look more relevant to EE than it actually is. I’m not exactly enthused to tell people my electrical engineering degree is used for phone support either. My family thought I would work for Google or Apple when I told them I wanted to become an electrical engineer (I know that’s stereotypical and I don’t especially want to work for a big tech Corp). Though my family doesn’t demean me for it or anything, I get kind of embarrassed answering calls as “tech support, this is Adhiboy” from my room while the quarantine is happening. 

The problem is that I hope I’m not boxing myself into a corner. Let’s say I work here for a few years—will I have applicable skills I can use in some other EE industry? I don’t really find factory machinery interesting, but I struggle to find a good reason to leave my current job other than that I’m not using my degree.

97,Considering A Career Switch From Mechanical Engineering to Software Development,1589164275,"
I am currently a Mechanical Reliability Engineer at a chemical plant in Houston, TX. I graduated in May 2018 and have been working here for two years. The pay is great and the job is challenging and interesting. I currently make $85k/yr with 401k matching and health benefits.  The cost of living in Houston is very cheap.

I am considering switching careers because the long term career in my field does not interest me. Here are the reasons why:

1. The problems I am solving have already been solved before. The chemical industry has been around for a long time and all of the problems seen have been resolved by someone before. All I have to do is figure out who to go to that has experience solving that type of problem. I then try to learn as much as I can about the solution as I can to make sure it is really the best option. Once I understand it enough, i then get a cost to solve that problem and pitch it to management. This is fun, but I am still not the one solving the problem. From what I have read, it appears software engineers solve problems themselves. They also are solving problems not seen before. 

2. The upward movement in the career path is to management, but management’s role seems boring. Management’s goal is to just keep things running. They are not doing anything new or solving new problems. As a manager, I would have to make sure production is aligned with logistics and sales from corporate. That means making sure things are not breaking and to make sure projects are on time and meet the production objectives. Again, nothing cutting edge or new here, just maintaining a plant and managing people to ensure production is met. 

The question I have for this thread is:
1. Has anyone ever made a similar career switch?
2. How hard is it it to switch into this field with a ME degree?
3. Is doing a “boot camp” helpful to get in this industry?
4. Do software engineers really make as much as they are advertised to make? How does it compare to my salary?
5. Is outsourcing a risk to a successful career in software engineering?
6. Are the problems you solve different from the ones I mentioned I have with my current job? Do you always solve new problems that haven’t been solved before? Can it get boring?
7. Do most companies allow you to work remotely? Does this allowance begin only after you have worked at the company for some time?

29,Effects of reduced bolt preload (&lt;70%),1589136894,"I am currently designing a bolted connection that requires a tapped hole in an aluminum plate (specific grade tbd, most likely 6061T6) in a high vibration environment, with thread lock. Based off my bolt joint calculations, I am getting internal thread shear purely from the preload force when using a standard 75% of proof load value of a grade 8 bolt.   


Now, I have determined that if I significantly reduce the preload force to say 50% of proof load, I no longer get thread shear, the joint does not separate, and the bolt does not yield. Basically, a 50% preload fulfills all the requirements of the bolted joint connection.  


This got me thinking, where do these standard preload values come from which generally range from 70%-90% based on application. The calculations check out, but is there some practical reason why such high values exist? Could I, in theory, apply a 10% preload as long as it fulfills the joint connection requirements?",AskEngineers,False,etlie,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gh75l0/effects_of_reduced_bolt_preload_70/

But circumstances made me opt for EE instead of ME, also, for employability, my father strongly suggested it.
Although I enjoy EE very much, I wanna go into the field of Weapons Dev, especially Small Arms Dev but Missile Systems and others will also suit nice as hell. The whole domain of Weapons Dev is my passion. 
So, I am confused about doing ME or AE? Which one will expose me well to that industry and at the same time provide ample employment opportunities? Will I get screwed by switching such vastly different (core) fields (from EE to ME/AE)? 

2) As I mentioned, I am pursuing B.Tech in EE from locally renowned University and am in 3rd year of it. So, I wanted to learn maximum of things by myself, as education here was restricted to theory oriented only. So, I completed some online courses for ANSYS and MATLAB. And also, I am building a 3D printer as a college project, but I am not making it entirely from scratch. It's a follow up of an Instructable. So, I feel like shit! That at the end of 4 years, I didn't do much significant projects of my own. I dunno what to do, what skills to learn, how to follow my passion but be a skillful, employable engineer at the same time? Or am I going at the right pace?

47,1:6 conversion of linear movement? specific example provided,1589113773,"I have a 10mm wide button that can be pressed up to 0.5mm. I want to convert the movement to a 3mm movement under the button.

I believe this can be done by an airtight system where the pressure will do most of the work, like in the below illustration:

[https://i.imgur.com/VXRNbLB.png](https://i.imgur.com/VXRNbLB.png)

The idea is the volume of the gas or liquid inside the airtight container is moved more by button 1 than button 2 needs, so ""button"" 2 will in result move more than button 1 has been moved.

The idea is to further have a spring to push button2 back after button 1 is released.

I think this is simuilar to how a syringe works except the liquid/gas is not allowed to escape and instead moves a tube which is narrower than the syringe barrel and plunger.

I have asked my University advisors and I usually get a rundown of how the university is almost there and how I should focus on my coursework. They really beat around the bush with it and I think it is because I am from out of state and they do not want me to transfer to another University. So no clear answer from them.

I have called the advising services of my other university option as well and asked about the importance of ABET but then I receive a sell of all the reasons why I should attend that university (more expensive one should I add).

I have a few questions on how to realize my project. I do not even know where to start. I am thinking about buying a raspberry pi or arduino, learning the programming language and how to use those microcontrollers. 

Then I came up with the idea to let the knob act like a resistor. When the knob gets twisted clockwise the resistance will increase and the other way around. Then I would need a unit that captures the current and outputs certain values depending on how high the current is.

I have no idea if this is actually the way it would be done or if its an old fashioned way to do it because there are way better methods. I would be really greatful if someone with more experience could help me out and give me some tips.

83,Dealing with a manager who suffers from chronic 'wishful thinking'.,1589038840,"This is part rant, part advice seeking and part wanting to commiserate with fellow engineers in a similar situation.

I'm not sure how to put this other than to say I work for a manager (and my manager's manager right up to our VP) who all seem to suffer from chronic wishful thinking.

I work in product development and part of my job involves forecasting a project timeline with our program manager and working with the finance team and cost estimates.  The development cycle is typically 1-3 years.  The issue that I'm having is that management is constantly taking my projections and significantly cutting down the time and cost estimates to what I think are ludicrous levels.  I understand the need to be 'aggressive' in cases, but we are in the realm of crazy-talk.

I am now reaching the end of a current cycle and under a lot of stress to reach what are clearly unattainable goals.  I estimated 26 months for the project and was given 14.  We are now at month 12 and it still looks like we need another 12+ months.  Additionally, the product cost is coming in at 40% above target, but only 5% above my estimate at the start of the project.

To top it all off, my merit increase is tied to achievement of the said impossible task.

I really like my job, just not the constant unrealistic decision making from management.

Short of looking for a new job, any suggestions on a path I could take that would not be career limiting with my current employer?

21,"Should I study Engineering? What does it take, what type of person thrives in that environment?",1588972462,"TL; DR: I'm planning to study Engineering, but don't know if it's for me. I'd love for you to tell me your experiences or advice: What is ultimately important for an engineer? Do you think I'm on the right track here?

I'm currently planning to study electrical engineering this fall at university. However, I feel unsure whether this is the right choice for me: less so because I don't think I have what it takes and more because I feel like I don't fit in the demographic and don't know whether I'll be happy in that life. 

I never had any type of enlightening experience that made me realize engineering was for me. Instead, I systematically informed myself about the possible subjects and directions, their pros and cons, and really mostly eliminated. My parents, who are both in the STEM sector and university system, also gave me some perspective on what to look for: what courses are pretty much useless, what I can expect on the job market, what each sector takes (for example Law or Medicine being very heavy on memorizing, etc.). And so I landed on engineering. I decided to go for EE since I believe it suits me better than Mechanical Engineering and, again, according to my parents it is better to choose a broader subject and specialise later on, as that is more looked for in the industry. Ideally, I'd love to work in Renewable Energies, but I suppose it's too early to say now.

However. I'm a girl, not a boyish one either. Whenever I'm asked about university, and say I'm planning on studying EE, I get reactions ranging from ""how boring"" (not that directly), ""awesome! Girls that do engineering!"" to ""Oooh and what led you there?"" which I never know how to answer. What did lead me there? 

I'm good at math and physics, but also languages or essays. I dislike pure memorizing, I'm pretty bad at it when there isn't a logical aspect involved, and would say that my main talent is based on logic. That's where I thrive in school, be it with an essay, ethics or math. I don't want to study math, though, because I have had my fair share of negative experiences there. 

Basically, my father is a maths professor, and so I was pushed towards math from a young age. Never really got to see whether math would pull me in if I let it. I did decently at competitions, but horrible during any type of advanced maths lesson. I give coaching lessons for regular school-level math, but in those lectures, I felt like I needed coaching lessons. Because I felt like math made me ""uncool"" as I got older, I stopped trying, and when I was old enough to realize the only thing that makes you uncool is trying to be someone else for other people, it was too late to get back into it (I did try, for closure).

And so, at this point, I honestly don't feel like I'm good enough for university-level maths. I know I'll never be as good as my dad - and honestly, I don't really want to either, I know he missed out on other experiences I really want - and I feel like I don't deserve to give it a shot in university after the attitude I had towards it in school. I hope for engineering to use logical systems similarly to math, but be more directed at real-life scenarios. Also, something that always bothered me about math is that I felt like many of the people who were truly good at it were so immersed in it that everything else sort of loses importance. So they might be socially awkward, or have no other interests outside of math. And I really value being a well rounded individual and having some social competency. I don't know how engineers are in that regard, though.

33,Freeze Dryer: Does condenser need to be outside of drying chamber?,1588966652,"&amp;#x200B;

This is my second post about freeze dryers. I have learned a lot but still have a few questions. One is: does cold trap/condenser need to be separate and outside of the drying chamber? 

\[Pics of Harvest right and a commercial Freeze Dryer\]([https://imgur.com/gallery/PUlJYR3](https://imgur.com/gallery/PUlJYR3))

As is shown in this experimental build: [https://youtu.be/obhYSf1ogoo?t=57](https://youtu.be/obhYSf1ogoo?t=57) it is separate. The harvest right one has ice depositing right on the walls of drying chamber. So chamber air does not pass through a trap. I also checked out one commercial unit. That one also has ice deposition happening in the drying chamber itself, on the coils at the bottom. 

What my understanding is that vapor deposits on cold surface even if its not made to pass through the trap. My visualization of gas molecules traveling at fast speeds and skipping the wall surface is I guess wrong. Because at that vacuum level vapor probably moves slowly and vapor pressure difference probably is driving that.  Am I thinking right? or is there something else going on which I am not aware of. It makes sense to keep it in same chamber because you want to reduce the distance as much as possible.  


I am thinking about building a freeze dryer hopefully similar to the commercial one in picture. Manufacturer is selling that unit for around $76,00 for 100kg (\~220 lb) capacity and $55,000 for 50 kg (\~110 lb) capacity of ice. Anyone with any interest or guidance about building any part of the system is welcome. I am starting from scratch. I was just consumer of freeze dried food until few weeks ago.

Currently I am a junior doing bachelors degree in EE and I’m wondering if doing an additional degree (bachelors or masters) in CS would be useful. I have prior internship experience at a defense company sophomore year but they had me so some basic programming to automate tasks and I also realized I don’t want to work in defense in general.

I wish I could have gotten more EE internships to know what’s it’s like to be in the field outside of classes.

The thing is, while my resume is heavy in software, those jobs didn’t require any real coding interview that a lot of CS majors have to do to land an internship at a big company.

45,"Recently moved, and have issues with monitors shaking whenever a train goes by..... Tips?",1588958739,"Hi all.  I recently moved to a new location.  It's a two story 1200 sq foot place near the CN rail main line.  It's roughly 130 meters away with a large berm in place in between my condo complex and the rails.  The sound isnt an issue, but where I do have issue is I set my small office in an upstairs room.  Whenever a train passes by, the entire upstairs shakes a small bit.    I have an ikea galant L shaped desk with the T style legs.  If I tap the desk, it is apparent that the stability isnt perfect.  This is also on a carpet.  I have tried to level it as much as possible.  Essentially I am trying to make the best of the situation as I like the place and location, but I find it distracting when trains are constantly passing by and my setup shakes.  I put some foam under the monitors corners and it helps a little bit.  I also put some window foam on the side of my speakers and butted the lcd's up to them to avoid that.  

I ordered some anti vibration pads off Amazon, but I then realised it is likely more about the movement and not vibrations.  Perhaps a more solid stable desk?

Attaching a picture.  Essentially I am looking for any and all tips just to make the issue as small as possible.  Thanks for any help...

48,Should I pay 65k for a masters in engineering?,1588958345,"So I'm in a unique situation. I did my BS in biomedical engineering and went to medical school right after. Long story short, I ended up ""leaving"" medical school because of some bull shit with the administration. Luckily I hated medicine and highly prefer engineering. However, I was applying all over the place and didn't get any interviews (applied to 100+ positions in locations heavily geared towards biotech). On top of that, it seems like the jobs that are easier to get for my degree are in quality, which I have no interest in (did a stint between undergrad in med school and hated it). I decided that I'd get a masters in mechanical engineering to 1) prepare myself for a change in fields (mechatronics, R&amp;D), 2) beef up my resume, and 3) make up for the withdrawal from medical school on my record. I'm also wondering whether I want to end up in the industry vs going into research.

I got into every school I applied to, and am heavily considering the top name research university I got into that would cost me about 65k for the entire degree. The other schools I got into are definitely lower tier, and the cheapest one (13k) is not in an ideal location (for me to live in as well as to get jobs in biotech). But it's a state school and their program is actually pretty good (definitely not as good as the former though). I'm really leaning towards the 65k one because of their name, program, and track record of career placement post-graduation.

75,Finding a Cross-Discipline job in a tough economy.,1588928974,"I am a 24 year old Nuclear Engineer and have currently been working as an operator trainee for a university research reactor for almost 1 year now. My qualifications are all complete and management has approved me for NRC licensing. Currently, I’m just waiting on the NRC to show up. The NRC said They’d tentatively schedule for July back before the whole Coronavirus thing started and management is not hopeful for them to keep their word. Likely, I’m looking at a several month delay. After taking the test, I’m looking at another 2 months for my license to be processed and will not receive a raise until the license comes in. So right now I’m in a potential 6 month limbo, despite finishing my qualifications in half the time of the average operator. I was told that I was in control of my raise. That by working hard and finishing qualifications quickly, I’d get my license quicker and subsequently get a raise sooner. However this delay has thrown much of that work by the wayside. But I guess that’s bureaucracy for ya. And plus I’m blessed to still be employed. 

Anyways. Coming out of college, I had intended on finding a job in the same city as my girlfriend (who is also an engineer), but did not find anything. (Note, there are no nuclear based jobs or companies in that city) I took this job 2 hrs away to try and build up my resume and intended on resuming that search after obtaining my RO license. She and I are now at the point where I am ready to propose and have the ring, but I would like to have our distance situation resolved prior to taking that step. Unfortunately, this whole virus thing has made jobs scarce and most companies are on a hiring freeze or slowdown. 
In addition, working this shift work hasn’t been wonderful on my health or daily routine. 

I’m quite interested in either piping/thermodynamic systems or materials engineering and would like to find something related to those fields. I did a lot of work with material analysis for Gen 4 reactors, including standard mechanical stresses along with issues with neutron damage. And I’m just good with thermo and enjoy it. 

Btw. My current base pay is $54,600, but after overtime, I will have made $60,000 this first year. The raise for the license put me at around $70,000/year after overtime. Jobs in the city I’m looking at typically have starting pays between $55,000-$70,000, so its a pretty sideways to potentially a slightly downward move. 

Also, for anyone who asks, the town I am in doesn’t have much work for her, and she’d likely take a $20,000/year pay cut IF she found something here. We have also looked at both finding an entirely new place with jobs for both of us, but finding two jobs at the same time in this market wouldn’t be easy.

86,How important are listing assumptions in your reports for work/school?,1588912921,"Hello, I'm currently helping with a first-year engineering course where the students are learning C programming. As part of each homework, the students are required to write a program design report. It includes sections for a problem description, inputs, outputs, assumptions, method, and pseudocode/logic flow. I've noticed that many of them list only one or two assumptions that are just commonly just one or two specific requirements from the homework description.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to share information about the importance of listing your assumptions as you seek to solve an engineering problem/designing a program. I don't expect them to write every possible assumption in the sky, but there are some easy ones that they should realize quickly when programming in C. One big example for this is that if there isn't a requirement to do extremely thorough input checking (first years) then a good assumption is that the user of the program will not enter invalid types such as characters when numbers are requested.

&amp;#x200B;

In my reports, I've always tried to list my assumptions as part of the report as this not only shows the perspective or direction I am approaching a problem from, but also helps to explain the solution I reached. In my Physics and ECE courses, we make assumptions all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is your experience with assumptions in reports? For professional engineers, do you list out assumptions in your reports and if so what are some examples of assumptions you'd list? If not, why? 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Again this is coming from a student/grader and I'm not trying to smash any of the student's heads in on this but just want to get some perspective from more experienced engineers and hopefully share them with the students.

 Engineer here. Have a Masters degree in Materials Science and Engineering, for whatever reason.

I've always been on the floor in production.  Especially at my last job, our senior machinist was responsible for programming 4-axis CNC machines, designing fixtures, and running the machines to actually make the product that the customer is paying for.  What I observed is ALL of our design engineers (and me, the manufacturing engineer) relied on his knowledge base.  Design needs to be fixed?  Call up the machinist.  Something isn't correct with the original fixture that a design engineer made?  Call up the machinist.  

He's not the only machinist I've met in our area who fixes all of the engineer's mistakes, but gets paid a lot less for it.  Sure I can do time studies and interface with design engineers during review, but at the end of the day I couldn't handle making product in time to be profitable.  I feel like my role and other engineer's roles add on a lot of overhead ($$$) without justification for how our presence affects profit margins.

As such, when I'm looking for new roles I feel guilty asking for more than $65K.  (For comparison, my coworkers who are engineers with the same amount of experience make upwards of $85-90K, and grumble about being underpaid).

I have worked with all different types of I&amp;E equipment and I rarely run into anything which I haven't seen before or seen something like it before, nothing is really an interesting challenge anymore, just something I need to burn more time on.  

I am now so knowledgeable about I&amp;E equipment in refineries that I can get a job anywhere in the US at almost any major oil and gas company (I have had numerous offers when interviewing at most all the supermajors).

Mainly in that most everything I have to burn time on in my job is of a technical nature and not a managerial and commercial nature, so its difficult to do things which score big resume boosting bullet points to move into a commercial and managerial role.

How can I go about my search and how do I address my situation to employers?,1588882009,"Hi, any advice is greatly appreciated. 

I went back and forth a lot during *and* after college about what sort of engineering I wanted to do. I've been out of college for almost a year, and even took a pretty long break from job hunting while I tried to figure out what I actually wanted to use my degree for, I tried a number of different personal engineering projects to rule things out. 

I've decided I want to do DSP on embedded platforms (my engineering concentration was embedded systems). However my junior year internship was an unpaid, low-stress, lab research assistant position where I did a lot of very high-level Python and Tensorflow. 

I've still been applying to full-time jobs, but I feel *severely* limited by the fact that not only was my internship in a vastly different field and using very different skills and technologies, but also that it was a significantly different environment from most tech industry work.

I honestly think an embedded internship would be a good ""reset button"" for me. But I guess this isn't the norm. Most internships I see advertised ""require"" that the candidate either be finishing college or still in college. While I don't think this will keep me from applying, would employers legitimately look at my resume and go ""hm, nah, this guy already graduated. Pass.""?

For MI composites, they have a higher density (98%), which makes them more conductive of heat, and this is not desirable for turbine blades.

I've had 6 different, qualified and wise people give me advice on my resume, including a career center and a paid resume service. It's now been reformatted to the point where any suggestions are pretty much opinion and preference. That said, it is 1 and a half pages long. Many have told me to make it one page max, but I'm stubborn. Is this truly a big deal? It blows my mind that longer than a page would be a reason for ruling me out as a good candidate. In fact if it is, I don't think I want to work there. How long my resume is has no influence on my abilities. I can't buy that it's about respecting a hiring manager's time if they can't respect mine. I spent 8 years on that resume, and probably 30 minutes redundantly filling in little text boxes with information that's already on said resume, so call me crazy but giving me 5 minutes shouldn't be all that bad.


I do have a few standards:

I won't work in the pharmaceutical industry

I won't work for defense contractors

I won't use a profile image on my LinkedIn


I know entry level positions are a numbers game, but honestly, why? 

Why should I need to become a master of superficiality just to get noticed? That's why I went in to engineering. Y'all are supposed to be objective. Every field uses different jargon, I get that, but judging me for using ""moment"" instead of ""torque"" (true story) will keep me from applying to your company again.

Whatever way of thinking is preventing entry level engineers from being taken seriously out of school is really disappointing. I hope anyone in a place to do something about that takes this to heart. I could have done so much in the last 8 months, but instead I'm complaining about the futility of being taken seriously on Reddit. Amidst a pandemic that I could at least be helping assemble ventilators for..

32,"Studying EE, questioning if it's the best choice for control systems engineering",1588868287,"Hi everyone,

I'm a student in my second year of engineering. It was general entry, so there was a common first year. I pondered my decision a lot - I've found  enjoyment in nearly everything I've studied so far (with the exception of biology in first year)

I realized I did really enjoy electrical, but I also enjoyed parts of mechanical. I considered going into mechatronic, but at the time I was thinking I'd rather have deep knowledge on one or the other.. I also didn't want to miss the EE modules I would've missed. I  heard the job market for mechatronic engineering wasn't great as well. I really like courses that use high level mathematics, and I saw EE had more of that. So far I have enjoyed EE (with the exception of networks) and I haven't questioned my choice until now.

I did a module on dynamic systems (Ogata's textbook) and I really liked it. I looked more into it and came across control engineering. I researched it and it sounds like my dream engineering job. They don't have to use excel all the time and they get to directly participate in some pretty good projects. I've also heard that with a few years experience and contacts, it's a market that is open to startups.

I decided to check which degree was most suited to it. This is where I got a lot of conflicting information. One person was claiming nearly all his colleagues studied EE, while another was saying the majority were ME. Yet another was saying that mechatronic was the best choice for it.

I wouldn't study mechanical on it's own because alone I don't find it very interesting. I'm also naturally more suited to EE. My question is: Which degree is most suited to control systems engineering? Will I be at a disadvantage with EE, or an advantage? Ignoring the pain of starting the year again, would mechatronic be the right direction? Thanks anyone who gives me guidance.

37,Does the Erasmus worth it?,1588864779,"Hello everybody.
I'm a mechanical engineering Italian student, winner of the ""Erasmus+ for study"" grant.
I should go in Erlangen (Germany) next September/October studying and living for a semester over there.
Even considering the covid virus and what's going on around the world right now, I should move to Erlangen necessarily in the October/February semester. That's because my master degree includes a whole semester dedicated to traineeship and this doesn't allow me to choose differently.
Well, what I'm asking myself is if the Erasmus really worth it. I mean:
1. My uni provides really good and wide preparation in my opinion, so am I going to find a comparable one abroad (at the erlangen-norimberg FAU University)? The courses I choose to attend there will substitute the similar one I'd attend remaining here, and I wouldn't like to ""loose"" part of that good didactic I already know.
2. Moreover, there's no chance to substitute the only one compulsory subject in my university with one of the FAU. That means I should study it on my own once back in Italy.
3. None of the other people I know will go in Erlangen, so costs (accomodation, food, transports) would be a little higher and, a lot less relevant, I wouldn't know anyone.
4. Since the second semester (March/June) is totally dedicated to the traineeship, I could have more infos, contacts and tips remaining here instead of being abroad. Even because the traineeship can often mean a future first job for us.
5. Considering the traineeship, I'd stay in total almost an year away from home, in a period where I'm perfectly conscious that will be maybe the last one beside my beloved ones.
Don't get me wrong, I think I'd really love to go abroad an live by my own.
In the meantime many people keep saying that Erasmus gives you an extra kick to your personal and professional life, I wonder how much is this extra kick and if does it worth it all the money, the stress and so on that it involves.

Images: [https://imgur.com/a/iJ2ykMv](https://imgur.com/a/iJ2ykMv)

Location: Tasmania - Repulse Dam

Constraints:

 The plunge pool has not been drained during its 50 years in operation and understanding of the existing conditions of the plunge pool and river channel are limited;

 The river bed is known to be a mixture of bedrock and aluvial gravels, exact depth and location however is uncertain;

 There is a localised high point in the river approx 75m downstream of the dam which prevents the water in the plunge pool from naturally draining away if the power station is off and water level is lowered at the next dam downstream;

 The use of divers had been considered to conduct an inspection in the plunge pool however due to the sediment in the water, visibility is too poor to be successful;

 The base of the Repulse plunge pool is RL 92.3m. There is also a concrete sill at the downstream edge of the plunge pool with an RL 94.1m;

 The operating range of Cluny dam downstream is between RL 92.96m to RL 97.8m. The ability to control the water level within this range is considered to be very high. Note that when this water level is high, it does back up to the base of Repulse dam;

 It is estimated that the backwater effects of operating the Repulse power station will raise the water level in the vacinity of the plunge pool by at least 1m but exact details have not been previously documented;

 Repulse power station may be turned off for up to a maximum of 36 hours however this will involve several days of planning in order to create sufficient storage room in the dams upstream; and

 Reliability of Repulse power station is a concern due to its age, as such it is usually left on running at a steady state. Trying to turn the station on and off multiple times a day (say more than 2) may become problamatic. If the Repulse station trips or breaks down during our site works and can not be returned to service, we may have only a matter of hours before it becomes unsafe to work downstream of the dam or the dam begins to spill.

I've never really had much luck in these types of subreddits. Hope somebody here can help. 

I googled for quite some time. Didn't really find much that I could understand. 

So I was looking at a battery-powered Templo Devices guitar amplifier (solid-state), and it got me wondering, ""what if you ran a Fender Twin Reverb off of it. The Fender Twin Reverb puts out 135 watts RMS at the output. A quick google search said that a tube amp generally draws 2.5 to 2.8 times the output wattage, so we're looking at 365 watts. It has a peak output of around 300 watts, so I would think we would want some headroom to avoid drawing too much current and burning up the battery, right? So how would I battery-power something that regularly consumes nearly 400 watts?

I'm currently a junior at UCLA majoring in molecular, cell and developmental bio. Recently, I've fancied the idea of going to grad school for a masters in biomedical/bioengineering since I don't really want to go the premed route and developing new medical devices/tissues sounds really interesting to me. However, the classes I've taken so far here have not really given me the best background in engineering, since I do not have the most rigorous math/engineering coursework. However, I am planning on taking linear algebra, diff eq, and systems analysis of nonlinear systems of differential equations my senior year. The only requirement I'm worried about now is the fact the physics courses I took were not calculus based.

74,"Do online applications only exist for ""equal opportunity employer"" benefits?",1588815932,"This is a serious question.

Who started the rumor that you could be qualified for a job, apply for that job, and be considered for that job?

It's not true. 

Not today, anyway. In fact I haven't found a single case (from people I have asked) of anyone getting an engineering job recently who didn't already have a connection, whether that be a friend, a college recruiter, or someone they met at a bar.

If you disagree, I'm willing to bet you haven't tried to get a job in the last 8 months.

Back in February I posted about my struggle to get responses from job openings for biomedical engineers. At that point I was about 700 applications deep and had only heard back from 7 places, all but one being rejections. At that point the economy still existed. I received some good advice from commenters, made some changes to my LinkedIn and resume, and went back to applying. 

I am approaching 1000 applications now, and have received a grand total of 3 actual job inquiries, all of which have ghosted me after the phone screening.

Interestingly, in the last two months, I have received significantly more rejection emails. It seems it took a pandemic for that to happen, but in the words of my most recent cold calling debt collector, ""Too bad there's nobody hiring now.""

Here's right. It is.

Too bad unemployment is impossible to get now.
Too bad my edu loan payments are due now.
Too bad I thought I'd be taken seriously by now.

Even before COVID-19 I had tried about everything, including faxing my applications and showing up uninvited to companies and handing it out (which seemed the most promising pre-covid, but I still got ghosted).


TL;DR

After 8 years, 3 college degrees and 1000 applications, all I need is one interview.

Being patient is no longer an option.

Yes, I've had my resume and cover letters proofread. Yes, I do follow-up phone calls. No, I'm not incompetent.

76,Would volunteer to management that a 3rd party product could replace your internal product for cheaper?,1588813069,"A few years ago when I was a new hire I designed a custom industrial control solution. It's a small PCB that replaces several of the old PCBs that have been in our products for years. However, the company ran into financial problems (industry wide, the company is solid) and we never deployed the solution because they didn't want to spend on R&amp;D at the time.

Now, in the face of corona virus related slow downs and less orders, they are looking to revive old cost saving projects. Management remembered this one and wants to deploy it. The solution would be put in a lot of our products ( industrial machinery). Having this solution widely deployed would be more job security for me since I designed it and wrote the software.

However, in the time since then, off the shelf PLC-type solutions have improved and dropped in price. I am pretty sure that we could use the cheapest solution from a major brand and accomplish the same thing for cheaper, and maybe better (not to belittle myself, but my one man project is not as slick as whatever Siemens or Rockwell whoever has a whole product team working on).

The cost of components for my solution is much cheaper, but the overall cost to the company is higher when you factor in the labor to assemble and test each unit. Which further complicates the question, because not building my solution would be taking away work from our electronics lab staff.

Should I tell management that we should abandon my in house solution and go with the cheaper 3rd party solution?

They’re offering an hourly rate that would add up to around $150k (not including overtime).

Financially it seems like it would be more even considering benefits at my current company, but given the current economy and job prospects, I’m hesitant to leave a full-time position for a contract. I’m also worried this company would hire me as a contractor, use me as much as possible for the term, and then say they don’t have room for me and I’d be jobless in a terrible aerospace industry.

6,Is it possible to make the switch from hvac/plumbing design engineer to state/county Civil engineer? How would I go about doing this?,1588783561,"I'm an hvac/plumbing design engineer for a private company. I want to work for the state/county, but there's largely only civil engineering positions available. I do however feel that my job skills and experience at least somewhat relates to some of the civil positions.    

A little bit about me - I'm 26, have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, and have been working at a small private consulting firm (\~30 employees, less than 10 of those are in the mechanical department)  for 3 years. I don't have a PE or EIT. I have been debating for a long time whether engineering is even a good fit for me, as I have been very stressed out at my current job. I think I'm pretty close to burnout, as I constantly feel fatigued, tired, lack of energy and am even beginning to stop caring about my work. I dont have the desire to ""learn more"", and I'm growing more contempt for my coworkers who game the system and work 6-8 hours a day while I'm stuck working 10+ hours a day as I continually get more work from my bosses because ""my quality of work is much better and my bonus will certainly reflect that"". However, we have to wait 12 months for our annual bonus in December and it pays damn near straight-time (or less) on the overtime that I work. Meanwhile coworkers take 30-45 minute ""bathroom"" breaks multiple times a day and leave at the drop of a dime at 4:59pm. My supervisors give me MORE work 15 minutes to 1 hour after I was already supposed to have left. Now I know this sounds like a problem where I need to just start getting up and leaving, but I've been here for nearly 3 years and nothing has changed, no matter what I try.    

I know working for the county/state wont solve a ""passion for engineering"" problem, but I feel if I had a job where I was at least *supposed to* be out of the office at 5, and was in a job/setting with much more structure, I'd be very motivated to get my job done, I'd look forward to work because of a better work/life balance, and I'd feel much more energetic towards my career instead of constantly feeling drained and used.   

I've been at my current company for 3 years doing hvac/plumbing design. I work under a few PEs who are very knowledgeable, but, since our firm is so small (and mech department even smaller), it is very demanding by nature.  Some of the things I've worked on are typical hvac/plumbing design for public works, public/private offices or tenant improvements, medical buildings, substations, trailers, etc. Sewage ejector pumps/wet well design, cost estimates, quantity take-offs, specifications, coordinating with other disciplines (such as architectural, structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, civil, etc), sizing piping systems, designing water piping systems/sewer piping systems/storm drain systems, construction support (RFIs and submittal), creating record drawings, attending project meetings and conferences/construction meetings, checking codes and regulations, responding to plan check comments, creating engineering basis of design or conceptual engineering reports, drafting or checking drafting work of others, among other things.    

I dont know if it's just my current job that has me feeling down on engineering, but one of my biggest strengths is my ability to adapt. I kind of tell myself sometimes that I may not be the perfect example of what it means to be good at engineering, but I could've gotten a degree in anything because I can adapt and learn or pass a class in anything. I can very easily connect the dots when someone is teaching me something, no matter what it is. I think this trait has helped me get to where I am now.   

Now, when browsing the state/county jobs, I do see that some of the civil engineering jobs do mention ""Civil engineering B.S. degree or closely related field"" and some of them do even mention ""A Bachelor's degree Civil Engineering or closely related field (such as Mechanical or Electrical Engineering)."" So this gave me some hope.   

What tips would you give for someone who's desperate to make this switch? Is it doable? What should I mention in my cover letter, resume, or free-responses in a job application? What advice would you give to someone in this position?

10,Horsepower Calculation for Motor for Pedelec Design,1588775426,"I am try to design a pedelec (electrically powered/assisted bicycle) for my senior project as a mechanical engineering technology student. We are in the research portion and I am working on acquiring a ballpark estimate for how much horsepower will be required (most ""affordable"" models have 250W hub motors). since there are many variables and I haven't selected a frame or gear set, the values I used are arbitrary.

1st I assumed the motor will be delivering the most power at rest or shortly after rest, making me able to perform calculations at equilibrium. I am also basing my calculations on the torque generated from traditional pedaling to simulate the power that the motor will need to deliver. Assuming CCW as positive and the rider putting all of their weight on the pedal when the crank arm is parallel to the ground, I determined the tension in the chain by summing the forces at the pedals:

 **(Chain Tension (lb) x radius of main sprocket (in)) - (rider weight (lb) x crank length(in)) = 0**

suppose the tension in the chain comes out to be **225 lb**, if the driven gear in the back had a radius of **2 in.** This would result in a torque of **450 in-lb** in the driven gear.

This is the point where I am struggling. What is the best way to take this further to get an estimation of how much torque is required to break equilibrium? Taking into account the weight of the bike itself and any friction experienced at the wheels. As of right now, I only took the **450 in-lb** as the final torque, multiplied it by **25 rpm** (25 rpm obtained from (motor activation speed 3 ft/sec **/** wheel circumference 7ft) x 60 sec) and divided this by **63205.** This is giving me a value of **0.178 hp** or about **133 watts**.

Currently, all of these adjustments are made manually in accordance with presets made in Excel.

28,"Engineers, help me propose to my girlfriend with drones + Lights!",1588745648,"Hey guys, hoping for some help.

My (27) Girlfriend (26) and I have been together for four years. When we first started dating, she and I would drive out to a beautiful Georgia field and put a blanket down on top of my old car and look at stars together. Sometimes it was a field, sometimes it was just in town even when most stars were obstructed, sometimes it was camping or just the back yard, didn't matter. It was our thing, and we remember it very fondly, and even do it from time to time, even after we moved elsewhere together.

I want to spell out ""I love you, \[Name\]"" and make it appear to be written with the stars.

My original idea was to rent one of those services that do drone light shows, and have them spell it out. I checked out:

 [https://dronelightshowcompany.com/drone-light-shows/](https://dronelightshowcompany.com/drone-light-shows/) Which is about $18,000. This is impossible for me to afford for obvious reasons haha.  [http://www.hireuavpro.com/drone-light-shows/](http://www.hireuavpro.com/drone-light-shows/) was like $35,000. These are so insanely outside of my budget, which is at absolute maximum (because I am already buying a nice ring) like a few hundred bucks. It's not a matter of wanting to pay for it, I'd give her the world, its a matter of possibility to do so.

 [https://skymagic.show/](https://skymagic.show/)  where I have submitted an inquiry, but I doubt the cost is significantly lower than the former options.

So these ideas are out the window, unless one of these companies feels extremely generous, which I doubt. So I've come up with an alternative: I don't need dozens of lighted drones doing a pattern; I need to rent four drones programmed to hold a large net with LEDs attached to the net in the pattern I need. Like the hold the four corners of the ""Star Sign"". I want it to look somewhat like the stars, but obviously it wont look as good as the full drone experience, but I want to do the best that I can on a realistic budget. It needs to be pretty large, so that when it's 50 or 100 ft in the air, its actually readable. That brings me here.

Does anyone have ***alternative*** ideas?

What kind of lights or LEDs should I use?

What kind of power source? Will it be too heavy?

36,Teaching to Engineering: Is the grass greener?,1588729202,"Lurker here. I’ve pored over existing posts on this topic, taken career quizzes, and commiserated with my inner circle. Figured it’s time to get out of my bubble and ask the engineers.   If this is not the right place for these questions, please redirect accordingly.

I have a master’s in EE from a well-known institution. Somehow came out with a good GPA but limited practical skills. Due to a massive case of impostor syndrome, positive experiences with TA positions, and needing a job ASAP, I became a high school physics teacher. Time flew by and I’ve taught for almost 10 years now. However, I miss learning new things and feeling like I accomplished something. Plus, I’m actually a socially awkward introvert who hates public speaking.  What I'm decent at is math, spatial reasoning, documentation, paying attention to details, organizing. I enjoy coming up with plans and seeing them through.  Generally I prefer well-defined tasks over open-ended problems.

1. How would I go about figuring out whether engineering is a good second career, whether the grass is really greener?  I suspect that working in engineering is different from taking classes. I do have summers free to explore, although I'm not sure internships are a thing for people 10 years out of school.  
2. Can someone become a successful engineer if they don't have a strong passion for it? (i.e. if they don't build things or code for fun)

37,Journalists are investigating the dumpster fire of a company I work at. How worried should I be?,1588728638,"Lately, I've heard that a few journalists from different tech blog/news websites have started digging into the situations surrounding my company. I've even heard that they are starting to contact employees to see who is willing to anonymously interviewed.

From what I know, the problems at my company aren't blatantly dangerous or illegal like Boeing's 737 Max or Theranos, but there was definitely a lot of mismanagement, breaking promises to investors, and burning bridges with vendors. Some former employees that left a while ago have publicly mentioned the turmoil on LinkedIn, which is probably where these journalists got their initial leads from. I can't help but think of companies like Theranos, WeWork, Away, Farady Future, Juicero, and probably more, that eventually imploded after getting exposed by journalists.

If the worse comes to worst and journalists start publishing articles, how will future hiring managers perceive my resume? Will this impact whether I get responses after applying to jobs? I hope I don't end up like some Theranos employees who've had to obfuscate the Theranos name on their resumes like in this CNN article (https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/tech/theranos-employees/index.html).",AskEngineers,False,federaltart,/r/AskEngineers/comments/geaou5/journalists_are_investigating_the_dumpster_fire/

So I'm an undergraduate mechanical engineering student currently enrolled at a community college and I'm planning on transferring to UT Dallas either fall or spring of 2021, so I've still got a very very long way to go until I receive my bachelor's degree. I was wondering what sort of career path within mechanical engineering would allow me to help to fight climate change as that is becoming a very large issue.

Is there anything else along those lines that would have to do with a mechanical engineering degree? Or any companies that deal with climate change that need mechanical engineers? I would love to know so that I could possibly start applying to internships for whatever companies those are since I'm still exploring and want to know more about what kind of work I'll be doing for the rest of my life essentially. I've also considered pursuing a master's degree or even a PhD since I want to go as far in my education as I can before I land any job as an engineer.

One of my coworkers suggested we use an assumed velocity and just calculate the channel time based on length and velocity. But I don't have any reasoning behind assuming a specific speed. I wouldn't think I could just assume 3 ft/s without good reason.

63,Troubleshooting can bus by checking resistance,1588693971,"I am trying to repair a liquid handling machine which sometimes is not able to detect one or more motors. I found out that all the motors are connected daisy chained to a high speed can bus and I identified CANL and CANH. Today I turned off all power and measured the resistance between CANL and CANH. It was 64.5 ohm:

https://i.imgur.com/BBziQmn.png

Next I disconnected the CANL and CANH connection between motor 1 and 2 (I expect to measure ~120 ohm) but I measured two different resistance values between CANL and CANH on both sides as you can see on the bottom of the picture.

The side that goes to the mainboard has a resistance value of 137.8 ohm and the other side 120.8 ohm. When I removed all motors from the equitation (I measured directly at the mainboard) I got 137.8 Ohm too, so it's not coming from a defective motor.

Is this normal or should I expect the exact same resistance value on both sides? Right now the liquid handling machine is running unreliable. Sometimes it complains it can not detect one or more motors and I don't know why - but I guess it is something with the can bus. I disassembled one motor but it looks fine to me. It looks like when I plug/unplug motors from the system or if I power off/on the machine it eventually runs for a few hours or days but after that the error message keeps poping up here and then.

The the main components of the dryer are a fan, a heating element, and a timer. I took high school Electrical Physics, so I have a very basic understanding of whats going on. As I see it, there are two options:

a) Place a wire cutting the heating element out of the circuit all together. From what I know, this would increase the current and may damage the fan or something else.

b) Make the heating element shorter. I can lift one of the loops of the heating element and place it onto the next loop, therefore shortening the heating element. I don't know if this would actually reduce the overall heat produced.

82,Thinking of quitting my engineering career after 5 years in the Aerospace industry,1588673762,"This is my first Reddit post actually.  I feel like I had many other things (non-engineering related) that I could have posted about but I guess this was the last straw.  I don't know where to start but let me start by saying I just don't have it in me anymore.  I  personally believe that if you love something the flow is smooter, i.e. you learn faster and you will excel at it.  This was the case with me when I was in university and the early part of my careeer.  I was a really enthusiastic person and I did excel at engineering, but then again that's properly all I had in my life.  The only thing that keeps me going is the money and the status of the title of Aerospace Engineering.  From where I am from (Balkans), Aerospace Engineering is seen as a dream job and the perfect career.  The really problem is my concentration and abilty solve problems.  It is getting harder and harder as time goes by for me to focus and solve problems.  Once I solve it and analyze it etc etc then the problem of writing a report which really tires me out.  I really hate writing reports.  But it is part of my job and it is a ""must"".  Analyse, solve, simulate and then you must write a report.  The worst thing is that I look at some of my friends who weren't particulary great at university but yet have excelled in their careers' further than me.  I feel like taking a career break but I've saved enough money to buy a house and I don't want to throw that away.  Before anyone says.   Yes I suffered with depression and Anxiety.  There was a lot of pressure for me to succeed imposed upon me by my parents when I was a teenager and when I was at university.  But now that I am 28, it's my life and my choices really.

Do any of you see any value in getting a DBA (Doctor of Buissnes Admin) or DIT (Doctor of IT) online if I could get my employer to pay for it?

84,Currently grad student in Mechanical Eng. interested in Control systems and automation where do I start?,1588669962,"Hello! I’m a recent graduate in Mechanical Engineering one year out from getting my masters in Mechanical, as well. I had no clue what sort of work I’d be interested in pursuing in the field until recently reading up on what Control Systems/automation Engineers do. It really caught my attention and seems very exciting to me. And seeing as this subreddit is often very helpful and I’m seeking some advice.

What can I do start doing now to effectively pursue potential internships or jobs as a Control Systems engineer?

I understand I should be looking more into PLC and DCS. Are there any specific resources or books you guys recommend for a mechanical like me to begin getting a basic understanding or grasp of these? I know PLC can vary somewhat from company to company and I’m trying to get a general understanding. Something that will give me a good basis without being too overwhelming. I’m willing to put in the time and effort to learn I’m just a slow learner. The most experience I have in something related would be a course called Modeling of Physical Systems. At the end of it we made some basic automatic control systems in Matlab/Simulink which I really enjoyed. I’m taking another course this summer specifically in Modern Control Systems as well. I’m planning to continue working with Simulink and learning it’s ins and out.

I’ve also seen some folks mention that some of the smaller companies (external integrators and automation distribution) aside from bigger companies like Emerson or Rockwell, are good about hiring entry levels and helping them get their hands dirty when it comes to learning on the job. Are there any specific companies you might recommend looking into.

All advice is very helpful even if it’s just where to start.

90,Ho do I pick up a specialization field for masters?,1588661574,"I did my Bachelors in Electronics and communication engineering. Upon graduation, I thought I would work for two years and study masters abroad. So I started looking for jobs core to electronics and communications engineering but to no avail. Most of the electronics engineering graduates in my country seem to settle into software development and IT jobs whereas the majority of them pursue their careers abroad in the US and Europe. Like many of my classmates I went for GRE preparation classes but I quit it after the first day as I thought I wouldn't be able to afford the class and examination fee. So I managed to get a job in software development. I worked there for more than a year but had to quit due to some issues with my eyes. I had developed a lot of floaters, double vision, ghosting, headaches and stuff like that. Its almost 10 months now since I left the job. During this time I did nothing significant. I searched for job opportunities in telecommunications, teachings, government but without any success.

As time passes by, I have this feeling of having done nothing or like my life is stagnant. I don't think I  want to work all day in front of computers as my eyes won't be able to tolerate it. So I am looking for a career that doesn't require me to work with computers only.  There are a handful of telecommunication companies like Huawei and ZTE and I already applied to them multiple times but got no reply. So its a really grim situation for those who study electronics and communication engineering in Nepal. Sometimes it feels like I missed the train and I should have gone with the GRE route even if it would place a huge financial pressure on my family.

As a result I am super confused right now about my career as an Electronics engineer. Since there aren't jobs or opportunities I can think of in my country, I thought I would apply for scholarships and pursue a masters degree abroad and try my luck there. I would like to get involved in some kind of research but that seems to be a herculean task given my current situation as  I don't know about the field I would like to specialize. During my bachelors, I never excelled or liked one particular subject. I feel like I am a jack of all and master of none. It feels like I have wasted so much time and still don't have a clear picture of my career.

So my question is has anyone gone through this stage? It may sound weird that I want to get involved in some research works/ engineering jobs that are more than just sitting in front of computers all day long but I don't seem to able to pick up a topic/purpose for specialization. The fields that I can think of right now are Robotics and automation, wireless telecommunications(5G stuffs), semiconductors and electronic devices, IOT; but I am not sure.

4,How do you deal with career insecurity?,1588646297,"Disclaimer: kind of rant/off my chest post but related to engineering.

I’m coming up on my 4 year anniversary from when I graduated with my BSME, and I don’t really feel like I’m going anywhere. 

As of recently, I feel like my job hasn’t progressed at all. I’ve been feeling increasingly “left behind” in that I don’t really feel like a real engineer. 

I’ve been holding down an “application engineer” position the entire time at the same company, and while it is somewhat technical, I feel like I don’t have real engineering skills. 

After about the two year mark I started telling my employer that I want more out of my role, but I feel like I’ve been swept under the rug. Like they won’t give me training on anything, they won’t consider me for other roles. I’ve had pay bumps but they won’t even update my title in the system even though they told me it was changed; nothing ever feels official. I just feel forgotten. 

This goes back to school where I was desperate for a job at graduation time and just could not get interviews. I had really good grades (3.8 final) and some stuff to put on my resume, but I just could not get anything to materialize. It made feel depressed. 

I know I’m not entitled to anything, but I feel like I never got a chance to show what I’m capable of. The people who would come to me for help with work would always come tell me how they got internships at great companies, ones that I applied to and never heard back from. I did not perceive them as more capable than me. I know any task they were given I could have done as well or better if given the guidance. 

I would always say “that’s awesome man congrats” but internally I was jealous that they would get noticed. Maybe I was naive? I was told grades are important, but I guess not really. Maybe they had cool personal projects? I don’t know, I figured most of us were in the same boat. It’s all a game.

After 6-8 months of rejection I was beat down. So I took the first offer I got. Some small no-name company you’ve never heard of. $50k starting salary in 2016. I was content at the time, but deep down I knew it was pathetic

At that point, I was pretty low. Didn’t negotiate because I had no skills. I convinced myself I wasn’t worth more or capable of more. I stuck around for too long because I convinced myself that no other place would take me. “Maybe if I do really well I will get moved up”. “I just have to prove myself”. 

Now 4 years later, I’m dying in my current role. It’s no challenge. It’s just mindless work for me. I don’t get any progression. It’s dead end, and it took me 3 years to realize it. I’ve stayed too long. Is this what all that work was for?  I could’ve been something, I sold myself short. But how can I say that when I could not lock down opportunity? 

I’ve sent out resumes to other entry-level roles that interest me, but it’s the same that it’s always been. I trapped myself, and now the new economy is crushing me. I know I can do more but how can you start when the first step feels like a 100 ft cliff? I never got my foot in the door. I guess I deserve it.

19,Can someone explain how electronic thermometers work?,1588625059,"I have a meat thermometer and a K probe in my multimeter and I assume they work the same way - there is some kind of resistor at the end of a metal probe, and temperature changes the resistance of this element. The device reads that voltage drop and multiplies it by some constant to get a certain temperature readout. 

Is this how they work? If so, I want to know more:

1. How linear is the relationship between resistance and temperature? I recently measured my oven thermometer using one of these probes and found a non-linear deviation between my oven and external thermometer - too hot on the cold end and too cold on the hot end, sort of an S shaped curve. 
2. Over what temperature range do these things typically work?
3. Do devices assume the resistance to temperature relationship is linear, or do they include some kind of calibration? Would the K probe in my 60 dollar multimeter have that? If I really wanted a really accurate thermometer from 0F-800F what would that entail?

I'm a mechanical engineer who works as a design engineer. The thing is, I avoid taking any projects that involve fair amount of movements and mechanisms simply because .. I don't get linkages. I studied them back in collage but it was bs. We didn't study them in depth as much as other courses like heat transfer, power generation, thermodynamics..etc, maybe because we where I live we consume much more we design and produce.

Anyway, I ended up working as a design engineer (in July, I'm going to complete my third year at my job), and believe me it's rare here to get this kind of positions, to design things from the scratch and manufacter it. I've been trying to make a career shift into something more common so my skills and experience can be of use but no luck yet. I'm trapped.
All that dosn't mean I don't want to be a better engineer. The job was not easy for me and I have had many bad days of anxieties and depression and I want this to end.

So one of my weak skills is linkages design. I want to get better at it. I couldn't find a good source to learn from, most are of high complexity which I can not understand by myself. Even in youtube I couldn't find anything. I always search for mechanisms, try to study the movment and analyses it but end up with many unanswered questions.

33,Confused about vacuum pumps.,1588615263,"I have what I truly think is a stupid question, but it seems nobody has ever asked this question on the internet.

Is there ANYTHING special about a vacuum pump that makes it a vacuum pump. I am looking to make a 500 gallon vacuum chamber and I am trying to determine the right pump for the job.

Most of the little portable pumps have too low of flow rates plus I have read that the duty of those pumps is so low and they should not be ran for more that 30 minutes at a time. I don't want filling this tank to take 70 hours. BUT I am not interested in spending 1000's of dollars on a higher duty pump that is rated to vacuums I will never need. I need to be able to pull 26 inHg which is pretty dang tall, but nothing compared to some vacuum pumps.

I had found [these pumps](https://hydrocomponents.us/collections/rotoflow-fluid-o-tech-rotary-vane-pumps/products/pa-2500-clamp-mount-brass-71-91-gph-1-18-1-52-gpm-3-8-npt-small-miniature-rotoflow-fluid-o-tech-rotary-vane-pumps) which are much cheaper even though they still require a motor that will run $100-200. It's not a vacuum pump, but it is still a rotary vane pump like most of the vacuum pumps you can buy. Somehow it has better flow rate specs than most of the expensive vacuum pumps, but I don't know why.

Can I make a vacuum pump out of any rotary vane pump? The pumps can come set to take gas fittings, so I am sure they move air. Would the actual flow rate remain the same? And how would I know what the vacuum rating would end up being? These are rated for pushing 100-200 psi while 26 inHg is only 13 psi lower than 1 Atm.

61,Designing a new fitness barbell and concerned about tensile strength,1588588822,"Hello everyone!  The engineer that I am working with is off for the week and I am trying to make some progress on my own in the meantime.  I also see this as an opportunity to learn and couldn’t help but be interested in the dynamics at play.

The product I am working on will load 300 pounds (max) of stress onto a threaded bar that separates into either two or three pieces (depending on another design decision).

The bar will be either 96cm for two pieces or 99cm for three pieces - with a diameter of roughly 3cm.

This product is supposed to be light and portable, while also being strong.  

The problem that I am facing is that, in my experience, many barbells aren’t rated for more than 300 pounds... so if I want to pull this off with a material like aluminum WHILE also probably being weaker at the points where it disconnects/connects, I feel that my work is cut out for me. 

Steel on the other hand comes in at a weight of 11 pounds and there still may be problems.

One hope that I have is that due to the shorter length of the bar, the weight that is pulling down on each end will cause less tension, and thus it could support more weight.  

I could definitely be wrong here though, as this intuition comes from my memory of levers and fulcrums in high school science.  

My two main questions are:

1. Does the length of the bar and the point at which force is being applied have an impact?  

2. Does the area where two bars are connected with inner/outer threading have reduced strength - or is it the same due to the total “thickness” of that area being the same?

I have had an idea about an aircraft that serves one purpose and it might finally be near a point to be realistic. It is for parachute sports. Bring 1-4 skydivers to an altitude of 5000 ft or higher as quickly as possible, hold altitude for 30s until jumpers are away, fall to earth a la spaceX to the landing area, swap out batteries and repeat.

There are obvious safety needs, but really the lack of luxury items is what might make it viable. No exterior shell needed, seat belts and a hardback seat only, everyone is wearing a parachute, it doesn't need a high degree of maneuverability.

I am in fortunate position where I don't have any debt, and my dad is letting me stay at his place for free, so money isn't a big concern for me. I also was able to save a good amount from my job that I had for 8 months. I have been thinking about the next step in my career, and I'd like to bounce my idea off of you guys. 

Due to my fortunate position, I am not desperate for a job, so while I am applying (have an interview on Monday actually), I don't want to take the first job I am offered or a job that I don't feel will help towards my career ambitions. With that said, I have thought about the idea of doing an at-home ""Master's,"" and I'm wondering what you guys think. One of my conclusions that I reached after doing my undergrad, was that it's entirely possible to have learned everything I learned online. The resources, extracurriculars, and learning to work on a team were  what I thought was really valuable, but that too can be replicated to some extent. 

So while I am furloughed, I will study some textbooks that I would have used had I pursued a real Master's. I also want to work on a FPV drone design I started while I had a job, but I now have much more time to dedicate. I really like the idea of being able to study and work on the projects I want without all the other tedious things that come doing a real Master's, not to mention saving a ton of money.

96,Career advice: How to use Mechanical Engineering to enable sustainability in society?,1588530854,"Hello guys,

I'm a 28 year old mechanical engineer in Mexico with 4 years experience in the automotive industry. When I started university, my vision was so that I could create ""great machinery"". 

However, I've always been passionate about biology. It recently came to me that I could combine both by **creating machines that facilitate sustainability by either making human activity synergic with the planetary ecosystem, or by reducing waste** (improve energy efficiency, recycle, renewables, etc.).

I believe achieving complete sustainability is somewhat utopic, but contributing to society in this direction would make my work meaningful to me.

**Could you give me career advice as to what companies, industries or countries I could move into to pursue this objective?**

Thank you guys, have a good day.",AskEngineers,False,Markt2099,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gcvmm4/career_advice_how_to_use_mechanical_engineering/
97,Help me get over my toxic Apple fetish,1588529990,"I had a P53. 

Returned it solely because I am so use to the Retina display of an Apple. 

I am about to click again to buy another P53, but I am hesitant because I remember how much of a difference there was between the retina and the FHD of the P53. 

Literally just asking the community to give me a nudge. Tell me why I am being irrational. 

Have you guys dealt with this or am I just a lunatic?",AskEngineers,False,CM_1986,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gcvdho/help_me_get_over_my_toxic_apple_fetish/

99,Size/weight of roof terrace pool,1588527882,"I am considering adding an ""inflatable"" pool on my roof, but I am worried about the weight. I live in Spain in a 3-story independent villa. The construction here is using reinforced concrete pillars and there is currently a large rooftop terrace on top meant for people.   


Everything seems very sturdy and solid, but I am not sure if it is safe. I am thinking about a pool like this:  [https://www.amazon.es/Bestway-56334-Desmontable-galvanizado-reforzadas/dp/B00N5UOC10/](https://www.amazon.es/Bestway-56334-Desmontable-galvanizado-reforzadas/dp/B00N5UOC10/)   


It can hold a little more than 6000 litres of waters which is more than 6 tons. It is the same weight as about 80 people, which I could just about squeeze into the space if I asked people to stand very close.

Any insight would be welcome.",AskEngineers,False,aDaneInSpain,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gcurb3/sizeweight_of_roof_terrace_pool/
