2,How are the power and battery requirements of a device calculated?,1520906168,"I was recently working with an optical technology that required 8 mJ of energy per pulse of light it generated. The device was required to make 288 measurements per day and I was given the task of calculating the battery life of our device given a specific form factor for the battery. Because of all the energy and unit conversions necessary, I am really confused as to how to approach this problem. 

In an industrial setting, how exactly is the power requirement and battery life calculated for a device given some form factor?

An alternative way to phrase this question would be something like this. If I worked for FitBit and my product designer gave me a CAD render of the device and management told me to calculate how long the device can last, how exactly would I make those calculations? 

P.S. I am a graduate student in engineering, so an advanced, technical explanation would be highly appreciated.

4,Actuating modified gate arm,1520900122,"Hello /r/AskEngineers 

I am currently trying to automate a modified gate arm to swing 90 deg. between two physical stops, where it will be locked in place. Its worth mentioning that I will be opening and closing this quite frequently.  Please take a look at the photo below. (https://imgur.com/a/8hCMa)

I currently am planning on using a linear actuator (pinned in/out of the paper) to swing open a large 16' hinged gate arm. Although using linear motion to achieve rotary motion is never recommended, it is the option I am considering currently because of how easy it is to set limits, operating only requires a simple switch, and cost is only ~$150.  

I briefly tested this set up with a 12in, 65 lb actuator and it works well, but the actuator needs upsizing. Before ordering something like this (https://www.progressiveautomations.com/linear-actuator), I would like your guys opinion on if there is a simpler/more effective way to accomplish this as I'm sure there are multiple different ways to tackle this.

5,First Update - Structural Engineers (Opinion Needed),1520897552,"This is an update to my post made earlier, here: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/83g7tq/structural_engineer_opinion_needed/)

Hello All, 

Thank you all for giving me your feedback and insight into this - I greatly appreciate it. I just finished meeting with the general contractor, sub contractor, and the structural engineer (hired by the contractors). 

It sounds like the structural engineer is going to sign off on the concrete/structure. Which really surprises me, I have to wait for his official report - which sounds like will be later this week. I will share the report once I have it, but I have feeling it will have vague language such as ""in general conformance with the design intent"" - which is not what I want and not sure if the City will even accept vague language like that. 

The subcontractor is going to come back out and patch over the honeycomb, fix the exposed rebar, and the other holes. 

Immediate results of structural inspection:

* Strength of the concrete came in as high as 3500 with a low of 3000 (which is actually higher than I expected).
* I am missing at least one vertical piece of rebar in the stem wall, potentially another piece of rebar in the footing where the garage entrance is at. 

Its my understanding that with all the honeycombing in the footings, it was hard for his xray machine to see through some areas. 

When I mentioned the ACI standard violations and building code violations with the exposed rebar, rebar driven into the ground, honeycombing, wooden stakes - all he said is that it was ""poor practice"". He did mention that he is a commercial structural engineer and does not specialize in residential structures.

What can I do?",1520895242,"As the title suggests, I graduated with a B.S. in Systems Engineering from a small school in my town. I graduated with a ""decent"" GPA [3.5].

My questions are as follows: 

What should I be adding to my resume to get noticed by the kinds of jobs I am looking for?

Aside from the big companies (LM, Boeing, SpaceX, Raytheon, etc.), what other companies can I look into to get some experience?

https://www.concordia.ca/encs/bcee/students/undergraduate/course-sequences/sept.html

It is one of the few programs of its kind in Canada.  There is a lot of cross over with civil and mechanical engineering in this program.

I am doing very well in the program, I enjoy it, and am working an 8 month internship at the moment.  Almost everyone here is from mechanical engineering.  My internship is heavy on comp sci/programming.

I am worried that after graduating I will have a hard time finding a job with building engineering. (it was very hard to land this internship which is focused on building modeling/simulations research)

Would it be wiser to switch to software engineering for job prospects.  I am very interested and fascinated in simulating physics with computers, web development, etc.  However, I don't feel like I have an above average amount of talent for programming. I get it but it takes time to decipher a code.

I am getting older now and I don't want to finish a second degree in building engineering and end up not having job prospects.  Software engineering is ubiquitous across all fields and I am very interested in the field but may not have sufficient talent.

I'm currently in school still working on my bachelors for Mechanical Engineering and Technology, but have gotten a full time job already as a CAD engineer at a firm close to home.

My senior project is for the remediation of a DNAPL. I'm only including the type of project because, to me, it feels like the solution is so open ended that my group is struggling with it.

Basically, our project goes: Proposal -&gt; Alternatives Assessment -&gt; Preliminary Design. Our alternatives assessment is due next week.

We have 5 choices picked out, from bioremediation to surfactant flushing to air sparging etc, but within each alternative there are SO MANY more choices that need to be made. **How can i reasonably do a ""general"" cost estimate on a, say, pump and treat solution without picking how many injection/extraction wells go in, what the actual treatment is within that pump and treat system, what the pumping rate is, etc etc?** 

I feel like each alternative has a hundred more alternatives that need to be considered within.


The other problem I'm experiencing is just general group issues. I can tell our ""project manager"" is getting stressed out. He's a super hard worker but he's not amazing at managing. We're all taking at least 3 classes, but he's putting a significantly larger portion into this project than anyone else. He gets so deep into these things that he feels like nobody is helping him.

55,Structural Engineer - Opinion Needed,1520700014,"Hello, 

I am a homeowner and currently under construction on my first home (primary). I've hired a general contractor who in turn hired a subcontractor to do the foundation. The subcontractor poured concrete in the forms without getting the rebar and forms inspected by the city. The city is now requiring (and rightfully so) that a structural engineer sign off on the foundation and to have the foundation xrayed. My general contractor is having a structural engineer come out this Monday the 12th. I want this foundation ripped out and a new contractor to come in and do it right. The general and the sub contractor are telling me its okay and it wont have to be ripped out (I dont believe them). I've spoken to two structural engineers here in the local area, they say given the situation they wouldn't sign off on it.  Please review  the following album:

[Images of concrete/foundation](https://imgur.com/a/5wO71)

My concern is what if this structural engineer who has been hired by general contractor has been paid under the table to pass the foundation? I dont see how this foundation passes. 

**Code violations** - code violations refer to the 2017 Oregon Residential Specialty Code

* Code - R109.1.1:  Foundation inspection - concrete poured with no inspection. 

* Code - R403.1.5.3.3: Support and cover - there are at least 7 areas where there is exposed rebar to the elements  in the footings. 

**Non-Code Violations** - considered  “not good practice”

* Wooden stakes left in footings - Over time these stakes will rot out and create voids in the footings, weakening the structure. The wooden stakes were used to support the forms for the stem walls so that they could do a monolithic pour. Talking with various people, most foundations are done in two pours - one for the footings (providing time to cure) and later one for the stem walls. This would have prevented wooden stakes from being in the footings.   

* Concrete not vibrated during pours - cold seams developed in the concrete between the two pours and concrete has a swiss cheese look to it. Many air pockets exist.

* Forms removed less than 24 hours after pour during very cold weather (below 32 degrees).

Among other classmates and I are conducting a school project whose purpose is to create a company (whether you actually do it or not it is a different subject). Two of them are mechatronic engineers and proposed the idea of ​​creating a design company. 

The problem is that the other two members of the remaining team (other guy and I) have other careers, where we do not see mechanical design (I had Static and Dynamic classes, but no software), and we do not know how this market works.

Where I live there are not so many engineering companies, so I wrote them an email asking if they could help me and give me a quote. Of ten emails that I sent, only one answered, saying that he charged 25 dollars an hour, but he didn't explain much of the process that it takes (taking measurements? just drawing?). 

I'm thinking about calling by phone those companies, saying I have a (fake) design, and asking for a quote so they give me clear answers. But I still do not know how to do that, because I do not know what kind of design to ask for, or if I have to send some example drawings.

And my teammates are not very helpful, they are focusing on the technical part, but they do not know anything about prices ... costs ... I really asked them a lot how to do this, seems like they don't know either.

 Have you worked in such a company? Was it profitable? Did you have a market? (We are thinking that the main market would be SMEs but I'm not sure.) I have an idea that designs are expensive, but it usually includes the manufacture of the piece, and our idea is based mainly on pure drawing.

I would be grateful to read your answers. Thank you very much.

73,Maximizing the toughness of cast components,1520628800,"Long story short, I've developed a cheap and effective method of turning 3d printed models into metal castings via the [lostPLA](https://imgur.com/a/HeSGM) investment casting method, which is not much different than the method of lost wax casting that has been around for thousands of years. However, metal castings by their nature have a coarse and random grain structure which promotes brittleness and reduces their overall strength. I've found that ballmilling tends to improve the strength of nonferrous alloys (I've used Zamak 2, Zamak 5, and ZA-27 so far with Zamak 5 showing the greatest impact resistance) by coldworking and thus refining the grain structure, but I'm unsure as to the best method of maximizing the strength of castings as it relates to impact resistance.

For example, if I utilized a heat-treatable nonferrous alloy like aluminum bronze C95400, would the following process work well to achieve my goals of maximized strength and reduced brittleness?

1. Chill casting in water after solidification completes
2. Solution heat treatment to homogenize the metal casting
3. Ballmilling to refine grain structure and harden exterior
4. Annealing cycle to relieve stress from coldworking
5. Further ballmilling to re-harden exterior and further refine grain structure
6. Final stress relief cycle

Additionally, which alloy of bronze would likely exhibit the greatest level of impact resistance and therefore function best as a sword hilt? C87300 (""Everdur"" silicon bronze) or C95400 (Aluminum bronze)? Currently I use a small electrical resistance kiln that is modified for argon injection to produce an inert atmosphere when necessary - would this inert atmosphere eliminate the need for fluxing agents and prevent harmful gasses from dissolving into the melt?

The current plan is to use a 12V linear actuator for the elevation control of the carriage (we expect it to be between 20-40kg with a display attached) with parallel profiled rails for guidance.  We're having some disagreement over the particulars of that last part, so I figured I'd ask the pros.

He's suggesting a single block per side with parts rated for 18kgf\*m on the relevant axis.  I worry that the dynamic load from acceleration of the actuator will make things too unstable and, if not torque our bearings too hard, place extra stress on our mount with springiness so I've been advocating for two blocks per side rated at 8kgf\*m each even though it reduces our travel a bit and costs a little more.  Which do you think would be better for this?  Am I worried about nothing or is my intuition that we want spaced pairs on point?  And while I'm thinking about it, how much space would we want between the blocks and between the rails?

The engineering director said some things in the interview that made it seem they had basically already decided to hire me. It went a bit like this:

I am interviewing for a position in Germany and so the interview was conducted both in English and German. Early on, the director could tell I was a bit nervous and getting frustrated at my loss of words in German. He stopped me and said ""Relax, we never skip the video conference interview but we made an exception because of your profile and put you right at the top of our list. The job is yours to lose."" After that, everything went very smoothly and I could tell he was impressed. At a later point he said ""I think you applied for the absolute perfect position."" Toward the end of the interview, they asked about my salary expectations and went through all of the employee benefits. After the main part of the interview, the director and HR rep left and told me I would get further information within 2 weeks. I was taken for a tour by the supervisor and we kept chatting. I was then asked to model a part that they had 3D printed and the supervisor and the group drafter seemed impressed. We then discussed a bit about a design problem they wanted to solve. I then went and had another mini interview with the supervisor and that also went well. I left over an hour later than originally planned and feeling confident. I sent a thank you email to each interviewer and the director replied with strong presumptive language including ""I look forward to seeing you excel at [Company]"" signaling again it was pretty much decided.

Well today I get a call from the company to set up a second interview. The confirmation e-mail I received shows that it will be conducted by the exact same 3 interviewers.

I just got a pretty big tax return ($4000) and I’m looking into maybe splurging a little on something to give me an advantage in my education or experience. For background, I’m entering into my 3rd year of mechanical engineering. Not going crazy here, but willing to spend a grand or two *if* it’s worth it. For example, two things I’ve considered:

1) My laptop is a $600 HP Pavilion. I use it on a daily basis, but it’s kinda slow and crashes and glitches out sometimes, and screeches at me when it overheats, so I was considering upgrading to a Dell XPS or something of that caliber. However, I’m not certain that I could justify a purchase like that, as most of my use is confined to Word/Excel/Firefox with only infrequent use of MATLab/SolidWorks/Eclipse and even less frequent gaming. And from what I’ve read on other posts, the general consensus seems to be that having a great computer isn’t super important in a mechanical engineering discipline.

2) I have a bunch of small-engine type projects that I work on as a hobby. One of them is a nice little 1967 Honda CT90 which I’ve repaired in all but the paint. I was eyeball quoted around a grand to give it a professional paint job if I handled the disassembly and reassembly myself. I would love to splurge on that, but obviously that wouldn’t really provide much benefit to me aside from pretty pictures for my LinkedIn ;) 

Ideally I would like to spend money on something that will benefit me as a student or as a future engineer. My first thought was just getting some better technology, but I feel maybe I’m just not thinking creatively enough!

0,What is a reasonable amount of negativity to take from boss?,1520547466,"I've worked for this company for a few months. My boss lets our team work from home. Most of the time he is reasonable and decent enough. However, a few times when we've spoken over the phone/Skype he's gotten pretty frustrated and angry at me. For example, several weeks ago when we were going over our presentation, he criticized nearly every slide and said it was too confusing to read, such as having too much text and confusing diagrams. Yet, a couple weeks later when I stayed for several days at the office with him, we watched a senior engineer's presentation together. I thought it was too wordy and I had no idea what were some of the diagrams/photos. I was totally confused by it as I don't have the technical expertise about that topic, and although my supervisor asked some questions that even I was able to figure out by reading the slide carefully, he didn't complain about it and told me I could learn from his presentation

Recently, we used Skype to communicate. He raised his voice and got angry about being confused about the results I was showing him and some of the concepts I was trying to explain to him. I thought I had already explained some concepts that seemed basic numerous times, but he still got angry at me. For this recent task, it appears that I'm the only one in the company working on this, even though he knew in advance I was not an expert on this topic, although I did have some background (not expert level) in a related topic

Other than the few times he's gotten angry at me, I would say this is one of the best jobs I've had. I love working from home, and I've dealt with much more toxic coworkers before. The work is challenging and I'm learning quite alot. Even if this sounds toxic enough that I should quit, I should mention it probably wouldn't be easy for me to get a new job.

My thoughts are that a lighter crankshaft will mean the engine will have to overcome less inertia meaning better acceleration and deceleration.
He says he’s unsure but since the crankshaft is so heavy in comparison to other parts on his bike, there must be a reason for it being that heavy and he thinks it’s to do with angular momentum.
I would’ve thought the crankshaft is as heavy as it is for strength and resistance to cyclic loading.

41,Career change from engineering to something more creative,1520463899,"hello

I am electronics engineer employed as junior app developer and I hate my job.  I hate it as much as I hated all my other engineering jobs, regardless if they were hardware or software related. In fact, I hated my studies as well. But, the word ""hate"" is not the right description of activities that are related to my profession. Probably better descriptions would be ""super boring"", ""not interesting"", ""lacking motivation about"" and ""hard"", and these may be the real reasons about why I hate the stuff that I'm doing.

Also, a big factor why I find all this stuff so boring is, that I have problems with attention (unconfirmed adult ADD case). In practise this means that it's very, very, very hard to start, and namely finish tasks in which you don't really enjoy in and are passionate about. And doing something that is against my will and that I don't really like, deprives all the energy out of me.  I often stare into monitor and keep asking myself what the hell I am doing here and what's the point of this?Do I really have to do this because of money?And it's even harder to proactively participate in discussion with your team, if you have zero interest about the matter. Meetings are especially awkward as I constantly get lost in my thoughts and when it's my turn to speak I usually get caught unprepared and then shoot some bloopers.

So if the main reasons of my hate towards my profession are boredom and disinterest, the second would be that I simply suck at engineering. I suck at problem solving, I think in pics, I suck at dealing with abstract stuff, I am inefficient and eventually I suck at programming. Here, I mean the real programming &amp; developing not just copy-paste coding. Everybody can program *until something goes wrong* and there is no available solution on stackoverflow about how to fix it. There is no worse feeling in the world than compiler displaying 30-line error which you can't trace down. It makes me suicidal and sometimes I want to cry. The same goes for bug hunt. If I'd get a penny for every time I've cursed in such situation, I'd be a millionaire by now.

I've taken some personality tests and apparently I'm more of an artist type, followed by technical stuff. Some people told me that they see me as a complete artist. Within my  app development work, the activities at least remotely hook me in, are photoshop, styles, html, creating icons and placing them around....some kind of visual design, I  would guess. I am also totally fine with simple scripting as it very straightforward and quickly brings immediate results on the screen, but I fuc*ng hate true programming and compilers. 

Apparently I'm more artsy/creative type and the question is, what could I do in this domain without totally throwing away my degree and technical skills and also staying competitive? I don't stand a chance with talented graphic designers who spent years playing with pixels, neither I can go against good code monkeys. 

Any suggestions?

I am also working an internship at 24-30hrs a week and I am dead tired. My grades are beginning to suffer because I can't find the time to study and I am averaging about 4-5 hours of sleep a night. I have spoken with my managers about reducing my work time and they mention that I just need to stick it out and push through. Maybe they are right but I feel incredibly stressed and exhausted and my grades are suffering because of it.

I think I can manage passing all my classes this semester, but I'm not sure whether or not I can keep a +3.0 at my current rate. I have been at my internship for 9 months and I have learned a ton but I am beginning to wonder if this is worth the stress and exhaustion.

Should I quit my internship to focus on school? The people I have spoken to mention how important the internship is over my academics, but I've already been there for 9 months and I don't see how hindering my ability to learn this material can be better than quitting and having the free time to sufficiently study.

I should also add that I'm trying to find something at a few other companies for the summer only, so the ideal scenario would be I quit and finish this semester strong and possibly get another internship which gives me some variety.

51,Regarding Materials Science and Design Engineering,1520447855,"Hi folks,

I am currently nearing the end of my second year studying Materials Science and Engineering at a University in the US and have a few questions regarding implementing Design Engineering and a career that involves both fields. 

&gt; How well do these two fields of study line up with each other?

I have done a little bit of research and have found that the most desirable Design Engineers have solid knowledge of how things work together physically, chemically etc. as well as knowing what it takes to manufacture different products. And so I am wondering if having a background in MSE and some ME is a strong basis? Are there other things I should work on learning?

&gt; What's the best way to begin working towards a career in Design Engineering?

One thing that I find myself continuously struggling with is finding a job that is right for me. I understand that there are a lot of exceptions that I will have to make, but finding a job that is centered around material information and product design that involves a lot of physical and computational work sounds like my kind thing. I am really just wondering what different job atmospheres are like and what I need to prepare myself with to get into a job I desire.

&gt; What is your daily life like as a Design Engineer?

Its a pretty basic question but I would really like to know how things actually are in the life of a Design Engineer. Is there a lot of hands on work/prototyping or is it more tailored to re-uping existing designs and whatnot. Do you enjoy what you do?

&gt; What programs or books would be helpful for me to learn and read?

Ive just begun reading Manufacturing Processes for Design Professionals by Rob Thompson and I find it extraordinarily fascinating. Are there books similar to this that would be helpful? And as far as programs go, I assume AutoCAD is a must but have also heard that learning how to render different things is super helpful too. Any suggestions?

&gt; And, finally, why did you decide to go into a career involving Design Engineering?

I'm curious what others are driven too and how much they line up with my own desires. Material Science and Engineering has been absolutely awesome! I love every aspect of it! I have always been fascinated by how things work and what it takes to make sure things work together.

60,Aluminum DSLR (Camera) l-brackets manufacturing costs. Where to start?,1520432922,"I recently entered the photography hobby, and the costs of extras appear to be downright insane (e.g. tripods and brackets). I have some assumptions which could be wrong. 

I'd like to know for how much I could jerry-rig one of these l-bracket contraptions. After conducting some preliminary research this morning, it seems like CNC is not even required for these types of gadgets, especially if we're talking about doing one-offs.

some background: I ended up here once I started looking into camera [neck] straps, as mine failed to come with one (ebay). During my search, one thing lead to another, and the consensus of the masses on the internet was that basic straps were shit and that the more expensive straps, such as Black Rapids, were the must-haves. Okay, great, that's a leap from 30 to 50/60. Not so fast it seems; it turns out these fancy straps, attach to the tripod plate of the camera, which seems to snowball into a subset of contentious arguments by armchair engineers whom swear up and down that the tripod bracket was never meant for this. Enter the, l-brackets (so-called, because they're shaped like the letter ""L""), seem to be a different approach to providing cameras with additional functionality. They can be mounted to other, more expensive, tripods, but, you can also secure your camera much more securely to them. Neat. Their prices range anwhere from $10 (Chinese ebay thing) to $250 (Arca Swiss, the gold standard), or RRS if you're one of these die-hard made-in-USA, REI types. 

cheap, $50, B&amp;H: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1120223-REG/sunwayfoto_dpl_02r_universal_l_bracket.html

expensive, $250, Arca Swiss, B&amp;H : https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/723386-REG/Arca_Swiss_802306_Universal_L_Bracket.html

I discussed this with another friend of mine who knows slightly more about engineering and manufacturing than I do, and we both came up with the same hypothesis: we can probably have one of these made for ourselves for $10-$30, if we're willing to make some concessions as far as weight or looks are concerned. 

What's the proper terminology to use when Googling specialty shops that specialize in aluminum or steel?

Considering the high price of aluminum, could this be done using steel?

Another one of our friends seemed convinced that CNC was not even required for this type of product, unless a company (I imagine RRS - considered the gold standard in camera brackets by the REI, made-in-USA, crowd) manufactured and sold enough units to offset the initial development and prototyping costs. Perhaps the CNC process gives it that REI look which, in turn, allows them to command higher resale prices. 

Okay, I've made a bunch of wild assumptions at this point, and may have asked this in the wrong subreddit. If anyone can help guide me in the right direction, I would be super grateful.

64,Looking for some advice on direction,1520414943,"Hi all, recent subscriber to r/AskEngineers. 

So currently I’m a self employed 27 year old living in the UK. My work is in the construction industry but nothing engineering. I have 0 experience or education in this sector however I’ve enrolled in an access course (giving all the requirements once completed to pursue an engineering degree) in engineering and construction. This will begin in September 2018 and end in September 2019. 

My question is; I’m looking to move to Canada to live and work, and wondered if I should do my access course here as well as my degree and then move to Canada, or would my degree not be recognised? Or should I do my access course here then study my degree abroad? Or will my access course not be transferable? Or move there now and study from scratch? 

I’m a British citizen and have no links to Canada, however I have £20000.00 savings in my bank account. 

Ideally I’d like to study mechanical/aerospace engineering at degree level

65,I'm stuck on where to begin to learn electrical engineering?,1520408263,"Hi guys, I'm sure this question has been asked a thousand times on this subreddit. However, I really want to learn engineering and I REALLY don't know where to start. I think engineering is ABSOLUTELY the coolest shit and the idea of creating something and problem solving is very enticing to me.  I see kids my age on engineering teams creating amazing, revolutionary stuff and I want to be a part of that So please, pretty please, point me in the right direction. 

--------------

For reference, I'm a college student. And the only relation my major has to the STEM fields is that I'm currently in the process of learning calculus. I don't remember much from high school chemistry or physics.

--------

**So regarding where I start:**

Do I start by learning calculus?

What about physics? And is it that concept based physics I learned in middle and high school where the math wasn't really higher than trig, algebra and geometry?

And what about computer science or chemistry?

-------

I looked up the curriculum for Northeastern University (I heard they're a top-ranked engineering school) and some of the main requirements are: 
Circuits and Signals, Embedded Design: Enabling Robotics, Fundamentals of Electronics and Fundamentals of Linear Systems. 

Say I bought a book on circuits and signals, could I understand it or is there a prerequisite? What I mean by prerequisite: Are there certain subjects I would have to had previously learned to understand circuits and signals.

69,Worried I won't be a good engineer when I graduate...,1520400426,"Good day engineers, I am an engineering student who will be going on his first engineering internship in a few weeks. Essentially, I'm worried I won't do well in the engineering field. I've heard how one miscalculation can cost a company millions of dollars and I am worried that I will do this. I am also worried that I won't be good at problem solving or that I won't be up to the task of finding good solutions to issues.

For example, in many of my group projects, I tend to mess up on small things that cascade into bigger problems. Like miscalculating a reaction force that starts fucking up everything later down the line, but no one catches it until its too late. Then, we have to go back and re-do everything. My group mates have never been mad at me when this happens, but I feel like I am a useless burden. I also tend to feel very slow when it comes to solving problems, like, stopping bars from buckling. I'm worried that I will end up under-performing when I get out into the industry, and that when I propose solutions, they end up causing damages to the company rather than solving anything. 

I have a very high GPA, but that means nothing. I suck at using my hands in manufacturing, and I am decent at CAD though there are many others that are better than me. I don't know, I just don't feel like I'm ready and the nightmare scenario of doing poorly in my job and then getting fired, and then never being able to find another engineering job is troubling me.

76,Is it true that the SRB's on a space shuttle is equivalent to two horses behinds?,1520387588,"Please bear with me on this one. I keep seeing the following pasta being shared and shared on facebook, so I thought I'd ask you guys, is anything behind this remotely true?

&gt;The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That's an exceedingly odd number.

&gt;Why was that gauge used?
Well, because that's the way they built them in England, and English engineers designed the first US railroads.

&gt;Why did the English build them like that?
Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the wagon tramways, and that's the gauge they used.

&gt;So, why did 'they' use that gauge then?
Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they had used for building wagons, which used that same wheel spacing.

&gt;Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?
Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break more often on some of the old, long distance roads in England . You see, that's the spacing of the wheel ruts.

&gt;So who built those old rutted roads?
Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (including England ) for their legions. Those roads have been used ever since.

&gt;And what about the ruts in the roads?
Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match or run the risk of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome , they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. Therefore the United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is derived from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot. Bureaucracies live forever.

&gt;So the next time you are handed a specification/procedure/process and wonder 'What horse's ass came up with this?', you may be exactly right. Imperial Roman army chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the rear ends of two war horses. (Two horses' asses.)

&gt;Now, the twist to the story:

&gt;When you see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are solid rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at their factory in Utah . The engineers who designed the SRBs would have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from the factory happens to run through a tunnel in the mountains, and the SRBs had to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track, and the railroad track, as you now know, is about as wide as two horses' behinds.

&gt;So, a major Space Shuttle design feature, of what is arguably the world's most advanced transportation system, was determined over two thousand years ago by the width of a horse's ass. And you thought being a horse's ass wasn't important? Ancient horse's asses control almost everything and....

77,When/how will I know if electrical engineering is right for me? Should I switch majors? Just switched from business to engineering recently,1520386775,"I know there are posts on this subreddit and other similar ones about different engineering majors, but I'm not finding them very useful in dealing with my personal dilemma. I'm a sophomore, but it's my first year as an electrical engineering major at my state's main university. I switched this past summer from this business school. My main aspiration is to be an entrepreneur who builds a business from nothing more than an idea into something that changes peoples lives. As such, I thought I should study business to pick up some accounting/marketing/finance/etc skills, but I realized during my freshman year that the business school was not really teaching for entrepreneurs but for your typical 9-5 corporate worker who starts at some 40-50k office job and tries to work their way up the corporate ladder. But this is not what I wanted to be.

A lot of my business ideas I realized were limited in that I had no technical/engineering skills or understanding. If I wanted to start a business I would need to find engineers who would take my idea and make it happen. This made me feel pretty useless. I want to be more like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, pioneers who studied science and engineering and then picked up business skills along the way. I've heard engineers getting MBAs is not uncommon whereas it's impossible to go from business to a Master's in Engineering. So I thought about this for awhile and thought well why not switch to engineering and pick up some analytical, problem solving skills and maybe work a few years saving money to put towards a startup. Several of my ideas were related to electrical topics like drones, low speed electric vehicle ride sharing, wallet tracking, etc so I thought well let me see if I like EE.

Now, I'm in my second semester of EE. I've taken Calc 1, Chem 1, intro to java programming, intro to electrical science etc and right now I'm in Calc 2, Physics 1, digital logic design. And I'm very unsure if this is the right major for me or not. When will I know? How will I know? I'm worried I'll regret it. Others in my classes and posts I've read on reddit seem so much more confident about their major. I'm interested in topics like renewable energy, space exploration, digital currencies, UAVs, and airplanes. But so far I've merely tolerated my classes. I hated programming, kind of liked chemistry, kind of like physics, not a big fan of math. It's not that I'm bad at these classes; I'm not great either but at least have a 3.8 GPA. I don't know what I'm doing. Should I switch to mechanical? I've heard it's more general and less abstract than EE. Or maybe engineering isn't right for me at all? Perhaps I switched because of a misconception. I really don't know and it's stressing me out. 

After watching shows like Cosmos and movies like Interstellar and reading a book about Elon Musk, I really got the sense last summer that I should be spending my time learning about the universe (i.e. science) and trying to find out where I can make the world better in some way. But I'm very unsure what specifically I want to do. Did anyone else have this problem? What can I do to feel more confident about my choice of major? Or does my dislike for my classes mean I should switch out? I really wish my university and the college of engineering did more to help me figure out these things. Sorry for the long post. I hope someone can help me. 

TL;DR I switched majors from international business and marketing to electrical engineering and I don't know if it was the right move or not. Did any of yall have similar doubts? Is there a way I can figure out sooner rather than later if I'm in the right major? Or what major I should be in instead?",AskEngineers,johnmwager,/r/AskEngineers/comments/82kj22/whenhow_will_i_know_if_electrical_engineering_is/
78,How to become a better Manufacturing Engineer?,1520384611,"Two months ago I started an engineering job in a manufacturing role after graduating with my ME. I do multiple things but my main focuses for work are reduction of waste/cost and product implementation. So far I'm doing good at product implementation. I'm usually provided a design by other engineers and I determine the steps/specifications the product will take through the factory to end up with a sellable product that meets quality standards.

I'm very bad at reducing waste and identifying the root cause of manufacturing defects. A product will have a recurring defect that causes it to be unsellable and I'm at a loss for what to do to fix it. I try to breakdown the steps it takes to be manufactured through the plant. My next step is to identify possible things that could be going wrong and then investigate them, but typically I don't find anything wrong that sticks out to me.

87,Which MSc should i choose? Should i change career path?,1520364759,"Hello everyone. I am 29 years old and i live in Greece. I graduated as an electrical energy engineer (technical university) and after 5 years working in sales while studying (and some time after) i started working at a multinational corporation (3 months ago), more specifically in the part of the company that has to do with medical machines (ct, mr, x-ray machines etc). I work as a long term planner (not as an engineer); i plan the maintenance of the medical machines for the year and i also organize the (daily) schedule of the engineers. I also talk with customers, execute company orders and tell the engineers when and where they go to fix machine failures. Generally speaking my job is the definition of an office job. However, the big con is that my job is an entry level job so it has THE LOWEST wage allowed in my country. I always wanted to get an MSc and i think its a good career choice to raise my chances of landing a better job elsewhere or getting a promotion.
So here are my questions;

**1. Which MSc should i choose?**  Or should i choose an MBA, is it good for me? Predecessors of my job have gotten a promotion since this is the first step in the company, but many had relevant degrees in the part of the company they went (by the way promotions in my job are 90% changing spots ""left and right"" and getting more money, upwards are VERY few positions filled and almost NEVER changing).

**2. Should i choose a different field as my degree?**  Or should i try to get into medical machines with my MSc now that i work in this sector? Is it a plus or a minus if i am an electrical engineer and switch to medical machines?

**3. Should i change career path?**  While i am not working as an engineer i participate daily in solving engineer's problems (as much as i can) and work with SAP, SBO+ and ServiceMax programs. However that is more in the field of information technology or data proccesing? i still don't know. Should i try with my MSc to pursue a career in this field? Or switch to pure electrical engineering? (which is something i have worked 6months only as a mandatory part of my studies, so no big working experience there).

I 'll probably stay in this company for the immediate future because i like it and the name of the company is a big plus on my cv, however the wage is THE LOWEST as i said. This is fine for now but i can't live like this forever. 
I urge you to be open and do not care if you hurt my feelings, i prefer honesty anyday so please, tell me what you would do in my spot with your knowledge (even moving to another country might be open if i don't see any good solution to my situation).

90,How much of a red flag for defense companies is having pursued international opportunities?,1520355482,"This question is mostly hypothetical, but I'd like to get a clearer picture if possible.

I'm currently a 4th year student at a Top 10 school in the US, graduating in December. My focus is in electromagnetic fields and waves, especially for RF applications. After graduation, I'd like to work in industry for ~two years to get some experience and to save up money for pursuing my master's abroad. Germany has been my top prospect for a while because of their free public tuition and engineering reputation.

Now, I understand that quite a few companies offer tuition reimbursement for pursuing your master's at a local university while working. Nonetheless, the desire to study/live abroad is something that, even if it doesn't necessarily make the most financial sense, I've been wanting to do for both personal reasons and as a chance to continue my education - all while I'm still in my early twenties. After getting a master's, I'd ideally like to stay in the EU to find employment.

Which brings me to the title question: If I return to the US afterwards, would having pursued an international master's program be a red flag for defense companies? I understand that a lot of RF jobs are in defense, and should there be problems with getting a clearance, I'm a little worried my employment prospects would be unduly limited.

Again, these are all hypothetical considerations for something that is at least 4-6 years away, but I'd still like to hear y'all's perspective. While on the topic, have any of you finished your bachelor's in the US, then went abroad for grad school (or know someone who has)? What was your motivation, and did it pay off?

4,What is a typical profit margin for a consulting business?,1520301061,"I work for a fairly small MEP consulting firm with a few different offices (&lt;50 employees and the 5-10 million in revenue range) and I've been moving more into the management side of things lately.  The thing that's kind of confusing me is that the top tier management has been putting quite a bit of pressure on the mid level guys like myself regarding our profitability.


From what I've seen so far, our profit margin in January was around 25% but February slipped a bit and will probably end up being more in the 10-15% range, although that's partly because a few decent jobs weren't completed until right at the end and sent out on the 1st of March.


My team has been pushing hard and thought we were doing well, but I recently found out that the top level guys were ""very disappointed with our performance"" and that our profit margin ""needed to be at least 30%"".  This shocked me a bit as I was under the impression that anything over 20% was at least fairly solid profitability, and I'm honestly not sure how to further increase our margins considering everyone on my team is already putting in OT and is salaried. 


So I have to wonder, is 30-40% (the range they stated to me) really a normal, healthy profit margin for a consulting firm our size?

The max load on the bridge would be a side by side with two passengers, so say 1500 lbs.  I'm assuming I'll want a safety factor in there, but also know the bridge will only be about 4 ft in the air so no real danger if this bridge failed.

22,Request: Liquid Nitrogen Cold Plate,1520272444,"Electrical/firmware engineer here, so mechanical stuff isn't really in my wheelhouse:

I need to be able to de-laminate flat stacks of assorted films that are laminated to glass. The sizes can get pretty large: let's say 2' x 3' max, though even the ability to do half at a time would be OK. These films de-laminate from the glass when they are exposed to cold (~-100F). 

Previously, I used dry ice in sheet form for this, and it worked OK, but sourcing the sheet dry ice in my area is a pain. So I decided to make a cold plate. I ordered a tank of liquid nitrogen from a local industrial gas supplier, and bought a marine cold plate off Ebay and plumbed the nitrogen to it. [Ebay Pic](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/voQ2lcSewrZMkDvc0ua2Vxdal4PXiFRELh3_4xK7LByduw22f8t9_JT20xXMfk54g11F=s114)

The issue is that the stainless steel used in the plate is too thin, and it tends to contract and warp when cold. The result is that the pieces won't lay flat on it, preventing good thermal transfer. Further, since the liquid nitrogen really only runs through the tube network inside the plate, the plate surface doesn't get as cold as I'd want (I assume in the real marine cooling application, there's a secondary liquid that is run inside the plate that makes direct contact with the nitrogen-cooled tubes). 

Can anyone think of something relatively off-the-shelf that would be better in my application? Some sort of plate or box that has a ""plumbing"" inlet and outlet, but maybe is hollow inside and has small holes that allow the boiling nitrogen to escape in gas form? I considered a cold plate used in brewing/storing beer (sometimes used in jockey boxes), but I don't think this would be much better either from a ""flatness"" perspective or a cold transfer perspective.

My current thought is to buy a travel gauge and an extensometer that can hook into our current data acquisition computer (mv/V preferred) and collect data while using the test machine as a glorified press / puller. We currently have dog bone samples of the material and could also procure cylindrical samples if necessary for the compression tests.

I’m employed as an Engineering Technician. I spent 7 years as a fitter and machinist and then moved on to begin studying an Advanced Diploma of Engineering (highest qualification before a bachelor degree). 
This course was discontinued before I could complete it, so I came out with a Diploma of Engineering Drafting and six units shy of the advanced diploma . I want to obtain that bachelors degree so I can progress my professional career. Should I complete the Advanced Diploma first?
My thinking is that a degree will take 6+ years, as I’ll be studying part time and probably by correspondence (full time work and family) so in the meantime I would have that advanced diploma for any future career prospects while studying undergrad.
Cost is a big factor here. I’m looking at $9000AUD to complete the advanced diploma.

and respond to the button pressed

This is a highly simplified diagram explaining the project.

I am modelling the mixing process of granite particles in resin (to make particle-reinforced composites). For this, I have been using DPM feature in ANSYS Fluent. So far, I have been able to track the particles flowing through the chamber.

However, I am interested in finding the distribution of the particles at the outlet plane of the chamber (refer image). I tried using clip plane and isosurface features and I can view the distribution at the outlet. But is there any way to export the particle distribution data at this single plane and quantify the distribution?

The goal is to say that the resin-granite mixture is homogeneous (i.e, an even dispersion of granite particles in the resin).

Anyway, I contacted the head manager asking o apply for a full-time position there. He sent me a email back asking when I could come to visit them to talk. I have a meeting with him in two weeks. Right now this is my only solid lead to a full-time job...

My concern: When I came to school after the summer, my supervisor wrote me a senior project proposal (which he invested some time doing), however due to the division of senior projects at school and the fact I didn't want to do a project by myself (I was kind of scared...) I was not able to do their senior project proposed. I did another one, which was proposed by my professor. I sent a text to my supervisor and explained. Before I left, some engineers at the company were kind of excited with what I would come up with the project. So now, I am kind of going back there empty handed... I sent a text to my supervisor and he told me to take time and come up with at least a some solid ideas about their project so I can impress the head manager, which I am trying to find time to do it among school and my other senior project(I will do it in these next two weeks)

Also, my GPA is not great. 2.7. I tried to improve in this last year but it didn't work out well... but my head manager already knew that even tho I think he expected I would raise it to a 3.0 or so

I would like some advice in how to approach this meeting with my head manager. How to reassure him, I would be the best fit for the company. I did work really hard over the summer, sometimes 50 hours a week (I was getting paid for that extra effort tho).

65,College orientation : would STEM be a better choice for me than business ?,1520131708,"Hey everyone,

It's probably gonna be a bit long and english isn't my first language but I hope you'll understand everything. Also I'm portuguese so the educational system here may be a bit different as compared to the ones in english-speaking countries like the US or the UK, but I don't think it'll be a major obstacle for the questions I'll be asking.

So here's my complicated story. I'm a 20 year-old guy currently studying in the first year of university for a marketing degree after lots of roam and drop out between various courses within the last 2-3 years. And now I'm again wondering if I made the right choice.

First when I graduated from secondary school almost 3 years ago I chose to engage in a physics degree. It was a crazy choice because my degree from secondary school was more in the area of management and business and had little math and no physics. So, not suprisingly, I quickly abandoned mainly because the math was too hard for me at the time.

Then I tried other degrees, humanities and business administration, which I also quickly abandoned. In these cases not because it was too hard but because I lacked motivation due to some personal issues that I faced in the last 2 years. So I ended up spending the last 2 years, until last september, at home doing literally NOTHING. It frustrates me a lot because, even though I'm still young, I feel like I've wasted a lot of time.

And then last september, more motivated and with less personal issues, I decided to give it another try and engage in a marketing degree, more in line with my background and even to some extent with what I wanna do professionally (I'll get into that later). Until now I'm doing well, especially in math. At the beginning of the year I totally sucked at math and had very low marks at it, but then hard work paid off and now I'm doing very well at math and starting to like it again (it was by far my favorite subject and the one I did better in primary and early secondary school until some point where for some reason I started sucking at it).

Everything sounds pretty good, but now I'm more and more wondering if I've made the right choice... For various reasons :

That I'm getting good at math again, which makes me wonder whether or not to go back to a more STEM and math-oriented degree that could provide me more professional opportunities and knowledge. Of course STEM degrees will involve much more advanced math than a business/marketing degree but I'm now confident in my capacity to do it as long as I put in lots of hard work.

Since my childhood I've always been deeply fascinated with cosmology, astronomy, and anything related to space more than with anything else. That's why physics was my first choice as a university degree. But then, my low-skills at math were the problem. And I think I'm fairly surmonting it now. I've also been developing some interest in software development and programming lately.

I could be mistaken, but I feel like someone with a STEM degree could more easily acquire business skills on his own than someone with a business degree could acquire STEM skills on his own.

Ideally I wanna become an entrepreneur and have my own business. Though I'm pretty open about my future job because I really have no idea about what I wanna do beyond that. But my main criterias would be jobs in an area that I'm interested in of course (so probably around business and STEM areas), with lots of potential for evolution and going up in the hierarchy, and, honestly, also with good potential to make lots of money which is an important thing for me (though by no means the only one).

Sorry if it was too long but at least now it must be clear as to why both the business and STEM areas appeal to me as well as why I wanna get a degree in one of these 2 areas and also acquire at least some knowledge in the remaining one.

So, in a nutshell, on the one hand I'm now in marketing and already changed a lot of orientation so it'd be a good case against changing again, furthermore as I'm doing quite well ; but on the other hand I've always been deeply passionated with many things related to STEM and am now confident in my capacity to at least give it a try.

I'm considering what we call here a ""zeroth year"", that basically would teach the basics to students who don't have a scientific background to then go into STEM fields.

So what would you do if you were me ? :p

TL;DR : Tried physics, failed because I sucked at math. Now in a marketing degree. And I'm starting to get fairly good at math again, so I'm wondering wether it'd be a good idea to orient myself towards a STEM degree ?",AskEngineers,Extremo-97,/r/AskEngineers/comments/81v1np/college_orientation_would_stem_be_a_better_choice/

89,Quitting a 3-semester planned Co-op Internship after the 1st Semester?,1520028004,"I'm working at a big manufacturing plant in the South-west as the sole engineering intern. I've accomplished and learned a lot in only 3 months on the job, mostly because the sole senior manufacturing engineers looks at the internship like a mentorship and has quickly brought me up to speed and we've worked a lot as a team.

I've looked at the resume for the intern who was here last, he was a big hotshot that has gone on to great things. I've hit most of the points on his resume already, apparently he took a semester or two out of the three to ""break the ice"" and start socially connecting with people in order to seize opportunities. He was always capable and bright or so I've heard, probably much smarter than me, he just had social hangups whereas my social skills are better than my engineering skills :) so far at least. So I immediately warmed up to everything and have been getting big project after big project to complete and feel a bit ahead.

I feel I've hit close to my limit at this place and my first semester doesn't end until May. I'm on great terms with everyone, and have a whole lot to talk about.

However, the only reason I'm looking to jettison out... is actually two reasons. 1. I have most likely scored a more prestigious and quite different internship, if this falls through everything else is moot. and 2. They hired the biggest fucking asshole I've ever met in my entire life to be the Quality Engineer, and an initiative has been started that the three of us will tackle EVERYTHING together.

My senior gets along great with this quality guy, so that compounds the problem. To rant a bit: this guy is way behind where he is supposed to be for his age, yet constantly brags about the generic school he under-graduated from (two decades ago), acts like a child, steals credit from other people, acts like a jock, takes every single joke too far, acts superior to everyone at the plant, then asskisses my senior, and was hired on 5 months after me but treats me like he's been here forever and that I'm the newbie to be hazed. He's lazy, insecure, selfish, and braggadocios. Basically everything you're supposed to immediately grow out of freshman year in engineering college. My days now consist of getting picked on by him and having him tell stories of ""beating the shit out of people"" to the head engineer all day.

It's gotten to the point where I've gone out of my way to find big projects within other departments to assist on. But after this initiative we now have daily meetings where everything gets fused together. Meetings that we agreed would run 20 minutes but today took up over 4 hours.

I've raised my concerns as delicately as possible to the senior engineer, he's always been honest with me. But its plain as day to see that he's choosing to build a better relationship with a permanent employee over someone who will be gone in two years. I don't fault him for that, it's just really making it a toxic work environment for me. This new guy is jumping on tasks I usually did before which is reducing my useful and effective workload, and sludging up my day with his stories.

To put it in perspective, the plant is 2000 strong. I haven't met a single person I don't like as much as this guy, I get along with everyone. But being tethered to this guy permanently, plus this guys toxic view of interns, plus his general over the top shitty personality, is just running me into the ground.

For more perspective, guy is twice divorced, both wives dumped him, both his kids from the first wife ran away from his home to live with friends, he basically lives homeless on the beach, and I think he was fired from every engineering job he has held.

TLDR: I have completed only 1 out of 3 work semesters for a co op, think I have hit around 75% of the types of things to do. Drastic changes and a new internship offer for the summer have me wanting to leave...

Thanks for the help! Let me know if you need me to clarify anything.

I was hoping for some outside advice/feedback.
I work in one of the larger consulting firms in Toronto, Canada. I have been an employee for 6 years now, starting as an EIT and rising the ranks to the title/role of project manager on large scale municipal infrastructure projects. I love my job and role, and have been flagged as a high performer by management. As a result I have been offered shares, and given unique opportunities including overseas placements. Management is generally nice, and I feel appreciated and respected for the work I do.

The only issue I have is salary. During performance reviews, I have always been commended for my work and given rankings of exceeding expectations. However, when requesting raises, I have been told that my years of experience is the limiting factor for my salary. All of the other municipal engineering project managers in my division/ office have 10+ years of experience, and are receiving compensation packages much larger than me despite me completing the same role/ having the same billable rate to clients. I have been told that I should look at the big picture and the experience I am gaining rather than salary at this point in my career, but I feel I am unsure if I am selling myself short.

I currently make $78,500/year. I have consulted OPSE salary surveys and recruiters/friends in the industry and have heard I should be in the range of $90-100.

Does this number sound like a reasonable pay expectation, or am I being overzealous? Does my current management/company have a point about the years’ experience?

the correlation is Df=Dw * Vf^0.2
where Dw is the water droplet. and Df an Vf are fluid droplet size and viscosity (centipoise) respectively. found that the droplet size for the perfume oil under the same conditions would be 687

 then used another correlation to find out how much i need to increase the pressure to reach my desired droplet size. found that to be 29 bar 

I don't know how to go from there. does the value of pressure indicates that i should use air pressurized nozzle? 

is my initial go at the nozzle design wrong?

My problem with all of this, and why I asked this question, is that I have now turned down 3 separate job offers from other companies because I really want the job that they are offering and am told that this company really takes care of its employees.

I want to find the impact force on the die from the punch however when I look in my dynamics textbook it just talks about things that aren't fixed, like billiard balls hitting each other. I can derive the displacement function being driven by the cam and then find the velocity and acceleration functions from that but past that I don't know what to do. I also want to find the stress on the die and when it yields. (A ring will start to form on the punch after a while.)

33,"I loved my job, and then I got my performance review... :(",1519935290,"

Hello,

 

This is part venting, part asking for feedback. I like hearing the thoughts of more experienced engineers.

 

I am a level 1 Mechanical design engineer at one of the big aerospace contractors. I received my BSME two years ago, and began working here 1.5 years ago in a non-engineering role. I used this role to network with engineers, which led to engineering assignments, and as of ten months ago, a job as a mechanical design engineer. I love being a design engineer, especially in aerospace.

 

**TL/DR:**

I thought that I did well on a recent project that I took over from a senior engineer. I delivered on an aggressive deadline, but haven’t been given much else to do, despite me asking for work. Performance evaluation basically seemed to say that I don’t deserve to make as much as a new grad because I haven’t done much work and I have made mistakes/am not perfect. I am legit bothered by this and want clarification beyond vague negative statements that amount to “You suck.”

 

 

**Context:**

 

When I transitioned to my current department, there was virtually no training. I was replacing a level 3 engineer, so they gave me one of his projects. It wasn’t terribly complicated, but it was my first, and it was a very rewarding challenge. I loved it and I’m grateful that they gave me the opportunity. The deadline was aggressive and I took the project over in the middle. Due to changing information from other teams, I had to completely redesign the thing from what was originally given to me. I also used some experience from my previous position to make case for an additional test that no one seemed to realize was necessary. Upon discussing my concern with leadership, they agreed that the simple special case test I was suggesting was a good idea. I completed the project on time and under budget, but not without my share of silly mistakes. Still, I received no indication that my performance was sub-par. Since then, real work has been pretty sparse. I’ve told my leaders that I’ve got bandwidth, but my manager just says there isn’t much right now and he’ll get me some meaningful work soon. I have no reason to not believe him.

 

 

**Situation:**

 

When I transitioned over from the old position, I was given a raise, but it still wasn’t enough to bring me up to market for an entry level engineer. I did ask for 5% more, but they wouldn’t budge. I accepted any way figuring I’ll see what happens when performance review comes around. That time has come. I would have been happy with a 3% raise, which would have put in in a range commiserate market for a new grad. The actual raise was far lower (less than inflation) and, frankly, I feel insulted. Call me entitled, but I figure that after 10 months, I should at least be making as much as a new grad. The manager himself told me what they typically offer new grads, and they are using my previous salary to justify paying me a full 5% less than what they typically pay a new grad.

 

I told myself that I’d be ok with this before the evaluation, but the more I think about the feedback on my performance, the more I just feel like firing up my resume. The feedback was almost all very vague, negative stuff about me not having attention to detail, needing to read up on some program documentation, and not being aggressive enough in finding work. He even hinted that I was downright dishonest about some things. My thoughts on this feedback; I agree that I miss things sometimes, but I’ve also caught important things that my leadership has missed. This meeting was also the first time I had heard of the documents that my manager seems to think I should have read already, so I’m not sure how I could have known to read them without being telepathic. Also, I absolutely did let leadership know that I was available for new work. I didn’t receive much attention. I could walk around with a sign and a megaphone, making certain that leadership is keenly aware, at all times of day, of my FULL BANDWIDTH, but that is stupid. Finally, not sure what the hint about dishonesty was about. I probably was wrong about something out of pure ignorance, and they thought I was trying to cover my ass. Any how, I emailed the manager, asking for more detail on my performance issues. I haven’t gotten a response yet.

 

 

**Conclusion:**

 

I always try to remain objective and avoid the ol’ self-serving bias. The feedback really bothers me a lot more than the salary. I put a lot of work and thought into the project. I am either insanely incompetent and no one has the heart to tell me, or I should look for a new job.

 

I think the most likely cause is that they just don’t really know how to develop a new engineer. I know that it is ultimately my responsibility to develop my own skills/competence, but I’m not a psychic. Some guidance is necessary if they want me to read up on specific documentation that is scattered around in 10 layers of folders on the company server. I don’t think that they are bad people. My leadership is, in fact, quite delightful and I enjoy them. But I am having a hard time accepting their feedback as anything more than half truth, and am frustrated by the lack of specific information regarding my shortcomings.

Here’s where I’m confused.  The problem is asking for the pressure at the bottom of the retaining wall and I don’t know which Ka to use.

Doing a structural review of a fishing vessel cantilevered section of decking that overhangs the working deck by about 4'.  Vessel design rules really only cover simply supported sections and not cantilevered ones so I tend to rely on first principle calculations for a cantilevered beam.  Assuming the beam is well-bonded to the plywood (i.e. glued &amp; screwed) can anyone provide a **simple** method of making an equivalent section that's made up of a single material.  Some background information:  4x7 rough cut red spruce at 16"" centers screwed and glued to 3/4"" douglas fir plywood.  I'm guessing it's something to do with the modulus of elasticity or bending strength of both.  Vessel rules allows the plywood to be added to the stiffener as effective width, but again these all assumed supported at both ends.

51,Defining my core skills: future career based on it and further education,1519892311,"Hello,
 I am looking to realize a career based on the skills I'll be defining below. It is more of a hybrid between Industrial design and Mechanical Engineering. I'll be defining the core skills in the title followed by details,my primary tools and resources, my strengths and my weakness. 
 1. Concept Development: Market Research, Feasibility Studies, Idea Generation, Evaluation and 
      Selection. My strengths definitely lie in navigating online for products and case studies. My 
      glaring 
    weakness is hustling for more information. 
 2. Initial Design: Concepts, Sketches, Mechanisms, Mechanical and Electro-mechanical Elements.
      My strengths are imagination, beginner level Sketching. My weakness are coming up with 
      complex designs for a simple application. 
 3. Detail Design: DFX, Part Detailing, Standard Sizes application and Application. 
       I am collecting Standards from online to make the parts as standardised as possible. However, I 
       lack knowledge in Packaging technques, and more application usage of standard materials in 
       materials and plastics. 
 4. Design Analysis: Theoretical calculations and Using CAE packages.
       Can do manual calculations for applications and setup the part to be analysed in CAE. But I 
       cannot replicate the boundary conditions of the real world.
 5. Production Drawing: Knowledge of Manufacturing Processes and their application. GD&amp;T, 
      Drawing Layouts, Formats. Assembly &amp; Operations Notes and Instructions. 
      I have begun applying Tolerances based on the type of fit which is also manufacturable. 
      However, I'd like more intuition in setting up tolerances, deeper understanding of the 
      manufacturing process in terms of process limitations cost and application. 
6. Tooling: Jigs and Fixtures for machined components, weld components, pressfit components, 
      assembly fixtures. My problems are less design intuition in using standard clamping solutions 
      like Toggle Clamps, push pull clamps.
 7. Programming : CAM, Tool Selection and Procurement. My strengths: Cutter Tools operations, 
      Setting up the part in CAM. Weaknesses: need more understanding of Workholding Setups, 
      Fixturing of complex parts, machine settings and Actual Machine conditions.
 8. Documentation: Creating and Updating Documents for all above rolls. 
 9. Rendering: Creating Concept Images, Videos and Other Post processing activities. 
 I may be over estimating certain things. But this is I have to start with. Could someone please suggest what further education can help strengthen these core skills. Any other advice is also appreciated. 
PS : I am a mechanical Engineer who has just started in a medical device/ sports product manufacturing firm (6 months in).

The other two stumped me a little because I'm doing a masters in project management at the moment and have developed a strong interest in it but also have an interest in technical side of projects. I told my boss the previous and he said most project managers in order to be successful also have technical knowledge to apply.

I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate at UC San Diego studying Nanoengineering with a focus in Bioengineering.

60,"9 months at first engineering job, already thinking of job change",1519866067,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I decided to go for a career change and went back to school for engineering in my mid-late 20's. I graduated last May with a B.S. in ME. I landed a job a month later as a technical sales/applications engineer and I'll have been there 9 months in March. I really like the company (friendly atmosphere, fast paced but laid back at the same time, good benefits, good job security since they don't really get rid of people often, interesting product/application). My problem is my current position, which I can best describe as follows:

-20% engineering

-30% working with their system, like processing new parts, B.O.M.s, looking up stuff like prices and costing, creating workflows, etc.

-50% dealing with business/sales/economics/customer service aspects and doing ridiculous busy-work, kind of like digital paper pushing

I figured that I would get into more actual engineering as I learned the system and practices more, but as time goes on it seems like that 50% is increasing: I'm just filling out spread sheets with information the customer wants (which involves me fishing around for information and every format is different, so most of the challenge is figuring out what they actually want, not really engineering related), going through assloads of quotes per day and matching up part numbers, figuring out what they are looking for and in many cases determining the cost/price of something if it doesn't already exist in the system. On the rare occasion I get to sit down with the design engineers and discuss why a customer's part failed or how we can better integrate one of our parts into their system; I love this part but it is rare (maybe once every few months and the project itself might last a few hours max). Otherwise, I'm sitting in front of my computer all day everyday and as time goes on and I take on more responsibilities, these responsibilities have less to do with engineering and more to do with filling out forms for customers and OEMs. I've looked at my coworkers who have been there much longer and this is also pretty much what they are doing as well, just more detailed. The best way I can explain it is I feel less like an engineer and more like a glorified customer service rep who can read a basic print and knows how to perform basic functions on a calculator. I was going to see if I could move over to the design engineering department but they just filled an opening and I don't picture another one opening up for a while until somebody quits (most of the guys have been there forever). I've went back and forth between being miserable and saying to myself ""you know what? This is a good company and I can picture myself being here for a while"" but the more I take on, the more resentful I feel toward the job since I went to school for engineering and most of what I do is just busy-work that somebody off the street with enough patience to learn the system can do. I want to do some engineering and use some of the technical skills I learned in school.

Okay, I'll admit that was a bit of a rant to get things off my chest but here is where I can use some advice from those experienced in the field:

1) I've worked all my adult life but I've always worked non-standard hours, so if I wanted to set up a job interview I could just pick a morning or a weekday that I had off; it was easy to find time that didn't interfere with work hours. With this job I work 8am to 4:30pm Mon-Fri. How does one go about taking a day/morning off without tipping off the boss that you are going for an interview (since it's usually somewhat short notice)? I'm pretty casual/friendly with my boss so I can easily picture him asking something like ""taking a long weekend?"" or ""doing anything fun?"" and if I outright lie then he's just gonna find out if I end up getting an offer and taking it. I know it wouldn't matter anyway if I ended up taking a new job, but it just feels unethical/immoral to me.

2) My initial plan was to wait for the 1 year marker and then reassess my situation (plus, then I could say I have ""one year"" under my belt) but I'm just curious as to what you guys think the time spent at the first job (as a graduated engineer) should be. I don't plan on leaving this second, but I'm also wondering if I should wait another few months.

I could've sworn I had more questions to ask before, but maybe I was just able to distill them down to 2 now that I'm writing it. Of course, I appreciate any further advice on this given situation. Thanks!

TLDR: I'm feeling like I should move on from my current job, refer to questions 1) and 2) above.

I have a cheap pool table, and I'm too lazy to walk around and dig in each of the pockets to get the balls back. I want to take a [traditional return system](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/23440d32-17f5-4994-bc68-6a60b0f2f854_1.605efe769b56d4e27f3227dd51f1d942.jpeg) one step further by pressing a button and having an arduino send the balls back up and out of a pocket.

How can I do this without affecting the original functionality of the pocket? I can use a flap cover to allow the balls to route down and into the system, but I don't know what kind of extension mechanism will allow this thing to get out of the way when it's not in use. I thought of:

* [scissor lift](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-IA0205IinY/maxresdefault.jpg): vertical movement isn't difficult to automate, but once it gets to the top it can only release one ball at a time. Very slow.
* [stepper lift](https://youtu.be/_Qge2w6uT3Q?t=206). Fast (ok not this guy's), but not an extension mechanism so it won't get out of the way
* gas/spring: too much power. Unpredictable, possibly dangerous.
* [Extension/cascade lift](http://images.slideplayer.com/16/5179158/slides/slide_34.jpg): I could trap the balls in some sort of cage that is lifted by pulleys. When the cage reaches its max height, release. While this meets the requirements, I don't like it. It's too unstable when extended and 15 balls are 33.25"" long. The table is only 30"" tall. 
* Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong, I should limit the vertical movement and automate horizontal movement. How about a removable trap: the balls could go into a container with a quick release that can be manually lifted to the top of the table, emptied, and replaced. I'd be concerned about damaging the table or the container over time, and it's not as impressive as an automated mechanical system.
* Put a small cup on the end of a stick. Raise the stick, and tip the cup. Lower the stick and get another ball. Sounds almost like the scissor lift, but it's not because I've been writing this post for almost two hours and now I'm just making shit up.

It was very lopsided, the lines weren't straight, etc. I tried both a third angle layout and an isometric sketch, and both were equally poor. I was able to get my idea across, but he quickly redrew it to confirm he understood and it was this beautiful engineering design sketching like an industrial designer or architect (or otherwise proficient engineer!)

80,What would you do?,1519827620,"At a utility company I worked at as an engineer, there was a coworker that was engaged in ever increasing harassment of me in the form of making fun if my baldness.  It began with minor comments and joking, but escalated to outright psychotic outbursts of name calling to the point where I felt it needed to end.  So in immediate response to one such outburst, I dominantly overrode the man and turned the microscope on him asking him questions about his personal apparel choices without any harassment or judgement.   Later that day, the office supervisor uncharacteristically came over to my desk and started to loudly question my work, refusing to listen to any logical explanation.  That office supervisor later denied ever doing that and specifically and in writing denied saying the things that he had said said.  At first I did not connect the two events, and I just treated that supervisor like he was dishonest, which he was.  Now I think that it is more likely that they are related.  It seems likely to me that the supervisor made his uncharacteristic demonstration as a retaliation against me for standing up for myself to the other guy.  But, since that supervisor did not witness the event, he must have gotten his information second hand.  And, since that manager did not ask me about that event, I conclude that it is likely that he had no interest in determining all of the facts before taking action.  Therefore, I now think that that supervisor was not only dishonest, but also incapable of objective reasoning in general and either a social subjectivist or a simple rube.  What do you think?

87,Switching into engineering after college?,1519799477,"Hi all,

I’m in my junior year of undergrad studying biochemistry, and to be honest, I don’t really like it. There are some aspects of my degree I think are really cool, bur I find that there’s too much memorization (not a strong suit of mine). And as it turns out, I really hate learning about living systems, and hate working with them even more (anyone who has ever done molecular biology knows how fickle cells can be.)

I used to plan on going to grad school for chemistry or biochemistry, but now know that’s totally off the table. I’ve come to quite enjoy my chemistry and physics classes though, which got me thinking about engineering. I go to a public university with a great program, but I really don’t want to switch my major with only ~20 credits left before I graduate. So I’ve been considering graduate programs in engineering, especially materials science ones. I know Boston University has a program catered toward people like me called LEAP, which I’ve been considering. (On the downside, they require you to have taken at least one calculus class with a final grade of a B or higher. My first semester I took Calc II and it happened to be the worst grade I’ve ever received in a class at a C+....)

Now that some of my background is out of the way, here are my questions for you all:

- Would I be way over my head attending graduate school in such a discipline?

- Do you think future employers would be put off by my pathway?

- Is engineering truly all it’s cracked up to be?

The last question is sort of a joke, but feel free to answer however you’d like (personal experiences with your job, observations, etc.) I’m an INCREDIBLY indecesive person, and over the past 6 months have considered so many careers from IP lawyer, to doctor, to food scientist, to this...

99,Aerospace Structural Engineer switching engineering discipline - Please advise!!,1519775507,"I will keep this short. I am a 28 year old single Asian American female who graduated from a Big 10 Engineering college in Dec 2014 with a bachelors in Aerospace Engineering. Right off the bat, I was hired by a defense contractor with whom I have been working since.

My experience is amazing - I'm trained at classical stress analysis, Finite element modeling, modes analysis. I supported structures test several times, put out PDRs, CDRs, got company awards. I was even promoted last year well ahead of my two year anniversary and transferred to another company site where I'm now doing stress analysis work for production end stuff (basically supporting MRB tags and occasionally indulging in some fatigue analysis).

The problem is - my security clearance was denied last year. I waited 2.5 years for that thing, went through an interview, got denied with a statement of reasons, asked for a hearing in front of a DOD adjudications judge. The hearing went amazingly well and the judge said I have a compelling case but it was a punch in the gut to get the final decision from him. He said there is simply no way I can ever mitigate the security risks that stems from my immediate family living in a country that has a hostile relationship with the United States.

Pretty much at this point, obtaining a clearance is a door that is permanently closed on me. Throughout this ordeal and getting to know coworkers who worked in classified programs, the desire to actually work in such a closed setting has also diminished. Therefore, I am now looking at taking whatever structural engineer skills I have and make them useful in another engineering discipline, and this is where I find myself stuck in a rut.

There are a few things I am trying to achieve:

1. I am tired of living in small town America. I want to be working in an engineering field with plenty of metropolitan area based jobs, which is why civil engineering is the first field that comes to mind. Problem is - I have been out of school for 3+ years and most civil jobs required licensing - and I am totally lost on how to obtain EIT certification, and eventually a PE.

2. I want to live on the east coast, specifically NY-NJ-PA-CT or MA.

3. Some day in the future when I have a family, I want to be in an engineering field where I am able to work from home at least part of the week.

4. Since I am 28 and unmarried with no liabilities, I want to be able to shift in to an industry where most companies pay for graduate school. The big defense contractors (Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, UTC etc) are really good with that and pay for a masters, and I want to be able to pursue higher education as soon as I step in to my new job.

0,"Bicicleta elétrica caseira com motor de cortador de grama usado, vai dar certo?",1519774486,"Quero transformar minha comum numa bike elétrica. 

1 - Solução usual: Andei pesquisando e um motor de 500W/ 24V de 2500 rpm e torque de 1,9Nm, próprio para bicicletas elétricas, custa a partir de R$ 400,00. Ele teria que ser ligado em duas baterias de 12V em serie (que custam no minimo 70 reais cada).

2 - Minha ideia: Usar um motor de cortador de grama (R$100,00) de 500W/127V de 9000 rpm em um pinhão de uns 12 dentes, com uma corrente indo do pinhão do motor até a coroa da bicicleta de uns 50 dentes. Isso, segundo a física, levaria a uma redução da velocidade em 4 vezes e aumento do torque do motor em 4 vezes. A alimentação do motor seria feita atraves de duas baterias de 12V em paralelo ligadas em um inversor (R$70,00) 12V/127V que suporta 500W.

3 - Meus cálculos:
Potencia (W) = Torque (Nm)*Velocidade Angular(rad/s)
Sabendo que 1rpm = 0,105 rad/s

Motor de 500W/12V que custa R$ 400,00:
500 = 1,9x2500x0,105
Logo:
500 = 498,75

Motor do cortador de grama que custa R$100,00
500 = Tx9000x0,105
Logo:
T = 0,5 Nm

Porem, com a relação os pinhões: T = 2Nm e velocidade = 2250 rpm
O que seria bem semelhante ao motor de 24V

4 -  Conclusão: 
Pela grande diferença de custos entre o motor de 12V e o motor de 127V + Inversor 12V/127V, alguma coisa nas minhas considerações devem estar erradas. Gostaria de saber a opinião de voces. Será que a durabilidade do motor de 127V é que seria muito menor que a do motor proprio para esse tipo de uso, fazendo a diferença de custo deixar de valer a pena?

Could someone recommend a book, or a good place to start, for basic heat transfer (specifically when cooking food)? My highest ""science/math"" education was some 101 classes at university... I've researched a few books thru the google, however I don't know a good place to start, or a book that talks specifics about heat transfer when cooking. 

Some context: Been playing around with various drum coffee roasters.. they all roast coffee so much differently. From conduction roasting, to convection roasting, and combing convection and conduction.. adjusting airflow and exhaust.. using natural gas vs propane vs infrared vs wood (plus the pressure of the gas, or the density of the wood, etc)... now combine all these factors, plus some, and you have roasted coffee in about 10 minutes. 

Lately I've been really trying to hone in on my roasts, finding the right balance between convection and conduction heating.. However I think there are some things that I'm just not seeing, or just don't know about. I know from experience how the roaster (and the coffee) is going to react. Additionally I taste all these coffees and use sensory analysis to determine changes in a roast. But I want to be able to apply/use/study heat transfer from a scientific standpoint so that I can improve the roast quality of my beans using sensory and scientific analysis.

13,"Building a home, Concrete footing and walls",1519753165,"I am an Electrical engineer and i am building my own home and wanted to check some numbers real fast. 


A brief description of the home. It is a box shaped 38' x 46' on the out side. It will have a basement and 2 stories above it. The basement walls are poured in-place 10' tall, 1' thick. The first and second floor, i will use hollow core planks each 37' x 4' x 1'. The planks can support 170 psf so no worry there. First floor and second floor walls will be precast concrete panels. 

I have calculated the load of each set of walls, and floors. I used 150 lbs per cubic foot of concrete.

*Basement wall - 181,200 lbs 

*Floor 1 - 128,205 lbs 

*Walls 1 - 84,000 lbs 

*Floor 2 - 128,205 lbs 

*Walls 2 - 62,000 lbs 

Total weight 583,610 lbs

Compared to the walls/floors the roof will be relatively light and i didn't factor it's weight in. I also didn't count the basement walls on the east and west side as those weights would not contribute to where my chosen footing area is. I am only counting the north and south walls as my bearing surface area because how the panels are only supported by those two walls. My footer is 3' wide, 1' thick below my poured basement walls. So that gives me 288 ft^2 of bearing area. So in all i have 2,026 lb/ft^2 of bearing load on really stiff clay soil. The clay can support its self up to 11' vertical as i was digging my basement. There are large boulders also in this clay.

I looked up building codes and most say for soft clay can support 3,000 lb/ft^2 and some say up to 6,000 lb/ft^2 for hard clays.

I was wondering what else i should consider?

Is 3,000 lb/ft^2 is a reasonable number for rocky/clay mix?

14,"Looking for education advancement advice. (AAS in ET, 7 yrs experience, looking to go back for BSEE)",1519746882,"Hey guys. I've been in a dead-end for some time now and over the last several months have started seriously considering going to ASU online for my BSEE.

A bit of background:

I earned my Associate of Applied Sciences at a local community college in 2010. I worked as a field tech and lead tech for a major transportation-industry company (focus in RF and integration, lots of IT too) for 6 years. 

Last year I took a non-travel engineering tech position at a top-20 non-doctorate engineering college. There is very little focus on electronics in this position. I am a glorified solder monkey. I am under-utilizing a ton of my skillsets. I have picked up a lot of machining skills but machining is not a direction I am all that interested in taking my career. 

I have been able to break out of my intended role from time to time to assist professors with unique problems (troubleshooting 30 year old ME equipment, etc).

Ultimately, I see this job as a great place to land after a fulfilling career and wanting to coast to retirement. I am 32 and I am not ready for that. Salary-wise, I am probably at the ceiling for my education (65k including retirement). I thought I would enjoy working at a college but the culture of the engineering shop is very distanced from the rest of the college. It is a great *job*. But I feel like it is killing my career potential.

What are your thoughts on going to ASU online to finish my BSEE? I should be able to transfer about half the program in. I am not terribly concerned with not having in-person labs. I have had that experience in community college already. I also have tons of hands on experience in the field. My only concern is needing to brush up on my associates education.

And to beat you to the punch, why don't I just go to school where I work? It is a residential/greek life school and I've never seen a single student over 24. There is a profound degree of affluence among the students that I am not sure I can get over. No night classes or adult learning program. There is also a degree of not shitting where you eat.

44,Multi-Port Burners (Combustion): Questions about performance - Any expertise in this sub?,1519653749,"Hi, I'm a hobby blacksmith. There is a quesiton about forge burners in the community that I can't find an authoritative answer to. I'm wondering if anyone here might be expert on the topic and willing to share some insight.

The question is about multi-port burners, and whether they create a hotter forge for the same fuel input compared to a larger single-port-burner.

Background:

* Many blacksmiths use propane forges. 
* The typical blacksmith forge uses a single burner similar to this: [Typical Burner](http://arlinn-tower.com/Tinkers_shop/pics_burners/Sidearm.jpg)^1
* There are lots of variants, sometimes blowers are used to force air, other times they are naturally aspirated, sizes and dimensions all vary based on the design, but basically bottom line is you have (typically) a 3/4"" pipe stuck into the side of a forge, producing a single large flame. 
* An example of the flame can be [seen here](http://arlinn-tower.com/Tinkers_shop/pics_burners/oliver_burner.JPG).
* [Here is a video of a different design running in free air](https://youtu.be/OuqSe7KqA1s?t=145). 
* [Here is a typical burner running in a typical hobby forge](https://youtu.be/JbGW-clJuME?t=72).
* Another alternate forge burner design is called a ""Ribbon Burner""
* [Here is a photo of a ribbon burner showing the many small outlets which are cast into a block of castable-refractory.](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c870d3_f03073d655e24febb80571efce31397a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_300,h_235,al_c,q_80/c870d3_f03073d655e24febb80571efce31397a~mv2.webp)
* [Here is that same ribbon burner running inside a forge](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c870d3_c1d50da6fcaf4e4c97f0f71c8e6919ee~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_298,h_224,al_c,lg_1,q_80/c870d3_c1d50da6fcaf4e4c97f0f71c8e6919ee~mv2.webp)
* Ribbon burners almost always use forced air blowers, although at least one naturally aspirated ribbon burner is known to exist.


In the blacksmith community, ""ribbon burners"" are said to run ""hotter"" and ""more efficiently"" than single-port-burners - basically people feel they are using less propane to keep their forge running that the desired temperature. There is strong consensus on this point. 

My question is: Why?

I struggle to see why the ribbon burner would be hotter if all things were equal. If the two burners were setup to run with the same mass-flow-rate of propane, and mixed to the same %air (blacksmiths want slightly rich to reduce oxidization in the forge), then I don't see why there would be a heat output difference from the burner. If the heat output is the same, then I suspect the temperature should also be the same. 

Various arm-chair theories exist about there being ""more of the hot part of the flame"" or ""slower flames that stay in the forge longer"" but those don't make sense to me (especially the last one).

Can anyone help me understand what's going on?

I am currently enrolled in a community college which has an agreement with a local ABET accredited university with an EE program (power and/or renewables) I intend to pursue. All credits will be counted as though from the university, so there's no complication there.

I'm also pursuing CompTIA certs. I'll probably be going up to Linux+. Not wanting to do a career in IT, I just think it's fun, have been playing around with servers since high school and figured I should have something to show for my skills, and maybe useful for selling myself later. Also, kind of makes it a little harder for IT people to talk down to you if you're verifiably credentialed in their field somehow, but that's really just a fun afterthought.

My goal is (initially or later, not in a hurry) to work with research and development of ""clean"" energy, or implementation, or improving efficiency of existing systems. Or installation planning, etc. I'd ultimately like to go toward systems engineering, but I understand the career side of that requires much experience first. I will likely go back to school on and off for the rest of my life, as I love learning, and love to apply new concepts. I'd eventually like to at least reach the doctoral level once in life. I'm also partial to relocating frequently, as I don't really attach to things or places.Honestly, I hate staying in one place. A more literal dream would be some sort of traveling engineer, but I've no clue as to how that would be sustainable career-wise, so I classify it as a ""tentative"" goal, like going to space. Not impossible, but varying degrees of improbable.

Honestly, I'm happy doing just about anything related to the sciences, but I figured I could make a bigger tiny impact in the world with electrical. That's a longer explanation, though.

My question is, then: What effects are background items like these likely to have on employer impressions, co-worker attitudes, and transferable (or, at least, relatable) skills or situations to an engineering position with no experience as an actual engineer? If any of these things contribute positively, where *could* I start to look, even, position-wise? I'm trying to figure out how I can shape my abilities and experiences while I'm in school (still working, still pursuing skills outside of school) to better be of use upon graduation, and to broaden my long-term planning options. This sub has an awesome wealth of experience, and I figured it would have some better ideas and interpretations.

If this is inappropriate here, I apologize for wasting your time. For any who can give me some insight, I greatly appreciate it, as my schedule almost completely precludes casual social interaction outside of a few people regarding school, work, roommates, and shopping. Socially networking is out of the question for a little bit longer, but I'd like to work on future plans, and make adjustment to plans currently executing.",AskEngineers,oishishou,/r/AskEngineers/comments/80b45w/what_effects_if_any_do_technical_nonengineering/
51,Career advice. Deciding between aerospace companies,1519624817,"So I recieved 2 offers for when I graduate. Both as a Quality Engineer. One is in Tucson, Az with a large missle systems company. The other is a huge, lesser known aerospace company Hedquartered in Windsor Locks, CT.

The Tucson job is a role where I would settle in as a Quality Engineer I and progress in that department. The company offers a 9/80 schedule, so Id have every other friday off. I loved the company when I toured and love the location. I would have to get a secret clearance here.

The one HQ'd in Connecticut is a Quality Engineering rotation position. Id spend 8 months at 3 different locations. Id also learn so much since I would visit different plant sites and business units. 

The rotation program pays a little more, but besides that the benefits are very similar. The rotational program doesnt have a 9/80 schedule. I like the idea of traveling, but I'm also single and kind of want to settle down in a nice location and meet someone and have a permanent home.

52,"Linear drive - rack/pinion, timing belt/pulley, other options",1519622596,"Hello everyone,

Here is some background info and a few questions:

I am building a large format camera. I need a mechanism to move two pieces of wood linearly relative to each other (to focus the camera) in a situation where load is low, cycle number is low (in the thousands) repeatability is not important, and weight/size/cost is very important.

In existing cameras, this is usually done with a rack and pinion setup, usually made of steel or brass. I am looking at all viable options.

1. Rack and pinion is relatively pricey and includes a block of metal that adds to the weight. Would plastic rack and pinion perform sufficiently and reliably? If so, which plastic is a good choice (nylon seems standard)?

2. Would it be possible to use a strip of timing belt as a rack, and a timing pulley as a pinion? If so, what would be the main concerns?

62,Switching career paths in engineering advice,1519591688,"Hi reddit,

I am currently a manufacturing engineer with about 2 years experience, and I am starting to look for a career change. I don't really enjoy my position as I don't feel it relates with my strengths, but I wanted to get advice on good career paths within engineering.

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and my background is pretty much the technical and design aspects of engineering. I found that one of my greatest strengths during my career (and one of the things I like the most) is quickly learning the technical aspects of the product we use and conveying that information to my team and others around me. So far, most of my wins during my career was understanding the technical requirements of the product and implementing the changes needed to improve it. My weaknesses, however, include my self motivation toward a project that I don't really care for, as a lot of my projects have been pushed onto me rather than me choosing them myself. Another weakness that I have been slowly improving is my organization within a project, which I would skip steps that are important to implementation/control. I have been improving with this by planning every step of my project beforehand before I even start.

I want to switch out of this environment because I just do not feel any joy out of dealing with the processes, even though I understand how critical it is to a business. I don't really get to work with other engineers in my job directly on projects, and that is one of my favorite things to do (my interaction with other engineers are usually just telling R&amp;D to design/test something for me, and I don't really get to work with my other MFG engineers as we all have separate projects, never really working on the same project).

I want to switch into a role that can 
1) allow me to work directly with other engineers, working toward the same goal, and having them depend on me, 
2) I get to talk to other people about the product I work on, or 
3) work on the technical aspects of products, like testing.

71,Separating earth into components (sand+plastics+wood),1519561785,"Hello!

I'm trying to come up with a more efficient method for beach cleaning - our local beach has a *lot* of fragments of plastic (1mm-10mm) washing up recently. Unlike large items (plastic bottles etc.) these are super tedious to be remove as they have to be picked up individually by hand.

So I have a bunch of 'contaminated' sand which is a mix of sand/plastic/rocks/wood/organic and would like to split it into it's component parts in bulk. Right now i'm just trying to figure out a crude thing I can duct tape together and maybe 3d print something later when I know it works.

My main thought is some kind of floatation method when contaiminated sand is scooped into water, the plastic floats and is then automatically skimmed off somehow. I've been googling mechanical separation methods but not really getting much back (my google fu must be weak today since I'm just getting froth filtration which I don't think is what I'm looking for).

So I guess my questions are: what techniques should I be researching, and is there any existing mechanisms in this area that I should be aware of?

Thanks.

***Edit:*** Thought I'd add a bit more information since a few people are asking similar questions:

This would be for a public beach in the UK. So it's not as homogenised as American torist beaches. So it's a mix of sand (coarse and fine) rocks (anywhere from 1mm to 10cm) driftwood (small chips to large branches) seaweed and other organic matter and plastics (1mm to plastic bottle+).
I'm assuming a sensible human doing the input, so really it just has to deal with the above but probably 5cm radius max. Since it's a proper, living beach returning not just the sand but also the rocks and organic matter is quite important. But filtering out small bits of wood with the plastic is fine.

Ideally device size needs to be human carriable, eventually hand-held. But that's kinda for later after I've figured out a basic techique.

Beaches around here have semi-regular community clean-up events where volunteers like myself go an pick up litter from the beaches. And that's great at removing big things (plastic bottles, cans, old fishing rope etc.) but increasingly I'm seeing tiny plastic fragments washing up. Cleaning up a few meters literally involves an hour on your hands and knees picking up each individual bit of ~2mm plastic. I'm trying to figure out a way of making it more efficient somehow.",AskEngineers,Orangy_Tang,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8046cu/separating_earth_into_components_sandplasticswood/

It’s likely going to be structured in a way that most of the company will fall completely under the multinational, but a small number of core people will be split out into a new company (with original ownership structure) to do R&amp;D work. I was approached last week by our current president and identified as one of the key people they would like to take to the new company, and the multinational seems to want as many of us as they can get. 

In the meeting with the current president, he coached me about what to say to the multinational so I don’t “emphasize my strengths” so that they don’t object to me being brought to the new company. Now, I definitely trust him, but a part of me feels like it’s a bit fishy.

A lot of details will be worked out in the coming weeks and months, but I’d like to be prepared for whatever happens. Either way, it will be a big career event. 

For obvious reasons, I can’t get into too many specifics, but I’m hoping to collect your thoughts on a few things.

1. Should I be discussing salary/compensation changes? I was hired less than a year ago and am happy with my current compensation, plus I’ll be getting a bonus once the deal goes through. It feels a bit opportunistic to ask for more money, but I also don’t want to leave anything on the table.

2. What are your thoughts on a small, very innovative company vs a multinational? The largest company I’ve worked for has been ~600 people (50 engineers), so what advantages would I have in being owned by a large company?

On one hand, there’s probably a lot of room for career advancement at the larger company, with different business areas I could move into. On the other hand, going with the small company, pretty much everyone ahead of me for promotions, etc is gone, leaving me near the top of the engineering chain. Note though that there hasn’t been a full discussion on a new job title or level of responsibility.

3. What are your thoughts on strategically selecting what I say to the multinational HR guys? I think it could benefit me financially to have them fight over me, but at the same time, I feel like I’d enjoy the work at the smaller company more.

Ending up in aerospace engineering would be my dream career though.  I unfortunately decided this too late into my degree after a year of doing astrophysics research with a professor, and instead of changing majors this late I just decided to finish up my physics degree.

Because it's in the bin, it would need to be fairly compact, less than 10cm ideally, when retracted, and should then be able to extend about 20cm into the bin to compress the waste.

I can't really seem to find anything appropriate online; double action hydraulic cylinders seem to be too large, and I haven't found a single action that can pull itself back up.

The compression wouldn't need to exert a large force - something in the region of 10N.

12,Feasibility of using superconductors to create a magnetic field around a spaceship?,1519435057,"Quick disclaimer-I am a Sophomore Chem-E who who hasn't gotten to electric fields in physics...  There may be some straight up misunderstandings of basics concepts...  Hopefully not.

So this idea came about from an article about using a satellite near mars to create a magnetic field for it and thus stop its atmospheric loss [link](https://phys.org/news/2017-03-nasa-magnetic-shield-mars-atmosphere.html).  So the idea is to make a much smaller version of this to protect just a spacecraft for a trip to Mars.  For my math I used SpaceX's proposed BFR.

Equation I used ((4pi x 10^(-7) * I * R^2)/((2 (R^2 + X^2)^3/2)
I used this equation because it had the right variables...  I may be using this completely incorrectly.  

I assumed the BFR length of 106 m, radius of 1 m, and a magnetic field of 50 microtesla (googled ""magnetic field in LEO"").  I also assumed that this gave a magnetic per loop in a coil.

Using these assumptions, I found that 1/4 (13.25 m) of the BFR could be protected if 1867 Amps was run through 100 loops.  Due to this massive current, superconductors would be needed.  For cooling these, either the liquid methane fuel (91 k) could be used or the liquid He (4 k)(tank pressurizer).

In short,
1) Is the equation used the proper one to use?  Is the field created ""per loop""? If not, what equation would give a proper answer?
2) Is a field of 50 microtesla overkill? What field is sufficient to deflect solar wind?
3) Is it possible to run 1867 amps through a superconductor without it losing it's current?

I've always wondered why every thermostat I've ever encountered has to be manually flipped from heating to cooling.  In the spring and autumn, temperature can fluctuate between below and above room temperature, even within one day.  To me, it would seem trivial to design thermostats to simply keep your house in an acceptable range - for example if the temp goes below 68F turn on the heating, and if it goes above 72F turn on the cooling.

Granted I have not used ""smart"" thermostats yet, I assume they do have this ability.  But I think even a ""dumb"" thermostat ought to be smart enough to do this since it's about as simple of a calculation as you can program.

29,Need advice moving into control engineer role,1519391220,"I am 24 years old, working as a service tech dealing with control systems. Graduated from uni two years ago with no internship experience or passion in my field(bachelor’s mechanical engineering). Ever since i started my job, i’ve become fascinated with control systems and would like to move into a controls engineer role in the near future.

Unfortunately, my company doesn’t deal with the design aspect so much so i was considering getting a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Also i am studying for the fundamentals of engineering exam and taking building engineer classes through the NAPEEF. 

So my plan is to work in the field for two-three years and build up my knowledge of control systems and then get a master’s degree.

30,Career Advice: What should I be doing before I graduate?,1519389796,"I'm currently 2 years from finishing my bachelors degree in EE at 27 years of age. I have been seeing a lot of well established engineers go into detail about how they got their start back in school with internships and the like. I've been extremely wary of taking on internships as I don't have a support system in place that would allow me time between internships to not be making income. I pay all my own bills in Austin, TX as an IT professional and full time student as well as my own tuition to ASU-Online with no outside help. Needless to say, I don't have savings or time to do a lot of networking in hobbyist meetups and it's difficult to bounce from job to job not knowing if I'll be homeless next month all for the sake of chasing some undergraduate experience.

With this in mind, how am I suppose to be getting a start in the fields I want to go into, ie. Aeronautics or Robotics? Should I even concern myself with internships if I can't afford time off between jobs? Without the luxury of getting experience through that avenue, what other recourse do I have to break into a field that requires years of experience for any entry level job?

My question is: Do any of you ever feel stupid at work? Do you feel inferior to your peers or feel like they think you're an idiot? Have you ever felt like that in your career?

I am asking because I am currently in my 3rd year of a BSME degree and I'm doing decently with a 3.4 cumulative gpa and a 3.64 major GPA but I honestly feel like sometimes the knowledge that I have does not reflect that GPA. I have no doubt worked my butt off to do well in school, but I often feel like I don't know a lot of things that I probably should know.

Anyway, I also notice that many of my peers have a decent understanding of many concepts i have forgotten. I sometimes wonder if my success is a product of working countless problems until my fingers bleed or whether it is a result of my intellectual ability.

I am currently working an internship and I often feel like the engineers think I am a moron at times for not knowing things that they think that I should know. I also interviewed for a big aerospace company for an internship position that I really want but the position would require putting a lot of theoretical knowledge into practice and I am not sure I feel qualified for it.

Is this a confidence issue? Am I not retaining things that I should be retaining? Am i not getting the education I should be getting?

44,How do I keep a constant mixture of electrolytes in an automatic refilling water tank?,1519352794,"So necessary backstory, I'm an animal nutritionist with an emphasis in beef cattle. Most cattle get transported via semi trailers multiple times in their lives, sometimes these journeys can last up to 12 hours. Obliviously cattle that go through those long trips are very stressed &amp; dehydrated when they arrive at their new location. One way people can really help these animals feel better faster is to use electrolytes in the water (it the same principle of getting an IV when you are sick). 

The problem: almost all water tanks in use are automatically refiling. They usually hold about 250 L and the pen of animals may drink 10,000 or more L in a day. So any solution mixed in the tank would be diluted after a few animals drink from the tank (causing the float to lower &amp; more water to release). A whole days worth of electrolytes in the tank would be way too strong actually make dehydration worse for any of the first animals to drink the super concentrated solution . 

Solution ideas: Basically I have two ideas so far, and i'm looking for other ideas/ advice in moving form idea to prototype. 
1. Metered auger system. Basically I would have a hopper that sits on top the water tank above the water level with a auger in the bottom powered by an electric motor. The ""meter"" would be an actual water meter hooked up to the the incoming water line. Every time a liter of water goes into the tank the motor would turn the auger X number of seconds. After testing I would know the accuracy of the system &amp; then would be able to create a formula for it (the more accurate the less glucose I would need to dilute the inaccuracy). Motor would be solar powered with battery backups. I can build all of this- but have absolutely no idea how to get a electric water meter to ""talk"" to an electric motor.  

2. Constant release idea. This would be less accurate than the previous method, so the results wouldn't be a good (it would still help, just not as much), but also significantly  easier to accomplish. This method would be something like place a mixture of NaCl, KHCO3, MgSo4 in a PVC pipe with caps on the ends and a few small  holes drilled in it to greatly reduce surface area exposed to the water, place it in the tank &amp; use a small pump to circulate the water. 

Obviously all of these models would be tested prior to the use with any animals, this topic has been extensively researched over the past thirty years and been shown to greatly benefit them they would not be in danger.

59,Where do you start for creating a production-ready prototype of a product?,1519334740,"Hey fellow engineers.

I'm a 25 y/o mechanical/aerospace engineer currently working at a big defense company, but I have an idea for a household product that I've had for quite some time, and I'd like to start seeing what it will take to bring it to reality.

I took a product design/entrepreneurship course in college, and I understand the process of filing a patent, doing market research and writing a business plan, pitching to investors, etc. My question is more on the engineering/manufacturing side of it.

Without divulging too much, the idea is for a new type of household/kitchen device. It'll be made primarily of hard plastic, but with some glass and metal components as well. It will also need to have some simple circuitry, a heating element, and some simple linear actuation systems.

My questions are thus: How do I go about getting an actual production prototype made? Assuming I can get investment, how do I bring the manufacturing to a production scale? I have the CAD mostly laid out, and my programming/electrical engineering skills are limited so I was thinking of just getting a working concept made using an Arduino/Raspberry Pi and some simple components from online. But I have no idea where to start as far as getting a professional, injection-molded plastic body made, or a real PCB, or real glass components. Once most tech startups (with hardware) get going, they typically get these kinds of components made and assembled in Asia, but what do they actually do to get that going? Is it just a matter of contacting various companies and getting a quote on their pricing to make it? Am I better off actually hiring a manufacturing engineer to handle those details?

65,Help Understanding How A Common-Emitter Amplifier Circuit Works,1519325339,"[Here](https://imgur.com/B1gAC25) is the CE amplifier I will be referring to. I know that the voltage divider allows for current to flow through the base-emitter junction allowing it to be forward biased. So, this in turn allows for the positive and negative half cycles of the ac signal to pass through the junction, through the bypass capacitor, to ground. This alternating current at the base then amplifies the collector current to get Beta * I_b. 

When I say that the forward biased base-emitter junction is allowing the positive and negative half cycles of the ac signal to pass through the junction, I mean that the wave form would always be above the x-axis because the AC and DC signals are being added, and therefore the current would not be changing directions. Is this the wrong assumption?

Now here is where I get confused. How are we getting a negative half cycle on V_out? From my understanding of it, and this is probably wrong, the 12V DC is the output that is varied by the AC signal. So, the transistor is varying the current of 12V DC source. When this varying current hits the coupling capacitor on the output circuit it is not varying from negative to positive, right? So, why would it be able to pass through?

79,Staying with internship (prefer to quit),1519307402,"Hey guys,

I currently am in the process of finishing my first 3 month internship in contracting/construction side (Civil engineering) in a small-ish family run construction firm. The internship is unpaid but I need it for experience/hour requirements as part of my course/degree (not in the US).

Now, I am probably expecting an offer soon to stay on by the boss and it will most likely be paid work (if it isn't, I'll probably just decline by default), however the problem is that I don't really enjoy the work environment and the team (somewhat). 

I feel as if my directing manager holds some kind of prejudice against me for no real valid reason (that I know of). He isn't an approachable type and is quite somewhat intimidating to me as a newbie, so I don't actually feel too comfortable in this learning environment. I.e: It is hard for me to ask questions as I feel he will snap at me or feel irritated at my presence. Or, whenever he periodically needs something from me, but has never formally introduced it to me, he just gets cranky. It's like getting mad at a dog for not 'sitting' when you've never shown it how to sit ever. Most of the things here have been self-learn for me. 

I don't interact much with the manager nor my boss, because I am mostly on the project site, but I think the boss is pretty neutral to me unlike the manager (They are brothers). I don't see them much as mentors as they've never really guided me on anything. Furthermore, working with the site-crew/labourers etc is sometimes alright/friendly, and other times they are pretty distant/rough/blunt which can make the day go worse than usual lol. The office staff are pretty friendly and neutral, but they are more for admin and accounts type of work, so I don't really go to them for help if I need to.

Anyway, the point is, should I decline this internship or just 'tough it out' since experience is hard to come by and it could easily worth more than my own personal feelings of dissatisfaction? I would expect a lot of people to say to tough it out, but it is hard to enjoy working at a place you ultimately don't really like.

Cheers fellas! 

TL;DR: Unpaid internship (not in US). Might receive an offer to stay, but unsure in whether  choosing to stay or not. Not enjoying the work environment and team that much, which is the main reason. But if stacking up 'experience' is worth toughing it out, then so be it?

I've gone to every lecture, and group study sessions, and watched YT videos and run MATLAB code, but I still lack any context or foundation. It feels like trying to learn to read French law books, without any previous training in French or Law. 

So I'm going to ask some very, very basic questions, and hopefully I can use the answers to understand the answers in the lecture notes. In some cases I *think* I know the answer, but want to know for certain before it makes me misunderstand something. Thanks in advance for your time. 

What are poles?

What is an impulse?

What is a domain?

What is an S-plane?

What is K? More accurately, how does it relate to gain?

The root locus diagram plots the damping factor (r) against the oscillating frequency (theta). I understand that the damping factor make systems less sensitive to input, but what does oscillating frequency control? And why does there need to be a separate value for damping, when K makes the system *more* sensitive to input, so why can't you reduce K instead of increasing r?

Placing your system outside of the path traced by the poles as they move around the graph in response to K increasing, makes it unstable. What does system stability mean in this context? I've seen graphs of the output shooting off to infinity as an example of an unstable system, but I don't think it's telling the whole story. 

I'd like to thank you again now, and also ask that if you can't spare the time to answer my questions, please direct me to somewhere that can.

I feel like I’ve been holding back with the fear that I have no experience besides what I learn in school. I am afraid that if I were to land an internship, I would have no idea what is going on.

What was it like when you were going through the process of getting an internship? How was your internship like? Were you well guided by the company?

Besides an internship itself, what else can I do or learn to gain skills and experience (outside of school related projects? Any company programs that you may know of?)

I truly appreciate any information.",AskEngineers,yogikrisp,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7z8cqd/internshipexperience/

9,Small inflatable ring/doughnut with Inner circle expansion? 1-2 inch.,1519226735,"Hi there. 
I'm working on a project where I'm in need for a small ring torus with an inner diameter between 1-2 inches that has the ability to expand when air or fluid is pumped in to it. 
Basically like the inner tubing of a bicycle wheel but much smaller.
The inner circle's expansion and deflation property is the feature I'm looking for.
Kinda like an anus sphincter. 
Outer expansion is not needed but having that property wont cause any problems either.
I made a quick drawing to make it easier to understand. I'm not an engineer so please excuse the unpalatable schematic. 
I would assume that the material for this device would be made out of some sort of rubber or silicone. 
I was thinking of making one somehow or sourcing a preexisting part. hopefully the latter. 
I'm not able to find an inner tube with such a small diameter.

11,Turn on an LED when charging a battery,1519224011,"**[SOLVED by /u/firemogle]**

Greetings designers of our modern world - I've become quite interested in electronics as of late and have begun building a simple little device to aid in my learning process - it's just a cooler with some speakers, an amp, and some batteries in it. Everything's working great except I wanted to add one small feature: an LED that turns on when you plug in the power supply to charge the batteries.

First I just wired the LED with a resistor to the 12v+ and -, which obviously kept the LED illuminated constantly by the battery. So I thought - I need an electrical check-valve - a diode! So, I threw a diode on to the 12v+ before the LEDs resistor and bang, now the LED only turns on when power is input from the 12v power supply! I was super proud of myself, this being the first time I had used my *understanding* of electrical components to modify a circuit without just copying other people's designs.

It didn't last though - now it won't send that 12v through the diode to the battery. What did I do wrong? As long as that diode isn't there the 12v is sent out and charges my battery without an issue, but as soon as I put a diode between the 12v+-in and the battery's 12v+, no current flows. Is there a better way of doing this? And, why didn't this work? Shouldn't it? It's a [1N4007.]

I am able to make quite a few simplifying assumptions to begin that reduce: 
RCD equation: https://imgur.com/a/DUey7

to 

RC equation (no axial diffusion): https://imgur.com/a/5yBSk

My first problem in understanding this is why the source term is multiplied by a density (if that's what it is, the document doesn't specify what exactly rho (p) is, but I assume it is the density of products. If I'm not wrong, every group of terms in either equation must result in units of mol/(L*s), or more generally, concentration per time. If this is true, then rho must be dimensionless since R' is probably already in these units.

This problem carries on when I nondimensionalize the equation to: https://imgur.com/a/Uf4Iv

In this way, the first term on the right side cancels out (no axial diffusion still), but the source term is still multiplied by  rho(p) * length/velocity, where length/velocity is equal to the residence time (Tau).

If it's not clear, my question is why is rho(p) in this equation, I've never seen it written like this. If it stands for density, then what are its units, as it seems from the above pictures that it doesn't have any units whatsoever.

She graduated as a computer engineer and is currently working a software developer job for the past 9 months.

She has since accepted one offer but with no tentative start date (apparently company is pretty notorious for long processing times and overall bad communication during the on boarding process). Pay is good (in the 80's), has good benefits, and has good travel opportunities but slightly worried how much she will enjoy the work (still computer engineering related)

She also recently received an offer in a field she's passionate about. Pay will be about what she's making now (about 70k), with worse benefits. Issue is the start date would be in about a month. Given she hasn't reached a full year at her current company, she would have to take out a loan to pay back the 10k she received for relocation/sign-on bonus (isn't prorated). It does help she doesn't have any student loans.

28,GNC Engineers: How did you start your career?,1519176574,"Hey guys. I am essentially asking the title question - how have other GNC engineers started their careers? I am interested in the space industry and a job in this sector is my goal.

Background:
I am graduating this semester with my MS in Aerospace Engineering with a specialization in Design, Control and Mechatronics (basically GNC). I am in my University’s nanosatellite club and have developed a controller for one of the satellite missions. I have done additional projects with Kalman filtering and spacecraft attitude control. My masters thesis (in physics) was based on physics modeling and Bayesian data analysis.

Unfortunately, this is the limit of my experience. I will have been in the MS Aerospace program for only one year - the last five years I was at a different school, and earned a MS/BS in physics and BA in mathematics. There were no engineering clubs, as that school didn’t have an engineering department, so I was unable to get experience while at that school. I have applied to internships at every single opportunity, probably totaling to over 100 different applications, and I have only gotten one response from NASA which ended up falling through due to miscommunication on their end.

I am afraid my lack of actual experience will hurt my chances. I have talked to recruiters and professors and they all agree my skill set has me beyond qualified - but only theoretically. Any advice on how to prove to recruiters my lack of extensive experience is offset by my additional knowledge/skills? I have spent hours talking with career services/professors perfecting my resume and cover letters for this problem so I’m not sure there’s much I can improve there.

An additional question: are there positions I am potentially overlooking that would be a gateway into the field? I have been pretty focused on applying for GNC Engineer openings but maybe there is something else.

But it's been difficult to land a single interview, and my current job is awful, in retail and I can *feel* the stagnation creeping in. But I get it, it's tough landing a job with so much competition out there, that's ok. 

However, I have actually *finally* landed an interview, and if all goes well I'll finally be able to stop living with family and begin my career! But it would be as an aerospace service engineer for a small airline company, and I'm not *quite* certain what that involves. From what I've gathered, it's interesting enough for me to believe I could learn to do great here! But all I know for certain is that I doubt it's CFD or stress analysis!

While this may sound silly, and I can feel a part of me telling me so, if I got this role, is there a length of time after which I would sort of begin to narrow my chances of ever being hired for let's say an aerodynamicist role or materials testing engineer, FEA technician or design engineer?

Thing is I still feel there’s so much that I have to learn at work, about the process in general but also details such as how certains pumps and valves work in an integrated process. 

It feels like I’m back at university, except sort of like a step above. In the sense that what I learnt in school forms the basis but there a few layers of advanced stuff that we didn’t quite learn at school.

I gave it to the guy, who later just flipped out at me.

I was accused of ""not being a team player"", ""not really a part of the project (which I was)"", ""not reviewing the things I was suppose to review (which I did)"", ""disrespect for his workmanship"", etc.

65,Algorithm for Fluctuating a PID Controller Process Variable Above and Below the Setpoint?,1519086542,"I am looking to simulate the control of a louver in a mine setting using two discrete PID controllers. 
One PID controller (Slave PID) which is for a Carbon Monoxide sensor, and the other (Master PID) for the control of the louver position. The PID's use the Trapezoidal rule to calculate the output. 


The Co sensor PID has a static Setpoint. The output of this PID will be the Setpoint (Airflow Setpoint) of the louver PID. 


The Louver PID will use the CO sensor PID Airflow setpoint in order to control its output (position Setpoint).


At the moment I am using the output of the Louver PID divided by some number as the Process variable of that same Louver PID in order to simulate/fake a real system. I am sure there is a better way of doing this.


For the PID the output is found by:

Y = KP * (DIFF + 1/Tn * INTEG(DIFF) + TV *DERIV(DIFF)) + OFFSET

Telecom is ok, but what I think I'm really into is automation, robotics, biomedical, software and programming, machine learning... and other hot topics such as VR/AR, IoT, neural networks, etc. I know some of these topics may or may not relate at all, it's fine.

At first, all of them sound interesting, promising and fun to me. I am having trouble to decide, however, whether I REALLY LIKE them of not. I've already researched and read a bit about each one of them but I can't seem to grasp much of the details, such as: how a tipical project is done, how the daily job routine is and what are the recquired knowledge to work with each one of them.

I've always liked coding but never done much, just the basics. I have an Arduino and a RPi board, but also never done much with them (lack of time which lead to lack of interest, although I really like what can be done with them).

What could be some tips in order for me to make my (even slight) deicison? I know whatever it is it doesn't have to be definite and that I'll never be 100% sure, but I'm kinda lost right now. Should I take online courses, work on a project in my Uni, try taking some optional classes on the subjects, reading papers?

I am currently trying to design a generator system in the front wheel of a motorbike that will only generate electricity during braking. (KERS System) 

I am struggling with the wheel hub design and I've really just hit a wall. 

The two ideas I have in mind is a rotor and stator in the middle of the wheel and a clutch system on either side. when the brake lever is pressed it will push the clutch on to stator and rotate it to provide power.

Or have a rotor and stator in the wheel hub and just have it excited under braking conditions. 

Most designs for stators and rotors have the rotor internally rotating but on the motorbike wheel i can keep the rotor stationary on the wheel axle and have the stator rotate but struggling to find and example of this.

I've been getting very interested in CSP recently, especially it's potentialto desalinate water (Sundrop Farm in South Australia uses it's CSP plant for this purpose) with just readily available sunlight (I live in Australia, that would be a huge deal if adopted elsewhere). 

But it really got me thinking, cargo shipping contributes to a HUGE portion of global carbon emissions, and ships sail around in the sun all day (mostly), criss-crossing oceans without ever soaking up a bit of that sunshine. 

Are there any new engineering challenges stopping a cargo ship from having a CSP array on top of the ship, with the solar-concentration tower powering the ship during sunlight hours, and potentially storing energy for use at night (electrolysis of seawater? though I've heard it's terribly inefficient).

After long, unproductive work I just go home all tired so I can repeat the shitty process next day again. Otherwise, I still don't know how I've managed to pass the studies and my completely rubbish marks testify that something was not OK . So far, I've either lost or quit 2-3 jobs in the span of two years, and I didn't really solve any problem. At least I've figured out that development is my enemy and that very likely such tasks aren't meant for me. Normally, I can't finish a task, neither can start one, everything becomes boring quickly, sometimes I just stare in monitor for whole hour without even moving a cursor or keep randomly clicking on tabs or fidgeting with some bullshit. My mind is usually on other planet and during team meeting I'm always in an awkward situation when coworkers caught me being mentally absent.  With such disinterest or disability I can't be proactive, I can't drive development, I can't take responsibility and so on, since these are essential requirements for developer so a failure is not avoidable.

I'm still waiting on Weber to get in touch with me, which might not happen until Monday, so I decided to pick your mind to see if yall ever experienced something like this.

42,I hate to say 'when are we ever going to use this' but...,1518813440,"I'm a junior in electrical engineering, taking an advanced circuit analysis class.

""Solving circuits"" in general seems a little...busyworkish? Increasingly arbitrary collections of circuit elements with no indication of how this might be used in practice, and I'm getting sort of suspicious that several of these circuits could not and would not exist in the real world.

But, you know, you got arithmetic pounded into you in elementary school, and now even though you can and do use a calculator for most things, you've got an intuition for it that you wouldn't have developed without a lot of tedious drilling. Maybe it's all just an exercise.

Now we're getting into Laplace transforms, again with increasingly complex and arbitrary functions and any connection to how this math connects to even hypothetical circuits is a fading memory. And I'm over here like, 'Would it completely destroy the foundations of engineering education to include one example per unit of how this process might be used to solve a real world problem?'

So, practicing electrical engineers:

* Do you ""solve circuits""?

* Does ""solving circuits"" bear any resemblance to the work that you do?

* Is there a specific skill you learned from the exercise of solving circuits that you use routinely?

* Ditto for Laplace transforms. ",AskEngineers,markjo222,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7y1q4x/i_hate_to_say_when_are_we_ever_going_to_use_this/

52,I can't decide between electrical and mechanical engineering,1518800962,"Hey AskEngineers

I'm really stuck deciding which discipline to pick.

Mechanical engineering seems interesting to me because I want to design robots and automated machines. I really want to study the physical but I also want to work with sensors and programming to make these machines come alive.

 I have this image that mechanical engineers design the machine and the electrical engineers bring it to life. In this sense, I want to go into electrical engineering, but I don't have any interest in the more electrical only subjects that have no application to real moving parts, for example, communications, signals, electrical power, etc.

I enjoyed studying mechanics and I also enjoyed working with electrical circuits. The electrical labs were much more interesting, and I enjoyed designing a circuit that controlled the movement of a robot on treads.

I would like to keep working with circuits. However, I really want to study machines. I like Boolean logic especially, in fact, I want to focus on Boolean logic and control. But only in relation to physical systems, like temperature control, movement of mechanical parts, etc.

It really seems like I can't choose one without leaving something behind that I really want to learn. Choose mechanical engineering and I lose the programming, circuitry, Boolean algebra. Choose electrical engineering and I lose the real world context and machines.

Also, I cannot take mechatronics, as it isn't offered at my university.

They told me to figure out the heat loss and a friend has to do the solar collectors sizing part.
The thing is, I'm not very good at thermodynamics, and I have no idea what to do with the data they gave which is the following:
-Volume of water: 3100 L
-Target temp: 40ºC
-Material of hot tub: Cypress wood (no special insulation, 0.06 m thick), I used a K of 0.096 W/m*K
-The system has no tank, the water from the tub will be directly heated by the solar collectors.
-The main purpose of the solar heater is to minimize the heat loss during the day, since the owner usually heats up the tub with wood, and he wants to switch to a solar solution to use less wood (and because the neighbours complained about the smoke). So the solar system is an auxiliary system.

I used a formula I found in https://thermtest.com/thermal-resources/conduction-calculator to calculate the conduction heat loss, but I talked to a friend who's a chemical engineer and told me the loss is greater from evaporation and convection. (I assumed it was negligible, since the tub is supposed to have the cover on most of the time.)

The heat loss I estimated was between 14 kWh and 18 kWh per day, I'm not sure if that's in the scope for a 3100 L hot tub, but highy doubt it.

So anyways, any help I can get, any formulas you can give me, I'd highly appreciate it.

Thanks for the help.

tl;dr: I have to calculate heat loss of a 3100 L hot tub made of cypress wood (0,096 W/m*K), 0.06 m thick walls, and cover is almost always on. Water should be at 40ºC ideally.

74,Advice on unfolding plastic film roll,1518721981,"Hi everyone,

For a project at my farm, I am in need of around 200 rolls of polyethylene sheeting that are 16ft wide x (100-200ft) long x 4mil thick. This was easily found on amazon, homedepot,etc but due to shipping constraints, every manufacture takes these 16ft wide rolls, and folds them down to a final width of 3ft. Here is the link to the ones I purchased (https://www.homedepot.com/p/HUSKY-16-ft-x-100-ft-Clear-4-mil-Plastic-Sheeting-CF0416C/202184160)

The issue is that due to the application, I need all the rolls to be unfolded, on a single 16ft pipe. After failing to hit manufacturers minimum order requirement for a custom order, I decided to try and take the rolls purchased at HomeDepot, and unfold &amp; rewind them on my own pipe. 

Here is the setup I currently jerry-rigged 
https://imgur.com/a/6ZpB8

I placed the 3ft purchased roll on a rotating shaft with a simple band brake to increase/decrease tension. On the far end, I have the plastic fed through a single tensioner onto the 16ft pipe the plastic is wound on. The 16ft pipe is turned manually through a crank, or can be connected to an electric motor.

The problem I am having is that due to the number of folds, the plastic resists spreading without force or some type of guide, causing it to roll very unevenly.  I imagine going from 3ft to 16ft without multiple tensioners isn't ideal but I am not looking for perfection, only to improve a decent amount. 

 After looking more into the process that manufacturers use to fold the plastic (http://www.blown-film-machine.com/images/in-line-triangle-folding-device-b.jpg) I think it would be best to try and reverse the process they preformed.  Implement some type of triangular spreader bar to force the plastic to go to the final 16ft width. 

I am unsure how to do this, and a would love any feedback, or other recommendations you may have for this problem.  Please let me know if anything was unclear or any additional information is needed. Cheers!

78,Question about thin glass fiber tubing,1518704896,"Hi there,

I am trying to make a thin glass fiber tube and I've been having trouble removing excess resin.

So far I've made two attempts using a pipe with an outer diameter corresponding to my desired inner diameter as a mandrel. Two layers of fiberglass sleeve were then put over the mandrel and I manually impregnated the fiberglass with epoxy resin using a brush. 

In order to get a nice surface on the outside of the tube, I've used a shrink sleeve and heated it. The shrink sleeve also acts as a tool to squeeze excess resin out of the glass fiber. I have trouble heating the shrink sleeve evenly, resulting in slightly uneven thicknesses along the tube's length. 

I was wondering if there are any other methods of removing excess resin from a glass fiber tube next to vacuum bagging.

79,What's the name of this part/device?,1518698437,"I'm looking for the English name of a device, or part, that elongates like a telescope (edit: [pictured here](https://i.imgur.com/0deFTRXg.png)). I've seen it translated as a ""telescope bar,"" but I can't find that term in any dictionary, and it seems to be only German-English websites that give the part this name. Is there another name in English?

To be more specific, I'm helping translate a text from German to English. The text is for a surgically implanted leg-lengthening nail, and the original text describes how the patient can use a ""telescope bar"" to adjust the length of the nail by clicks. I'm looking for the part that slides to elongate (like a telescope), not the whole device.

81,Found an interesting truck height adjustable hitch and I am wonder if it's main feature could be a major weak point in the design?,1518671174,[Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbTI2Rih3mP/) is a link to a video demonstration of this truck hitch on Instagram. I couldn't really figure out how to word my question better but looking at this fabulous hitch  I was immediatley drawn to how little material surrounds the height adjustment pin compared to the overall design. I don't see how the thinner pieces between the adjustment slots or the adjustment part being on the outside edge of the piece wouldn't wind up breaking before anything else when an excessive amount of weight/force is applied to the hitch. I never took materials courses when I was last going to school and this looks like it's CNC'd out of aluminum/steel like all other truck ricer parts but it doesn't seem like a very strong/safe design; something one would want in a hitch.

What the two jobs have in common or very similar:

- 401k match, medical, dental, vision

- Commute: 15 min vs 20 min drive

Additional comments: 

- I live in SoCal with very high COL
- I did a year long internship for another pumps company using the same CAD software; I guess this is why I’m their top pick for Job A. I’m not particularly fond of pumps, but from my previous posts on here I learned that whom you work with matter more than what you work on.  
- I plan to work for 1-2 years before looking around, if not offered adequate raise. 
- Average starting salary in automation/controls engineering is much higher. This explains the salary difference. But I feel like I’ll be missing out the 3D CAD part that I enjoy and was the reason I chose to major in ME. I like job A a tad more, but the lower pay will put me at a disadvantage when negotiating raise or jumping jobs. 
- Both jobs involve electrical stuff, but job B significantly more. Not that I don’t like working with electrical, I’m just listing as a fact. 
- Cubicle vs Office: I’ve never had my own office before, but I guess it's nicer to work in an office. Any thoughts?

If I had got only one of these two offers, I would have taken it right away without having to think this hard. Lol. I did all my homework but still, this is so hard to decide. I have a week to think and let them know.

91,How important is it to see your first project all the way through?,1518640930,"Hey guys, sorry for the long post ahead:

Super TL;DR Will designing an R&amp;D project for my company from conception to launch help me significantly when applying to grad school/other jobs? Or do they just care that I worked on the project and had ""Lead"" in my job title

TL;DR I got ""promoted"" to be the Electrical Lead for a kind of important new R&amp;D project at my company, and have the opportunity to own the design from conception all the way to launch (2021). I have dreams of getting my MBA and moving to a big city to work as an engineering manager. My current company is located in a kinda small midwest city, and I can't decide if staying 3 more years all the way to launch is worth it as opposed to leaving in 2019.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started at my current company 1 year ago, right after graduation with an EE degree from a large well-ranked school (I'll get to that later), and I did internships with them prior to graduating. It's a very large Fortune 500 company, generally regarded as one of 2 or 3 major players in our industry. Thanks to networking with some alumni from my university while interning, a month or so after starting I got an interesting opportunity to switch off the team I interned with and be an R&amp;D engineer for a new IP that isn't projected to launch until 2021. Shortly after that I was named ""Electrical Lead"" for the project after our first prototype worked well and got delivered in less than 6 months (didn't come with a pay raise unfortunately). Right now I'm still the only EE on the project so a majority of my responsibility as Electrical Lead is just being in charge my own research tasks to get the prototype working and setting up design inputs for when the architecture gets finalized. We'll probably only get one more EE resource so it's not like I have a whole team to be in charge of or anything. My manager and some of my peers have said this is a rare opportunity since I'm a so young, but I don't have any perspective in the outside world so I have no personal frame of reference whether it is or not.

The only real idea I have of the outside world is from former classmates, and since I went to a well-ranked school a lot of them have landed in big cities working for your typical tech companies (Amazon, Microsoft, etc). When we talk about work their day-to-day doesn't even come close to what I'm getting to do in my current role, but they have the luxury of living in amazing cities and spending time with other young people. 95% of my coworkers are 40+ with Masters degrees (a few PhD's), wives, and kids closer to my age than they are.

I guess to summarize, I feel like I'm learning a ton and this experience will be valuable, but I know I'm a very young engineer and my frame of reference is limited. I'm worried that even if I perform well in my current role, it won't mean anything in the rest of my career, and the only way I could leverage it is by staying in this small city filled devoid of young people.",AskEngineers,VeryPoliteThrowaway,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7xl579/how_important_is_it_to_see_your_first_project_all/

1,How would you build it?: Seeking feedback on a smart chess board concept,1518622807,"Hello and thanks for checking this post out. Criticism is welcome; if I have worded something poorly or in a confusing manner please point it out and I will try to correct it. 

#Objective

The objective of this project is to create a chess set that interfaces with a [computer chess game called lichess](https://lichess.org/) in a way that allows me to play without having to use my mouse/keyboard or really even look at the computer at all. In order to accomplish this, I need to create the following:

1. A chess board that tracks the position of the pieces and displays the opponent's moves
2. A computer program that sends and receives the position data to and from the game on lichess.org 

#Working Concept
##Hardware

My rough idea for the tracking component of the board is to use the magnetic switch mechanism outlined in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D84sVPR6g7o&amp;t). The guy in the video built his board with a different objective in mind (to record a game of chess on an SD card), but I'm thinking I could repurpose his concept for my idea. If anyone can think of an easier way than this to accomplish the tracking, let me know.

As for displaying the opponent's moves, I'm thinking I could install a small LED in each one of the 64 tiles of the chess board. The idea is that the Arduino could light up the two tiles involved in the opponent's move (i.e. f2-f4) and I could just manually move the pieces on the board myself. 

##Software

This would be the hardest bit for me as I lack experience in this area. I don't even know if it is possible to accomplish all of this with an Arduino so if there are any experts on that please chime in. Essentially the Arduino needs to do two things. First, take my inputs (the moves I make on the board) and convert them to commands for the game running on lichess. Based on [this API documentation](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/blob/master/doc/mobile/play.md) for lichess, I believe that part is feasible. Second, it has to light up the LEDs corresponding to my opponent's move so I can update my physical board after that move is played. I feel like that part may be difficult because the computer would have to know that it wasn't me sending another input (i.e. moving one of my pieces to the place my opponent just moved). Perhaps a switch of some kind could be incorporated to tell the Arduino when to be in send vs receive mode? 


#Conclusion

Ultimately I'm just trying to figure out the easiest way to accomplish the objective. My rough concept is just a starting point that I'm hoping to get feedback on to improve, but if there is another idea you have that utilizes something completely different I am certainly open to it.",AskEngineers,HomeProjectGuy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7xiupc/how_would_you_build_it_seeking_feedback_on_a/
2,Any advice on removing large B16 studs without galling? Valve service work.,1518620072,"Hi everyone, I've been looking into methods that may help my coworkers when they are taking apart some of the monster valves out in the field. I'm hoping someone on Reddit may have some advice and could help make our lives easier when working with Inconel bolting.. We work in the valve service field and have been having issues with a few large high temp stem valves bolting coming apart. On one of the valves we usually have issues with, the studs are 2in B16 with 3 1/8in nuts (I think ~~B8M ~~nuts, [7L nuts](https://i.imgur.com/BL15vMp.jpg)) so both are alloy steels for high temp steam service. The bolts are huge and torqued to somewhere in the 6000 ftlbs area so I'm sure you can imagine these are hard as hell to take apart. The valves are at a combined cycle power plant and experience large temperature swings from when the plant is running vs down. (1000f to ambient) 

The valves are F91 chrome moly so when a stud or a nut galls during removal it can cost a lot of money and downtime to fix. Depending on how bad a stud galls we typically have to hire a company like bolt tech manning to drill the stud out and then we have to weld/rethread the bolt holes. After that the valve requires a long post weld heat treat since it is a F91 body.. As you can imagine all of this takes a lot of time and comes with a high cost.

We have a hydraulic Hytorc with a ridiculously high tq (10000ftlbs), a pneumatic rad gun (around 3000ftlbs), and also a big ass nut splitter for worst case scenarios. Our techs haven't used the nut splitter as we just recently bought it but I think it might be a better option than trying to remove the bolting with a Hytorc. The Hytorc is so strong (10000 ftlbs) it makes galling really difficult to feel. The nuts are expensive, somewhere around $500 each, but splitting and replacing is almost a better situation than the risk than having to deal with a galled stuff. A few things we do to try and make it less likely to gall, use proper anti-seize during install and we spray lots of kroil before we do anyt work and let it sit over night to hopefully help break free the nuts. I've looked into using a graphite based but do not have much experience with those. Does anyone have any recommendations on what might work?

Here's a few pictures of a valve that we've struggled to get the bolting off in the past. I unfortunately do not have any pictures from when one of them galled and we had to cut the nut off..

Take a board. Go in the lake, launch the laser, mark the board on where the laser touched, then move by a distance L then use the laser again, mark the board again.
There should be a slight but noticeable difference

After some geometry/calculations, I ve concluded that in order to see a difference of about 15cm, one had to move a distance L of about 1km. (0.62miles).
So a laser that has a range of about 3km (1.8 miles) should be more that enough for that experiment.

9,Advancing as a Civil Engineer without a degree,1518605210,"Dear Engineers,
A few years ago I started a 4 year bachelor's degree in Engineering. I always had a part time job in a restaurant as well. A few months ago, my student grant/loan from the government stopped, so I had to start working more to get by. I applied for a position in Civil Engineering (junior project manager at a small contractor doing small scale infrastructure) for 4 days a week. The plan was to focus on my education that 5th week day and in the weekends.

As one could probably have imagined, it's becoming increasingly hard to get to studying. I'm really enjoying my work, I get to do so many different things throughout the day (from design to calculations to buying to meetings with different people) and I really enjoy the atmosphere at the office. I feel like I learn more here about actually being in engineering than I ever did at school. My struggling motivation for uni has taken an even further hit.

I'm looking into stopping my education, and just focusing on my work. Assuming I develop my skills like I have so far, my direct manager wouldn't mind. However, as much as I enjoy my current job, I realise that eventually I want to get into the more structural engineering side of the field. To what extent would the fact that I didn't finish my degree hinder me there? Especially considering what I'm doing now is only somewhat related to actual structural design. Note I do design right now, but it's only a limited part of my job.

For context, I'm from The Netherlands, and am looking to work either here or in the UK. I'm quite old for a student (29 right now). I'm in no rush to leave my current job, there's so much I can learn here, but I do realise this is not the final step for me. Could anybody (preferably with experience hiring or being hired in Western Europe) give any insight on my situation?

10,7 Months into First Job - Having Doubts,1518598199,"tl;dr

I'm 7 months into my first job in what I was told is a rigorous and difficult company and field. It's hard for me to go a week without making a mistake here recently, and I think it's starting to stack up against me. I also don't really enjoy the day-to-day stuff I do (i.e. looking at data, rapidly summarizing it and presenting my decisions and findings to a firing squad of higher-ups, and executing an unending stream of annoying and difficult tasks afterwards) and don't really want to keep doing what I do in my current role or in a role with more responsibility in the case of a promotion. I don't think I'm dumb although it feels that way sometimes, but I don't know if this job or if engineering in general is for me. Advice/is this normal?

Wall of Text

I graduated from an accredited university (albeit rumor has it that it is somewhat easier than most/the best engineering schools) with a BS degree in chemical engineering last summer. During college I also got ~1.5 cumulative years of engineering work experience as a co-op. I had a good mentor there who encouraged me, so I thought I would be fine in the working world. I've always had good grades throughout school and did very well in college, so I never thought I was dumb. Not the smartest, but not dumb...until now. I decided that I wanted to challenge myself after school, so I got my first job out of undergrad in a fast-paced, high-intensity company in a relatively new and dynamic industry. I knew going into the job that it would be a challenge, and my interviewers said that it would take me about a year to feel fully functional, but I'm having my doubts that I'll ever get there, and if I do get there whether or not I'll even want to stay. I've made some mistakes (nothing catastrophic), but recently the mistake rate has increased and I've gotten this feeling that I've made more than is expected out of a newbie. I'm diligent and check my work multiple times, but the work feels so complicated that I feel it's a miracle if anything goes through without something going wrong. Some of my mistakes have been honest (i.e I'm unconsciously unaware enough of a situation to even realize there could be a mistake to be made). Some have been stupid, and looking back probably could and should have been avoided - missing a negative sign, etc. Like I said, I don't do something unless I check it at least 2 - 3 times if not more and feel as certain as I can that it's right, but I feel that there are so many opportunities for screw ups and that I spend too much time checking things to adequately perform the other responsibilities I have to fulfill, and so I'm stuck at work late almost daily (my manager has told me I should not be at work late twice now) trying to get what I need to get finished finished. This snowballs into me being tired and sick of being at work which makes focusing and doing good work harder and leads to more screw ups that shouldn't have been made...you get the idea. My current state is I think like I'm starting to get a reputation for messing things up and I haven't even been there 1 year yet. I understand that credibility is huge, and I also understand that I'm learning, but at this point I can't help but feel that I've got a hole to dig myself out of if I'm ever going to feel comfortable staying. And honestly, I don't even think I care enough about the field/job to stay for long in the case that I do figure it all out. I'm exhausted and I feel like I've been running on empty for the past 3 months now.

I would like to at least stick it out for a year both to give the job a fair shot and to look better on applications once/if I move on to something else, but I am also afraid that it's not going to get any easier, and my mistakes will just keep piling up and make it harder to get a good recommendation. On top of that I don't even really care about the work that I'm doing and honestly don't feel much desire to stay in engineering. My only real motivation right now is the paycheck, but I think I could be satisfied with less as I don't really have expensive tastes or habits. I feel that a dream job is something of an illusion and I'm not exactly trying to find that as much as I am trying to find a direction to go. Showing up to work to immediately have 5 new things thrown at me and then have to quickly figure them out, stick my findings in a presentation backed by cold hard data, present them to higher-ups (all within 2 - 3 hours of arriving), and somehow not look dumb not only in the execution of the presentation, but also the execution of the projects and the demonstration of critical knowledge is starting to feel overwhelming, nearly impossible, and frankly awful on a daily basis. I don't really see it getting better - I just don't want to stick around for it if I don't have to. I've had issues with stress/anxiety in the past, but have always excelled and have told that I would do well at whatever I do yada yada yada. I can't help but feel like everything so far has just been wrong. Does everyone go through this in the first year, or should I get out while the getting is good?

49,Seasoned MEs and EEs: What are your favorite interview questions for candidates?,1518498265,"In the course of my last three jobs I've performed dozens of interviews. First for a company I founded several years back, later for small businesses (&lt;50 employees).


In the first two cases, my general strategy was to look over a resume and portfolio, ask specific questions about specific aspects of past work, and gauge how knowledgeable the candidate was. I prefer to feel out a candidate's intuition and grasp of engineering concepts rather than ask them to remember complex equations, on the theory that it's much easier to find the right equations (and know how to apply them) if you understand the underlying theory, rather than going the other way. 


Anyway, the interview process in my current job is more structured and there is a series of interviews each addressing different things. For ME and EE candidates I perform the technical part of the interview. Traditionally (as a holdover from the last guy in this role) we ask candidates how they would design ""X"" system (each time a system *we* designed) and gauge their responses. I've never liked this approach, for a couple reasons. One, the questions are poorly worded and confusing, and it often takes 10 minutes just to get the idea across. With Skype interviews it takes twice as long, and is frustrating for all involved. Two, as they are designing we progressively add constraints, and inevitably these constraints push the applicant to reproduce our existing design, the way we designed it. I find that to be a poor way of gauging competency. 


With that in mind, I've re-structured my interview process to include a few things:


* Conceptual questions: Questions that do not require doing any math to solve if you understand the problem. Some of these seem really simple and I'm almost embarrassed to ask them - except that so few candidates get most of them correct, so I persist. I.e. many grad students and experienced engineers still seem to think that the amount of force acting on a dam is a function of the volume of water behind it. 

* Design questions: ""How would you design a system to achieve 'X.'"" They are sometimes but not often related to our actual work, and I like to throw out design problems most engineers haven't encountered outside of niche industries to see how they think about a problem.
 
* CAD test: for now this involves dimensioning a part. I'll give a random part in Solidworks and give them 15 minutes to create a dimensioned drawing. It's pretty easy to see if a candidate has had any real world GD&amp;T experience. 


So with that in mind, I'd like to know how you guys/gals do this. Are there any particular conceptual or design questions you're very fond of or that you consider particularly illuminating? Do you ask calculation-intensive questions?

60,Is it worth it to apply to defense companies if I'm interested in international opportunities later on?,1518476974,"I'm a 4th year EE student at UT Austin who will graduate in December 2018. My concentration is in Applied Electromagnetics, and as I understand, defense companies do a lot of the fancy projects in that area - Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon, etc. For most of undergrad, I was the kind of person that was really interested in working for those companies. I applied to their internships, but never got any offers (though I do have other internship experience).

Anyways, for the past semester or so, I've increasingly been questioning my desire to work in the defense industry. The morality issue had always been lurking in the back of my head, along with the amount of bureaucracy, but beyond that, I'm now strongly thinking of pursuing international opportunities - upon graduation, I'd like to work for ~2 years and save up enough money to pursue a M.Sc. in Europe. After doing that for 1.5-2 years, either remain in Europe should I get a job offer there, or return to the US. Maybe it's too early to be planning the next five-ish years of my life like this, but that's my ideal goal at the moment.

So at this point I'm left wondering if it's even worth applying to full-time positions at defense companies prior to graduation, particularly those that require a clearance. I've never held one before, and I'm not sure how much my desire to study/work abroad could affect my being granted one. Furthermore, if I return to the US after doing a master's abroad and apply to defense companies, would it be a lot harder to get a security clearance (foreign contacts, bank accounts, etc.)?  For either situation, should I just apply to non-defense companies?

 It will be touching 3 walls...  the wall over the garage door to halfway to other side and from wall to wall over (perpendicular to) the garage door,. that's where i will need some sort of hangers. 

I would like to hang it from the ceiling, if possible, so I can still get a car in, its already tight in there.
I believe the rafters above will run parallel with the joists, so each joist (if needed) can have a hanger to attach to the band of the deck. 
Do I need to get an engineer to tell me exactly how i need to do it? 
Or can I hang some metal straps or something from the rafters and bolt 3 sides of outer band to that the wall studs then install some joists?
People will walk on this plus weight of storage materials; also stairs will go to the loft.

I am currently working as an intern within a large semiconductor company while I work towards my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. Unfortunately, I hate my internship. I spend my days looking at spreadsheets, filling out purchase orders and doing minimal actual engineering work. It bothers me almost every day that my internship is doing very little to help advance my technical abilities. Due to this, I have been aggressively looking for a new internship for this summer. Recently I had an interview with Intel and I did very well but, I was told they couldn’t offer me an internship and instead was offered a Full time position as a process engineer.

Still, I have two main questions:

1.	Would you guys recommend taking the job and see if I can have Intel pick up the bill for the rest of my masters? So far I haven’t spent any money on my masters due to me finishing my Bachelors early and being able to use my left over scholarship money on my graduate course work.

Since a flow must always go from High pressure to low pressure. Does this mean in some instances velocity can act like pressure? The reason I ask this is because of how nozzles works...

If you had a compressor that pushes a flow through a nozzle. You'll get some pressure drop due to obstruction of flow...... but for the most part the pressure drops and the velocity increases. Could you reduce the pressure to the point where it's less than atmospheric pressure and have the flow go from low pressure to high pressure? Have the nozzle spray directly into the atmosphere.

Or would this cause a backflow? And I am realizing you have to take into account the compressor pressure/flow curve... but if possible could it be explained in a more simple manner?

5,What is your history with CAD programs. Which do you like most (why?) and which do you hate (why)?,1518345941,"I've been using 5 different CAD programs so far.

CATIA, Pro/E and Creo Parametric, Creo Elements, Inventor and Solid Works. I'd like to write a short conclusion of each and at the end a big rant why I think that ProE/Creo is by far the worst, at least for my type of work... This includes Creo Parametric and Elements.

- When I started at university, CATIA (V5) was the first CAD program I learned. I liked it. Very versatile. I was good in modelling in different modules, parts, sheet metal, generative shape design and assembly. But I only modelled parts and made assemblies of it, small fixtures, no whole machine. So until today I can not judge Catia's potential and possibilities when you have lots of motions and different configurations (like robots/handlings that pick and place stuff) in a machine. What I noticed in assemblies... putting standard parts like screws, pins, O rings, washers, safety rings, keys etc was somehow.. exhausting. Quiet extensive work and not very comfortable. Also building steel racks with standard steel profiles. I'm sure there are libraries that contain it, but I didn't have them available. So they seem not to be included in Catia with the standard installation.

- Then I started as an intern at a design bureau. They used Pro/Engineer. I learned it quickly, modelled parts and assembled them. Not a problem for ""small"" assemblies and fixtures. What I found shitty from the beginning:

1.) you have to do like a million clicks to do anything... that complicated pile of context menu windows to get to the option you wanted. This was improved when Pro/E became Creo, but I find it still the worst of any CAD Program.

2.) Also that you have to click ""activate window"" every time you change the window you're working in. WTF? And this until today (at least in Creo Parametric 2 but this it what two of Germany's biggest companies and that I work for still use)

There are many more things that annoy me so much that I fear I'll get a anger stroke or heart attack one day. But more in the end at my final conclusions.

How ever, until today I found two things that are better than in other cad programs:

1.) swapping one part of an assembly to another new one. There is a setting where an window opens, that shows the old and new part next to each other, and you can go through all contraints linked to the old part, and assign the corresponding surface or feature on the new part. In other programs the connections often are lost and have to be re-assigned in a less comfortable way

2.) performance is good. Even a big machine or assembly line with thousands of components runs really smooth. Inventor on the other hand gets unusable very fast unless you use simplified levels of detail.

- Then I learned Inventor. I think Inventor is the most intuitive CAD Program that I know. It is super easy to use standard parts and it has a huge standard part database including bearings, steel profiles, sealings as stock. It is also very easy to place them... just pick the type of screw you want, klick on the hole for it to be placed, and it automatically recognizes the correct length and other holes where it assumes that I want to use the same screw. It is super easy to define many movements/positions inside a complex machine. In my opionion it is great that parts are freely dragable unless you limit motions with contraints. Makes it easy to just drag parts around at the place you like and then mount it. Also working with flexible assemblies works great. I can drag parts inside a sub assembly around and constrain them in the main assembly to external references.


- Then I had a project with a customer who insited on getting the 3d CAD data and drawings in Creo Elements. Until this day I wasn't even aware that non-parametric cad programs even exist. I tried my best to get familiar with it quickly. Must say, for a quick and dirty mock up or concept it really has its advantaces. But for my type of work it determined it was useless... I had parts with too complicated shapes that I expected to change frequently during the project, I also had a machine with too many moving parts, a roboter that does lots of things with a bulky handlign in a very narrow space... In creo elements it was impossible to make collision analyses and simulate my movements. So I decided to work that project in inventor, after I was finished, I exported the result as STEP, imported it it to creo elements, applied threads to thread holes (which weren't included in the STEP of course)... and then made the drawings in creo elements hoping no more changes would be required.

- Then I switched to another company that used Solid Works. Sadly due to unfortunate circumstances I stayed there only for 6 weeks... But I found solid works very similar to inventor. I guess even better. But didn't work with it long enough to be sure. What is great it that it has more options to choose for part constraints in an assembly... I also prefer that there is only one feature for defining level of detail and different positions. In Inventor this is separated into two features which is more complicated to define and to switch inbetween.

Anyway, I've only worked with Inventor for the last 2 years but my current project, which is a big fully automatic assembly line with many movements requires Creo (Parametric) to be used. It is my first ever complicated machine with lots of movements to be done in Creo. I wasn't aware how much of a pain in the arse creo is until now..

1.) Every time you change the working window you have to click ""active window""

2.) That you have to chose a working space and that creo saves everything in it. So importing a step file of an assembly creates a huge mess in my working folder

3.) When I import a step file of an assembly, it doesn't keep the original file names of the contained parts, it either makes it prt001 or it keeps the original name and suffixes an version1 which is often cut because of file name length restrictions

4.) creo is shitty with longer file names and spaces in the file names

5.) applying inter-part constraint in an assembly isn't bi-directional like in any good CAD program. In creo you have to pick a part condition and an assembly condition. It isn't interchangeable afterwards. This is the hugest pain I've ever felt in my job... It interrupts my work flow so much, it is really hard to justify to my boss who is only familiar with good (more user friendly) CAD programs.
Example: I usually built my fixture/machine around the work piece. I load the work piece into my assembly, and start modelling all the functional components around it. The last component will be the base plate on which the whole fixture is mounted. Now the problem is: I have movements in this fixture. The work piece was the first piece. So it is locked in place and stays still and the hole fixture moves around it. That is very shitty and not practicable. In any good CAD-Program, where constraints are bi directional, I'd un-anchor my work piece, and anchor my base plate. Done! The machines stays stationary, and the work piece moves inside the machine. To do this in Creo/ProE you have to edit every constrain between the parts, make the base plate the assembly contraint, and the piece mounted on it the part contraint, then to the next part all the chain up to the work piece.

6.) Basically the same as above, but the hierarchy in the model tree is important to make an assembly functional, and it is not too easy to change the order afterwards because of the non-bi-directionality of constraints. For example let's say I have a guide rail with a linear carriage mounted on it. On the carriage I mount a sub assembly. Parallel to the guide rail I place a pneumatic cylinder that should move the whole sub assembly along the guide rail. In a good CAD program that is easily done. I define the carriage as flexible in the desired direction and just constrain the sub assembly mounted on the carriage with the piston rod. Now when I extend or retract the piston rod, the whole sub assembly including the carriage moves. Not so in Creo. There I'd have to place the cylinder first, then put something like a flex coupling on it, and then constrain at the sub assembly with the flex coupling. This is very impractical so I have to use temporary planes etc.

7.) Everytime you change the working window you have to click ""active window""
8.) Everytime you change the working window you have to click ""active window""
9.) Everytime you change the working window you have to click ""active window""
10.) Everytime you change the working window you have to click ""active window""
11.) Everytime you change the working window you have to click ""active window""
12.) Everytime you change the working window you have to click ""active window""
13.) Everytime you change the working window you have to click ""active window""
14.) Everytime you change the working window you have to click ""active window""

10,Help a fabricator with dimensions and tolerances.,1518319341,"Engineers of Reddit, I am a steel fabricator and many of the newer drawings that we get at my shop are now dimensioned in inch decimals rather than fractions. Work sometimes comes to a screeching halt, several cups of coffee are poured and better part of a morning is spent arguing over a dilemma such as this:  

I have a drawing (tolerance block x.x+-0.100, x.xx+-.010 etc.) with a 10.5 inch square steel plate. Across the top and bottom are three holes (6 total) so this plate will fit/mount over 6 welded studs.  The dimension from the edge of the plate to the middle hole is 5.3 inches.  Now the hole is drawn in the middle of the plate.  On older prints it would have said 5 1/4 inches but now it says 5.3.  Half of the gang says put the hole in the middle the other half says put the hole at 5.3.  Across the shop the welders are having much the same problem.  Well actually, they're really just sitting down because they don't know where to weld their studs.  

Now I know that I can put the hole in the middle at 3 1/4 inches and be within tolerance. Then I have to deal with the idiot from inspection (a failed fabricator) who says ""I thought you were better than that"" and points out that my hole is .050 different than the print.  

Any guidance, rule of thumb or reference would be greatly appreciated.  

 Edit: Thanks  for responses so far.  To add, we fabricate parts and pieces for ships and other marine structures that are being repaired/overhauled.  The original design prints come from some well known US based firms.  I won't throw them under the bus.  The example I gave is simple but true.  It gets much worse with complex structures the have stacked dimensions that have all been rounded for tolerance reasons.

15,"Looking for a cheap, low powered pump for a demonstration project",1518306618,"I volunteer with a professional engineering society in my town. There's a big event coming up in about a month that I'd like to make a little hands-on demonstration project for. I'm going to ask the society to cover the cost of building this project, but I'd still like to keep costs as low as possible. Since this is also just a demonstration, there's no real need for anything high-end.

The project I have in mind is basically a tiny ""wind tunnel"" filled with rheoscopic fluid (basically water+mica flakes). I'd place an airfoil on a shaft in the center such that it can be rotated (I'm thinking a magnetic coupling so I don't need to seal the shaft), and the rheoscopic fluid would show how the flow changes. The visual section would be no more than ~8x8x0.25 inches (and probably less). A pump of some type would drive the flow - and this is where I'm getting stuck.

[schematic](https://imgur.com/AYnbR2V). I picked the location of the pump (pink) arbitrarily in this drawing - it can be elsewhere in the circuit.

I've thought about something as simple as a submersible pump which is cheap and easy to find, but I'm not sure how well it'd stand up the the mica flakes in the flow. It also has the issue of needing electricity to run, which isn't always guaranteed. I've also had the idea of a hand turned pump, though that comes with needing a sealing gasket on the shaft which complicates the design a bit.

I've also heard of magnetic coupling centrifugal pumps in my searches, which basically just use a magnet to turn the pump without a mechanical linkage. This would work great since it minimizes the risk of leaks since I wouldn't need to drill any holes in the fluid-filled section, but all I've found is articles describing the principle with nowhere to actually get ahold of one. This would even work with my hand-turned pump idea if I could just find the pump part, but it'd also work with a battery powered drill, for example.

Does anyone have any experience with a pump that might work here and know where I could find one?

22,"Jon boat-bass boat conversion- wiring, framing, etc. help!",1518297447,"I have a 14' long, 4' wide riveted aluminum jon boat with a 25 hp 4 stroke Tohatsu outboard motor.  I am planning to add a casting deck to the bow with some accessories (seat, trolling motor, lights, fish finder, etc.).  I have included a rough diagram of the layout I have planned so far, as well as a wiring diagram.  I'm seeking advice, suggestions, critiscisms, and harangues.



The area of the bow is about 13 square feet (28x50x48 inches) and has 1 aluminum bench and one small shelf in the bow I plan to utilize as part of the support frame already in place, which I will utilize as [art of the support frame.  I'm still debating the materials to use as frame and decking, but have it mostly narrowed to aluminum square tubing and angle or 2x2 and 2x4 lumber for the structural frame, with either 1/2"" plywood as decking or some other material (maybe 1/2"" PVC sheeting?).  I'm interested in making it as light as I can without breaking the bank, with durability to last.  I’ve only done a little bit of work with aluminum, and would use screws, bolts, and rivets for hardware (I can’t weld).  For a non-slip surface on top of the decking, either marine carpeting or this stuff called [Hydro Turf](https://www.hydroturf.com/hydro-turf-sheets/sheets-boating/pwc-boating-47-x-86-cut-groove.html).  I do know that treated wood and aluminum don’t mix particularly well, so if I do use wood, it would be untreated, but sealed, primed, and painted to protect it from rot.  This boat will only be used in freshwater, so saltwater corrosion is not going to be an issue.
I’d like to know what suggestions you may have for other materials, construction, etc.  I realize my diagrams are crude (that’s being generous), but I am currently away from home for work and can’t take exact measurements nor take pictures of where the supports are and what the boat actually looks like.



As for the wiring, I believe I have that mostly figured out, at least what color wire goes where.  The engine has a small 12v 14A alternator on it (it’s a manual start engine, no need for a cranking battery).  I plan to connect the engine alternator to my deep cycle battery to charge it a little while the engine is running during runs between fishing spots while my trolling motor is off.  The alternator is not enough to keep the battery charged with the trolling motor in use, since that draws 42A at max speed.  However, if I can gain a little bit of battery life back during the course of a day, that’s all I’m asking for.  I have a charger  at home I can use to fully recharge the deep cycle at the end of a trip.  I have the isolation switch at the battery so that I can kill the whole system if needed, and to isolate the battery and engine from the electronics so the alternator isn’t overworked (if that’s a thing).  The main questions I have are, are the circuits in my diagram adequately protected with breakers/fuses, and is there a way to simplify or improve this plan? One diagram is fuse-protected, another is breaker protected, and the last is breaker-protected with a fuse in front of the switch panel.   I have included the current draw values (approximate) of each accessory in the diagram.

31,mixing tank design question,1518280946,"Hello engineers. Capitalist here.

I have a glue mixing tank (about 1M tall, 80cm diameter) that is to be filled with at most 8 ingredients and then mixed together with an agitator. After the following the recipe, the viscosity of the mixture needs to be checked and added extra ingredients if the visco is too high or too low.

Currently, mixing is done using manual labor.

my questions are:

    Is there a way to automate this process?

    Does there exists a way to use the agitator as a way to measure the viscosity?

To further clarify question 1, there are 3 kinds of ingredients: powder, granule, and liquid. What is a good system to store and automatically mix them together? I'm sure this has been done before, so perhaps if you could just point me at a product, that is enough for me to learn more about it

To further clarify question 2, how do I monitor the torque, given constant RPM (does it need to be constant?), to then create a statistical relationship between torque and viscosity value based on manual viscometer, so that while the motor is running, I can have a display on the visco and have the machine stop after it reaches certain value, or to add certain ingredients from (1) to increase or decrease the visco?

Sorry I don't know much about detailed technical engineering jargon and what nots. Again, if this type of machine already exists, please just point it to me.

I bought a California Air Tools rated for 4gpm @ 40psi. I typically run it at about 30psi and it runs approximately 3/4 of the time.

45,Various questions regarding a renaissance fair tent I'm building,1518227191,"Hi r/AskEngineers! Quick background- I'm designing a homemade tent to fit the theme of the guild I'm joining the next several years at my local renaissance fair. I'm reasonable experience with wood work and light framing, but not experienced with engineering designs. This is by far the largest single structure I've ever taken on, and before spending lots of money on material, I'd like to address possible engineering issues.

Attached below are a few pictures of my tent design, quickly put together in SketchUp. All dimensions are Imperial, feet and inches. Most material is 2x4 wood studs, except for the top 4 'bone' shaped pieces, which would be 4x4 posts (adding material to the ends that would be sanded to shape, i don't believe this will affect anything structurally as the smallest point isnt affected). The rods are one of my questions below. All joints are designed to come apart for storage, except for the 45 degree seem where the vertical 2x4 meets the horizontal 2x4, which would be glued and screwed during the initial build.

https://imgur.com/a/r2K81


The rods are going to be a total of 12' in length, with an average of 10'6"" between attaching points, with the exception of the top rod at 11'2"". The rods will have a hole drilled on either side of the wood it slides through (total of 4 holes per rod), with an appropriately sized pin installed to keep the studs from sliding along the rods. These rods serve a few purposes, such as holding all the parts together and keeping the two main walls vertical.The rods will also hold up the canvas siding, which is spec'd at 12oz per sq yard. 


 - What material would be best suited to this? My original plan was to use wooden rods, but I'm having trouble sourcing them and am also starting to have concerns about the weight and forces theyd be subject to. The next thought was to use either ""2 OD x .120 wall A513 HREW Round Steel Tube"" or ""1-1/2 OD x .065 wall A513 HREW Round Steel Tube"" from my local steel shop, depending on actual requirements of this build. 


 - Would either of these be suitable? Would I need something larger/thicker? Or could I possible get away with something lighter(cheaper!)? or should I instead be aiming for a square cut wood?


 - What size hole+pin would be appropriate to prevent the entire tent from going askew?


 - Or should I consider adding another L type bracket to the inside of each vertical 2x4 to stop this type of movement?


 - For the two intersections of the 4x4 posts, I planned on cutting a 2in deep channel in each beam so they'll slide together and interlock at my desired angle and on a single plane, but still come apart later. The purpose of this joint is to prevent the entire tent from widening under its own load. With my design, I believe that load is upper rod, the 4x4s and the fabric over the top. I'm also planning on using tent stakes at the outside of the lower rods to help keep it from moving. Would this joint be strong enough to stop that action? Any concerns I may not have considered when using this type of joint, especially with the hole drilled through the center for the rod? Is there a name for this type of joint?

56,Calculating the drag force and engine force of Bugatti Veyron at top speed.,1518203208,"All the following specs are the actual specs and not assumed. The Bugatti Veyron SuperSport has a top speed of 430kmh or 119 ms. It has a Cd*A of 0.808. Assuming density of air is 1.2kg/m^3

I use the drag force equation. So the drag force is 1/2* 0.808*1.2 *(119)^2. This amounts to a drag force of 6900N.

Now the force produced by the car at 430kmh at 6250rpm, with a wheel radius of 0.35m, in 7th gear with a final drive ratio of 3.64 and a 7th gear ratio of 0.8 and engine torque found from [this](http://www.automobile-catalog.com/curve/2015/1439180/bugatti_veyron_16_4_super_sport.html) graph is 1300* 3.64*0.8/0.35 which amounts to 10800 N.

Thus using specs I have found that the torque produced by the engine far exceeds the drag force at 430 kmh and yet 430kmh is the actual nonlimited top speed of the car. I know rolling resistance and other frictional forces  exist but they are negligible at these speeds and contribute to 5% error not 40%.

71,Internship offer advice,1518153105,"I'll start off with a bit about my situation. I won't censor anything because I think all the little details are important. So basically, I got an internship offer today from Aerojet Rocketdyne in Canoga Park (North LA/Valley area). The position sounds amazing and it's really almost exactly what I wanted to do this Summer. I'd be doing a lot of work designing and analyzing electrical systems. The only problem is that I live in the El Segundo/South Bay area. Anyone who's familiar with LA at all knows the 405 is godamn awful to have to commute on. I'm thinking I'd be spending at least two hours driving M-F, on top of working 8 hours a day. I'm definitely prone to burn out, so this is a major drawback.  Plus, I would have no life outside work on the weekdays. 

But anyway, they offered the position to me today. What should I say? I don't have any other offers yet and I don't have any way to tell if I'll get any. But I applied to a couple of positions much more local to me in El Segundo and Torrance. I would much rather take some offers there if I had a choice (of course depending on what it is). I'm wondering if I should ask when my deadline is to accept the position... or just accept it and cancel later if something else comes up. Both sound kinda unprofessional and uncourteous in my opinion. Are either a thing that people do and is one better than the other? Just because I want to be completely transparent, I also applied to L3 Technologies, LISI Aerospace (Torrance) and Raytheon, The Aerospace Corporation (El Segundo). In terms of prestige, is Aerojet much higher in ranking? All the positions that I applied to sound fun, but I have no idea when I would get any sort of reply from them.

78,Construction to.... design? Need somr career advice,1518137184,"Hello everyone,

So I definitely need some advice for me and my career going forward. A little background info first. I graduated this past May and was hired by a large scale, heavy civil construction company as an engineer and was told to report to Chicago (was from Pittsburgh but went to school in Vermont). The work wasn't too bad as my hours were from 7:35 ( time I got in ) to about 5. Most of the time, I was doing estimating which was interesting and did little to no field work. Even though my work/life balance was pretty good and I never worked a weekend, I wanted some field experience that I was promised during the hiring process. So this past October, they sent me to North Carolina and helped me get situated. 

My first job was a nightmare. 14-15 hr. days , 6 days a week working a mix of days and nights. I absolutely hated the work and was pretty depressed with how my life was going. After about 2 months, I had surgery on an old shoulder tear and was out for a month. I just recently came back and I moved once more to the Charlotte area. Now I'm working 11 hr. Days which isn't awful but I was told that ill be moving again soon to be on a job, start to finish.

My question is what should I do if I absolutely don't like my line of work? I have to stay with this company until November 2019 due to them helping me relocate.  I hate my work/life balance and i keep moving which is honestly getting old fast. My girlfriend ( soon to be fiance ) is going to move in later this December and I can't/won't move after that. Should I switch to estimating at the main Charlotte office? What kind of engineering careers are out there with that I could get with my experience and with a proper life balance?

In order to get the most out of these conversations, I was hoping for input as to what kinds of questions or topics I should try to ask about?  I plan on discussing their careers (where they started and how they got to where they are), the specific responsibilities of their positions, what they found very challenging, what kinds of things I should strive to do to advance, advice for someone starting a career, and if there was something they wished they had done differently and likely other related topics.

82,How did you get yourself out of a rut?,1518130622,"Well, I just lost my 2nd job in &lt;4 years of graduating.  I can't seem to keep up with the workload anywhere and I get overwhelmed and then just kind of check out.  I can never get anyone to mentor me on the job and I have a very hard time managing myself.  I always thought new engineers would be taken under the wing of a more experienced person and shown the ropes for a few years with someone playing an active role in training them up.  

That has not been my experience and I am floundering under my own direction. I experience a lot of stress and anxiety at both jobs on a daily basis and I just can't work through it without getting pulled off task by my phone or computer. Obviously unacceptable behaviour.  

Now, I am concerned I am moving too fast through jobs (this one lasted less than a year).  It may become harder to get another job after this.  I was thinking about some project management jobs, like maybe a different environment/expectation would help me not feel so lost. 

Have any of you ever been through similar experiences? How did you get through it? Did you stay in engineering, or transition to a different role?  How do you get past the feeling of not knowing how to do fucking anything.  I feel like I could try like one more job before I am convinced that I am just not cut out for this stuff, and I'm wondering what the next step is.  Should I transition to a different career?

Mostly, I'm wondering what formula an entry level engineer should use to compare hourly salary to yearly salary. What kind of hours will I be putting in?

1. How often do you use math? I really enjoy math and the prospect of using it more has made me consider switching 
2. How exact is software? In other words, in ChemE processes your calculations are only a very good estimate as you have to take into account many outside factors. I.e. energy is never 100% conserved.
3. How much applied logic do you use on the job? Another major thing for me is logical analysis. I’m a very passionate debater. I love breaking things down to a very logical standpoint I.e. “you think x because y occurs in your brain which triggers z” 
4. Is your work challenging? I love being mentally challenged and having to think my way through something that isn’t always clear, this is what made me fall in love with Engineering in general.

I have two degrees in AE and I very much enjoy technical challenges and finding solutions and i consider myself a good leader but as a manager I'm still very green.


My job at the moment is like spinning plates. There is so many little things to grasp and I don't get much support.

I've seen some really interesting jobs for a company doing space engines which sounds amazing. The pay is similar and the benefits better.

Of course for many, including myself taking this offer from such a company is a no brainer. 

However at the end of the process the COO sat down with me and made the point that going into the management side of things is a role which isn't as technical as some engineering students may hope. He told me to go away and think about if going down this path is something I can give 100% to and is something I can give the best of myself to. 

I was wondering if anyone could offer advice in terms of an engineer heading down this path at an early stage. 

What is the difficulty of changeing paths back towards a technical side potentially?

Would an engineer who goes straight into managerial positions be stumped by a lack of technical experience?
