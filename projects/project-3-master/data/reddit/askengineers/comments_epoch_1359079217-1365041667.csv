0,"Need help deciding on job offers, unsure of what is the best option available.",1365038894,"My girlfriend is graduating this May and has just received an offer from a company she recently interviewed for. She graduated with a degree in Aerospace Engineering, but the job offer is for a consulting firm, not specifically an Aerospace one.

The problem now arises because she has an interview tomorrow for an Aerospace firm, but the offer from the Consulting job is asking for an answer by Monday, which doesn't seem to be enough time to decide, let alone hold both offers up for a choice. She is also ambivalent because she's not sure if taking a job with the consulting firm (which provides better benefits/salary) will stunt her ability to get into the Aerospace field later if she so decides.

I'm unsure if mentioning the companies by name or other specific details in public is wise, but I can provide details as needed.

8,How valuable would my masters degree be? How relevant does my research need to be to the field I want to go into?,1365012528,"I went to grad school thinking I would be immersed in academia and be learning a ton for two years.  I picked a new professor because I thought he would be ambitious and hungry in order to get tenure.  

Two years later, it is evident I was wrong.  The classes I have taken have been a joke.  In some cases the professors literally gave us the answers to tests and projects so it would look like we were doing a lot of good work to the powers that be, but in reality they were just handing out As.

My advisor has no backbone or goals.  The last two years of research has been aimless.  I was literally told to go do some experiments of my choosing and we will figure out what to write a thesis on later.  I have been scavenging random parts and scrap in order to set something scientific up.  In the last 2 months a collaborator and myself have completely cut our advisor out of everything, stopped showing up to meetings, and made an ambitious drive for tangible results with a lot of success.  At this rate it will still take another 5 months for us to graduate and we will still have to navigate the bureaucracy of an evasive, unaccountable, and arrogant department.

I've checked all around, well-known and obscure: McMaster, Carr-Lane, Alcoa Fastener, Grainger, Thread Tool Supply, and Newman Tools (the worst-designed company website I've ever seen).  Only the last two had **any** left-hand sizes, and they weren't large enough.

Pumping and Environmental Engineering Problem.,1364929717,"The design project I'm working on involves an array of groundwater recovery well pumps that will be pushing water over a hill, where on the opposite side an existing water treatment system is in place.  The groundwater has dilute concentrations of hydrocarbons (Benzene, TBA, etx.) as well as some anaerobic gases (Methane and CO2) in the dissolve phase.  The pumps are designed to pump liquid only, and there are no knockout drums between the pump and the water treatment system.

The concern that we have is whether this mixture will generate excessive vapors at the high point of the pipe line (at the top of the hill), and if those vapors will need to be vented at the high point.  If the vapors require venting, I need to determine if the vapor concentration will require some kind of treatment (either activated carbon or an oxidizer, for example).

Here are some of the groundwater laboratory results.  These are the maximum concentrations detected (Gas/Vapor results are taken from liquid headspace in the lab): 

*  Benzene:  1,000 ug/m3
*  Methane:  10,00 ppmv
*  C4 as n-Butane:  2,600 ppmv
*  C7 as n-Heptane:  3,300 ppmv
*  C11 as n-Undecane:  2,200 ppmv
*  Carbon Dioxide:  300,000 ppmv


Ideally, I need to determine a unit of vapor generated per unit of liquid, and an approximation as to what concentrations the vapor will consist of.

67,Request: Property drainage solutions,1364621348,"x-post from [r/winnipeg](http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1ba1fo/request_property_drainage_solutions/)

Looking for suggestions or ideas to improve drainage on my property:

I have a single level house with a 2-3' crawlspace, built in the 1950s in Winnipeg, MB, Canada. With the quick melt-off of snow in the spring of 2011, my crawlspace flooded and stayed wet for a couple of months. The soil on my lot has clearly shifted over the years (and my house with it). The soil grade no longer slopes away from the foundation, assuming it even did at one point. The amount of snow on my property right now worries me as spring draws nearer. I definitely need to improve the grading around my house before next winter.

I am wondering if it would be worthwhile to install a drain tile around the foundation, along with a [dry well](http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/intro/0,,20486669,00.html) while I am shifting earth to improve the grade.

Due to the clay content of the local soil, I'm not sure that a dry well would be very effective. It stands to reason in my mind that it would be better than nothing though.  A sump pump is the only other option I am aware of, and it seems like it would be more trouble and expense than it's worth to install (would have to pull up the floor of my living room for large enough access to the crawlspace).  Flooding due to rainfall doesn't really seem to be an issue, and since it's not a full basement, installing a sump doesn't seem justified.  Obviously I wish to protect my house, but the shifting over the past 60 years has only led to minor cosmetic issues thus far.

Any thoughts on lot grading and drainage for my property? Would a drain tile around the foundation attached to a dry well be worth putting in just to help with the spring thaw each year?  Should grading the lot properly be enough to protect my crawlspace? Any other suggestions?

(For those that aren't aware, Winnipeg is built at the confluence of two rivers in the middle of the prairies in Canada.  Generally speaking = flat land, high water table, clay-filled soil. To my knowledge, the norm on new builds is sump pits/pumps.  Sumps must drain above ground, not directly into the storm drain system.)",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/1bafe5/request_property_drainage_solutions/

I'm looking for help on writing a letter to the California Board of Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists. My application for a Civil PE license was shot down on the grounds that there wasn't enough info to determine the work as civil engineering under their definition. Any feedback on my letter would be much appreciated!  



Dear X:    
	I am a recent applicant for licensing as a Professional Civil Engineer sitting for the April 2013 exams. In a letter dated January 1, 2013, I received the Board’s determination that my application would be classified as incomplete. In response, I submit this letter further detailing my engagement period with X Company. Please accept this additional information to supplement Engagement Record and Reference Form used to determine if my engagement would qualify as Engineering Experience under the Board’s definition.   

The only project during my engagement period was the Project X: Radiological Remediation and Support which lasted from my date of hire, November 1, 2010, to the deadline of the April 2013 exam application, November 1, 2012. Its purpose was to protect the public health and welfare, and the environment from actual or potential releases of radiological contaminants with the removal of sewer and stormwater drainage piping, materials, and soil in the D-1 parcel area that was found to contain contamination. The piping, the trenches resulting from the piping removal, the surrounding soil, and nearby buildings were screened and sampled for their specific physical quality of radiological concern. Additional excavation remediation was performed as necessary. All materials that were determined to have contamination were properly disposed of. Site restoration activities included the installation of a temporary drainage swale to manage overland storm water flow.  In addition, trench excavations were backfilled to grade followed by the application of road base material.   

Below I have organized a table listing my tasks and duties in contribution to the project in detail and a corresponding engineering principle beside each.
 /*I could not format this as a table in reddit, so please pretend it is a table. I numbered the tasks to match the right principles.*/
  
Tasks/Duties  
1. Design and review of sampling activities of trenches and soil below asphalt layer.  
2. Analyzed screening results of sewer/storm water drainage piping for removal and proper disposal.  
3. Evaluated results of sampling to determine soil/concrete quality for release or disposal.  
4. Designed plans for further excavation for removal of hotspots within trenches.  
5. Coordinated with radiological technicians, GIS specialists, surveyors to determine trench suitability for backfill.  
6. Prepared and modified trench, soil, and drainage pipe sampling and screening data for engineering reports (RACR, SUPR, FSSR).  
7. Field inspection of technicians and contractors.	
  
Engineering Principles  
1. Determined number and location of samples required to characterize soil based on distribution analysis.  
2. Determined whether material was suitable for release or disposal based on its radiological properties.  
3. Determined whether an excavated trench or surface area was suitable for backfill or required further excavation.  
4. Determined size of excavation and soil volume removed that would contain contamination yielding a clean trench or surface area.  
5. Coordination of the work of professional, technical, or special consultants.  
6. Technical and engineering report preparation.  
7. Inspected completed work to determine compliance with work plans and hotspot excavation designs.

Also they are throwing in a generous sign on bonus. I can't really say no to the new offer.

But, here's my issue, I feel guilt for leaving a great position now. My current department is understaffed but we barely manage. I'm going to blindside my manager and leave him in a tough spot.

I was afraid of failing and being stuck with a biology degree and looking at mice poop under the microscope all day instead of being in medical school.
Anyways I'm currently taking a career exploration class and one assignment is to ask anyone that is currently living the life of one of these engineers about just life.

If you wouldn't mind answering... maybe some proof would be awesome :) Ha, it doesn't really matter. I just hope the teacher would believe us. Anyways, here we go!

Why did you decide on you career?

What was the most challenging part of getting to where you are?

What do you enjoy doing in your work?

Is the future bright for this career? Job security?

What do you dislike about this job?

What is a usual day like?

Would internships help me?

What kind of grades should I expect to achieve?

Is the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (I live in Nebraska) be a good choice? (Guess you don't really have to bother with this one)

Personal qualities needed for this work type?

Who should I network with?

How much math was involved?

How important is it to know the ""right"" people?

Do you live a comfortable life with a family?

What are your free time like and your hobbies? Cars? Motorcycles? :P

Currently I'm majoring in MSE and minoring in civil engineering, physics, and applied mathematics (the latter 2 are only one additional class each).

20,System Identification (Flexible Pendulum - Cart system)... trying to figure out what I did wrong,1364392824,"Yes, this problem was for homework. The work itself has already been turned in.... But, I want to make sure that I really understand it. And, well, it I don't. Not quite. I seem to be able to handle the later bits alright (the partial derivatives... after some reminding/ prodding and can get the Lagrangian) but am having trouble with actually coming up with the ""right"" system.
The statement is like this (and is redrawn on the first linked page):
*Consider the mechanical system in Figure 3, a “cart-pendulum” system. The cart has a moving mass M, and is connected to a linear motor via a flexible coupling with damping B. An inverted pendulum of length l, negligible inertia, stiffness K and mass m is attached to the cart via a rotary actuator. If the pendulum damping coefficient is b, the linear actuator force is F and the rotary actuator torque is 't':*

I've attached links to the work that I've done so far... for this problem I'm assuming the pendulum itself has no mass, that it rotates about its center in a counter-clockwise position, and that it will vibrate a little. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/S9QSb#0) is the first page where I derive the Kinematic equations. You can see that I take the length of the pendulum in to account in the Kinematic equation. *But* I don't consider it ""vibrating"" at this time... should I be? [
Here](http://imgur.com/a/S9QSb#1) is the page where I do the Potential Energy identification. At the bottom of this page is where I *thought* I should turn that 'l' in to an 'l dot' ... using Newton's notation. But, thinking on that, it doesn't feel quite right (and probably isn't). For completeness, [here](http://imgur.com/a/S9QSb#2) is the page where I form the rest of the Lagrangian (using the wrong equations) and define the state equations.
I know that the state equation isn't *quite* right because, even though the Mass matrix (the one multiplied by x_dot, theta_dot and l_dot) is symmetric, there's terms that shouldn't be there... l_dot*theta_dot...  
I'd appreciate any help you could offer.

However, this was the first time I had a phone interview and I was super nervous. I wasn't able to say half of what I wanted to say above.

I've chose a ratio of gears to be 1.5(this is a theoretical project). So in a 5th gear i have total of 5,155 ratio. A car has torque of 350Nm at full power in a fifth gear(i've calculated that) and has a rear wheel drive. My question would be - that means that a torque at that moment to the rear portal axles would be 350*5.155 = 1804,25/2 = 902.12 Nm? Each wheel gets half? But what happens if one wheel looses traction - how much of torque can then get each wheel? I mean in LSD differential its impossible that one wheel would get full 1800 Nm? Am i right? Because the thing is - i am calculating forces that affects the gears, but if i'm calculating them for full 1800 Nm, my portal axles gets waay to big(the center distance of gears then is about 20cm alone, and thats way to much to lift a car).",AskEngineers,Icanbutiwont,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1b2ccm/question_regarding_lsd_differential_and_torque/

I'm just wondering could anyone tell me more about resin tooling for vacuum forming. I'm ordering one now but I'm not sure how close to the final design I need to be. I know they can be altered, is this only to remove material? Or can some be built on? Is this much more awkward?


Also what are the pros and cons of using resin tooling for a build up to 400/500 parts. I know that it takes longer to cool and thus moulding takes longer. Im also aware it degrades due to the inability to heat sink the high temperature away from the surface. This is for a packaging application... it will be using some clip features but these shouldnt have very high tolerance issue.

I've got a setup which essentially amounts to an over-sized air canon. We've got a clear PVC tube about 3m long and maybe 30cm in diameter. We build up air pressure in a tank behind the tube with the two separated by a membrane. When the pressure reaches 20psi we pop the membrane. 

We suspect the pressure wave is supersonic, but we don't know for sure. Right now we are looking at installing two or more pressure transducers along the tube and measuring the time between their activation. Obviously they need to be pretty fast. 

Before we go any farther though I thought I'd ask the experts: How would you guys go about doing this, is there a simpler way to prove the wave is supersonic? If our way looks like the best, what types of transducers would you look into purchasing? And on the measuring side, what brand or type of hardware and software should we look at?

I came into my university last fall dead set on getting a BS in Biomedical Engineering and using that as a platform for medical school. However, it's now the end of my freshman year and I don't know if I want to continue with this game plan. I've changed so much since entering college and I don't want to spend my career stuck in a lab doing research in a field I'm not 100% enamored with. I hate that BME is so restricted in the jobs that it can get out of college and that it usually requires a Masters or PhD. Above of all I hate that I might be limiting my professional opportunities by continuing in this field.

The things is, I love philosophy, english, and psychology. I love neuroscience, I love thinking about how other people think, what motivates people, the biology and chemistry behind our brain, how our brain develops and how that affects the decisions we make, how different media (advertising, tv shows, movies, photography, art, literature, etc.) affects our brain and our personality. I'd love to do research on diseases like Alzheimer's, or anything to do with neurotransmitters and hormones (dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, cortisol, etc.), and even genetics. I'm also intensely interested in replicating the brain, in both hardware and software, and the computer science involved in replicating neurons and the like. I'm also very interested in working with Doctors Without Borders, I LOVE to travel and I love helping people. In that regard medical school is definitely still a possibility, and although I very much want to keep an open mind I'd like to do something with either anesthesiology or (obviously) neurology.

My university offers a ton of courses/majors/minors that have to do with this sort of stuff, there's physiology and neurobiology, neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, etc. The point I'm trying to make is that I'd much rather be doing research in those fields and pursue a masters or PhD doing something that I love, and I'm afraid that by continuing my undergrad in BME I'm not going to have that opportunity. I also want a well-paying job out of college in the case that I don't decide to pursue pre-med.

What should I do? I believe I am more than capable of completing my undergrad in BME, but I don't want it to limit the possible jobs I can get in the future, and more importantly I don't want to be stuck doing something that I'm not totally interested in. I feel like I could minor in something neuroscience related and keep the engineering major, but that would create an extremely difficult course load that might become overwhelming.

I know brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, so I assume brass is made by heating them both up together, until they melt, stir it abit, then let it cool? -Sorry for the vague assumptions but thats what i've gathered from wikipedia.

So if you are heating up copper (in a furnace or whatever) to 1000C to melt it properly, then you add some zinc, won't the zinc just boil into (toxic?) fumes instead of melt and mix to make brass?

But now I find myself in a situation where I need a bit of finesse.  Finesse has never been my thing.

What I've got:  A (roughly) 100,000 pound object sitting on some rollers.  I need to rotate the rollers so that I can rotate the object.  HOWEVER, I'd like to use the smallest motor I can get away with.  Speed isn't that important.  If it takes 10 minutes to rotate 180 degrees, so be it.  

But there's some minimum amount of torque required to turn the rollers.  That torque is going to be driven by rolling friction... I've looked at the manufacturer's specs of the bearings I've selected and they make no mention of rolling friction of the bearings.

Anyone got a swag for such applications?

We are doing out final project for an Innovation class, and for that we have developed a product - a shoe that generates kinetic energy from a form of generator in the sole.

The focus of the project is on the business side of the product, but in order to convince our censor and teacher, we need to have some kind of proof that the product will provide sufficient electricity.

We are looking at being able to generate power enough throughout a day of walking to charge a simple cellphone, power a small LED-light etc.

The product is to be used in developing countries, and as such the amount of walking be substantially more than in a developed country. The energy would be stored in two independent batteries - one in each shoe.

If we assume 15000 steps a day and a weight of 75kg - how much energy could one estimate could be stored at the end of a day?
And would one be able to have an output in the same range as that of a USB 2.0 port?

Length of contact is roughly equal the diameter of the cylinder.  I ran an FEA on this situation and got a von Mises stress.  I used equations found in Roark to do hand calculations of the same situation.  Roarks equations yielded a max compressive stress that is much greater than the FEA (about 10 times greater).  I looked, and it turns out that the Roark equations only seem to work for cases when L&gt;&gt;D.  

So I have two questions:

1)  Where can I find good equation(s) for contact stress when L is not much greater than D?
2)  How can I compare the max compressive stress calculated to the von Mises stress given in the FEA?  Another way of asking this is how do I come up with principle stresses, given the max compressive stress, and use those to compute von Mises stress for comparison with FEA?

87,"How do I calculate the size of these nylon support pads, so that the weight of the supported object does not crush them? (maximum pressure I assume?)",1363916158,"I'm not an engineer, I've studied physics, so I understand the theory but I get bogged down in practical details. :)

It's a part of a scientific instrument. Big flat round disk made of ceramic material, laying down on its back, horizontal, on 3 round support points, equidistant (not quite at the edge of the disk, but about 30% of the way inwards). Each support takes an equal 1/3 share of the load.

The diameter of the disk can be anything between the wheels on a small car and the wheels on an 18-wheeler truck. Thickness about 1 hand width. The total weight between 1 and 10 buckets full of water.

The support points must be as small as possible. They are made of metal. To protect the ceramics, they are padded with a few mm of nylon.

Now, I assume if I make the support pads too small, the weight of the ceramic slab will crush them due to sheer pressure. So I need to determine a minimum safe diameter for them (so that they last a decade or so), based on the mechanical properties of nylon and the weight of the ceramic slab.

How do I calculate that? I'm not asking for someone to make the calculations for me, just tell me how it's done and I'll do the math. I assume I need to correlate pressure with some mechanical properties of nylon, and add some empirical safety factor.

The ceramic slab will never crack under its own weight, it's extremely thick.

A few extra details:

In addition to constant long term pressure due to gravity, in some rare instances there will be brief transient shocks when the instrument is transported to a different facility: roll it down the hall in a dolly, load it in a truck by means of two muscular guys, drive, repeat in reverse at destination.

I've just started a job doing NDT inspection.  The job is alright, but I can already tell I am not passionate about it.  So I was wondering, if I can enumerate what I am passionate about maybe with your help we can figure out where my career should head.  These are the things that I enjoy doing or thinking about in my spare time:

-Space Travel.  I am a huge fan of the Apollo program and NASA.  Kerbal Space Program has been my favorite computer game lately, and it always gets me thinking about modern rocket design.  I really enjoyed the tv series From the Earth to the Moon, and I'm currently reading Moon Lander: How We Developed the Apollo Lunar Module by Thomas Kelly.

-Simulation and game programming.  I'm trying to teach myself c++ so I can build a game.  I want something like Minecraft crossed with Runescape crossed with Spore crossed with COMSOL.  If I can't build rockets in real life I want to build them in a virtual reality.

-Science fiction.  I'm a big fan of Michael Crichton, especially theorizing technology that is ""almost there.""  If X existed, what could we do with it.  Especially wormholes (real ones, not the fax-style teleporters).  I also enjoy Asimov and Arthur Clarke.

I've got some ideas of projects that I would love to work on.  I'd like to dump 100s of robots on the moon to begin building mag-lev landing strips, solar power arrays, and underground habitats.  I'd like to mine precious metals from the sea floor.  I'd like to come up with a black-box greenhouse that takes in solar energy and water and co2 and spits out biodiesel.  I'd like to figure out a unidirectional gravitational wave generator for propulsion without reaction mass.  

Most of all I want to find a job where I'm happy.  I want to look forward to showing up at work.  

So, as a chemical engineer interested in space, what are some fields I should look into?  What do you think is about to get real big?  Is there such thing as a job that is enjoyable, or I am thinking about this the wrong way?  Were you in my shoes, what would you be doing right now?

I'm trying to characterize air, using a pressure transducer and hygrometer to find air density.

My plan was to put property tables/the psychrometric chart into excel, then use sensor outputs and labview to locate the density value in excel (using ActiveX), but I'm hitting a wall.  It would be tons easier to just have an equation rho(RH, P), which I could simply input in labview.

10,Inlet diameter of heat exchanger,1363801222,"I'm trying to calculate the inlet diameter of a heat exchanger but I'm having trouble with the derivation.

The heat exchanger is basically two pipes, one inside the other, where the compartment between the pipes is for the hot fluid and the inner pipe is for the cold one.

Hot fluid is pumped into the outer compartment and I need to know the required inlet diameter for fluid velocity v.

**[Here is a picture of the system](http://i.imgur.com/6mH2tUo.png)**

The heat transfer rate in and out of the system needs to be at equilibrium

    dQin - dQout = 0

The heat transfer rate out of the system causes a temperature change ΔT

    ΔT = dQout*t/(c*mc)

where mc is the mass of fluid in the system

    mc = rho*L*(ro^2 - ri^2)*pi

The heat transfer rate into the system has to compensate for the temperature change ΔT so

    dQin = c*dm*ΔT

where dm is the mass flow rate into (and out of) the system

    dm = rho*v*d^2*pi/4

Combining these equations and solving for the inlet diameter d results in

    d = sqrt(4*L/(v*t)*(ro^2 - ri^2))

Now I would like to somehow get 't' it out of the equation. However I do not know how. This has been bugging me for days and I know that there must be a very simple solution.

Edit:

* dQin - Heat transfer rate into system

* dQout - Heat transfer rate out of system

* rho - Fluid density

* c - Fluid specific heat

* mc - Mass of fluid in system

* L - Length of both pipes

* ro - Inside radius of outer pipe

* ri - Outside radius of inner pipe

* v - Fluid velocity into system

* d - Diameter of circular opening into system

* t - Time

'd' is the diameter of a hole on the side of the outer pipe (not the diameter of the pipe itself).

I'd like to thank everyone in that thread for helping me think this project through and finally reach an objective plan of action.

I thought I would update you guys on the progress I've got going. I ended up using 4 of the same 25RPM motor, and wired them with 4 different voltages of power supplies: 5V, 9V, 12V and 14V to get the different speeds. Then I used some squishy rubber skateboard wheels as friction wheels against PVC rollers I made. In the future I'd like to fabricate the rollers out of something better, but since I was on a deadline I had to try and figure out as much ready-made stuff as I could. The rollers are 3"" PVC couplings over a 3"" PVC pipe. 

Here are a couple of videos of the progress. The first one is the motor test, and the second is the first run of the whole thing with the belts on. Rollers #3 and #4 kept binding up on eachother, so I need to figure out an elegant solution to that problem.

32,Detonation resistance of gasoline vs. jet fuel - some confusion about pressures encountered in both types of engines.,1363706369,"I am a licensed A&amp;P mechanic, but haven't worked in the field for almost 20 years. But I recall some of the things I was taught in airplane fixin' school regarding fuels, their types and suitability in different applications.

Please correct me if I have any misconceptions or am flat-out wrong about any of this.

One of the things deeply emphasized for reciprocating engines (gasoline fueled) was detonation and preignition. We were taught that preignition is a deflagration that comes from some anomalous heat source in the combustion chamber glowing red hot (feathered valve edge, a spark plug electrode worn down to a point) and setting off the charge early.

Detonation, on the other hand, is the charge actually detonating, well ahead of the optimal point in the combustion cycle due to a given fuel charge's inability to withstand the compression that occurs just before ignition. We were taught that detonation is **extremely** destructive in aircraft engines for obvious reasons (pilot will not be able to hear it, engines are built to be more lightweight and not as tolerant of the strain, etc.).

We were taught that octane in gasoline is really nothing more than its resistance to detonation, and that some fatal accidents have happened because of mis-fueling piston engined aircraft with jet fuel (which we were taught has almost no detonation resistance) instead of gasoline. The mis-fueling scenario: the engine will run until the pilot applies takeoff power, but about the time he lifts off, the engine is in full detonation on all cylinders and very shortly he has holes in all his pistons.

Recently I was looking up, as a refresher, the peak pressure encountered in each type of engine. Gasoline piston engines apparently achieve 135 PSIG during a compression test, so I suppose this is roughly what the fuel/air charge will encounter upon entering the cylinder of a running engine, not accounting for the heat already present when the engine is hot.

However, and this surprised me, the pressure at the diffuser of a typical aircraft turbine engine will be between 200 and 250 PSIG. So this means that at the point where the jet fuel is sprayed from the nozzles into the combustor, the pressure encountered is almost double that of a piston engine. I knew the diffuser is where the highest pressures are present in a turbine engine, but I did not recall the actual pressure values were that high.

So, my question is, why does the jet fuel behave as it's supposed to in a turbine engine, and not ignite in an chaotic or uncontrolled manner as soon as it exits the nozzle due to the pressures present? I think that the flame front of a running gas turbine is a couple of inches away from the fuel nozzle outlets, why doesn't it ignite within a millimeter of exiting the nozzle? Maybe the massive flow velocities present in the combustor (over 2000 ft/sec) constrain things and make it impossible for the flame front to contact the nozzle?

41,Calculating the proper temperature to condense methanol after production (CHE). ,1363643215,"(NOT GRADED, PRACTICE). This is an xpost from engstudents. Most of the people over there are other students who can help give me an answer but not a good explanation. I have scoured online and my book / notes but have no basis for comparison. I just want to learn how to do this.

Essentially you have a feed to a catalytic reactor of CO and H2 to produce methanol. The reactor effluent is sent to a condenser where 80% of the methanol (effluent) is condensed to a liquid product stream. CO and H2 are treated as incompressible and leave through a gas exhaust of the condenser with the remaining 20% methanol (which didn't condense).

I have solved the whole system balance wise so I have any flow rate / molar comp data needed but I don't know how I can find the temp necessary for the condenser to condense 80% of the methanol. 

I can include pics of calculations / filled schematic / values if needed but was hoping for a general explanation / approach rather than an actual answer (I want to learn not just submit answers). This is for a practice problem for my exam on Thursday and I've been stuck on it. We never did any problems like this one in class or in the book. 

It states that the condenser is running at constant pressure, what is the temp necessary?

A quick digression for those unfamiliar with brewing: for about 3 weeks while the beer is fermenting, yeast is consuming the sugars in the wort (the pre-beer liquid) and producing alcohol and CO2.

[BrewPi](http://brewpi.com/) allows you to measure the temperature (inside and out), but I think it would be interesting measure how much CO2 is being exhausted. This is can be proxied by the rate of the bubbling in the airlock, which is solved by [this guy](http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/131).

81,Improving long-term electrical contact reliability,1363305868,"I know that there are relays made to be used in oil tubs. The oil prevents arcing and lubricates the switch of the relays.

I'm looking for ways to improve the reliability of electromechanical timers (like the ones found on older washing machines), relays and dc motors with copper brushes (not carbon). My question is whether it would be safe to use mineral grease to this end. The idea would be to inject grease into the relay or timer through holes in its case or to smear the copper brushes and coil contacts of a dc motor with it. I'm not sure if mineral grease is going to degrade the plastic cases, the varnish on the coils, or the electrical contacts themselves.

I've already googled and although I didn't get a clear answer, I read that [silicone greases are not good for this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone_grease#As_a_sealant_around_electrical_contacts).

Is this a viable career choice?",1363216337,"I graduated last May with a 70% average from a good school, and since then I've been working full-time for a CE consulting firm. The pay is decent, but it's a lot of work and it's reallllly reaaallllly dry and boring- our primary business is to do with waterproofing parking garages. to keep it succinct, it's basically like painting the garage floor alongwith some concrete work. Basically, I think I want out from Engineering for a bit and explore other areas in which to apply my skills. 

Anyway, as i said, long hours spent on site dealing with surly contractors, endless technical reports and spending hours upon hours in parking garages has really left me disillusioned. On the other hand, I will recognize that I have learned a whole lot of soft skills - dealing with clients, managing deadlines, project management etc. that I believe are highly transferable and valued in other consulting businesses. 

So, to the meat and potatoes - Do I have any sort of chance to change careers or will I be completely disregarded by the folks at one of the big (or small, i'm open minded) firms? I do have some case competition experience from university and am a fast learner, but besides that I haven't really had time for a lot of extra curriculars. From my research, it seems like a lot of consulting firms require some sort of programming knowledge, of which my fellow CE's will back me up, when I say I have none.

In the UK I could go to a company to do it for me but I'll be charged a fortune, but they really aren't complicated to build.  The only thing stopping me is I can't seem to find anywhere to buy the cassettes no matter where I look.

2,How do I get out of a technical writing rut?,1363165206,"So, I originally decided to do an engineering (mechatronics) degree because I was pretty good at and enjoyed maths and physics at high school. And I think technology is pretty awesome and want to contribute towards its development. My careers advisor told me that I should apply for 'early entry' at the local university and being a woman with reasonable marks I got it and it all went from there.
My first year was a bit of a fuck up. I almost failed the 'Introduction to engineering' course and surprisingly it wasn't actually because of partying but more because I just didn't really know how to get into the swing of things at uni.
Every year after that since I missed the fundamentals a bit in first year I struggled and as a coping mechanism, isn't of studying harder, I started partying. But I figured 'Ps equal degrees' and ended up with a low credit average anyway because of the incidental Distinctions that I got.
Because of my low marks I struggled to get any work experience til after my last year when my cousin changed jobs and needed a graduate to write the standard operating procedures for the saw mill he was working at.
I worked there about for about a year writing procedures, doing risk assessments, helping to implement Lean manufacturing things and trying to help the maintenance team move more into productive maintenance rather than totally reactive maintenance. I graduated in July last year after getting the work experience I needed to graduate.
They eventually had budget cuts which resulted in my no longer having a job. I applied for about 5 jobs a week for about four months and had 5 phone interviews in that time. 

My brother-in-law suggested me for a technical writers position at the software company he worked at where I am now working writing help manuals for new software products.

I enjoy writing but find it to be mind numbing in the procedure writing context. Even though I did struggle through uni I did enjoy doing analytical work and also working on design projects and I miss challenging my brain to that level.

I feel like I'm pigeon holing myself into technical writing which I don't want to do but I don't know exactly what it is that I want to do since I don't have much experience in engineering environments.

What can I do to help myself get out of this technical writing rut and stop being pigeon holed into technical writer? I keep applying for engineering graduate programs but even if I do get an interview I find it difficult to express myself favourably in terms of having passion and being committed to the cause.

**Tl;dr** fucked up a bit at uni, currently working as a technical writer and have limited experience with anything else engineering related, want to know how to get out of technical writing and into engineering. Oh, and I'm female if that helps my cause.

We have a triangular frame made up of circular sections, at the moment looking to be some form of extruded plastic tubing, PTFE, HDPE, PMMA etc., which is filled by cavity paneling, two polycarbonate sheets with an air cavity, that would be framed most likely with a simple aluminium frame. The difficulty comes in connecting these two components.

Our first idea was to use a system similar to patent glazing mounted along the top of the tubing but this may cause structural issues, would it work compositely? Would wind load still be transferred directly from the panel to the structural framework or would it be applied as additional dead load along the tubing and hence require a larger diameter section to reduce buckling?

Another idea was to have the tubing accommodate the framing itself, i.e. have a section cut out along the edge and rubber gasket fitted along the edge of the cutaway or the framing to allow connection.

This semester I had a mental health break and I left school midsemester to get myself back together. Now I'm so worried about what I should do, if I should go back to school there, if I should even continue with engineering. I just don't know.

I'm at a point where I don't know if I should get up, dust myself off and just fucking *finish* this thing. Maybe go to a different school and try my luck there? Or if I should accept defeat and try to pursue another major...

I haven't had any passion for what I do. It just kind of feels good to say ""Yeah, I fucking did it!"". All of my teachers at my school, save for a couple, were all researchers and not actual *teachers*. The class material is hard enough without suffering through a thrown together class curriculum and bad lectures.

I've been watching lectures at 2X speed on vlc lately and sometimes, seemingly mostly when the professor is talking and moving a lot, there's a pulse of static along with the audio. It's somewhat like a playing card on bike spokes, and it starts and stops intermittently. The odd thing is, I can (via the magnets) feel the field from the power supply changing from a fairly consistent buzz to a much more pronounced on-off type of buzz, with the same frequency as the static ""spots"" in the audio. When I unplug the supply from the laptop, the audio spots remain, while the charger obviously peters out. When I plug it back in, the charger syncs back to the frequency of the audio spots until they stop.

For a lab building in-house, one-off electronics, wire wrap has great advantages: we've got the tools to do it ourselves and repairs/component replacements are easy. PCBs are much cheaper and quicker to produce on a large scale, but I'm talking about producing single devices and their prototypes.

The perception of wire wrap in my environment seems to be that it’s just a wire wrapped around a post: that the electrical contact of two metals touching cannot be trusted; that the wire will simply go loose over time; that the freely moving wires and thin insulation introduce a greater risk of arcing.

Are these valid criticisms?

As a show that I’ve done my due diligence in searching for the answers to my own questions, the following are the resources I’ve found so far:

[The only clear comparison I've found](http://www3.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol43-1964/articles/bstj43-3-1067.pdf) concluded that wire wrapped and soldered connections are not significantly different in terms of passing fatigue tests. This is promising, but it's from 1964.

NASA has used wire wrap connections, and has [requirements of its workmanship]( http://workmanship.nasa.gov/lib/insp/2%20books/links/sections/301_Discrete%20Wiring.html), which is also promising. It’d seal the deal in terms of mechanical reliability if wire wrap were space-travel-worthy, but can anybody confirm that it’s used in space or just at NASA’s ground facilities?

In terms of electrical reliability, Martin Tarr of the Univ. of Bolton [describes wire wrapping]( http://www.ami.ac.uk/courses/topics/0117_wiwr/index.html) as a matter of the square post biting into the wire and thus bypassing any oxidation layer that might be present. This indicates a much more reliable connection than a wire simply touching a metal post. Tarr [references a book]( http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Assembly-Soft-Soldering-Wrapping/dp/0132487667) on wire wrap, but it is out of print and not available in any libraries I have access to.

One side thinks the train would go through the hull 'like a bullet' while the other thinks the train would be annihilated. Niether side has backed up their argument with calculations. I'm currently taking a mechanics of materials course, but I'm not sure where to start.

Here are the assumptions I have to work with:

Each vehicle is out of their element, as though meeting as free bodies. Only the internal mechanics are considered (e. g. The water does not absorb any impact energy) 

The train is 10 cars long. Cargo is unspecified. 

They are moving towards each other at 50 mph. (Could use the top speeds of each to be more accurate.) 

It's probably a diesel train. 

Cruise ship is of the Carnival line. 

I'm thinking I could look up the hull thickness, material properties, and average (or max) spacing between cross sectional supports and then treat it as a large place with supports. Some of these properties I found [here](http://www.beta-cae.gr/pdf/ship_collision_simulation.pdf).

* Are you enjoying your job after X years?
* Does your job get you engaged? or is it just like a boring 9-5 job?
* What consists of a normal Electrical Engineer working day?

10,Friction Pad? for mainly static friction,1362508935,"I'm helping a local school build a rotating stage for their theater. When the stage is not being actively rotated, I'd like it to be very firm under foot for the actors. I think this will mean using a brake that is normally engaged.

My current plan is to use a rocker arm with a friction-pad pushing against the steel outer rim of the stage (below the deck). The other end of the rocker arm will have a spring, and a solenoid strong enough to overcome the spring (for remote operation). I'll probably incorporate a manual override as well, but my question is regarding the ""friction pad"": 

**What material should I use?** I'm mostly interested in static friction, as the break is not intended to slow the stage (though I'm sure someone will use it that way at some point). I'd like to use a material/product that they can order/replace themselves without my input. Is there another machine/mechanism I can borrow an idea from? 

I've thought of using automotive brake pads, but the best CoF I can find is 0.5, and they're primarily designed for heat and wear--not my main concerns.",AskEngineers,jesseaknight,/r/AskEngineers/comments/19pyx7/friction_pad_for_mainly_static_friction/

Some might get wrapped up in a day or two and some take many months.  Hell, some last a couple hours.

I have struggled with finding an organization system to keep track of these projects, where they're at, what I'm waiting on, what I need to do next, time spent working on them, etc. I tend to alternate between keeping large lists on my green pad of what I'm working on but then fail to get it updated or more annoyingly find that I have to keep rewriting it to keep it updated.

If I could find something to integrate with Outlook (shudder I know but forced by IT to keep it) that would be amazing.  I could go the MS Project route but it's honestly overkill...I don't need a Gantt chart to constantly update.  

Being able to create a project in Outlook somehow and then create nested task lists would be awesome.

Am I missing something obvious and easy?  What works well that won't make me a slave to the organizational method?

Problem is I don't know enough about steel or where to look right now to get the values to do the math (not 100% sure I can do the math necessary either), so I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction and make sure I get the math right.

So here's the rough plan.

[DropBox gallery with 3 images and the first rough SketchUp model](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3h05set1y6uvr0a/OtIrnkcban)

The cupboard space is roughly 7' deep and 40"" wide and in my kitchen/dinning room.  In the current model the shelf extends just over 60"" and has about 18"" of overlap when fully extended.  Will have a door that closes on the opening.  Want adjustable shelving for the first 16"" that you don't have to pull the shelf out for at all.  Then I'll setup some more shelving behind that shelf that you'll get access to from the side as you pull the shelf out.  Shelf at the front will be used to store pantry type items.  Behind it will be small appliances and more pantry type items.  The front bearing of the slides will be directly over a 2x4 framed wall that is dry walled on both sides.

So I'm after what type and thickness of steel I'd need to use to give a comfortable safety margin.  Lets say 400lbs on the front shelving unit and 800lbs more spread out behind it (this should be higher than it will ever actually see).  Also contemplating making each slide use two channels and have a pair of angle iron pieces welded into a T if necessary to get sufficient strength.

42,Looking for people with experience in/knowledge of the solar industry,1362343724,"Hi all, as the title says, I am looking for someone with some experience in the solar industry. I am writing a software program for school that pinpoints the sun's position and using that data calculated the energy incident on a flat-plate solar collector at any given azimuth and tilt. So far the project is going really well!

  I must write up a report on this software program that follows the ""system design life cycle,"" so analysis, planning, coding, and documenting. For the analysis portion I must focus on the end-user's perspective. I have a few simple questions that I'd be ever so grateful to have answered by as many of you as possible, regardless of expertise in the solar industry. Below are the questions/requests. 

1. What is your experience in this area?
2. Have you ever used software or spreadsheets to calculate the sun's position in the sky?
3. If so, what inputs (latitude, longitude, *others*) were required and what outputs were calculated (elevation, azimuth, *others*)?
4. If you are familiar with the algorithms/general processes used in calculation of the sun's position, could you briefly describe them?
5. Have you ever used software or spreadsheets to calculate the solar energy on a flat-plate collector/any flat object?
6. If so, what inputs (solar position data, panel azimuth, panel tilt, *others*) were required and what outputs (direct normal radiation, global radiation, *others*) were calculated?
7. If you are familiar with the algorithms/general processes used in calculation of solar radiation, could you briefly describe them?
8. List several features that a spreadsheet/software program must have in order to be considered 'useful.' (i.e. must find air mass, etc.)
9. Are there any improvements you always wished to see in the software or spreadsheets you used?
10. **Finally**, if it is possible, could you provide a picture or screenshot of the interface of the software or spreadsheets you use?

**tl;dr: leave a comment if you have experience with solar science and I'll contact you.**

  Thank you!

46,Why not build a hydroelectric plant in Panama?,1362295895,"Similar to the Panama Canal, except use the difference in the ocean's heights (about 8 inches, or .2 m, not including tidal differences according to random Google sites?) to generate hydroelectric power? 

Assuming one could make the flow arbitrarily large without flow subsiding, the calculation for hydropower would be (head)x(flow)x(gravity)x(efficiency)=(Power). Assuming about 60% efficiency, and a cost comparable to the Panama Canal (14.7 Billion USD in 2007 dollars), is it theoretically possible to generate enough power quickly enough to get any sort of reasonable payback period? (Not counting how you will move the power to the people it's supplied to?) 

I understand one would have to dig a much deeper canal than the Panama canal, since the locks are for raising/lowering over the landmass, not for the difference in oceanic elevation; feel free to adjust the cost to compensate.

Edit1: Added some spacing to avoid wall'o'text.

Edit2: Did some quick calcs with the info I gave myself...assuming the trench was far enough down to provide each ocean enough flow in and out at a central point (basically you ignore the width of Panama and assume your trench provides adequate flow...I'm sure questionable at best) so creating a hydroelectric dam with undefined flow rate and .2m of head - to generate 1 W of electricity, we get: (1W)/(.2m)(9.8 m/s^2 )(.6)=0.85 L/s of flow to generate 1 W of power.

So to generate 1 MW, we need 850,000 L/s of water.  To get close to a single coal plant's generation (500 MW), we need 425,000,000 Liters per Second of flow.  For reference, all of the oceans on earth contain 1.34 × 10^21 Liters of water.  But we only get to use the top 0.2 meters of the Pacific.  

So the Pacific Ocean has an area of 1.652 x 10^14 meters.  That multiplied by 0.2 meters = 3.304 x 10^16 Liters (converted).  That divided by our L/s calculation gives us 899 days of flow before we RUN OUT OF WATER (not to mention our head is dropping in that time).

2.465 years is not enough time to recoup at *least* 14.7 Billion dollars from the monetary generation of a single coal plant.  Case closed.  :)",AskEngineers,timmywitt,/r/AskEngineers/comments/19kg8j/why_not_build_a_hydroelectric_plant_in_panama/

I am pretty new to the field and have some questions, first off, how precisely can I measure with a Strain Gauge? I've been digging through tons of sites and all I found was that it depends on what kind of bonding process I use and so on, but no actual numbers.

I understand they work in the area of microstrains, Semiconductor Gauges around 3000microstrain, but at what range does it stop being sensible? 10microstrain? 1microstrain? 0.1? 0.01? Assuming I do a really good job with bonding, and if I do just an acceptable job? I will use a full bridge setup most likely.

I have been looking around and I did find some scales that can measure to a precision of 1mg and up to 1kg. Anyone can tell me how they work? Since if I make a loadcell the strain is pretty much always linear proportional to force, meaning 1mg gives me a 10e-6 smaller strain than 1kg. And from what I found, sc gauges start to fail if you go above 3000microstrains, and the way it seems they are only sensible in the area of a few microstrains. So only over 3 orders of magnitude, not 6.

While I am at it, how do you call the range of magnitude of precision in measurement? Since that thing there can go from 1e-6 to 1e1, is there like a unit or definition that is then called 6 Whatevers?

Also, what are some other limits on the precision i have to consider? Like the voltage source, thermal fluctuations, etc...

I don't see how the strain can reduce at increased loads, how the sample seems to zig back and forth. 

Was the company's extensometer out of whack? Or is it possible that the filaments started cracking and snapping back during the test, causing the meter to read sample shrinkage? Could voids above/below the meter give first, allowing the surface to retract toward the center of the sample?

How about tapered rubber only that can be quickly placed into each hole without the need of assembling the small bung and then clamping right around the diameter to ""squash"" the large rubber ends to seal the holes on the outer diameter?

93,How can I most quickly heat a 150 gallon tank of water to 90F starting from 45F?  Only single phase 120V power is available.,1362020734,"Be forewarned: I work for a theatre company, so there is no rational reason for any of this, other than artmaking.  The constraints are due to the performance space.  

I have a 150 gallon water tank approximately 2'x2'x6' that wants to be at 90 degrees Fahrenheit when we start a performance (it needs to be warm for the actor that gets in it).  We have to change the water often and when we do so, we are usually filling it with cold water and then heating the water in the tank.  We usually have to start this process the day before the show because the tank takes so long to heat up.  In my dream world, we could fill the tank and heat the water in under two hours.  Then we could do the set up on show day with existing crew rather than paying someone to do everything early.

**Constraints:** The venue only has 120 V single phase power available.  The building hot water supply is unreliable (and not controlled by us) so is either already out or only supplies up to 50 gallons max.  The tap water that we use to fill the tank can be as cold as 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  And we don't own the venue, so changes to infrastructure are out.

**Current Procedure:**  Currently we use a [1500 watt T-shaped immersion heater](http://www.mcmaster.com/#immersion-heaters/=lo1ukh).  Whenever we refill the tank, we drop the heater over the side, put the thermostat at 100 and then go out for beer and come back the next day.  In the summer, when the tap water is relatively warm, I've seen the tank reach 90degF in as little as 5 hours (with the thermostat cranked all the way to 250degF).

I've been researching all sorts of different heaters (immersion, in-line, tankless), but my brain has pretty much melted looking at all the options.  Am I relegated to just buying more of the same heater and using them all at once, or is there a more elegant solution out there?

My design is based upon a tidal lagoon concept from a company called tidal electric. I am currently struggling with the design and would like your help!.

All I have so far is a theoretical power output and design dimensions to go with. The turbine used is to function with bi-directional flow and I have assumed the efficiency to be around 80%, 8 bulb turbines are to be used to provide power.

The equations i used to calculate the power was: 
P=efficiency*specific weight of water*flow rate*net water height, 

from here the unit output could be calculated by:
 UP=P/(diammeter of the turbine^2*net water height*3/2)

38,Making a faraday cage; need help with mesh size.,1361828707,"Hi

I am making a faraday cage for an [electronic ballast I bought recently](http://www.ipowergrowlight.com/1411/digital-electronic-ballasts/ipower-grow-lights-dimmable-electronic-hid-ballast-600w.html), which interferes on AM signals (and probably more). 

I was wondering what kind of steel mesh I could use to make this, since I want the cage to be well ventilated. 

I looked around and found this:

&gt; Where f = frequency in Hz, c is light velocity, and λ represents wavelength in meters. **One rule of thumb often used for Faraday cages to prevent transmission is that the holes need to be no larger than 1/10 of the wavelength of the signal**. So for a 3G cell phone that operates at a frequency of 2.1 GHz (2.1 * 109 Hz), the wavelength = (3 * 108 m/sec) / (2.1 * 109 Hz) = .14 meters. Thus, for a Faraday cage to prevent this noise from entering, the holes in the cage should be smaller than .014 meters (or 1.4 cm).

So I looked around to find what frequency that my ballast runs at and found that in the case of these lamps it is called the *lamp operating frequency*, which for this model is (apparently) 25 ~ 100 kHz.

So if I plug those numbers [into wolfram alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=frequency+to+wavelenght&amp;a=*FS-_**PhotonWavelength.lambda-.*PhotonWavelength.nu--&amp;f2=100+kHz&amp;f=PhotonWavelength.nu_100+kHz&amp;a=*FVarOpt.1-_***PhotonWavelength.nu--.***PhotonWavelength.E--.**PhotonWavelength.k---.*--) I get the answer 2.998km/10 or 299 meters.

So I need a cage with holes smaller than 299 meters wide? What have I done wrong here :P

thanks in advance

**edit**: what if I used an old biscuit box but cut a 6cm wide hole in the box to line up with the fan exhaust on the ballast? would the box still work as a faraday cage? I presume the metal exterior of the ballast cannot touch the cage? (otherwise why wouldn't the exterioir be a FC itself?)

6.  The disks tend to warp under certain circumstances and the preffered disk material has become carbon fiber.  Would some kind of aluminum alloy be able to be used?

I'm studying the stress created in a standard 2x4 LEGO brick when connected to another standard 2x4 brick.  I know that this connection is maintained because of an interference fit and friction, but I'm wondering what kind of simple hand calculations I can do to validate the FEA model I'll eventually make.

My thoughts originally pointed me toward a comparison to some kind of pressure vessel, but now I'm thinking I can model the outer faces of the top brick as cantilever beams undergoing a deflection caused by the pegs on the lower brick, then calculating the forces and moments caused by this deflection.

Any thoughts?  Thank you!

[Edit]: Even if you don't think you know what you're talking about,  I welcome all bits of insight or ideas!

[Edit2]: To be clear, I am talking about the stresses existing in the top block simply due to the fact that the second block is being wedged in its bottom. (Not interested in making that sound less silly)

[Edit3]: So you all know, LEGO bricks are not held together by cylindrical press fits per se, as pegs to not enter holes on other bricks.  It is better described as a perimeter which ""circumscribes"" a set of 8 pegs that is slightly larger than the inner perimeter of the walls of the other block.

68,Any refrigeration engineers 'round here?,1361659885,"Hello AskEngineers!

Maybe this isn't the *best* spot to ask, but since this is the subreddit for engineer-questioneering, I figured it fit.

To preface: I got a job last summer at a US division of a large UK-based controls company. We specialize in refrigeration controls for grocery stores and the like. Plant/pack/rack control, circuit control, individualized refrigerated case controllers, lighting control, etc. If it's energy-based in a grocery store, we can do it.

I've been in training since then as technical support for this company. I do not have a formal background in refrigeration, electronics or controls. I am not an engineer, nor do I even have a degree! I was hired, I think, because I was a good personality fit with the company and had taken some networking classes in college, which was an okay start for what they needed. However, the longer I'm here, the more I realize that I want to future-proof myself. I hate it when I have to say I don't know, and my job entails that I have to admit this on a daily basis. I don't want to do that anymore.

The guy training me knows his shit. He's been in refrigeration for 30 years and in this specific controls-oriented setting for at least 5. The problem is, he's a horrible teacher. He talks to you like you know it all already, which means that for every 100 words he says, I can dissect 5 for myself. It's amazing I've learned as much as I have thus far. He also doesn't have a great deal of time to sit down and teach me, so I do a lot of self-teaching.

I'm looking for some basic books on refrigeration systems and maybe even electronics and circuitry. My job is very niche, so I have to learn a lot of different aspects from refrigeration, hardware, electronic circuitry, proper wiring, networking, AND on top of that, our specific systems and devices, AND the PLC programming that goes with it (not to mention, I also am in charge of shipping &amp; receiving right now!) I really want to become a valuable asset to this company. I want them to look at me and say, yeah, we need that guy. And in the future, I want them to look at the company and say, wow, we don't just need this guy, he should be doing X or Y, climbing the ranks! So I need some help figuring out what my absolute best options are. As of right now, it's looking like I'll be teaching myself a great deal more. I have a training session for 2 weeks in the UK this summer, but other than that, I have to learn a lot on my own...And without a knowledge of refrigeration, learning how the PLC works within the controllers is really, really hard. It's like reading a sign through a brick wall, because the gap of knowledge is impervious.

73,Looking for some advice regarding seismic retrofit for a post-pier cabin on a hill side,1361644859,"I have a ~800 sq ft cabin at some property that the family owns. When we were all down there last year replacing the deck, I noticed that the posts beneath the cabin looked to be leaning a bit towards the down slope of the hill that it sits on. They sit on concrete piers, and are tied to the joists on the cabin floor. Its a typical post pier system.  

I've been talking to the Millwright / Fabricator / Do-It-All guy at my work and he mentioned an ""old school"" method of running cables back from the leading corners of the house to a railroad tie, log, or some other anchor buried in the ground on the uphill side, to secure the home or building from moving further down hill. 

Please see http://i.imgur.com/s8OnCaQ.jpg   

I am a welder / fabricator myself, so I am wondering if there isn't another way to properly secure this cabin without the need to dig a 10 foot deep trench, or 3 of them rather, drop a couple of railroad ties in, wrap a cable etc. To go this route means taking apart the deck that we built last year, and a whole lot of manual shoveling as the cabin is pretty remote. 

Can the post / piers be x-braced with 2"" SCH 40 pipe with proper fastening plates attached to them? Heavier? Lighter? 

The cabin is not in imminent danger of falling down the hillside right now. It has been there for around 50 years I would guess, and it has moved probably 2 inches at the most. But I noticed that it **has** moved, and therefor want to fix it. Id just like to get some ideas or some ""no fucking way! don't do that!""-s.

I know some will be nervous to give advice about this kind of stuff, but you need not be, free advice is worth exactly what you pay for it, right? I'm just brainstorming here.

That makes me wonder, how vital is this requirement? I've read in an ISRM book that non-parallel ends cause the rock to fail prematurely but that it also has little effect on strength and modulus.

99,Question about finite element modeling of an adhesive in a bonded joint (Patran/Nastran),1361417278,"I am modeling a honeycomb panel that has an angle stiffener across it. The two parts are bonded together via an epoxy adhesive. Both parts are 2D and meshed with quad elements. What I have modeled right now is the panel with the stiffener being some distance L below the panel, and the meshes/nodes of both parts line up vertically. I attach each node of the panel's mesh to the stiffener's nodes in the following way: I created a rigid bush element connecting the stiffener node to a distance L/2 up that connects to a node (node A). Node A is coincident with Node B. Nodes A and B are attached with a 1D bush element with stiffnesses in  the 1,2 and 3 directions only. Node B is then attached to the panel node with a rigid bush element, which has a length L/2. I used this webpage as a guide for modeling my adhesive:

http://femci.gsfc.nasa.gov/adhesive/index.html 

When I run the model, I get an error saying the model is not properly constrained. Note: I ran the model without the stiffener and it was sufficiently constrained, so it has something to do with the adhesive modeling technique. 

Attempted solution on my part: I figured the rigid bush elements permit rotation in all directions, but the quad elements cannot take rotation about the axis that is normal to panel. So I added rotational SPCs in that particular direction for the panel and stiffener nodes that attach to the rigid elements. Unfortunately that did not work. I get the same error.

Will graduate with 1 year and 4 months of work experience in the energy and utilities fields, and 4 months worth of research experience. 3.5x/4 GPA.

I am looking for a mechanical masters program that has industry involvement whether through a co-op program or research partnerships with companies. I have preference for a research based MASc program but will consider an MEng program as well. Another option that I have considered is a masters degree in electrical engineering. I am open to any school within Canada.

My slight bit of experience in the Utilities industry has given me a bad impression about a career in the field. The work is so boring, and non-technical. I feel that there is an overt amount of paper pushing.

I would strongly prefer a career that involves more application of the concepts taught in school and with a strong focus in mechatronics. However, the opportunities for such a job appear to be low in Toronto and its surrounding area. Also, the salaries offered by more technical engineering jobs are disproportionately low compared to jobs in utilities.

The TA gives us sample code to go off of, but so much of it is unexplained that I have a difficult time interpreting what his code is saying. Here's an example:

PORTD &amp;= ~0x80;

or

PORTC |= 0x10;

Does this read as Port D is assigned the bitwise AND with 01111111? In terms of bits, what is this actually doing? Is Port D already assigned bits of 8 0's or 1's depending on if its set as an output or input?

Same for Port C. Does the statement read Port C is assigned the bitwise OR with 00010000?

Any explanation of the assignment in terms of exactly what its doing with bits would help me tremendously, thanks ahead of time.

23,"Looking for a cloth-like material suitable for my project, more in topic",1361352342,"I'm an avid gamer and spend a lot of time on the computer daily. I always hated the way your wrist feels across a cloth mousepad, so I came up with this thing I call the ""gaming sleeve."" It's basically just a low friction cloth that's sown into a sleeve that I have in my hand as I play or do whatever on the computer. 

My first version was made out of a pair of gym pants, just a proof of concept, and it worked well. It wore out tho, so I got some satin or silk like fabric from a local store and made another a few years back. It's been working fine, but I'm wondering if there was an even better fabric out there.

To give you a better idea of what it is I'm talking about, here are some links.

* Video of me using the first sleeve while playing a fast paced shooter game: **[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlqJlUqz-hA)**
* Close ups of the newer gaming sleeve: **[Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/s6Ds2.jpg) / [Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/Ee3Qx.jpg)**
* 200x magnification pictures with a microscope: **[Picture 3](http://i.imgur.com/kkgOb.jpg) / [Picture 4](http://i.imgur.com/PhdFj.jpg)**
* Another picture from a bit further away: **[Picture 5](http://i.imgur.com/t9tLdhq.jpg)**

**What would be required from the fabric:**

* Resistant to wear and tear through friction, it's going to be sliding across a mousepad constantly. Mine is a cloth pad, but there are plastic pads out there as well.
* It should not suffer from moisture, since it might get sweaty during long sessions.
* It should be sowable and not break apart easily if it's cut.
* **It should be extremely slippery**. This is the most important thing, the main point of the gaming sleeve is to reduce friction when moving your hand across the mouse pad.

I would greatly appreciate any and all insight into what sort of a fabric would do this job well. Thanks everyone.

I'm trying to buy a headphone amplifier for my headphones (Beyerdynamic DT880 600 ohm) and I am interested in the [Audiotrak Dr.DAC2 DX](http://www.audiotrack.net/products/DRDAC2DXTE/feat/).

It comes in two variants:

- the normal version ([OPA2604](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opa2604.pdf))
- the TE version (with the [MUSES8920](http://semicon.njr.co.jp/eng/PDF/MUSES8920_E.pdf))

As far as I know this is the only difference between the two versions (except the price!)

----

I'm wondering if there are any significant qualitative differences that would set these two apart.

Particularly, I noticed that the MUSE8920 has less distortion at 1kHz and also less noise per Hz^1/2 , but would I even be able to notice these? Or are the differences too negligible?

Please note, I would like to drive a 600ohm pair of heaphones, as well as some sensitive in-ear monitors (20 - 32 ohms). I have briefly calculated the required power to drive these to 120dB SPL and they are as follows:

- DT880: 96 dB/mW, 600 ohms; 251.19 mW needed
- UM Mage: 114 dB/mW, 21 ohms; 3.98 mW needed

60,piezoelectric transducers (ultrasonic foggers) how to change for the good of humanity!,1361147085,"Hello all never really done this before but I am researching into fogponics and joined because I wanted to pick the websites collective brains because I believe that if done right and if the all the kinks are worked out, fogponics could be one of the best growing methods for herbs/vegtables/fruits.

I have done extensive research mostly using http://ganjadigger.com which searches ICmag, Roll It Up, Grass City, THC Farmer, Cannabis, Cannabis Culture, Open Grow, Gardens Cure, 420 Magazine. Why these sites you ask because they are really the only ones with people trying out this type of system and pushing it forward. At best the information on the site is fragmented with arguments for and against fogponics, I want to compile all the data I can mine from them and put it into a clear and concise all-encompassing manual for growing using fogponics and give it back to the communities because I believe sharing/open sourcing is the best way to innovation.

Pros for Fogponics
-Uses less water and nutrients
-High Yield 
-Growth speed on roots is amazing, large mass and very fuzzy; growth of stems is very quick as thus high turnover rate
-Versatile in how you want to set up you grow op (i.e. vertical, buckets or just in Tupperware)  

Cons for Fogponics are:
-that the foggers heats up which can destroy the nutrients and hurt the roots
-the frequency at which foggers vibrate is great for seedlings as the water droplets is in 5-30 micron range, but as plants get older they need different nutrients which require a low frequency so the water droplets are lager and can carry the nutrients say in 40-50 microns range
-ultrasonic foggers can't handle anything lager then 500 ppm because it will clog them and kills them

For the cons, I know of a few solutions for the first problem such as timer that say stays on for 10 minutes cycles every 30 minute but these timers can be expensive; using a chiller but these are really expensive. For the second issue I have ideas how to fix it such as slowing down the frequency just slightly could make larger droplets but as I have no idea how piezoelectric transducers work I would need to talk with an engineer of some kind to bounce this idea off of, if not that idea I also thought increasing the surface area of the vibrating disks themselves might do it. As for the last issue I currently have no ideas how to solve which I am coming to you guys/girls.

Anyways if you made to the end without passing out from bordem thanks for reading and hopfully something comes from this that will benefit us all


tl/dr need help on how to change the short comings of an ultrasonic fogger (piezoelectric transducers) for fogponics; such as changing the frequency so droplet sizes are bigger and can carry certain nutrients to roots, avoid overheating water and be able to handle more then 500 ppm without clogging and dying so people can grow their own herbs/vegtables/fruits

61,General topic-- interlocks/emergency stops/failsafes,1361147028,"Hey everyone.  I figured I'd offer a bit of an open-ended question.  One thing I always struggle with the design of are interlocks, whether they are used to protect machinery or people.  A significant confound is that these systems are difficult to test well, as they are often designed to protect against improbable or even unanticipated events that can't be adequately modeled.  Obviously there is no substitute for thinking through and enumerating multiple failure scenarios, but I was wondering if anyone has any rules of thumb or interesting ideas they bring to the practice. 

I'm talking about all the family of design choices available, like:

* Mechanical, electrical, or software?
* Systems in series or in parallel
* etc, etc, etc.

Recently I had to design a cooling loop for a large induction heating coil.  I was struggling with all the possible failure modes (pump failure / coolant blocked; coolant empty; coolant leak; overtemperature...).  After putting it down for awhile, I was able to simplify the overall design by letting the coolant siphon through the coil, and running an on/off control to fill the top coolant reservoir.  Reservoir near empty?  Cut power.  Reservoir at upper limit for too long?  Kill things in software.  It had the added feature that the temperature excursion on power-off was less severe.  I'm looking for tips, tricks, and design philosophies in this area.  It's possible there are no general shortcuts here, but maybe you clever people have some or interesting stories. :)",AskEngineers,ic33,/r/AskEngineers/comments/18pxfy/general_topic_interlocksemergency_stopsfailsafes/

The problem I'm running into is finding a generator that will work at these speeds with a low starting torque. Almost every site I've found only seems to offer large generators like you would use with a wind turbine or car motor.

Can anyone can suggest a good site to purchase a small dynamo from (ideally one with a known efficiency curve so we don't have to calculate one ourselves)? 

Update:
If anyone is interested, we ended up going with a different idea, we tried to do a quick design of sure123's suggestion of measuring the torque placed on the motor, but trying to manufacture a mount or a eddy current dynamo is beyond the scope of our project.

We ended up going with creating a 'friction-dyno' if you will by wrapping a belt around the motor and then around a 2nd wheel and locking the 2nd wheel in place with a load cell. This gives us a way to measure the difference in the tension in the top and bottom of the belt, which is the same as the friction force exerted by having the belt rub against the engine, then we just need to measure the velocity of the wheel and we will have a power output.",AskEngineers,Run4way,/r/AskEngineers/comments/18ppvv/need_a_good_place_to_buy_a_small_dc/

A little background about me: High GPA, a few good internships under my belt, and about to graduate with my Masters degree in mechanical engineering. The subreddit rules didn't say not to talk about salaries, so I hope this isn't breaking the rules. But, the offer I received was around $50k, but included a company performance bonus program that has a bonus level of 10% starting out (which can be promoted later), which is multiplied by a company performance multiplier, which has recently been as high as 4 or 5, thus giving a 40%/50% bonus in those cases. The average bonus has historically been 2.0 x bonus level (20% in my case), but there have been cases of years with no bonuses.

67,How to select a lead screw and other things.,1361128264,"Hi everyone! My project team is designing a 3 axis linear robot (basically a CNC robot) and we have started selecting lead screws for the 3 axis. I've looked up various lead screw manufacturers but none of them tell you how the end of the lead screw looks like. If we need to mount it say to a bearing or a coupling we need a smooth part at the ends for that. Does anyone know how we can determine this? 

The other thing is that my two other team members are assuming that everything needs to be SUPER precise and accurate or else the lead screw will seize up or the rails will get locked or whatnot. We basically decided that we should be buying most of the critical stuff like rails or actuator assemblies and build as little as possible to reduce the amount of error. So one of our choices is to buy a whole $800 linear assembly for each axis ($2400) which is ridiculous because I doubt the school will pay for that. This would minimize our manufacturing work which I think is bad because it's fun to actually make stuff. 
The other option is to buy the rails and lead screw separately and sort of put them together which would come out to about $1000. This would make it less precise (according to my team) and more prone to error. 

I guess I should mention the application is for a pencil to draw a circle on paper and maybe have the ability to mount a dremel on there. So this is where I need some help. Do we really need $2400 worth of parts to make it run well or can we go with option 2 and make it work fairly easily? I've seen DIY cnc machines online and they work remarkably with minimal price.

As per the many recommendations from all of you, I'm taking the FE in April. Being the master procrastinator, I'm just getting the materials together. 

Unfortunately, the materials are expensive. VERY expensive. A reviewer on Amazon suggested the [Lindeberg book](http://www.amazon.com/Review-Manual-Preparation-Fundamentals-Engineering/dp/1591263336/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361082723&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lindeburg+fe), the [sample test book](http://www.amazon.com/EIT-Sample-Examinations-2nd-Edition/dp/1591260744/ref=pd_sim_b_3), and the [discipline (mechanical) specific book.](http://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Discipline-Specific-Review-EIT-Exam/dp/1591260655/ref=pd_sim_b_4) A quick calculation shows that this is hitting $200. I got the reference book for free. 

While I CAN afford it, the real question is should I? I found a bunch of practice materials online including, but not limited to, the Lindeburg book and a bunch of stuff from [Texas A&amp;M.](http://engineeringregistration.tamu.edu/tapedreviews/FEreview.htm)

Getting to the test will cost me something like $80 alone to get a car and that's already pretty pricey. 

So does this sound like a plan? I'll spend the money if I need to but I don't want to throw unnecessary money after it. I would appreciate any input and tips from all of you, heck, even stuff on study tips would help. 

I'm also going to be approaching the engineering economics section with little background (took two accounting classes when I originally planned to be a business/psychology major) so books/tips/resources for that are welcome.

With that in mind I thought it might be amusing to swap war stories and maybe learn a bit from each other (As they say, anyone can learn from his own mistakes, the smart man learns from mistakes other people makes.).

I'll even go first.

I was working on a rush project and had to build some custom fixturing to accomplish a certain task.  I threw together the design and - being in such a hurry - didn't bother to spec welds.  I just took the drawings to the fab shop, grabbed the welder, and said to him, ""Weld the crap out of all these joints.""

What he apparently heard me say was, ""Give me crap welds on all these joints.""

The part was finished.  I even proof loaded it... But I've no idea how it survived the proof load because shortly after putting the unit into service a weld broke and we quite literally dropped a bomb (I work in the ordnance industry).  Upon inspection, there were some butt welds with virtually zero penetration and obviously zero surface prep.  Again, how it survived the proof load I'll never know.

But the whole mess landed in my lap after the investigation.  After all, I hadn't specified what sort of weld the guy was supposed to use.  Mind you, I informed him of the application and told him I needed good welds, but there was nothing on paper.....

This class is truely exciting for me even though it makes me some what of a large nerd, but I am in need of some help with a program *syncro 8* as I am drawing an area for analysis.

The problem that I am having is with a right turn lane shown **[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wesomaeuhpdnonb/Photo%20Feb%2014%2C%202%2002%2049%20PM.png)**.  The intersection has a channelized right turn lane with a yield, as well as a right only lane next to the through lane.  Is there a way to show this in syncro, or would it be possible (without messing up the data) to make the through volume always 0 and then have the turn have volume.  I am just struggling with this and would like to make it look accurate.

A second question (that jsut poped into my head) would be the length of the storage length.  Would this be only the length of the solid white lines, or would you also include the taper?

My alternator puts out 95 amps. I need to fuse this connection, but do not know what size fuse to get. I have been told many different things and am looking for some real, concrete knowledge. Some people say 125% over the power going through the line, which i assume is 95 amps coming from the alternator. Another group of people say fuse it below the needed capacity, so an 80 amp fuse for a 95 amp alternator. That seems like it would just constantly blow the fuse. The third thing I have heard is that it doesnt matter what type of power is running through the wire, because it depends on the wire gauge. Since 1/0 holds 220-300 amps I would fuse somewhere in that number? I am extremely confused!

The surface area of the heating element should at least be half the circumferential value of the soda can.

4,Any building envelope engineers/architects on here?,1360856503,"I'm just curious if any of you guys do what I do.  I left school planning to do structural engineering design.  3 years later, while my company does a lot of masonry and concrete repair design, the majority of the work I do isn't structural, but rather ""building envelope"" related. 

Mainly, that means that the work I do is involved in the ""shell"" of the building, including masonry veneers, stucco, EIFS, metal panels, windows, roofing, subgrade wateproofing, or anything else that involves keeping a building air, water and thermally tight.  Is anybody else on here involved in that kind of work?  Seems to be a bit of niche field as far as I can tell, but most common building defects resulting in problems for the user are not structural related, but rather envelope related (mold and leaks).

5,[x-post r/engineers] Accountant looking for advice/insight from an engineer!,1360851923,"Hey guys, I am an accounting intern in the banking industry, and I seek some knowledge about a problem that I hear is similar to what some of you work with every day!

My boss told me about a guy he had met at a bank conference that was a (civil?) engineer for many years until he was laid off. In an attempt to find work, he applied to many different places and explained how his knowledge of advanced math could benefit their firm. He ended up working in a bank, and used his math skill to find customer account decay rates among a fairly homogeneous customer base. His background was stress testing materials used in buildings bridges, and he found that many materials used had a long life and some had a very short life, much like the customer base in a financial institution. 

He spoke at lengths with my boss about his work, and years later, my boss is very interested in precisely this kind of research. I am tasked to approach engineers at the local university with this problem, but I thought I would first turn to Reddit. I am going to try to detail exactly what I am looking for, but please keep in mind that I have no engineering background so I may (will) use incorrect terms or assumptions.

We have a homogeneous customer base that will all eventually leave the bank for very different reasons. Some may leave due to dissatisfaction or a better competitor, while some may leave the bank due to death (i.e. lifelong customers). We are trying to find the availability of funds in deposit accounts (savings, checking, CDs, IRAs) over a number of years, and the interest rate risk involved in establishing new accounts and gaining new funds as necessary, which would involve establishing new accounts at current rates. We are also trying to determine the point--or number of years--at which 50% of available deposit funds will no longer be available to the institution due to regular activity and account closures. 

We have the data for account closures, and are just looking at the best way to apply the data. This is a mock graph of what we THINK a chart would look like that would be generated by this application of data, and what we hope to gain is insight on how to do it.

We are powering a large 12 v DC motor and it is being used to drive a hydraulic pump, when the pump is at full capacity (i.e. 3000 psi) the motor as specified by the manufacturer will use 1600 Watts. using P=IV to me that says 133 amps. For our design the pump will likely never exceed lets say 2600 psi. The problem is we are having difficulty trying to find a way to power it.

Ok first of all this is my approach to jumping a dead battery:

1. Red (positive) cable to the positive terminal on the dead battery.
2. Connect the other red (positive) cable clamp to the positive terminal of the good battery.
3. Connect the black (negative) cable to the negative terminal of the good battery.
4. Connect the other black (negative) cable to a clean, unpainted metal surface under the disabled car’s hood.
5. Turn on good car, leave running for a bit. 
6. Try to start dead car. 
So here's my scenario that prompted this post:

I was jumping a friends car with this method. Tried starting the car after leaving the good car running for a while. Nothing happens. Try a few more times, nothing happens. 

My brother's friend then shows up and disconnects the black cable from the unpainted metal surface under the hood and instead connects it directly to the negative terminal of the car. He tries to turn the car on and it starts up immediately with no problem. He then says that this is how he always jumps a car and I am left wondering.

I'm using filters to cut out excess light. The photodiode is wired to one op amp which is connected to one instrumentation amp whose signal is then converted to a digital read out in Lab View. 

The problem I'm having is I get a reaction on the readout from both the dye and the water droplets I use as a control. It looks like the photodiode is picking up on the change in medium from oil to water/dye droplets. 

I've varied light source intensity as well as the voltage in the circuit but I either cant get any reading or I pick up the medium change reading.

I don't have a background in electrical engineering but I've tried a few different sources and photodiodes so I'm fairly sure I've wired something incorrectly. Any help would be great even the recommendation of a good resource on op amps and photodiodes, I've looked at a few books but didn't find anything helpful.

35,Motorized motion along a fixed non-linear planar path,1360702868,"Hi r/AskEngineers,

I have the following scenario which I'm having trouble finding a solution for. 

I need to attach a camera and have it move along an L-shaped path (or C-shaped if it's easier). The path is fixed meaning I can place something along that path. I also would need the method to be relatively inexpensive.

For a linear path, I have seen the camera attached to a threaded rod and another fixed rod while a stepper motor spins the thread rod causing the camera to move up or down (it's attached with some special attachment). The fact that it's a stepper motor allows you to be able to estimate where the camera currently is. If anyone knows what this system is called I'd love to know as well.

What good solutions are there for non-linear paths? Is there also a way to have an idea of ""how far along"" the path the object/camera is?

But it's a serious question of sorts.  I've been an engineer in the defense industry for about 18 years.  In that time I've only encountered a few PEs and those individuals invariably came from another industry.  Clearly, the defense industry doesn't care about PE licensing.

Still, a part of me wishes I'd bothered to get it.  I'm not sure why.  I don't know that I'd ever do anything with it (in fact, I'm pretty sure I won't).  At this point, I doubt I could pass it simply because the ""normal"" topics are so far removed from my experience that I'd be worse off than a recent grad since I haven't even thought about ""normal"" stuff like HVAC, the Carnot cycle, and such since I graduated school.  I recall the licensing board sending me a letter once, asking me why I'd never taken the exam (I did pass the EIT way back when).  I responded that there weren't any chapters on detonation mechanics, or gun ballistics, or armor design, or anything that remotely resembled my bread and butter.  Alas, I digress.

I'd like to build a solid state version but I don't know how to calculate the necessary voltage for the HV power supply.  It'll depend on the distance between the plates, and the properties (mainly weight, I assume) of the beads.  Assume a ""stiff"" voltage source so no issues with humidity / leakage.

Am I missing other important factors?  Is there a way to calculate this?  

A huge bonus would be to calculate exactly how many electrons would be needed for a given field strength (voltage / distance between the plates) and bead weight to counteract gravity on the ""upswing"" from bottom to top plate.  From that I'm pretty sure you could even derive an approximate figure for the current flow (for a given number of beads plus the ""jump frequency"").

Edit: I probably wasn't clear enough on the question.  Clarification:

I'm hoping for something practical based on the parameters of the object within the field, the properties of which will determine the force. As the bead lies on the bottom plate it either net gains or loses electrons (depending on the polarity) and begins to experience a force pulling it to the opposite plate. How much voltage (which will determine how many electrons are pumped to/from the bead, and also the field gradient) is required for it to actually accelerate upwards against the force of gravity? That is going to depend in part on the properties of the bead. I just don't know which ones or how to calculate it.",AskEngineers,nkinnan,/r/AskEngineers/comments/18dain/styrofoam_beads_jumping_between_charged_plates/

What should have been a quick and easy maintenance turned out to be a 2 hour conversation.  Basically he saw a huge fault in my brake system and said they can potentially lock up and cause me swerving into incoming traffic and kill myself.

Now before I go on, I would like to apologize that I have no pictures.  Somehow I forgot in the heat of the conversation.  So if you choose to continue, please bare with me and use your imaginative talent.

So back to the problem.  Yes, I can imagine some possibilities in which my brakes could lock up in midst of operation.  (Before I get ahead of myself, I'd like to point out I'm talking about caliper brakes; and the brakes in the front of the car).  However, my reasons all involve some malfunction of the hydraulic system.  Perhaps the piston can freeze midway in motion or somehow oil can bubble up and prevent full retraction of the brake pad.  Generally speaking, the hydraulic system would cause sudden brake lock up.

However, my mechanic reasoned that it's the fact that the rotor is a mismatch for the caliper.  I don't specifically know why, and forgot the reasoning (I didn't understand what he was talking about anyway), but I simply cannot imagine a way that the brakes may lock up because of this issue.  To be precise, the rotor was too small.  The rotor did make full contact with the pads.  I did not see anything in particular.  It seemed like everything was dandy.

I used to think I knew the general operation of cars inside and out.  ANd the brake system?  Psh, not so difficult! 

But I must be wrong.  Or instead of assuming, I'd like to ask folks that are more experienced and professional.  Whether you're profession involves cars (or the brake system specifically) or not, what are some of your instinctive thoughts or well-thought-crazyily-contrived reasoning?  Imagining the way a general brake caliper system (in an automobile) is designed, how can the overall system ""lock up""?

I graduated in May with a BSME and took the first job I was offered which payed $20/hour. They said that I would start out doing low level work(assembly, troubleshooting, etc) and I would slowly move to more technical work. After two months I was put in charge of their new product. I made design changes, contacted vendors, had the prototype made, etc. All successfully. After six months I am now the ONLY engineer at the company. I am the only one with access to the engineering documentation, I manage quality control with our vendors, I am starting to work on the future products, and I am still making 20$/hr. 

Problem:
Now to the important part. I usually work between 9 and 10 hrs/day which makes my yearly salary between 50,000 and 55,000/yr because of the overtime pay.  The boss came to me on Friday and said ""seahorses, we would like to give you a 10% raise, we are offering a salaried position of $46,000 per year.""

Where I may have messed up:
I couldn't help but tell him that he wasn't actually giving me a raise. He is going to continue to expect me to work overtime to get my job done, but now he isn't paying me for it. I tried to give the whole ""I really enjoy working here and feel I have contributed positively to the company, and I feel I deserve to be payed at least 50,000/yr(because that is what I am already being paid"".

74,Repairing a motor,1360415367,"I have an old sewing machine, about 35 years old, unfortunately the motor is on it's way out.  I love this machine and it was inherited from my grandmother.

The sewing machine shop round the corner says it's not worth repairing (they can't get the parts and even if they could I'd be looking at over £500 and I'd be better off spending that money on a new machine).  An internet search confirms what he says that it's been a long time since the motors have been available.

Can I repair the motor?  I am a chemical engineer rather than mechanical, so while I don't know much about engines it's hopefully something I would be able to understand if I put some effort into learning.

I can't justify the cost of a new machine and have a lot of time as I'm only employed part time at the moment (trying to find a full time job) so I'd like to try and repair it if that's at all possible.

The motor does turn over, but not as fast as it used to.  Initially the problem was that it wouldn't 'start' the machine, but if I used the hand wheel to get the machine going the motor could then take over.  Now unfortunately it can't even do that, it still makes noises.

I haven't tried getting the motor out yet as it requires completely dismantling the mechanics of the machine to access it (even after removing what panels I can it's not at all accessible).  If I even can dismantle it.  I'm unable to budge some of the screws I've tried (any advice?)

1. Isn't a band just an aggregation of specific wavelengths between given frequencies?

2. If so, how many specific wavelengths are in each band (in this case, for an old fashioned telephone line)?

3. If this band is sampled 8,000 times per second, does this mean that each sample records the amplitude (in this case) for each wavelength? This would mean that for each sample, multiple bits would be recorded?

What I wanted to do though was to implement a method of switching the power supply leading to the main light bulb (from the power grid; a set of batteries) to that provided from the motor. So basically, when the motor turns, the power supply is switched from the power grid to that being provided from the motor.

It also said that there was a steel coated with the stuff had been immersed in salt water for 30 days without any effect.  

I guess my question is how abrasion is road wear on a car? Is this product's rating going to be high enough to last a whole winter?  Will it last even 100 miles?

I disassembled an older model and retrieved the magnetron. Since I'm an EE (not that rude though), I don't need help with the schematics.

Yet the design of the mechanical parts seems to become a problem. The magnetron is about 5x5x8cm and looks similar to [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Magnetron1.jpg). I want to add a ""muzzle"" to direct the beam straight (or with a little spread) outward. The MW beams that exit the magnetron angled would mirror off the walls and leave the muzzle angled too. Can I overcome this by using a specific muzzle diameter? Maybe by using a rectangular cross-section?

The other question is proper grounding. Should I ground the muzzle to the magnetron case or isolate it from both the magnetron and the environment? How high voltages can be produced?

Forgot to mention that the frequency is 2.4GHz. Any target with some water in it and thicker than 3cm should absorb the majority of the beam, right?

For a class project we got a task for which we have to find a new solution in maintenance of tunnels. We have to rethink a way to locate yourself when you're behind the concrete wall inside the tunnel. We have to be able to locate a position behind the concrete wall, inbetween the concrete wall and the mountain/rocks. So that we can go back on the other side of the wall and to be able to find that location again. 

We're not allowed to to drill through, or anything like that. And the way the measure this location now is through old fashioned measuring. And this makes alot of room for mistakes and errors. GPS doesnt work, since it's inside a tunnel.

So would be great if i could get any help with some ideas of what might work and is doable!

Let's take a hypothetical scenario where there are two helical gears that correctly mesh and are both on keyed shafts but can move up or down it's respective shaft. Gear number 1 (G1) is the driver and gear number 2 (G2) is driven. G1 is heavy compared to G2. The teeth are angled in a way that if G1 is spun clockwise, G2 is driven counterclockwise. What would happen if all of the sudden G2 were to spin in reverse (clockwise) from what it normally does? Would G2 ride up it's shaft and thus essentially disengaging because of the angled teeth?

As in: insert parts to cut (length and quantity), insert stock to cut from (also length and quantity) and voilá! Cut ""part"" ""X"" times in ""StockBar"" and so on.

I work in a theater and I've been given a budget to redo the rigging/design of an orchestra shell. There are two walls (each weighing 2000# that hang from the ceiling on the extreme left and right sides of the stage. Currently the SL &amp; SR walls of the shell hang on a wheeled carrier that runs along a small, 10' I beam (to supply a small amount of movement of the walls onstage for smaller symphony shows) type S8 x 18.4. This is bracketed to a ladder truss, with a 60' span SL-SR, and is picked up by 6 ""points""-- each made of 3/8"" wire rope. The system was installed in 1985, and despite a number of adjustments to wire rope and turnbuckles, the truss is very frown-ey, as all the weight of the walls is stored on the extreme edges of the truss.  

I would like to ditch the truss entirely, and replace it with singular, or spliced I-beam, and beam clamps to connect to the wire rope. My thinking being this would allow the walls to travel onstage/more to the center of the beam when stored, and spread the load more evenly along the beam and among the pick points. 

That said, I'm having no problem finding dimensions of beams online, weight/ft, etc, but not much in the way of weight loading capabilities/compression/tension. I'd love to keep the same size/not have to fit a new trolley, but doubt it will work/could possibly be that easy. Additionally, what lengths of I-Beams are typical? 22'? Best ways to splice them? Am I making sense? Am I off my rocker? Like I said, it's a unique problem for me--I'm good with basic engineering for cable/swages/hanging scenery/flysystems in theaters, but I-beams are a new beast. 

Thanks again.

I'm an amateur astronomer, but living in the city means that light pollution is a real problem for me.  Rather than getting set up on some remote property, I'd like to create or modify a cargo trailer into something that can serve as a mobile observatory.

There are two major issues with having a telescope within a trailer.  One is that movement in the trailer will transfer vibration to the instrument, and the other is that the telescope will have a hard time viewing over the walls of the trailer.  The solution I'm thinking for this would be to mount the entire (~600lb) telescope assembly on a steel plate mounted over a hole in the floor of the observatory.  The plate would then be lifted up with a set of 3 synchronized [screw jacks](http://joycedayton.com/products/machine-screw-jacks/1000-lbs-machine-screw-jacks).  But I'm not sure how high I can lift the assembly before the screw rods become unacceptably unstable, and I'm not sure how to allow the jacks to lift against uneven ground while maintaining synchronization.  Some sort of clutch system, maybe?

Another possibility would be to use screw jacks only to lift the steel platform only very slightly off the observatory floor for isolation, and then to use a [lifting column](http://www.rk-rose-krieger.com/english/products/linear-technology/for-those-familiar-with-our-products/lifting-columns/) as a pier to lift the telescope clear of the trailer's walls.  I'm not actually sure if this would be more stable or less stable than simply relying on longer screw jacks (it'd certainly be more expensive).

How feasible does this sound?  Is there anything important I'm missing as I design this?  How can I predict how 'wobbly' the lift system is likely to be once it's ready to go?

 I was wondering the feasibility of sizing down the current bladeless fan technology  ([Seen here](http://www.dyson.com/Fans/FansAndHeaters/Fans.aspx)) to ~4in circumference. On the dyson website, it mentions that (what I presume is) the 12inch model can produce 405 l/sec of airflow [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dyson_products#Air_Multiplier_fan). 

Is it technically possible for a ~4inch circumference bladeless fan to produce anywhere from 4-10 cmH20 positive pressure? Could this be accomplished in ~1 second?

I realize that the  air generation comes from the relatively large base of the fan that feeds the air into small slits on the inside of the fan. How large would the version of the source in the sized down model have to be? How much power would it require?

The current plan is to build a solar-powered UAV that looks similar to [Space Ship One/White Knight](http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/spaceshipone-2.jpg). The UAV will be lifted by the tail in a large balloon and be released to gain the necessary altitude and velocity through gravity rather than precious battery power. The plane will then autopilot for ~7000km. The [pod](http://www.aerospaceguide.net/spaceplanes/ss2.jpg) will contain the majority of the payload (a GPS for tracking and the pig) and will be designed like a [lifting body](http://www.daviddarling.info/images/HL-10.jpg) and will be dropped about 7,000 feet above the target. It will then deploy a parachute at about 100ft of altitude, falling safely to a field or somewhere.

I have a few questions as to the feasibility of this. 

* My goal weight total is 4.5kg (10 lb). Will that be stable enough to cross the Atlantic Ocean?
* My estimated wingspan would be about 2.5m (8 ft). Will that be stable enough to cross the Atlantic Ocean?
* Would a solar UAV be able to power itself for 7000km (4500 mi) if it weighed 4.5kg?

I was given the task to build a device that attempts to reduce/prevent bed sores (aka pressure ulcers) for those that are in wheelchairs. The device should be able to fit into a wheelchair and look like a large cushion on top of the seat. The design so far is to periodically redistribute the pressure on their buttocks through changing the shape of the surface that they're sitting on. So far I've come up with either having some sort of cam-shaft system deform the cushion from under them or to have a grid of air pockets that inflate/deflate. Another idea I had is perhaps there's some of 'electrically controlled surface' where you could physically change a material's physical shape through a voltage signal.

So far, we have replaced both fuel injectors, the top hat for the fuel pump, the barrel and plunger of the fuel pump, and the shock absorber for the fuel pump. The next step is to change the exhaust valve which will happen when we pull into port in a couple days. We also adjusted the fuel rack, sending more fuel to the cylinder, as a quick fix and it worked for a few days.

M-Moment
F-reaction to create normal force
μ-static friction coeff.
τ-shear 
R- total radius
r- variable radius

dM=(r*τ)dA
 
dA=(2*pi*r)dr 

dM=(2*pi*τ*r^(2))dr

τ=F*μ/(pi*r^2) % this is the step im really unsure about, whether i can define τ as just the friction force over the surface area of contact.

anyway, 
dM=(2*F*μ)dr

Considering how prolific bacteria are, there must be a damn good reason this design has lasted so long.",AskEngineers,cata2k,/r/AskEngineers/comments/179fvn/is_it_practical_to_draw_inspiration_from_nature/
95,Modeling a prosthesis on Solidworks or AutoCAD. Where do I start? ,1359124929,"I want to model and construct a robotic arm or leg (arm or leg prosthesis) on Solidworks or AutoCAD. I was wondering if there are any useful tutorials, websites, books, etc...that I can look to for reference? Are there any specific toolboxes, plugins, or commands I should look into for modeling it? 

Thanks a bunch! ",AskEngineers,Eowyn27,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1798f2/modeling_a_prosthesis_on_solidworks_or_autocad/
96,Need help building a motor,1359119105,"I have a school project to build a simple motor, can anyone help with providing a site or video that details how to build really any time of simple motor whether it be electric or wind or so on. The only thing is that it can't be so simple as the ones you make when your young, something for a 17 year old or so. I have been looking at steam engines they seem ok, but do you have any other ideas? ",AskEngineers,7bob7,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1794c7/need_help_building_a_motor/
97,Keeping taps from freezing by letting them drip 24x7.,1359116676,"I receive emails from someone (possibly an apartment manager) in Chicago periodically with reminders about rent payment and stuff like that due to a typo in his mailing list. 

Yesterday I got the following email:
&gt;
&gt;Subject: Cold Water rules to keep pipes from freezing
&gt;
&gt;1.  Keep the cabinet doors below your kitchen sinks open.  The kitchen sinks are against the outside wall which bear the brunt of the cold ir.  This will allow the warm air to circulate around the pipes and keep them from freezing.
&gt;2.  Let the cold water from the kitchen sink run all day and night whenever temperatures are forecast to go below 20 degrees at anytime during the day or night. 
&gt;3.  The bathrooms (tubs, etc.) that have their faucets on an outside wall should also have the water moving to keep them  from freezing.  
&gt;The &lt;XYZ building&gt; bathrooms have the water pipes for their showers on an outside wall and therefore should have the water dripping from those faucets to keep the water from freezing in the pipes whenever the temp falls below 20 degrees.
&gt;
&gt;Call me if you have any questions.

Is this usual practice? I mean, I know it would work but isn't that a lot of wastage. ",AskEngineers,multicore_manticore,/r/AskEngineers/comments/179326/keeping_taps_from_freezing_by_letting_them_drip/

99,Troll motors for hydrokinetic turbines,1359079217,"I'm in a senior design project where we need to create a hydokinetic turbine for a remote hospital in Africa. The final goal of the project is to create a turbine that creates 20kW of power and at the end create a 1:5 scale model.


My faculty adviser suggested we find the biggest trolling motor to translate the turning of the turbine blades into power (he basically said no to reinvent the wheel, but work off preexisting things.) 


The problem is that electronics aren't my forte and I'm looking through ebay and other sources to find different types of trolling motors and I'm lost. What would be sufficient to create that amount of power. Also, the size of the turbine blades to be 1:5 scale would need to be 2.5 feet long on a 3 blade turbine which would be pretty heavy. The budget that the sponsor is providing is $2,500 (very tight) and we are leaning towards a double turbine system (2 turbines turning to provide power.)

any help would be greatly appreciated. ",AskEngineers,Old_Caroline,/r/AskEngineers/comments/178a21/troll_motors_for_hydrokinetic_turbines/
