11,"Trying to decide between switching my major to aerospace engineering or computer science, and could use some insight",1582608298,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the right place to ask and that I’m not breaking any rules. 

I’m currently a first year music composition student working on my undergrad, however I’m most likely changing my major to either aerospace engineering or computer science (I know music to engineering seems like a pretty drastic switch, but they’re the two things I’ve been interested in most of my life, so I’m pretty capable in both areas). I can’t seem to decide which would be best for me though. 

I’ve always been fascinated by aircraft and spaceflight, I used to take flight lessons, and flight simulators were always my go to games. I also fell in love with Kerbal Space Program when I was in early teens (gotta start somewhere, right?). Being able to create something and see that creation fulfill its purpose is always some I’ve loved, which is true for music just as much as it is for engineering. At the same time, I started to develop an interest in coding. It first started with downloading a mod for Kerbal Space Program called kOS, that I used to try and automate my voyages, which I also thought was fascinating. This then expanded outwards to learning a bit of actual programming. I’ve also always wanted to delve more into video game design, as I think it’s something where I could use my artistic talents in tandem with my more technical abilities. 

Of course, all this leaves me not sure where I should go. I feel like computer science would give me more versatility and more options, and likely more ability to still utilize my artistic abilities in the future, but I also think aerospace is something I’m more certain that I could enjoy. While certain parts of comp sci are super interesting to me (machine learning, AI, video game design, automation, even exploring the overlaps between music and computer science), there are also aspects I find less interesting. Aerospace, on the other hand, I find interesting in pretty much all regards. 

Most people I know say to go with comp sci as it would allow me to more easily continue doing music to some extent, however I also just find rockets and planes and all that incredibly interesting and I think there’s a huge future in space flight, and it’s a future I’d love to be a part of.

Basically, there should not be threads inside of the hole carrying a shear load. 

This makes sense because you have a sharp inside radius in each thread as well as a fastener radius reduction for each thread in the direction of loading.


However, there is no mention of design practice for threads inside of a hole when the bolt is carrying a nearly pure tensile load. Essentially, same situation as above, but tensile loading instead of shear.

I was told at work to select a different fastener for my application to not have threads in bearing for a tensile load. However, from what I have seen, internal threads in tensile loading should not cause problems. I was also told that even in tensile loading the edges of the threads could be sources of cracks on the edge of the hole.

17,How can we increase our chances to be attractive? (Electrical Engineering Technology),1582597081,"Hi guys, 

I am a graduate in Electrical Engineering technology (3 year accredited degree BengTech) in my country which is eligible for an engineering license after 1 year practical work under a licensed engineer doing approved engineer work. I know for a fact that I'm at a disadvantage when it comes to other graduates who got \*actual\* degrees in Engineering (4 year accredited programs) but thats fine and that's the decision i made going into this. I'm interested in automation and would love to join the industry but im flexible and like the look of field applications engineering too, in any case I would like to eventually become a ""real engineer"" and make good money to become financially stable.

I'm more interested in what I can do to become better, so I'd like to make a thread where we can get the help of other Engineers (or engineering technologists/technicians any field is welcome) or employers to give us advice to make ourselves attractive to work for you guys. So these are some topics I would like to cover, please feel free to add any other advice that isnt covered by this list, thank you:

1) Resumes /Cover Letter: 

\-What can we put on our resumes/cover letters to make it attractive? How should we present it etc. 

\-Should we include any relevant tertiary experience, what should we leave out/include? 

2) Skills: 

\-What skills can we learn at home to become more attractive? What type of programming should we learn from free online courses? Should we (in the electrical industry) just do random circuitry and soldering at home that we can add on our resumes to indicate our passion for this industry? Since most of us have no relevant experience? What home/freelance projects have been helpful in your experience? 

&amp;#x200B;

3) Networking/Linkedin: 

\-How should we take advantage of our linkedin or networking contacts? For some of us who don't have any friends in the industry how can we make some? Should we hit the pavement? Should we cold call or cold message people we want to be like on linkedin? 

&amp;#x200B;

4) Any alternative ideas: 

&amp;#x200B;

\-I've spent most of my time applying to jobs online to no avail, I've called employers about their job listings to show my enthusiasm even asked for other jobs they're offering and cold emailed recruitment staff for work. Should I start door knocking and handing out my resume? How else can I get oppurtunities besides applying for every single new job on the internet everyday. My guidance counseller says that only 10% of jobs end up on the internet, but I'm not sure how to access the other 90% that I'm willing to put in work for.

20,I Invented Something... Now What?,1582595276,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a senior year Aerospace Engineer major that works at a semiconductor (and probably will work there after graduation for a while). I think I might've just ""invented"" something extremely useful for a rather large market. I've done a bit of research and there doesn't seem to be much (or really any) products that fulfill the same purpose and the one I found that does is VERY expensive and kinda ugly. Outside of that there are plenty of DIY guides on how to build something similar, but I think if I can develop something not too expensive it would sell like hotcakes (maybe).

Assuming I get a positive response of a bunch of people saying ""yes I would buy that for $x!"" where do I go from there?

22,"Been looking into a coil gun project for a while now, but need lots of clarification and help with some circuit design",1582594221,"for some background: I am a mechanical engineer (with some electrical and computer expertise), So back at christmas time, I got a couple of arduino kits for chirstmas, and was looking into what i could maybe do with them. I already got most of their usage figured out for the rest of the project, but the part that I need help with is basically designing a coil gun. a strong one. a really strong one. but I've been running into lots of difficulty figuring out the info beyond a tiny weak nail shooter. So if this is going to be controlled by an arduino, it will most likely be triggered through an SCR and/or a relay, but thats beyond the scope of this question, just some context.

In general with the coil gun design and circuit behind the coil gun, i have multiple questions:

I've done a lot of looking into this, and it seems to be very similar to how a solenoid works. Where the more amps and the more turns you have, the more force that gets imparted to the projectile. However, I've read that you want to keep the impedance as low as possible, (but this is DC so do you mean resistance?), but have as many turns as possible. I was originally looking at a coil that would be 3 inches in diameter and 4 inches long, but i'm running into issues trying to figure out whether to go with low gauge wires and focus on high current and lower resistance but less turns, or go with high gauge wire with tons of turns, taking a very long time to make, and having a very large impedance (resistance?). I've also read that the force in general just depends on the overall mass of the whole coil, it just becomes a tradeoff between current and voltage when powering it.

There isn't really a set voltage that I want to use with it, but from what i've read, I just need to discharge a film capacitor (a capacitor thats designed for something like this) over the coil. but I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to size it beyond ""get the highest voltage you can reasonably find that doesn't fry the relay/SCR"", particularly on the capacitance side. I've read 100uf for every amp, but considering this is just an instantaneous discharge, how should I size it? Also, wouldn't something like this break an SCR or a relay with the extreme current caused by said discharge? or would I need to place that switch to discharge the capacitor elsewhere in the circuit?

How would I go about generating such a high voltage to charge the capacitor? I'm trying to stay away from playing with live mains voltage, and i do have power supplies from various consumer electronic devices such as old laptops and old desktops (just got a 750w desktop computer psu, probably super overkill), and I do know how to get a set DC voltage out of them. But the issue I am running into is moreso trying to step up that voltage to charge the capacitor. I've looked at boost converters (which dont seem to go very far since many MOSFET switches i've found have very low current/voltage ratings, and I am wondering if I can use an arduino to control the MOSFET), or a couple other circuits that seem to have the problem of dropping off in terms of voltage once current is actually drawn from them. What is the easiest (and if possible, safest) way to do this? I've found a ""capacitor charger circuit"" from linear that uses a chip, but it seems to top out at around 500-600 volts, and charge fairly slowly, and I was hoping for something I could scale up, or would at least be higher.",AskEngineers,False,TimX24968B,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f9264m/been_looking_into_a_coil_gun_project_for_a_while/

Hi guys, I recently graduated from SDSU with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and I’m having a difficult time getting responses from employers due to my lack of experience. I’m looking for jobs in the Irvine, CA or Los, Angeles areas but my effort isn’t yielding much. I only have 1 summer internship to my name which wasn’t really engineering work. It was primarily just traveling between states for data entry and it had a few project management opportunities (planning travel routes for intern teams, mapping which locations to complete for each day to maintain a schedule). I’m still motivated and applying everyday but I believe the issue may be with my resume. I have revised it numerous times with input from others (both in the industry and out) and I thought it was pretty good but still, no responses. My EIT exam is scheduled for mid-March and getting that certification may help but thats not a guarantee.

I need to approximate the drag of the flat end versus the drag of the rounded side (basically orient like long pontoons front-to-back, or rows going side-to-side). It's gonna get complicated because there'd be a lot more surface area exposed to incoming water in the sideways orientation, but they'd all be in the turbulent wake of the one in front. that might fuck the whole thing up... i dunno... 

I hypothesize that the rounded sides of the barrel would have a better drag profile than pushing the flat ends of the barrels through the water, because I'm under the impression that the amount of force exerted on the barrels by moving water, or by stationary water for that matter, is not a linear function of the angle at which it is hitting. 

I know the draft of the barrels below the surface would be not more than 5-6 inches, so the most extreme angle of the tangent of the surface of the barrel to the water would be like 30 degrees... whereas the flat face would be normal to the velocity of the water. 

https://imgur.com/a/sQynKuc here's a little sketch of kind of what im talking about. Suppose for the sake of theory that the angle of the curved barrel at a dept of like 5"" in the water is 30 degrees up from the surface of the water, which we will assume is traveling perfectly horizontally relative to the face.

58,Career Progression for a Manufacturing Engineer Specialist,1582562830,"Just some background info, but I graduated last year with a technology degree and was lucky enough to get a job as a manufacturing engineer specialist.  In 1.2 months I will be hitting my 1 year mark and for a while now I have been considering where I go from here.  The amount of work I have to do doesn't seem realistic for an entry level position.

This causes me to be spread too thin and never having time to put 100% into my projects (Lack of pride in what I do with very little reward).  To top it off my supervisor quit back in the summer, leaving me as the sole MfgE in my company.  (My new supervisor is ranked very high in the company and barely knows what I even do now)

Losing my supervisor has led to many changes in my job that I don't know where I should go from here.

Originally my job only required me to:

* Create BOM's in our ERP system 
* Create visual work instructions
* Interpret ECN's and ensure all stakeholders are aware of the changes 

Now My current job is more like this:

* Create and structure BOM's in our ERP system
* Create and manage jobs
* Interpret ECN's and ensure all stakeholders are aware of the changes 
* Coordinate with supply chain that parts are purchased
* NPI: Test and validate engineering designs and modify jobs if needed (Weird right?  Things hit production before being validated and I always have to flag these things)
* Design fixtures for production
* Plant layouts
* Many more (I'm basically a support role to logistics/inventory, supply chain, production, engineering, quality ect)

The above doesn't seem too bad, but being the only MfgE I have to do this for every production line we have.  As my old supervisor described it, the more engineers we hire and the more product launches we do just increases the amount of work that get's funneled to me.

With my technology degree is it even possible for me to progress, or am I trapped in this job until I can build years of experience or get a P.Eng?

NAE (Not An Engineer)

I have a yoke (Saitek Pro Flight) that I use for flight simulators. It is known for poor mechanical design so this problem (among others) is not uncommon.

The problem: When moving the yoke in or out, there is a slight increase in the amount of friction at about the midpoint. This makes things like landing more than a little frustrating.

They use a pair of plastic inline gears to transfer motion from the yoke to a potentiometer. It appears as though when the yoke is in the middle of it's stroke path, the gear teeth bottom out with the most pressure. There is no space at the bottom of the ""V"".

My question is: if I shave just a little off the bottom of each ""V"" notch in the gears in order to relieve the ""bottoming out"" pressure, will it have an adverse effect elsewhere?

The reason I am being cautious is because there is no place to get replacement parts and it would cost about $150 to replace the yoke if I damage it.

I'm unsure if the links will work, so you can just take my word for it, but I'll try anyway.

According to THIS site.

https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/petroleum-and-other-liquids/more-petroleum-and-other-liquids-data?pd=5&amp;p=0000000001&amp;u=0&amp;f=A&amp;v=line&amp;a=-&amp;i=none&amp;vo=value&amp;t=C&amp;g=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001&amp;l=249-ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvvvvvs&amp;s=315532800000&amp;e=1514764800000&amp;&amp;ev=false

The world used 26348 Mb/d of gasoline in 2014 (I'm ASSUMING that's Mega barrels/day or rather ""thousand"" barrels per day... according to the handy canadian conversion website for dealing with american units. https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/international/nacei/18057) Honestly, what in the actual hell is that unit? A capitol M in a unit NOT standing for ""million"" (and the AMERICAN MILLION at that, none of the ridiculous british million bullcrap from days gone by.) Stupid unit.

Regardless... 26348 THOUSAND barrels per day (and that's the OIL barrel definition of 42 US GALLONS... I'm assuming.... not the OTHER definition of barrel for virtually any other liquid of 31 US GALLONS (seriously, WTF IS UP WITH THESE UNITS.)

Now, if you take the website above, go into ""data options"" and select ""metric units"" instead of US units, you'll see 5475297 Mmt. (in 2014 for ""world"".)

That turns out to be 5475297 Mmt. I'm ASSUMING that stands for ""million metric tons."" Mainly because when you select ""metric units"" on the ""data options"" screen, it literally says ""metric tons."" 

Now, let's try to do the math between them... let's start with the metric unit because F*** US UNITS.

5475927 Mmt (x1000000) -&gt; 5475927000000 metric tons (x1000000)-&gt; 5.4753E16 GRAMS of gas(/0.7489 g/cm^3 (density of gas)) -&gt; 7.3111E18 mL of gas(/1000) -&gt; 7.3111E15 L of gas(/3.78541 L) -&gt; 1.9314E15 US gallons of ethanol (/42 (gallons in US oil barrel)) -&gt; 4.5986E13 US Oil Barrels of gas(/1000) -&gt; 435986E10 ""Mega Barrels"" of gas(Thousand barrels) (/365) -&gt; 125987880.9 Mb/d

As you can see, 125987880.9 =/= 26348

Ok so.... uhm... wtf? The really stupid thing is.... if you do the SAME conversion with fuel ethanol used, you see that the answer is ROUGHLY off by a factor of 1000, meaning that Mb/d means ""million barrels/day"" and not the commonly used (but stupid) definition of ""thousand barrels per day."" Ok so then we get the following.

125987.8809 =/= 26348

Still not even close. At least when you do it with ethanol you at LEAST get the same answer at this point.

16,Really confused about adjusting to a new industry and am wanting some advice.,1582482438,"Hello, fellow engineers. I am brand new to the (full-time, salaried) workforce, having just started back in January, right out of school. I’ve taken these past couple of months to get a feel for the life in my workplace, and I’ve noticed a few differences from what I’ve experienced so far in this job, compared to past internships.

I should explain: I’ve interned at three different environmental engineering consulting companies throughout college, and I was hourly for all of those and wasn’t expected to put in more than 40 hours a week most of the time. HOWEVER, from what I had seen/heard from my coworkers who were full-time, salary exempt employees, a typical work schedule was set as the “8am-5pm” day, but would usually work around 45-50 hours a week. So, I thought this was the norm.

Fast-forwarding to this past January… I started my first salaried exempt job, working for a well-know defense contractor. One of the first things I learned was the flexible work schedule they offered: most people do a 9/80, but you can basically do whatever you wanted, as long as your hours added up to 80 for the pay period. Additionally, from what I’ve seen from my coworkers, they seem leave at exactly the same time every day, and rarely work more than 80 hours in the pay period.

I’m usually the first one to arrive, and last one to leave, every day because I want to make myself stand out. So, because of this, I’ve been able to get a feel as to how people operate here. This is such a stark contrast from what I had seen in consulting. But I feel like it’d be a bad idea to adjust to the “norm”, right? While I’m just starting out?

tl;dr the work atmosphere in defense seems different than that in consulting, and am having some trouble adjusting. All I want to do is stand out for my boss.",AskEngineers,False,HeheYoItsYaBoi,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f8dg5a/really_confused_about_adjusting_to_a_new_industry/

We have a part at the place that I work that has multiple profiles that also have MMC applied in the control frame for datums (Diameter from centerline and also a plane made with 10 holes at the top flange of the part.). As far as I am aware you cannot apply MMC to Profiles (we even submitted questions to our customer and they gave us the generic ""MMC cannot be applied to profiles"" answer and that was all they said, so i'm not sure if they even looked at the part number we submitted). I found one page online that says this is for a ""Datum Shift"" to the profiles that allows movement of the datums to allow the profiles to be in tolerance. ([https://www.tec-ease.com/gdt-tips-view.php?q=132](https://www.tec-ease.com/gdt-tips-view.php?q=132)) The Same page said this is difficult for CMMs to do.

I also saw that PCDMIS has a module for calculating this datum shift called XactMeasure. We are using OPENDMIS for our CMMs, which can do some PCDMIS code, but not all. My question is can profile have MMC applied in certain circumstances? Also is this possible for a CMM to inspect? If it is can Opendmis measure this without the XactMeasure module PCDMIS has?

25,How come these two-stroke Yamaha motorcycles appear to have exactly double the power specified?,1582458210,"I haven't checked bikes from other manufacturers, only a couple of old two-stroke motorcycles from the country I live in, such as the RD 135, DT 180/200, and RD 350 (which I believe is the name for an entirely different, older motorcycle in other countries). These are the power output figures I have found:

RD 135: 16/18 hp
DT 180: 16.6 hp
DT 200: 25 hp
RD 350: 55 hp

I've also found a figure of 88 horsepower for the RD 500, but I don't know about its performance. I'm sure it also performs similarly to liter bikes with double the horsepower, though.

As far as I know, rough top speed can be calculated by taking the cube root of engine's top horsepower figure and multiplying it by an aerodynamic coefficient. That should give a rough number.

The RD 135 is often seen reaching speeds of 160-170 km/h. Those are speeds reached by bikes like the Ninja 300, which makes 39 hp, roughly twice the 18 hp the RD has. The RD 350 appears to be able to reach 200 km/h, and that seems almost impossible with only 55 hp. These bikes also accelerate too fast for these power figures.

What I've found is that the RD 350 seems to suddenly gain a lot more power after around 6,000 RPM...something to do with YPVS, I think. It might actually be getting double the power after that RPM, from what I've seen.

It also seems that a stock RD 135 really performs like a typical 16-18 hp motorcycle, not getting beyond 120-125 km/h.

I picked a photo of a gear system off the web and started drafting it. It is here: https://imgur.com/gallery/1iyUaje.

I know the photo is a bit silly so forgive me. I basically counted the gear teeth in the smaller gears and making sure they lined up properly was able to fit them together perfectly regardless of the first photo showing errors.

I then began lining up the positions for the outer gear teeth to match with the inner gears ⚙️ and that is where I ran into problems. I tried using the amount of teeth from the original photo, 47, but couldn’t get them to line up. Then I also tried 46 and 48 to no avail. Then I took the midpoints from the top inner gear in between the teeth, to try to mirror that angle with the correct points all around the circle to get my outer gear teeth points, but as you can see in the photo with the green lines the last angle doesn’t line up. Photos here: https://imgur.com/gallery/tATyjjt.

I suppose I could use scale to change the sizes of the inner gears a bit as the teeth for the outer gear isn’t finished yet and they could be longer if need be. Really I’m stuck right now as I’m not an engineer or even a drafter yet, so I’m not sure what the best way to go about fixing this is.

44,Hi guys. Not sure if this is the right place to ask but want to know about diy gen-set project feasibility,1582419454,"I am doing ton of research as of late regarding how I want to go about doing a schoolie RV conversion build. I want parity to living in a standard home so one of my biggest concerns has been onboard power generation. Considering that I am building am RV conversion I'm sure it makes sense that I want a more efficient and (quiet for boondocking) generator to charge my off grid battery system. Due to this I have looked into converting junkyard auto engines into a diy gen-set, especially since I can tailor it to my specific needs. What I don't have is the know how about ECU controlling, flashing etc.

So. I have long been a Toyota fan and I know that the 2ZR-FE engine is not a bad place to start, (30-35 percent max thermal efficiency afaik), but I'm also well acquainted with it's hybridized cousin, the Atkinson cycle 2ZR-FXE. This guy tops out at almost 40 percent thermal efficiency, and with even the best mobile inverters peaking at (maybe) 88 percent efficiency I think I'd like to get the most of of the first bottleneck, that being the engine. 

Could it be done? I've seen a few guys on YouTube throw together kind of makeshift G1 and G2 hybrid engines together but to limited success. I am not trying to use the hybrid transaxle, rather I want to probably slap an adapter plate on for electric start (since MG1 won't be present) and another adapter to hook up a 10-20?kW generator head. I will purchase a long block so that all the ECUs and wiring harnesses/ plug coils, and injectors are present but I am most concerned about the flashing of the ECU to make it work properly and efficiently as a generator. I even saw a guy claiming that it would be better to just use a custom ECU (can't remember the brand) to better control the unit. And yes, it seems it would be cheaper even going through all this trouble than actually buying a brand name Generator that isn't even liquid cooled or efficient whatsoever. Also, I don't want diesel. Its loud, and again, I live in the lower Midwest. It still gets cold enough here on occasion that fuel / oil gelling is a concern I think.. so no.

Anyway, please tell me your thoughts, product suggestions, configurations, anything! There is no rush to this, I am just trying to get an idea of what I can do / push this build to the limit.

62,What are the mechanical advantages of modern four-stroke sportbikes over old two-stroke ones?,1582385480,"A friend of mine always talks about two-stroke motorcycles being better than modern four-stroke ones due to how much quicker they tend to accelerate in comparison to four-stroke motorcycles with the same displacement. Their engines are usually more lightweight and they tend to produce more power than four-stroke engines with the same displacement. Overall, he believes that an old two-stroke sportbike under good conditions should have better lap times than the best liter bikes being produced today. But I don't really buy that. I'm sure modern bikes must have several mechanical advantages over old projects that surely could've been used as a base to make even better bikes.

Obviously, modern bikes have onboard technology that helps riders ride more safely, but he believes that being a good rider has a lot to do with skillfully riding a dangerous motorcycle. I was wondering what advantages other than onboard technology modern bikes have. From what I've seen, it seems four-stroke sportbikes tend to accelerate well even at high speeds, whereas most four-strokes I've seen seemed to be unable to accelerate as quickly at high speeds.

Another thing he always says is that two-stroke motorcycles are easier to modify so that they can produce even more power. I'm sure there are downsides to significantly increasing a motorcycle's power output, but would that make an old two-stroke sportbike capable of effectively beating modern liter bikes?",AskEngineers,False,RedditorsDoMeFavors,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f7tzp9/what_are_the_mechanical_advantages_of_modern/

69,Engineering Career Advice U.K,1582355885,"Ok so when I left school I did a mechanical Engineering course at college came out with an NVQ Level 2 in Performing Engineering Operations and a level 2 certificate in engineering. After this I got a mechanical engineering apprenticeship at a company that assembled and pneumatically tested air brakes for use on trucks and trailers. I completed the apprenticeship earning NVQ Level 3 in mechanical manufacturing engineering and level 3 diploma in engineering technology from day release at college. Unfortunately the work was pretty basic just assembly and basic pneumatic setting and testing and when I finished my apprenticeship the company only put my wage to £14000 just a bit above minimum wage at the time. I tried to find an engineering role at another company but I was lacking experience in areas like fabrication and machining and milling. I eventually found a job assembling and testing turbochargers at another company for more money but this was really more of a production operator role and was unfortunately made redundant 4 months into the job. I then worked some production operator roles as an agency worker at a couple of firms until I got a permanent job at a pharmaceutical company as a packaging technician. Although this role involves setting up, changing packing sizes and performing some basic maintenance on packaging lines 75% of the role is just running the packaging line as an operator. This job pays well £26000 plus £7000 shift allowance but its continental 12 hour shifts and not really engineering. The company has been good to me the past 5 years I have worked there as they played for me too go to college to do my HNC in mechanical engineering although this was because due to market demands the packing technicians had to be highly qualified those who werent were made redundant. I have now reached a career ceiling at this company I am at the top pay scale of my role but i cannot apply for any higher roles like maintenance engineer, working on vessels in the clean rooms or become a supervisor as all these roles require  
A university degree in an engineering or science discipline and at present the company is not offering to sponsor people for courses like the HNC I did a couple of years ago. I requested to get the time off and I would pay for myself to do a day release top up to get an engineering degree in 2 years at a college and work the time back but they said they cant spare me due to how busy they are. So I applied to another company recently
To be a packing line maintenance engineer in the interview there was an assesment showing pneumatic drawings, cam assemblies, PLC drawings etc. And I completely screwed the assesment up and it made me realise just how much my engineering knowledge was lacking suffice to say I didn't get this job. So I am wondering what to do now because I dont want to work as an operator I want to be an engineer plus I fear roles like mine as a packaging technician will fade over the next 10-15 years or so due to ever increasing automation. So I am wondering if there is any way I can gain the knowledge to be an effective engineer at another company or do I give up and maybe try to become a manufacturing supervisor or something?

I have worked for the same company for the past 5 years after interning for a year while finishing my degree. Last year I decided I needed a change, and walked into my boss's office and requested to work remotely. I was told that upper management would not allow me to stay in my current position, as there were concerns about anyone being able to satisfy the role without being tapped into the office (fair); but they would allow me to move into the field service group and go remote (only one other in the service group works remotely and he has \~30 yrs experience). I took the chance, moved to Colorado, and have not stepped into the office for over a year now. I now find myself weighing the pros and cons of my present situation.

There are so many great aspects about working from home, but also some considerable drawbacks as well. I believe I have an incredible opportunity that many people would love to have, but at the same time I have reoccurring thoughts that I should look for something more.

Working from home allows me a ton of flexibility, but it comes with a cost. Being a service engineer requires me to be on the road for \~50% of the year. I've got no significant other or pets, so the travel hasn't been too stressful on my life. My role is less technical than my previous -- less design, more troubleshooting.

Those 4 pegs which the slide-on camper is standing on connect to the camper via angle brackets. Those angle brackets bolt onto the camper.

Since my pickup truck bed's tray is wider than normal, I had to have wider angle brackets made. Regretably, the bolt holes on those wider angle brackets are off by 1mm or less.

0,What sort of bearings are suitable for the base of a gimbal?,1582306572,"Hi, I have an early concept for a vehicle mounted gimbal, and want to select a bearing to allow for precision operation of the turret. Here's a [rough diagram](https://imgur.com/a/xN32HL0) with some rough numbers below. The diameter of the turret is probably going to be over 600 mm. The entire assembly but not including the base plate should be less than 60 kg and have high stiffness to low mass, probably composite construction. The dynamic radial and axial forces should be a few hundred newtons to 1.5 kN peak including weight, inertia and wind loading. 

The central motor and rotary stage should be supplying 10 to 20 Nm of torque about the vertical drive shaft but I'm concerned about the wind loads which with some rough CFD suggest something like 4 Nm about the horizontal. What sort of bearings should be considered at the base of the turret? I'm interested in very low rotational speeds and precision positioning of the gimbal yoke.

I expect a small shaft rotary bearing next to the motor to take the lateral loads, and a large internal diameter thrust bearing (in red) to take the axial loads and to give a big arm to counter the moments from the gimbal turret structure.

Obviously on some vehicles its not a good idea at all to push towards 135mph in say a older 90s pickup truck. This is also assuming tires are rated for this. Is there any way to figure the maximum safe speed for a vehicle? Ive looked at some vehicles such as the chevy ss, runing on the camaro chassis, while the camaro chassis is rated in a camaro at 198mph, the ss is limted to 167. Obviously this also probably takes aerodynamics into question and complicates things. Ive also been looking at the new Cadillac ct6-V intial reports said its top speed was 200mph, since then it was tested to 149mph. Some may say the transmission or the engine cant handle it, but if they are built with enough power what else besides aerodynamics, engine output, and tire ratings effects the top speed of a vehicle? I imagine thats a list, so what are the major points?

* Steel hollow tubing is easily available here. An example rate I have is 4x8cm, 2mm thick, 6 meters long, for $20.
* I am thinking to switch to steel framing, then get the bug and rot resistant wood, cut into plywood-like sheets, and then use that for shear framing and the subfloor. I was planning to add insulation, then screw the bug and rot resistant directly into the framing and then put gypsum board on top for the walls, and vinyl planking on on the floor.
* If I do the steel framing, its affordable, easily available, stronger than wood, and will handle the weather and bug better than wood. It should be fine for earthquakes too if I do the shear framing.
* What do you think? Would 4x8cm be fine for framing?

Process is different in each office because the people checking jobs do their own thing, and there's no standard calling for anything consistent. Director doesn't know or care and it's been garbage for decades, although it seems to be improving albeit at a snail's pace. Biggest problem is pressure to get jobs out on time, with no accounting for issues that pop up. Even the checking time is short to satisfy project management, but since managers and supervisors do most of the checking due to the lack of senior level people to handle that responsibility, they approve jobs without actually checking them as they have multitude other responsibilities. When they do take the time to check jobs, we don't get good feedback or training and when the productivity and quality reports come out, it's all our fault they look crappy because their name isn't on the report, only the design techs.

36,How to tell if a motor shaft is spinning or not?,1582247110,"At work we have a motor that stirs a liquid, and a heater that heats the liquid.  If the motor stops spinning, either due to not power to the motor, or the shaft get caught we need the heater to turn off as it can quickly cause a fire.


We currently use a motor similar to this [one](https://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-1-70-HP-C-Frame-Motor-4M073), and only run it at max rpm.  However recently they have been failing, so now is a good time to improve the entire unit for the safety additions.

I have three thoughts on how to do this, and wanted input on peoples experiences with any of these directions.


* 1, I thought we could use a high/low current switch(s).  The current would be measured going through the motor.  If the current is too low, that means the motor isn't on, so shut off the heater.  If the current is too high, that means the motor is caught and isn't spinning, so shut off the heater.


* 2, put a gear on the shaft and use a proximity sensor (Unless there is a better thing) wired to a timer.  The timer would could down and if the proximity sensor hasn't sent any signal change then the shaft isn't spinning, so shut off the heater.

52,Latency Time for Activation Mechanisms such as spring-loaded and hydraulic cylinders,1582220724,"Hello dear engineers of Reddit,

currently I am researching on the activation/ initiation time for different mechanisms.

For instance: An airbag takes about 5 milliseconds starting from the decision of ignition already made to the start of expansion of the airbag. 

There are lots of different latency times you can measure. For instance still going with the airbag example, it takes about 10 milliseconds to make the decision (as far as I know) and then it takes about 50 milliseconds until it is completely filled with gas.

However I am most interested in the measurement of latency time starting from the decision already made until some target mass is starting to move. (eg. 5ms for Airbags starting from ignition of ignition material to the airbag starting to be filled with air, eg. for firearms a trigger being pulled to the bullet starting to accelerate, etc. … )

As far as I am informed, regarding pyrotechnical mechanisms this latency time is often referred to as ""ignition delay"". I found some measurements for different materials/ substances like dust explosions and so on.

However regarding spring-released mechanisms and different hydraulic (oil, air) cylinders I am at a loss.

Does anybody coincidentally know a good source (maybe literature or a study) regarding this topic?  
Knowing the respective names for the different systems would also be a huge help. Research is a lot easier when you know the words experts use in the respective fields. (e.g. ignition delay for pyrotechnic mechanisms)

I know this is a very specific question, I hope that I am lucky and someone who coincidentally has some information regarding this topic will answer to this post.

If there is need to clarify parts of my question/ post, please tell me.

I am looking forward to your feedback

54,High schooler looking for an internship at an electric supercar company - is this worth a try?,1582219204,"(TLDR at the bottom, but if you're looking to give advice, please read the whole thing)

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone, I'm a 2nd-year high school student (16 years old) from Croatia. I've been interested in tech and engineering for quite a while now (about 5 years), I did a ton of programming since then and recently got into electronics and more broader engineering. I understand lots of programming concepts and know \~10 programming languages (C/C++, C#, Java, JS/TS, etc.) and am learning about electronics design. In these 5 years I tried all kinds of programming, from web dev to game dev, OS/kernel dev and now embedded/firmware dev. I'm also able to program various other things and hopefully design a mostly digital PCB (currently in the process of doing that, will see how it turns out).

But I have one huge issue, I have never finished a single project. I have started literally more than a hundred of them but never truly finished any of them and just switched to a different project and forgot about the last one. Most of them are just local at the moment but I also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/nufflee/) with some of the better things I made. I'm really trying my best to change this in 2020 but we will see how that goes too.

Now, there's this really cool Croatian company called [Rimac](https://www.rimac-automobili.com/) which designs and produces electric supercars and various components for EVs in general. I learned about them a year or so ago and have been since following what they're doing and watching their YouTube videos. Since I learned about them and saw everything they're doing I immediately fell in love and my biggest dream became working there, on a real-life product, in a real-life environment with actual skilled engineers. I'm really only looking for the experience of working in such an environment, money is a nice bonus for working on my own projects and getting a lab set up but it doesn't matter a whole lot honestly.

Their HQ is relatively close to where I live and they're probably the most popular high-tech company in Croatia. I briefly looked at their website and saw that they do offer internships and have over a hundred open positions otherwise. I tried going through the intern sign up process but they are obviously requiring a CV and what not which I don't really have and I'm pretty sure that's mostly made for university students.

I reckon my next step would be to e-mail them directly and ask them about the possibility of something like this happening. I would basically include everything I said here but I'd expand more on the technical parts of it but this is getting pretty long for Reddit already. I'm posting here because I thought it would be a really good idea to ask actual engineers and possibly HR people about how they'd approach this/want this to be approached.

Is this even worth a try and would they actually get me seriously or just brush off? Sure, I don't have a ton of technical expertise or experience in this exact field but I think I have a really good starting point to learn and build on top of. I would absolutely do my best to complete whatever tasks I'd be given since I'm incredibly passionate and have been doing these things literally every signal day for 5 years and never stopped having fun and learning.

In the case it would be worth a try, does someone mind out pointing out what else I should include or exclude from what I've said here. What do I do to better show my skills and passion for this? For example, do I tell them I have a huge issue with finishing projects or will that sound too bad? I also stream programming on Twitch occasionally, is this something that would be worth mentioning? Of course it doesn't give the best example of me as a programmer or of my actual productivity but it's just more ""proof"" that I kinda know what I'm doing.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 2nd year HS (16 year old) student looking to get an internship at [Rimac](https://www.rimac-automobili.com/en/), a Croatian EV company. I've been incredibly passionate about engineering for the past 5 years but have no idea how to approach this.

1. What kind of “first principles” type questions are common in stress analysis interviews, and where can I do more reading in to this? It may be that I don’t get asked a question like this but I want to cover my bases.

79,Is this water combustion-like engine even possible ?,1582180833,"Please consider this idea and let me know if it is plausible or possible. 

Water 'combustion' engine and passive steam generator with zeolite and vegetable oil idea:

Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. You would need the vegetable oil to at least be that temperature (or higher) for this to work. 
Imagine the working principle and basic design of a combustion engine. Now imagine that the base inside the piston chamber would have a zeolite bottom that would act like a wick by soaking up hot vegetable oil from a channel below the piston cylinder. The hot vegetable oil would just wet part of the 'wick' so that the surface area of the inside of the zeolite could be utilized in the next part. Next a drop of water is dropped inside the piston cylinder and the drop falls onto the zeolite wick and due to the increased surface area and the reaction to the hot oil, the water rapidly expands into steam thus pushing the piston head up. On the upstroke the steam can be evacuated (like how the exhaust typically would in combustion engines) and used to power an auxiliary generator. A two for one deal. 
Recent research I found online shows that zeolite has the ability to store heat very well. Also zeolites unique nano cage structure and porosity, enable a massive amount of relative surface area. This process I've described is not technically combustion per se, however, it does provide the same effect since you have a way for the rapid expansion of water in a confined space.  
Heating vegetable oil to 212 degrees (and maintaining that temp) would not require that much energy and could be done via fresnel lens, or mirror reflectors of sunlight.",AskEngineers,False,StevanWhite,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f6p3dg/is_this_water_combustionlike_engine_even_possible/

I have an application I am developping right now that requires cooling a mechanical seal on over 30 mixers in different factories. The current design for flushing seals for such things in the factories I work for right now is very.. lets say rudimentary.

 Want to start the pump/mixer? Open soft water valve and dump water in the mechanical  seal and then on the floor. You can imagine the waste generated!!

My initial thought was to use a small reservoir with a pump and TIT + flow switch to ensure proper recirculation inside the seal to avoid running without lubrication but this is a lot of additional cost in both hardware, software, maintenance and spare parts compared to a passive thermosiphon.

I was thinking of using a standard thermosiphon unit for future cooling on mechanical seals like this one: https://www.huhnseal.com/products/1781/support-system

My main question about those passive systems is about reliability. What are the main points of failure to expect? Typical maintenance I assume will include flush and repriming once in a while.

How can I garantee proper monitoring of the flow through the seal to preserve the mechanical seal incase the system isn't working? My guess is a flowswitch won't work.

23,[Help] Sizing motor and other considerations for automated/motorized vertical blinds,1582130246,"Hello, as indicate by my title I'm not an engineer. I'm a hobbyist trying to identify an appropriately sized motor at a minimal cost. The project is to open and close the vertical blinds in my living room. My plan is to use an arduino based board such as a NodeMCU to control the motor, I'm thinking of going with a BLDC motor similar to if not the item linked below, with a belt/pulley system to move a 3D printed gantry along the length of the rail that houses the blinds. I would use end stop micro switches at either end to limit the travel, I really only need them in the opened or closed position, plus this allows me to save on the motor, not needing a more expensive stepper or servo motor which could theoretically offer partially open blinds. I'll still need a stepper/servo motor to rotate the handle on the blinds that rotates the vertical pieces to open or closed positions as I dont believe it is meant to travel in the closed position. 

My main question at the moment is how to determine the size of the motor necessary. I'm thinking of getting a cheap luggage scale off ebay and measuring the force to pull the blinds in either direction. But I'm not sure if the pulley/belt system would require more or less force. 

Is there anything I'm overlooking? Again, I am very new to this sort of thing, I've followed tutorials and the like before, but I've never actually tried to design my own project, at least not anything remotely as complicated as this.

24,Is there a thermal efficiency benefit to not using a charge air cooler in turbocharged diesel engines?,1582129933,"My understanding is that charge air coolers or intercoolers are used in Otto cycles to avoid auto-ignition of the fuel-air mixture during the compression stage. Since the Diesel cycle takes in air only (and injects fuel later), it can be compressed to higher pressures and temperatures without this concern.

I'm interested in understanding the benefit (thermal efficiency-wise) of using vs not using a charge air cooler. Just looking at a P-V [diagram](https://www.mechanicalbooster.com/2017/10/diesel-cycle.html) of the diesel cycle, I can see that adding an additional isentropic compression step with constant volume heat rejection would add area under the curve and increase the amount of work done. If I don't use a charge air cooler, then I would just have an additional compression step with no additional area under the curve, right?

Can someone explain the benefit of using a turbocharger without using a charge air cooler?

As engineers, I believe that personal growth, getting challenged mentally &amp; having a positive impact on society are important needs for us. But after working some years in the corporate world, these needs might be far from being fulfilled because:

3. Reactive management forces us to deliver fast results on the short-term, instead of creative &amp; innovative work that is good on the long term

I will be finishing in April and I will have 2500/7200 apprenticeship hours towards my certificate. I have taken an interest in robotics which led me to a program at my local college called Computer Engineering Technology-Mechatronics. The program has some coding classes such as Java and C then drifts towards the electricity and robotic system classes in the later semesters. The program goes very in-depth into PLC's too.

The program also bridges with a local University, I plan on going for my bachelors in technology for power of software engineering. The course coordinator told me I can get my millwright apprenticeship hours during the mechatronics co-op but I will need to gain experience in both fields. I also have to find my own co-op because the co-ops they offer will not give me millwright experience.

Would possessing a millwright certificate as well as a bachelors in technology (mechatronics) be beneficial for me. I would like to work for a company that can utilize both skills?

71,When did you know it was time to go work somewhere else or do something different?,1582065621,"This question is really geared more towards the experienced engineers and not new graduates. I'm about 5 years into my career as a mechanical engineer and thinking about making a change into something different (PM, Sales, Software, or engineer at Bigger Company ect.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a small OEM company and I'm getting a little tired of having to do not only my job but a little bit of everyone else's job as well. Whether it's sales, service, purchasing, product management, manufacturing I'm constantly having to put out fires for them when it's not really my responsibility. I get it that at a small company I'm supposed to wear ""many hats"" but usually that only applies when there isn't someone to fill those other positions. We have people that are supposed to be doing those jobs but most of them are from recent turnover, new hires for new position openings, or just plain lazy long-term employees that push their workload onto someone else. It's starting to impact my own deadlines when I have to stop what I'm doing to handle someone's emergency. I've started pushing back on these requests while keeping my boss in the loop on what I'm doing. But my boss is the kind of person that says ""Yes"" to everything without really giving it much thought and burning himself at both ends to make everyone happy. I am not that kind of person and he gets where I'm coming from but at the same time kind of expects me to follow in his footsteps without really definitively telling me to bend over backwards for everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been mulling over doing something different for the past six months, looking at job postings, reading about other career paths, and have a few phone interviews lined up. Just not sure if I'm going to be experiencing more of them same if I go elsewhere. It's been hard to find this stuff out in the interview/research process tactfully.

72,Can We Build Levitating Shoes And Sell Them To Consumers? How Can We Best Engineer Such A Shoe?,1582065577," I would like to ask you the Reddit community a fairly eccentric question that I have had trouble finding much information on. Any information at all would be very much appreciated! 🙂

**Question:**

**Is it possible to build levitating shoes that can be genuinely sold to consumers? Understandably, this won't be easy if it is possible. One such way that we can induce levitation is through 'magnetic levitation' or 'maglev'. Although this is a powerful way to make someone float, the only downside is that the individual would have to be walking above a magnetic surface at all times to be able to float. This is where the crux of my question comes in - is there any way that we could engineer this shoe such that a person wearing it would not have to walk on a magnetic surface? For instance, is there another way we could attach the magnets to the shoe, or another way we can design the shoe? Or is this just not plausible? Perhaps you have some other levitation methods that I could consider?**

My original thought was yes, it would be a noticeable change, but wouldn’t necessarily make the ice melt “quickly.” I’m thinking that having the entire outside surface of the bottle wetted with condensation lowers the amount of heat transfer occurring — so wiping the surface dry would allow more heat to directly warm the plastic and then the ice rather than the water on the outside of it.

I graduated in september 2019 and so far I applyed for hundreds of jobs positions, with a 0% interview rate. There are still too many experienced professional unemployed, so even entry level positions ask for too much experience, raising the entry bar for recent graduates.

Another potential issue would be if I would be able to “make it” in the real world and earn more than I would be able to if I had pursued the PhD. Then again, it is easy to say that I’ll be able to earn more money but I might not even be considered for those opportunities.

DIY Ground Penetrating Radar / Underground rock detection"" .

This caught my eye as it seems similar to a problem I have been trying to solve. I would like to be able to detect rocks which might damage equipment or create an unstable surface for animals. In a given year we might cross several thousand acres of pasture with equipment moving at between 5 and 15 miles per hour.

Ideally we would be able to capture location and approximate size of rocks while driving across the fields as part of other operations. Alternatively we have thought about  the possibility of devising a drone mounted device.

The near surface is relevant as frost will push any rocks near the surface onto the surface within a few winters. Once pushed up they will damage equipment in a future year.

I have looked into machine learning/image recognition for surface rocks as well as looked for cost effective ""radar"" related systems. So far I have not ""tripped"" across a technology I can leverage from other industries which seems to be able to do this sort of ""high speed"" detection.

I’m a senior in college in the US finishing up my BS in civil engineering, and I’m currently taking a class which explores the differences in engineering practices and culture in different countries across the world. This has made me curious about the personal experiences of practicing engineers who were born, educated, and have worked outside the US, so I came up with a set of questions I’m interested in finding personal answers to. I’ve considered emailing a few former colleagues but I thought putting this out on a public forum could give other people the opportunity to gain some international perspective on our industry as well. Im not looking for any specific country of birth other than not the United States. If for any reason anyone wants to answer but not publicly, you can always PM me. Thanks!

65,Why aren't even firing orders always the best option for internal combustion engines?,1581952997,"I'm sure I understand the idea here, but my father doesn't. I've tried explaining it to him, but he always says that it doesn't make sense to him. He says that, for instance, a twin-cylinder engine should be more effective and balanced with an 180° angle, just like a bicycle crankset. He believes that any other firing order would be less effective because there's a bigger gap between the moment when each cylinder fires, and that a perfectly even firing order has the smallest gap. He says that inline 3-cylinder engines are naturally balanced and that they should be the smoothest engines of all due to them ""necessarily"" having an even firing order, but I don't think things work that way. Surely cylinder count and the way cylinders are arranged should not be all there is to it.

I believe that engine proportions (bore and stroke) have a lot to do with this. Depending on the engine's dimensions, a certain firing order will burn fuel more efficiently. The crossplane crankshaft design used by Yamaha is meant to reduce inertia torque, and it seems to really work more efficiently than their previous inline-4 design. But my father thinks this should generate more vibration and should be less efficient at generating power.

How do I explain this to him? Am I right in saying that sometimes, depending on the bore and stroke, the fuel won't be burned properly in an evenly-arranged engine, and that an uneven firing order will produce more power with less fuel?

This is related to my uni work so I'm not looking for outright answers so much as support and/or direction.

I'm asked to find the value of t (in seconds) that the velocity becomes zero.

The original equation for displacement relating to time is x(t) = e\^(-kt)\*cos(2\*pi\*f\*t)

To find the velocity at a given point I understand to be the first derivative of the above equation. I have:

v(t) = -e\^(-kt)\*(k\*cos(2\*pi\*f\*t) + 2\*pi\*f\*sin(2\*pi\*f\*t))

In terms of calculating I don't have issues with f or k (in this scenaria f = 3 Hz and k = 0.7s\^-1) but I am struggling to approach this.

If I'm looking at this correctly I am trying to calculate the following:

0 (i.e. where there is no more velocity) = -e\^(-kt)\*(k\*cos(2\*pi\*f\*t) + 2\*pi\*f\*sin(2\*pi\*f\*t))

Depending on the CPU arch, whether it is strong or weak ordering, when involving multiple threads or cores in a multi-processor system, the results you get from a sequence of instructions generated from software can be non-deterministic based on race conditions.

Classic example is like:

    A = 1; 
    print B;

    Thread 2: 
    B = 1;

3). Is there any way to get the version number out of the description in the BOM?

I'm thinking of either making the head and tail pulleys crowned to try and take out of the wasted time tracking belts. I've also been reading about v-belt guided systems. Do all the rollers on v-guided systems need to be groved, or only the head and tail pulleys? To me it seems like the best solution is a v-belt because the rolls can be slightly mis-aligned and the belt will still track okay.

Any advice here would help!",AskEngineers,False,jubulexx,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f4vkgz/conveyor_belt_tracking_issues/

2,Let's talk about QC,1581874514,"I've been looking for a SW job since I graduated with my bachelors in 2018. It took so long that I actually just sold my house and used the equity to go to grad school in my target country (UK) so I could meet people and try to find work. Hundreds of applications later, I finally applied for what I had been told time and again is an engineer's worst career path: quality assurance. I definitely didn't like the idea that I wouldn't be creating anything, just making sure other engineers didn't cut corners. On top of that, it's basically just reviewing documents and filling out checklists, which sounds pretty boring, right? I finally started two weeks ago and I have to say, I'm really happy so far. Part of it is that my team does have a really good dynamic and my manager is very much like I would want to be as a manager myself, plus the senior engineers are really good about teaching me what they know. They even sat me down a week into the job and asked me about all the tools and resources that I have available and if there was anything I would find useful so far. Well, any engineering team can have a great dynamic like that and I'm we all have different balances of ""friendly work environment"" vs ""engaging my creative side / solving problems"" in terms of how we might sacrifice one a little for the other, so from here on, I will just address the work itself. For context, it's in aerospace and there is a little bit of defense (though I can't really see most of that because I might be a spy or something, lol) and a bit of civil. If I were in development, I would be given some coding conventions to learn, some company specific best practises for formatting, some catching up on whatever project I'm on, and I would be working away in probably 3-6 months. I would basically just look at the requirements, implement them, then have someone test them (we don't mix test and dev). Also, even though embedded systems is a step toward hardware, it's still predominantly software. Over here in QC, however, the audit process for hardware and software is quite similar. Because of that, I am getting lateral training on hardware right out of the gate (I've built an industrial IIOT device simulating a piece of factory equipment as a FSM from scratch, so don't freak out if you're hardware and worried this is too big a jump). This not only opens up my options WRT career path, it also addresses several concerns I had about software engineering in the first place. First of all, I don't want to fall out of shape by sitting in front of an IDE for 7 of the 8 hours a day I work (overtime is rare over here). With QA, I could probably do a software audit remotely, but hardware, nope, gotta go walk around and take a look at shit. I don't really like sitting in one place too long, even if it's my couch, so this is a huge bonus for me. Speaking of bonuses, my manager said this training will be incredibly useful when it comes time to calculate a raise. I didn't even have to bring it up. My other concern is that a good way to get laid off as an engineer is to get too specialized in a specific area of your field only to find out that the field itself has been rendered obsolete by matters out of your hands and you're now too expensive to go back to non-specialized engineering. Spreading myself out like this makes me a lot more useful and a lot more likely to survive layoffs; and even after one, I'll be a lot more hireable. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, but I thought that it would be good to bring up QA since it's not really the sexiest job in the business but it's definitely not the boring dead end it gets made out to be. (I know it could be argued that 2 weeks is not enough to say this, but I actually have been working for a QA-esque consultant company since 2010, I just wasn't doing engineering work and I wasn't sure whether or not the consultant nature of the business made it better.)",AskEngineers,False,CraptainHammer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f4txej/lets_talk_about_qc/

But I had many gaps in my resume from being unemployed, having difficulty getting a job, traveling abroad, teaching HS kids for a few months, etc. Even now I don't get many recruiters contacting me on linkedin

In my current role, it's 100% work remotely, but I have to stay in the US. I've mostly worked on image processing with Matlab, but have also worked with C++ a little, along with Python for deep learning. The upcoming project I'll work on will involve alot of parallel computing.

    The job is good in terms of being allowed to work from home, the work is challenging enough but not too stressful, etc.

I am planning to pursue an engineering undergrad in college and one of my problems is where to? As i scoured the internet for information, i came across abet. This topic is new to me and i became confused and bothered as i read more information about it here on reddit and other websites. I still have little knowledge regarding it so i hope that someone could help me understand.

Let me first clarify that i reside in a certain country in Asia. I am planning to work and look for job opportunities abroad when i graduate. This is beacuse engineers in my country are absolutely underpaid. Imagine working as an engineer who only earns around $6-7k annually and some even lower lol. While in the US, the starting salary for engineers is around $50k.

Is abet accreditation really an important factor in choosing an engineering undergrad? Could someone kindly enlighten me as to what is it about? Would it affect my employment in other countries? How about my future career? I read that in the US, one cannot get a PE license if your engineering undergrad isn't abet accredited. What about in other countries besides the US? Like in Canada, Australia, UK, etc. Is abet recognized world-wide? Also, what is the Washington accord? I read that it is an international agreement which also accredits engineering degree programs.

There are only a few institutions offering engineering programs which are abet accredited here in my country. As of now, out of 500+ colleges, only 8 are abet accredited as stated by the abet website. But as far as i know, some are currently working on it and i guess that number would rise up to around 20 in the near future. What if for example i graduated from a non-abet school and after that, it became abet accredited. Will my degree also become accredited?

I swear to you I have never charged it. Never. it still has a full charge after four and a half years and a handful of uses. I press the button on it, and it says the battery is completely full. Plug my phone in and it will charge. so how is it that there's a $20 battery on Amazon that can last four and a half years without even ever needing to charge it.

Right now, I am working to send them to some developmental courses to help fill these gaps as well. Overall with the new guys, I am facing 2 major problems.

1. They are clearly skimming materials and are not taking the time to try to comprehend.  Ex. Asking for more material to read 1 day after being given approximately 400 pages of technical material regarding a topic I know they are not familiar with (specifics of aerospace design).

2. Over confidence. Ex. I brought them to a final project review meeting with the head of engineer (2 levels of management up) so they could get a feel for what the process is like.  Despite some discussion before hand, they spoke up with their opinions regarding the project during the final review with management.

Reasons why I don't want to take it:

* Although I find CFD very interesting, I don't think it's something I purely want to do for a year. I'd worry it'd get monotonous
* I don't really fancy sitting in front of a computer for a year, I'd prefer to have something with at least a little bit of variety
* When I leave university I want to go into more of a design role where I'd be designing actual devices/systems, ideally within the aerospace sector. I'm not sure how well this internship would align with this goal

Reasons why it might be good:

* I might not get another internship offer, and I would hate it if I turned this offer down to not receive another one. However, I am on a 1st (I think this is equivalent to a 4.0gpa) and I have good experience from a previous summer internship and student engineering teams.

As part of my studies I did a year long co-op at a large orthopaedic multinational. After graduation I have been travelling all over the world doing odd jobs. (Always wanted to do some travelling after uni). 


Now I'm in Canada, and trying to get my first engineering job. I've been here since October and had been job searching while working getting two phone interviews that lead to nothing.

However after two months full time job searching and months prior to that, and have barely anything to show for it. Back home I have contacts in good companies and if I'm completely beaten I can go back and do my masters (1 year).

48,How I became an embedded systems engineer and why I started questioning this field?,1581756863,"I am an Embedded Systems engineer from India with formal degree of Electronics and Communications.

My story in short -   
Got inspired after attending a Line Follower Robot workshop in first semester. Joined a crash course on Embedded Systems afterwards. Started making simple projects like gesture controlled Robot, LED chaser, etc. Then I started trying register level programming. But then because I was not able to find any reason/a good project, so I got distracted or disinterested in this and kinda wasted my college time. Got Internship in a startup that works in Embedded system domain in my last semester of college. There I got exposure how to make actual working prototypes. Learned how to Google open source codes and hardware and use them, get knowledge/exposure with actual electronics and how to make your own hardware which I think no college in India can tell you. Then I started my Full time in another startup which also works in the same field. There my main work is to make firmware for a lot different types of prototypes and products. But in this startup I didn't get any exposure to core hardware projects because they are not into core hardware. 

My concern -   
This company is into how they can scale their products faster. Just like how software scalability these days have become so easy because of all these tools, frameworks, new languages that you can learn in no time. (Not a software guy so do not know much about it but that's the summary on software side I suppose). Hardware is also becoming similar in that way. Not only there are so many libraries of hardware interfacing on Github and other platforms, hardware itself have become so modular that you can find modules which need no programming and  that can be used right away. You just need to read the analog/digital input and you are good to go. Now I am not anti about this rapid change in how embedded system have changes so much in past 5-6 years or so. But I am starting to think that you don't need to have much knowledge about it and anybody can be trained to do this work. So what I am doing? Should I be changing my field of work? But I don't know any other options since I am not exposed to any other fields.  I am always a practical person so I hated all that theoretical knowledge they teach us in college and so I choose this field. But now I am kinda tired of learning things myself. But at the same time I know that learning by own is the best way. But still I want to work in an environment which have streamlined protocols and so that I can learn them and try to implement on my own personal projects. That way learning will be faster then try to learn by hit and trial. Learning on own is taking too much time that I thought at the start. Plus there is a growing family pressure about earnings and all.

But I do hear this has some value in experience. I do here constant advocating for these positions, but definitely not on where to get yourself into one of these roles

Try really really hard to find whatever low paying start-up job as an entry level engineer, even these seem ruthlessly competitive though.  In theory, a company might be more likely to hire me as an ""intern"" based on cost-risk alone, but post-graduation internships to degree-in-progress internships seem to be available at somewhere at like a 1:250 ratio.

Would 3/8"" ID tubing be too small, and how much flow loss should I expect?  Would I be better off using to reducers and using 1/2"" line to get rid of some flow restriction?

84,Optimizing Fluidmechanics for a two and a half-dimensional application with colour- / materialtransition,1581675925,"Hello everybody

I am looking for help in optimizing a slip casting process.

I am a ceramic engineer in R&amp;D and am developing a 2 material casting process. Ceramic pastes are cast. 2 materials with different properties. A cylinder (approx. 100 mm diameter x 20 mm height) is to be produced which is cast from 100% material A to a dynamic mixing range up to 100% material B. The transition must be smooth and even in the X-Y plane. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have already tried a few things, but fail 1. because of the even application in the X-Y plane and 2. because of the dynamic mixing area (which is the simpler problem).

&amp;#x200B;

Are there already solutions in the industry that allow an even application of pastes (approx. 2000 mPas) on a surface (such as a shower head-like nozzle, which has the same length in each channel to allow the same material flow)?

Or are there simpler ways to relaunch this project?

It is very important to me that the ideas I implement are rooted in scientific fact. The resolution revolves around a song being played loudly enough to carry a short distance across a village and over a forest. This idea also involves a prototype contraption, that is built into the basement of a church, in order for the acoustics to aid in amplifying the sound that it creates. 

My question is, how attainable would that feat be if the church was built up on a hill that overlooked the village and forest? What sort of materials would aid in the amplifying of that music, and how far could it reasonably travel? 

The church would not of been constructed with this purpose in mind. 

If anyone could explain, and or point me in the direction of materials that can help with this project, I would appreciate it immensely. 

Is this possible in a tiny wooden chapel? I would assume not.   

Perhaps a building constructed of stone? If so, what stone would be more effective?

I know that the high ceilings of the more elaborate builds aid in the acoustics of any sound emitted within it, but do those materials also insulate the sound from carrying outwards?

96,"Using an old satellite dish, with a car radar detector, to spot airborne radar mapping drones",1581640525,"I have heard that the Colorado mystery drones trigger radar detectors.  I'm interested in looking in to the mystery, maybe finding out if they are really doing something. I thought of using  an old satellite dish (37"" x 28"" oval, solid steel sheet metal from Hughesnet),  to increase the likelihood of receiving airborne mapping radar from the drones (if present) with a police band radar detector (Valentine 1, aka V1 ). 

Three questions on using this dish with a radar detector:

how critical is location of the receiver in front of the dish,

and how critical is aiming the dish,

and is there anything else I should address to improve my chances of picking up a signal?

I'm not looking to hack or crack the signal, just get a yes/no answer to ""is there a radar signal from the drone?"" I.e., drone appears/point the dish at the drone, get alarm; point away, alarm decreases; drone leaves, signal disappears. 

So to test if I could get anywhere with this idea, I brought the dish in the house, took the dish to the farthest part of the house away from the WiFi router, pointed the dish at the router, and looked at the WiFi reception icon on my phone. 

Holding the phone in any orientation, in various places roughly 2-3 feet in front of  the center of the dish  I get two bars of WiFi, and 4 feet away to the side  I get one or none, so it works, I think. It seems as though the area is pretty big in front of the dish with better signal. It seems that  location of the receiver relative to the exact focal point of the reflector is not very critical, although my feedback (bars of WiFi signal on my phone screen) is not very precise.

It appears the LNB arm just gets the LNB roughly in the middle of the general area of concentrated energy from the parabolic reflector.  So it looks to be different from, for example, a frying pan  in front of a parabolic reflector for solar cooking or a microphone, which I think both have to be pretty close to the focal point for best results.

I was hoping it would go from one bar to  4 bars reliably but it never went to 3 bars. Still, I did get a noticeable effect.

Is there anything I can do to this dish to increase the signal to a radio receiver (cell phone, radar detector) placed near it ?  

Is aiming the dish critical when the transmitter is only 50' or 500' away ?  I can see how aim would have to be pinpoint accurate if  the mapping drone was in orbit around the planet but it's closer than that.

How accurate does aim have to be to give any results at all in this scenario?

0,"Looking for a compact, very fast, electronic actuator for DRS system.",1581639368,"Hello everyone

I am currently looking for a very specific electronic actuator, for a DRS (Drag Reduction System).

For the ones not in the racecar loop: It´s essentially a system, that moves the upper plane of a rear wing to reduce drag on the straights. This is usually done with hydraulic actuators. For various reasons, i need to do it with a electronic actuator.

For the current Idea I am trying to realize, I do not only want to push down the plane, but also be able to raise it under breaking. This would require a linear actuator to be in an idle ""middle"" position and then be able extend and retract the rod to either raise or lower the flap. 

This would have to happen as fast as possible and the actuator would have to be able to resist quite a bit of force exerted on it by the air passing over it, without moving the position of the flap unintentionally. Nothing too crazy, though, maybe talking around 20N. I have found industrial actuators that would be fast enough, but all of them are way too big and exert unecesserily much force for my application.

For packaging reasons it would have to be quite compact as well.

I know I am sort of asking for the Jack of all Trades here, but maybe you guys can recommend me some parts or manufacturers that would have/manufacture what I am looking for.",AskEngineers,False,leandersieben,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f3jn2a/looking_for_a_compact_very_fast_electronic/

2,"Is an Associate’s in Engineering a viable option, while I finish my Bachelor’s?",1581636069,"Hello everyone.  I came here because reddit is a great place for some advice and I am in need of some right now.  Anything and everything is appreciated.  

So I am mid-30s, military veteran, using my GI Bill to do an online Bachelor’s engineering degree.  I am happily married, 3 kids, own a house, the works.  I have a very successful career (80k +) in a field that works parallel with engineers in a production environment, so my degree pursuit will benefit my career and open up opportunities. 

However, the reason I’m here, is that of recent, I am finding myself tragically overwhelmed with the burdens of life, work and school.  I have the option to take an associates in engineering that is offered and then continue my pursuit of a bachelor’s at a slower pace, but I can’t seem to find much value in that option.  I was wondering if there are opportunities for such levels of education that would be available to me while I slow down my pursuit of higher learning and focus on my life a little bit.  My ultimate breaking point has been lately where I’m starting to question my mental health. My job, my school, and my family life have me severely sleep deprived. I want my kids to at least have a father while they are still in a stage that is of vital development to our relationship.  

Some background about me:

I have 15+ years of technical and maintenance experience and am halfway done with my bachelor’s.  My career has steady growth and many would consider it a great field to be in with a great company.

3,I'm a new engineer. I'm addicted to learning better ways to do things and it's making me slow. I need an outside perspective.,1581635692,"I've been an engineer for 6 months now. For the first few months, I was mostly doing paperwork stuff and creating documents. I was eventually given a much more open-ended and math-heavy assignment. I started learning some software to help with it, and before I knew it I was lost in lala land learning about all the new things I could do with this program. It was like a whole new endless world had opened up. I became obsessed. I started spending my nights and weekends learning this software and trying different approaches at this problem, as well as going off on less directly-related tangents just to experiment with features that I thought were interesting. I would get back to working directly on the problem, but before long I would discover a better way to solve it and I'd start all over with a new technique. I just can't stand doing something one way when I know there's a better way to do it. I told my manager what I was doing and about all the useful things I had learned and he seemed really interested and impressed. Eventually, though, he started to emphasize that I really needed to finish the assignment. I still wanted to keep learning and doing things my way, so I've started spending even more time on it at home and even going some nights without sleep so I can devote more time to it. It still isn't enough time though. The days and the weeks just fly by. I'm still taking forever on this thing despite literally spending between 80 and 100 hours a week working on it and learning new things. I also have another project i'm working on that was given to me by someone other than my manager, and I'm in the same situation with that one learning the features of a different program. This has been going on for 2 months and I can't stop. I don't want to stop. I thoroughly enjoy every second of it and I don't feel even close to being burned out. It just feels like I'm playing video games all day. This is just how I want to spend all of my time.

I feel certain that what I'm doing is worth my time in the long run. I can do so much more than I could when I started on this and people continue to be impressed by what I'm learning how to do, but I'm aware that I'm doing the right thing at the wrong time and I really need to just get these projects done. I am making progress on them, though. I feel like I'm close to wrapping them up, but I've felt that way the entire time and it's like I walk into work Monday morning and sit down for two hours and suddenly it's Friday evening.

It is to have very good accuracy and repeatability (on the order of a few tens of µrad or better). Output speed need be no more than about 0.5 rad/s peak. The whole actuation system should have a mass less than say 8 kg. It's got to resist various axial and lateral loads (say 500 and 200 N) and operate in ambient down to say -40°C / °F. The peak output torque I think is upto about 2 Nm. Power budget is limited at about 100 W peak or a few watts in normal operation.

My current thoughts are as follows:

- DC brushless motor and optical rotary encoder.
- Worm gear about 100:1 connected to a rotary stage resisting loads.
- Motor driver and slipring.
- Consult textbooks and websites for design rules and get suggestions from suppliers.

Ideally we would be able to capture location and approximate size while driving across the fields as part of other operations. Alternatively we have thought about drone mounted devices.

The near surface is relevant as frost will push rocks near the surface up and thus damage equipment in a future year.

I have looked into machine learning/image recognition for surface rocks as well as looked for cost effective ""radar"" related systems. So far I have not ""tripped"" across a technology I can leverage from other industries which seems to be able to do this sort of ""high speed"" detection. Given how small the need/market is for this I want to come up with a low cost, maintainable, system built from readily available parts and technologies.

39,Would I be hurting my career if I don’t participate in my schools internship program?,1581609975,"Here’s a little background:
I’m 26 and nearing the end of my second year. My GPA is 3.6 accum and I feel I’ll have no problem graduating with at least a 3.5. I work 30 hours a week as a forklift operator and have for about 3.5 years, but have worked other jobs and have a good work history. Non related to engineering however.
I live with my girlfriend of 3 years and I really want to ask her to marry me and begin to live life a bit. But as most of you know, most of my days consist of minimal sleep and close to no free time with my work and school schedule.

So here’s the long version of the question:

Would I be doing myself a disservice by opting out of the universities two, 6 month long, paid internship program, where working under a PE is guaranteed?

Durning these 6 month periods I would not be attending classes, setting graduation back a year.

My plan as of now is to participate in the program as I want to become a PE and the one year total internship time counts as experience towards that. So my overall timeline doesn’t really get affected. But, how realistic is it for a student to get an internship that isn’t affiliated with the school? I’d rather do that and continue to attend classes. Graduating in 2 years is a lot more appealing than 3 years currently.

40,Torn between 2 placement offers(UK),1581609757,"I have very recently received 2 placement (1year in industry) offers from very different companies and am very torn over which to choose.

The first company is a reasonably large aerospace company that create embedded hardware for military applications, working as a Design Assurance Engineer.

The second is a smaller company that create fire detectors, working as a mechanical design engineer.


I very much enjoy the design aspect of engineering, and have become proficient in Solidworks through University studies and our Universities FORMULA student team. However, I feel like I should take the opportunity to experience Design Assurance, and the broader experience that it might give me in an industry (Aerospace) that I hope to move in to. I have seen a lot of threads on Reddit warning against Quality Assurance roles, warning people they may be limiting their future opportunities by going down this route. I feel like I would definitely switch to a design role for a graduate position, but am not sure if I would be missing out on additional engineering experience by going straight into design for my year in Industry.

The job of our team was to analyze requests for uncommon or special motor designs that could not be bought off the shelf, determine if it was viable, and then provide a quote with price and lead time.

If a scope was provided with the quote request, then it was our job to read every line that was applicable to motors and make sure that what we were offering met their requirements. However, in our quotes we always had an exceptions/clarifications section where we would state all of the specifications and requirements that this motor was not going to meet or what we may have been offering instead. This is also where any assumptions that we considered would be listed.

We worked with the understanding that if a scope was provided, then anything we did not mention as an exception would be assumed to be met by our quote and it was considered a binding agreement.

With all that said, I now work as a Project Engineer on the maintenance team at a manufacturing plant. I am finding that it is a battle to get contractors or OEM's to practice this on quotes.

In fact, silver defines conductivity - all other metals are compared against it. Because of this property, and because it doesn't spark easily, silver is commonly used in electrical circuits and contacts.


Silver is listed as the highest in conductivity... Because it doesn't spark easily. This is where I'm completely lost. If something is a good conductor of electricity, why doesn't it spark easily? In my simple mind I think hey it is the best conductor of electricity that thing must spark like hell!! But nope. It Sparks the least. But the most resistive metals like Mercury...

I am a non-traditional student going back for a degree in NAME (Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering) at 42. The really odd part however is that before coming back to school I have spent the last 13 years practicing as a lawyer. Eventually I realized how much I hated it, and decided to go back to school for my real interest. So now I am back as a sophomore with a BGS and a JD, and an basically restarting my career. 

There are a couple of questions I have. Does anyone have a suggestion of how to deal with this on my resume? Adding a lot of legal work that isn’t relevant to work as a NA seems silly, but at the same time it isn’t like I can just ignore it. 

The second  is that I keep getting offers from HR to slot into their legal department, which I really don’t want to do. How do I gently let them know that while I am not opposed to reading standards as relates to being a NA, I have no interest in becoming a discount attorney in an internship position. If I wanted a job in their legal department I would have applied for the six figure attorney position not the internship job. So far I have just let them know that while I appreciate being considered for those positions I am not interested in continuing my legal career and only want to be considered for engineering internship positions. 

Finally. I am sitting at a 4.0 GPA in the NAME degree, have a commercial captains license, and used to work off shore. I have enough maritime experience my department has let me skip a number of intro classes and basically put down ‘life experience’ instead.

85,Software engineer to industrial or mechanical engineer? Career change.,1581546690,"I am a software engineer of about 5-6 years. I have a bachelor's degree for this and am good at my job. However, I have an intense interest in the construction and workings of large machinery. Recently it is blast furnaces, steam engines, and boilers, but before I have been interested in refineries. 

I like to read about different iterations of machines, such as the different types of boilers, which ones worked, what didn't, and what is in use today. Information and diagrams for older machines are difficult to find but I enjoy looking, it is like unearthing the past and I can see how modern machines have built on principles from earlier ones.

Part of this interest means researching how these machines work, but also creating detailed 3D models of them, texturing the models, and porting them into a game engine to play around with and simulate.

I am unhappy in my current job and it occurred to me that maybe, I could find a different career that roughly fits my interest pattern. I don't know what it would be called, though, or if such a job exists. What I want is to participate in the research and design of large mechanical systems for industrial purposes. 

 Is that an industrial engineer? mechanical engineer? Maybe a bit of both? I am interested in how different machines work together within a facility, but also the details of individual machines on a physical level. I am not intimidated by physics anymore, I have been learning a lot in my spare time, and am actually starved of resources. 

I know from my research that most of the stuff I am interested in no longer exists in my country, (America), but I feel such a strong inclination I feel like I have to try. 

I've always been interested in this stuff, even since I was a kid, but I chose my career path because it was something I was good at, and I was told so many good things about the software field. I think now, 5 years after graduating, maybe I can go back and actually do what I'm interested in.

86,RF Engineer at a Defense Contractor. Feel like a fraud.,1581546485,"I got my ECE degree in 2018, and my focus in school was DSP. I found out too late that I disliked the discipline, and managed to get an internship in RF at a large defense contractor. A lot of the more senior engineers assured me that I'd be able to learn what I needed on the job, but I have found this to be untrue in my case. Opportunities for mentoring kept getting pulled out from under me, and I ended up switching to a different group within the same company (partially because of the toxic nature of the group--i was among several who left). While the culture of my new group is better, I am now stuck in a test role.

I've wondered if the problem is just my company, and if I should try RF engineering elsewhere. But honestly I don't feel competent enough to get a job anywhere else. I can't answer in-depth questions about whether you should use a shunt capacitor in a design. I can characterize amplifiers and I know my way around various test equipment, but in general I feel like a technician could do what I do. 

I've considered leaving engineering altogether, and going into patent law, but given my age and other external circumstances I don't think law school is a viable route for me. I know I'm still early in my career and could theoretically switch industries, but I don't know what that would mean, or require. I know I'm not confident in my ability as an electrical engineer, in general. My programming skills are elementary, at best, and I feel like I've forgotten a lot of my basics about electrical engineering. I'm doing my best to refresh some of these skills on my own time, but it's slow going, because I've always had a hard time getting these concepts to stick. I feel hopeless.

89,How to calculate meniscus volume (fluid dynamics),1581543506,"Problem: I am trying to build a model system replicating the interaction between bees wax and stored honey within a single honey bee cell (like on a honey comb). In other words, I am interested in understanding the interaction between wax and the stored contents of the cell. I have a system that replicates the surface area of wax in contact with the contents of the cell so that is not an issue. The current system works by melting a known amount(and thus volume) of wax at the bottom of plastic wells.

Issue:   In this model I need to be able to know the average height (thickness) of the wax in the bottom of my plastic well in order to replicate the thickness of a wax cell wall in a honey comb. I did my volume (of wax) calculation buy taking a proportion of the total volume relative to the total height of the well vs. the needed thickness of a wax comb. 

Plastic cell height= 19mm                

Wax thickness in the wild= .03mm

Therefore I needed 1.58% (.03/19) of the total volume to be filled with wax, which was easy to calculate... but...

The meniscus fucked everything up. The wax did not melt evenly in the cell. I found the paper below which has a formula and I was able to find some of the needed values such as the surface tension and density of beeswax but am at a loss for calculating contact angle. 

I just need to figure out a way to have a layer of wax with a thickness of .03mm at the bottom of the well . I know this is super specific but any guidance would be super helpful in developing this.

So, I worked in a lab freshman through sophomore year. Did a clinical engineering internship last semester. Also switched labs last semester to do research way outside my major after being recommended by a prof. Thought I’d be working at least sort of my own project, which is the reason I switched labs, but the first year I was going to work with dropped out, so now I’m working on a study that is already well in the works. I am considering accepting an industry internship over the summer, so obviously I wouldn’t be able to continue my current research over the summer. 

Today, the prof who recommended me for current lab position told me they wouldn’t be able to be a recommender for me if I take the industry internship since I’d be leaving the lab after about 6 months. They also said that job hopping looks bad on a resume but would this count as job hopping? It’s not like I wouldn’t be able to work in my current lab next year. I understand summer is a good time to get shit done but it’s also a good time to do internships. 

Basically I feel like I’m just trying to figure out what interests me and what I want to do when I graduate. I still feel like there’s lots I haven’t been exposed to or tried that could interest me.

This is not a technical question. This is basically me sitting on fence between career opportunities.

I have been working with this product for almost 2 years doing from designing, drafting, and application engineering work. Now company A is bringing me in as an Application Engineer with a salary of high $50k. I know it is pretty low in my area, but the manager insists me to take it.

On the other hand, I have some connections from company B. They are willing to take me in as a CAD Admin with a more competitive salary. If I switch to company B, I will have my career path leading to a Mechanical Designing Engineer as I grow and get promoted.

26,Steering Calibration Engineer first job?,1581499339," Hello, I just completed an interview for a position as Steering Calibration Engineer for an Italian Luxury car manufacturer (as an external consultant). This would be my first job after graduation. I had a few questions about it:

From what they told me both hardware and software for the steering system are developed by suppliers, so in the end what this job boils down to is going to the track (and also traveling to test facilities in Sweden and Africa to evaluate behavior in hot and cold condition, snow etc..) , listening to the tester's feedback and modifying a limited number of variables from the pre-made software. If that's not enough you go to the supplier and ask for new functionalities etc... They also basically told me that office work is just planning for track tests

Even considering that I really LOVE track testing (was Vehicle Dynamics lead in Formula SAE team) and going to Sweden and South Africa sound pretty cool (then again I'm betting it gets old pretty fast, especially since you have to go pretty often), I won't hide that it souns a bit disappointing compared to what I was expecting (those Business Managers are very good at misdirecting).

My main issues are:

\-I probably won't learn much doing this job and don't really know how applicable to future jobs my experience would be

\-Probably low growth potential, don't want to be stuck doing this forever

\-Would like a job in actually designing things

\-Standards of both consulting company and Client company seemed very low, Interviews were not challenging at all, gave me the impression that anybody could do this job

That said I would probably enjoy doing this for a while and the client company is currently growing a lot so good prospects on that side (though I doubt the will actually keep me and not just throw me away once I'm done like most consultants), but it does sound like a dead end career wise.

Anybody has direct experience with similar positions?

29,Water infiltration on detached home slab on grade concrete perimeter,1581497374,"Ok, so I'll try to make this short. The subject home is a 2 level home about 40 yrs    
old, located at grade. There is a gradual slope towards the front of the home.       
Water line from city to home was replaced last year. A path was excavated and     
entry point was drilled in the side of the conrete foundation and up through     
the interior slab to run the Pex pipe into the home.       

During heavy rain. Water will enter the home from the the sleeve of the inlet waterpipe.    
I talked to the installer about my concern of water entering through the void, 
and asked what could have caused this?   
  
He suggested to add a 4' perforated drain pipe to the storm sump located appox 6-6.5ft    
from the waterpipe entry to the home. He said this would relieve the water build up    
near the waterpipe entry point, and he also sealed the void between the waterpipe and sleeve     
with silicone from the inside of the home only.   
 
I suspect the water comes in from the outside entry point through the exterior foundation    
side wall.The installer disagrees and says, sealing the exterior hole to the home on the    
foundation is not needed.    

So his suggestion on the upgrades were done. Months go by without any issue.         
Then heavy rain came last week caused some water to enter about 12"" from the waterpipe entry            
from the interior slab, slowly leaking out from the slab for about 3 hrs.    
   
So if this water ingress is caused from a high water table, then wouldn't water will also     
coming out from the cove joints on the side of the slabs, correct?      

Could it be the unsealed exterior side wall entry point of the foundation that allows        
water to enter under the slab during heavy rain? Additionally with a gentle slop towards the       
home, could this cause enough hydrostatic pressure to push water into and under the slab          
forcing water come out the top of the interior slab?    

The installer disagrees with me and said that the exterior side wall doesn't need to be    
sealed at all. And further tries to sell me into 2-3 pump systems to get the water away from     
the home. Because he insists it's my drains ( never had issue with the drains ).    

A little history. There was no water infiltration into the home before the water inlet pipe was    
installed. During the installation, the installer got the drill bit stuck and smashed it    
with a sledge hammer for 2 hrs to try and free the bit!     
  
So I'd like to ask all you with some insight about this situation, what would you do?    

1) Have the installer dig and repair/seal the entry point from exterior?    
2) Install a new drainage system along the front?

54,"What would be the feasibility issues with building a cofferdam in the ocean and using it as pumped hydro storage(with the ocean around it being the other ""basin"")?",1581460462,"(I have never seen such an idea proposed, so I'm assuming there must be some major flaw with the idea)

Basically, somewhere where the sea floor is relatively flat, relatively shallow, and the wind is relatively consistent could have a giant cofferdam built in it(pick any location you like; the following is just an example, but off the coast of Texas near Houston, the sea floor is between 50-100 feet deep for several miles out to sea)

It seems to me that a wall could be built from the sea floor to the surface(let's say 50 feet) and then the inside could be dug out even further down(let's say another 50 feet) and reinforced around all sides with the dredged material, sloping down to buttress the new hole in the ocean like an embankment dam.

(In this hypothetical, feel free to adjust the wall height and dredging depth as you see fit)

Off-shore wind could easily be placed around the perimeter of the cofferdam, and excess power could pump the cofferdam empty. When there isn't enough wind, the process could be reversed and power would be generated by filling the hole with ocean water. 

100 feet obviously isn't very much head to begin with, and as the hole filled, the head would decrease, but even with an overall average of 50 feet of head height, a hole with a radius of 2 miles could power every home in Houston(860K homes I think) for 24 hours(average usage of 39kwh per home per day) if it filled at a rate of 35,000 cfs, which isn't out of the ordinary from what I can tell for other dams. 

So what's wrong with my idea? I'm assuming cost is part of it. Although, it's not like the concrete part of the wall would need to be very wide if it was surrounded by the dredged material --like an embankment dam-- to keep the ocean pressure away(or would it?). In fact, it seems like to me that such a project would require less than 10% of the material used in Three Gorges Dam(I'll admit, the biggest construction project in human history might not be the best reference point, but since I used Houston as my example, I'll use ""they like things big in Texas"" as my rebuttal to my own admission)

In the long run, that still seems like a good way to balance the load of renewables, especially in coastal areas where people tend to live and wind is plentiful.

64,"Currently Majoring in EET, considering switching. Again.",1581444222,"There is a lot to cover here. Not even sure if this subreddit is the best place to ask but i'll give it a go.

&amp;#x200B;

right now, I am going to a Bachleors electrical Engineering Technology at SIUC. But what has led me to this major isn't really what I wanted to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a little kid, I used to spend a lot of time sitting in my parents basement taking apart electronics, and putting them back together. I was using an oscilloscope, creating DC-DC converts and reading schematics and datasheets by high school, so I thought I would Major in Electrical Engineering. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then something strange happened senior year of high school. I stumbled into the IT asset revovery and resale business by accident upon visiting a scrap yard in Michigan, and ultimately started an ITAD business myself. I was making 70K a year just going to scrap yards and flipping computer parts in ebay, craigstlist, and Amazon and paying a couple of friends to pack and ship things for me. Of course all that ended my Senior year, when I went off to college. This is where things take a downturn.

&amp;#x200B;

I chose Electrical engineering as my Major, and ended up failing my first year of school at UofM Dearborn. The Calculus and Chemistry got me. I was put on probation, and for a complex list of reasons I do not want to explain here, Transferred to SIUC in Illinois.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon transferring to SIUC, I chose a Bachleors in EET becuase it seemed ""easier"". But Now i'm finishing off my second semester as a Sophomore at 21, and I'm still not sure if it's right for me. Recently as of October 2019, I've gotten into teaching myself Altium Designer, fusion 360, and I love my solidworks class. But I learned that we never cover any design work in EET, It's just technician work.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering switching back to EE again, since the classes my junior and senior year are more appropriate for what I wanted to do to begin with. unfortunently I would have to go back again and try to get those hard Math, Physics, and Chemistry classes out of the way. That would mean instead of graduating in 5 years, it would be 6 years. I didn't particularly feel like spending 6 years to get a college degree, but here we are. 

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other hand, I also am really into entrepreneuership and the business side of things, and am currently moniring in Economics, so I am not sure what to do at this point. I've been good with business, and I've been good with engineering. I'm not sure which one to pick.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a third option here; Industrial engineering. My School offers it, and it looks to be a good blend of Business and Engineering. It would still extend my school time to 6 years, but would require me to only retake my math classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, does any of this even matter? Maybe just stick with my major, and get something like a minor in Economics or business (I am halfway to meeting both of these). The goal is to be employable after all, whether the market is doing well or poorly. At this point, the chose I want to make seems like a dice roll.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm a second Semester Sophmore Student in EET who likes both Engineering and entrepreneuership, and has been good at both outside the classroom. Is it worth it to switch back to electrical Engineering, or even switch to Industrial Engineering instead given I would extend my time in school from 5 years to 6?

My question is how to practically model the suspension constraints on a heavy haul trailer (think lowboy or flatbed). These trailers have multiple axles. The way I see it, there are a couple of options, but I'm not sure which one is the most realistic for analysis purposes.

1. Pin the trailer at each axle location, either using a line or a simple geometric representation of the suspension hanger. 
2. Apply a pin at the middle of the rear axle group.
3. Apply a fixed constraint at each axle. 

Note that sometimes these trailers deflect upward at the rear bumper under certain loading conditions, which is why I don't know whether pinning/fixing each axle is a good idea.

I’m building a tiny house inside a semi-trailer and for the effort of gaining as much interior space as possible, I’m building a cantilever ceiling bed that can be tucked away into a ceiling recess when not in use. 

I’d like it supported by a couple of steel tracks on the bed-head end only. The important consideration with mine is that when it is in the “down” position (ie. ready to be slept on), the weight of the bed will be supported underneath by resting on some floor supports.

So I’m looking for any guidance when it comes to the engineering side of the strength needed to support the wall side of the bed where it is attached to the trailer. I have read estimates of around 1000kg load strength for a 150kg mattress + structure weight. Does that sound about right?

The trailer wall is fibreglass with a reinforced steel frame where the bed will go (where the freezer unit used to be attached). The intention is to have a steel substructure welded together as a single unit that is guided on tracks on the corners of the bed base.

94,Closest thing to an M2.5 non-metal (preferably Nylon) wing nut?,1581377118,"Hello,

I am on a SEED team and we are currently working on packaging a system of sensors.  We prefer all hardware to be non-metal as this package may end up on a drone.  Our biggest design constraint is weight.  

We are trying to make the assembly of this 'sensor package' toolless so that researchers in the field don't have to struggle to swap in and out different sensors.  

One of the sensors has through-holes meant for M2.5 sized bolts (it's a metric through-hole, but we suppose we could also use UNC size #3-48).  

After some thorough research by two team members (including myself), neither of us were able to find any sort of wing nut or thumb nut that is M2.5 or #3-48 AND plastic. 

So I guess my question is, has anybody dealt with a similar scenario?  Do you know where we might be able to find a M2.5 sized Nylon wing nut? 

We have been 3D printing (FDM) many prototypes of our package and are now moving onto the higher resolution technology of SLA.  Thus, I am thinking of whipping up my own M2.5 wing nut to be printed on the Form 2 with their Durable resin.  But I figured I'd ask here first.

The idea is to somehow fill the chamber so full of gas that the device isn’t able to make contact with the ground.

Imagine pressing down on a pump that’s attached to a device that’s already full of air. At a point, you’re no longer able to press the pump all the way down because air is trapped between the piston and frame of the pump.

8,How do I recover from college burnout and general apathy about an engineering career post-graduation?,1581363550,"For context, I'm a final semester mechanical engineering student. Recently (well, since mid-Fall semester, I guess), I've been feeling burnt out of engineering and anything technical. I just feel like I won't be fulfilled by any job I get in engineering. And it feels crazy to me to admit that because I've basically wanted to be an engineer all my life. I watched Extreme Engineering and Modern Marvels alongside Spongebob while growing up. It always seemed like destiny to me. But now, when I can see the light at the end of the tunnel getting ever so closer, ever so brighter, I just feel like nothing really matters. 

I wrote this to myself in my journal last week:

&gt;I hate engineering and everything I’m doing. 

&gt;Admitting that to myself has been kind of tough. And I don’t know if I’m just burnt out from this senior project that’s way more work than we bargained for or if I’m finally learning how to live life for what I want, not what I thought I wanted or what I was told I wanted. All I know is that everything I’ve done in the past four years fills me with a feeling of apathy that feels like it would only lead to another round of depression in the coming months after graduation. 

&gt;There’s something to be said about doing “real” engineering. The nitty-gritty technical stuff. The world needs people to do those things. But the idea of putting my life into something that I honestly do not give a flying fuck about brings nothing but existential dread to me. Because honestly, there is nothing on the cutting edge of technology that I care about. 

&gt;I could design cars. I love cars. I love driving. It seems like a perfect fit. But everything about today’s cars, while technically close to perfect on paper, just seems boring to me. I don't care about performance numbers. I just want the feeling from driving an early turbo car with lag for days or a car that I can drive at 9/10ths under the speed limit. And I hate commuting. It’s just soul crushing. I want a job where I can take the subway to work so that I don’t have to waste hours of my preciously short life stuck on the 405. I just want to take my creative energy and build my perfect car and take her into the mountains on the weekends.

&gt;“What about tech? There’s lots of cool stuff there.” I use the internet for three things: TV, Spotify, and looking for car parts that I can’t afford. And Reddit, I guess. Four things. I don’t give a fuck about gaming or whatever “next big thing” is out there. 

&gt;I want to be creative. And I realize that engineering can be creative, but it doesn’t seem like the kind of creative I want to be. I am very thankful for the creative problem-solving skills this engineering degree has given me. It has led to a feeling of self-confidence that I did not know I could feel. It has made me feel like I can do anything. But I don’t want to solve technical problems. I want to make music or be an actor or find someway to express myself to the world. And I don’t know how to do that without having a basic-ass engineering job 

&gt;After picking myself from depression, I realized that I need to put stuff into me to be happy. I’m still trying to find my place in the world and who I am and I think that’s why this is making me happy. I’m still in a phase of self-discovery and trying to learn what I like. That feeling of discovering myself, that feeling of trying new things, as pretentious as it sounds, is what keeps me going. And this process of discovering myself, of discovering new things, as disappointing as it sounds, is what has made me realize that I hate engineering and everything I’m doing. 

&gt;Now what?

I realize this is kinda long and no one is going to care but I needed to get it out there. I don't feel like I can talk to my friends about this because they are all engineers and they are all still in love with engineering. And I don't think I'm still depressed because I've definitely been putting an effort into bettering myself. I don't feel like I did before when I was *depressed* depressed.

So  I guess the TL;DR of this big block of text is, ""how to I rediscover my passion for engineering?"" Or alternatively, ""what do I do when I realize engineering is not for me?""",AskEngineers,False,gathuryplace,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f1vkfd/how_do_i_recover_from_college_burnout_and_general/
9,QA Tester seeking advancement advice.,1581361305," 

Hey guys, I need some advice for career advancement.

In the last 8 months I got a job for QA in a company that makes BIOS and chips. I got the job mainly because they had sudden vacancies and my college roommate works at the company too. I have a Exercise Science degree and mostly a retail job background with a little bit of technical knowledge. I have grown in my skills since working here, but I'm still hourly and want to set a road map to securing a better position at the company.

Now the company culture is old school in training or advancing your skills, in that you are not allowed to study anything accept department training on the clock. I've been told by my manager's that the only way to advance myself is to get an associates in programming or engineering. My managers are engineers and have never taken a management course, any advice on how to deal with those types of managers?

On the plus side there have been C-Level changes that are altering the way we quantify advancements in the company. So the requirements or opportunities to change my status in the company will be different in next year.

17,"I can get a free college degree in high school, should I get an associates of engineering, a trade school degree, or do nothing?",1581353657," 

This is a bit different from 'which bachelors should I get' in FAQ so don't delete this mods

My local community college offers dual enrollment, allowing me to take high school and college classes, so I can graduate with my HS diploma and an extra college diploma. The college offers associates (science/arts/engineering) or career/technical pathways (trade school/certificates). I'm weighting the pros and cons between getting an associates degree, trade school cert., or taking school like a normal person. To put this in context I live in NC, will be taking the course as a senior, and my goal is mechanical engineering.

Pro's of dual enrollment in general:

\- Taking a dual course means the tuitions been payed off for me.

\- I get try out college/degree with little risk to see if it's for me

\- I get access to college resources (reserve study rooms, library, clubs that look got on a transcript)

\- More freedom. I can take online or drive to campus from high school.

Con's of dual:

\- I want to take some more AP classes to bring up my GPA (3.4 weighted right now) and college might get in the way of that. My dilemma is that I could take AP calculus or college calculus and so on. I also want to mention I'm taking to 2 AP classes which are not factored in yet because I didn't complete them my GPA might rise or fall making this point invalid.

\- I have to work on a senior project and I feel that mixed with college might be to much.

\- Paper work will get confusing. There are 2 colleges I can go to one in county A and the other county A. College A is free if you live in county A, same with college B is free in county B. I live in county A, but go to a charter high school in county B. This has lead to paper work confusion so when I sign up for something I don't know if I'm a county A person or County B person. Both courses are the same it's just I need to worry how the tuition is getting payed. My counselor says I can apply to both schools, but I'm still not sure.

Pro's of associates of engineering (A.E):

\- The credits are made to get past engineering 101 classes (you have to take calculus 1-2, chem or phys, engin. graphics, intro to engin., and the generic ela/S.S/art classes). Since the tuition is free taking the intro classes in dual will save a lot of money.

\- The credits can also be used in high school. If I take an English class in college during dual enrollment it becomes both a college and highs school credit

\- The credits are easily transferable. The degree was made in mind to be transferable to a 4 year school and most of the major colleges in my area have programs to help you switch. You can even talk to a counselor to help you choose which classes are best for which college you want to go to.

\- A.E \*might\* help me get a decent job while I'm working on my bachelors

Con's of A.E:

\- Wont be much use outside of finished core classes. From what I've found you can use an A.E, but it's hard to get a job and most are low paying.

\- Not much of a con, but the school is already crazy cheap (3,000$) so I'm not missing out on a big deal.

\- Not as transferable as AP's and I've heard colleges prefer AP. The degree was made for an instate college, so going out of state (which I don't want to) will be harder.

Pro's of Trade school:

\- Still 100% free

\- Better chances of getting a job. Once I graduate from high school I'll be employable in a job that isn't burger flipping. The main courses I have my eye on are the IT certification, welding, or office admin.

\- School has clubs for it's certificates.

Con's of trade

\- All the courses are certificates not degrees. Does that make it a a bad choice?

\- I'm not strong enough to weld (I'm a girl, medical conditions, generally clumsy)

\- I will most likely never use these degrees again after completing my bachelors

\- A cert in a random field wont look as good as an A.E",AskEngineers,False,Mountain-Treacle,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f1t39u/i_can_get_a_free_college_degree_in_high_school/

I asked him to help with a basic analysis which he spent 2 months working on. I periodically checked up on him and gave him advise and reference materials. Today, he delivered his analysis to me and when I started digging into the details, it is so poorly done that I need to reconduct most of it. He got pulled off my project to support another project, so its all dumped on me now.

I obviously need to break the news to my Project Manager that this analysis will take another month to clean up. However, is this something I should bring up to my Functional Manager?

32,Verifying Mass Moment of Inertia Calculation,1581342671,"Hi all. I'm looking at a piece of code calculating MoI's and I'm trying to understand it.

I see the formula in our code that basically reads (I'll stick with Ixx for this, since I think that if I can understand one, I can understand the rest. I'll also write this in MATLAB-esque pseudocode):   



g = 32.17; 

ixx(1) = mass\_ixx(1);

n = number of point mass elements   

for ii = 2:n

ixx = pm\_ixx(ii) + pm\_mass(ii)/g \* (((pm\_ycg(ii) - ycg)/12)\^2 

\+ (pm\_zcg(ii) - zcg)/12)\^2))

end  

  

I can see that this follows the form:  

  

I = summation from 1 to n of mr\^2

53,Prevent previous work issues from hurting next engineering job,1581295185,"Hi, I made this post here before:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/e2r8vp/first\_engineering\_job\_not\_receiving\_support/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/e2r8vp/first_engineering_job_not_receiving_support/)

So here is a bit of background on my issue. So, after making this post I talked with my manager who said he would try to help me get the senior engineer to cooperate with me more. So two weeks after that he spoke with me and told me no, don't expect any mentorship or help with anything. Then he told me if I can't figure things out on my own without help from the senior engineer then I am not a fit for the company (despite me being hired as a junior engineer). 

&amp;#x200B;

So after a few weeks later he told me I was doing great and things were going fine. Then we had an issue with some products and I had to find out what the issue was in the circuit. I didn't have proper circuit analysis tools (oscilloscope, signal gen etc) to handle this (I only had a multimeter), so I asked them to purchase them. My immediate manager said yes we need them, but upper management said they had to finish budget information first. 

&amp;#x200B;

A month past and I kept insisting this was required for me to proceed but they kept telling me no. Then I was told I need to find this solution soon because it's affecting the product. Then I got called into a meeting over why this hasn't been progressing and the senior engineer kept talking over me and being rude when we were talking to the Engineering Manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

A month passes and I still don't hear anything about the equipment I need and my manager told me the next level up needs to approve it and they haven't yet. And I told him and his boss that I need it or I can't proceed. But his boss told me that I need to make progress on this and they need to see it being worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started working on other things and the senior engineer would always tell people he was testing my stuff that I was doing and always finding problems. But one time I double checked everything and had another person double check it and it worked fine. Then I let the senior engineer look at it and he said it worked, then I left for 3 minutes and came back and he said it was not working. I noticed a couple wires were pulled out in the product where they were once plugged in, so it wouldn't turn on.  

&amp;#x200B;

I started looking for another job but meanwhile I was working there, stuff like this kept happening; I would make something or do something but he would always criticize it or find a way it ""wasn't working"" then he would try to convince people to let him have the time to fix it and make me give him the task instead. If I had deadlines, he would often convince people the goalposts should be moved for a feature and then I would miss the deadline because he wouldn't communicate these changes to me or someone else would tell me later. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got called into a meeting with my manager and he told me the senior engineer said that we cannot trust the quality of my work and that I am making too many mistakes (as a junior engineer). I found out that the senior engineer was telling people that I was stupid, slow and he didn't like working with me. After this conversation with the manager, the bullying from the manager really picked up. He would talk over me during meetings, disagree with me, make rude comments etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another month later, the old hardware issue comes back and I can't make progress because they still won't rent or buy equipment because of budget stuff but I need to do my job. The senior engineer kept making comments about how it was taking too long to get this done and how I should be doing more (he was not happy they let me handle this because he didn't like having to hand off his responsibility to me).

&amp;#x200B;

A week later I found a partial fix for a hardware issue and implemented it but then a couple days later I had another talk with my manager and his boss. They ended up telling me that I was being let go without cause. I kept asking why and they said they just felt that with the negative comments about me, that I wasn't a fit for the company and that I should have solved the major hardware issue (even though they never bought me electronics tools). In the end, I was given a month of severance. 

&amp;#x200B;

In total, I worked there for about 7-7.5 months. I had a lot more responsibility than any new engineer would, I felt like I was doing well and other employees (and engineers) told me that things seemed to be working a lot better with me there. I learned a lot in my time there.

How do I explain this in an interview for a new job? How can I spin ""i got fired but I gained a lot more experience than most new engineers would for their first job"". 

Presumably, a new job would want to call my old employer...how do I handle this? How would I prevent this from leaving a red mark on my career? Any advice how to move forward would be helpful.

Hi Everyone,

I am a third-year student who recently got a 6-month co-op at a pretty large company. I am accepting this offer to intern for them this spring and summer quarter and am very excited to start. However, my situation is kind of odd because I am in a program that links you up with two guaranteed 6-month internships which would mean I would miss my spring terms. My dilemma is if I should try to finish my degree within the next school year and skip out on my second guaranteed 6-month internship or accept the following 6-month internship and extend my schooling out to a fifth year. I listed out the pros and cons of each and since I can link a spreadsheet of my projected finances for both situations please ask me questions! I hope you all can help me make a decision!

Pros of Graduating on Time:

* Be able to get a year of extra work saying that I will have a full-time job offer after I graduate.
* Be on track with my long-time girlfriend who is going to be graduating next year.
* Save $3,000.

Cons:

* Heavier course load since I will be missing my spring term and must make up some classes.
* A year lost without being with my friends who also have a 6-month internship

Pros of Graduating as a Fifth Year

* Could spend my fifth year sending out quality job applications to various companies.
* I would already have another 6-month internship ready after the end of my spring term.

Cons:

* A year lost of potentially making good money.
* Have to pay more for housing and schooling.

Drum minimum diameter = 1m

Max diameter = 3m

Drum width = 350mm

Rope diameter = 20mm

Sensor must be in an IP65+ rugged housing for use outdoor in all weather. Can't be affected by rain etc. Safety critical. 

Sensor must be powered by 24VDC and output a variable signal based on the distance it measures. 4-20ma or voltage or 0-10v would be OK. 


As you can see, the rope will stack up layer upon layer until the diameter is ~3m. 

Options:

Ultrasonic - It seems the beam is too wide for any I have found and the flanges of the winch drum (350mm apart) may interfere with the signal. 

Diffuse Photoelectric - Diffuse sensors seem to have a limit on the distance they can measure. With a variable distance of ~1M, I cannot find one suitable.

After numerous solutions still standing water in crawlspace

Hi all,

So I bought a house 5 years ago. It was built in the 1960s. It doesn’t have any severe foundation cracks. We found out quickly there was drainage issues. One thing lead to another and we replaced all downspouts adding a drainage system that drains to daylight. Replacing the gutters. Had a curtain drain installed around the perimeter. And they even added a pipe under the footer sticking into the crawl space about a foot wide with an engineers approval to catch water as it tries to enter from a corner of the house.  All in all we are 30k deep not accounting for 8k on roof reframing we had to have done. 

We just had a bunch of rain in western Washington and the guy who dug our drain was out for some other stuff and I had him check the crawl. He said there was still spots with water and a few where it was above the vapor barrier. Some are a few inches deep as we have some fairly low spots in areas. They are scattered at random so this seems to possibly be groundwater at this point. . We had a structural engineer out at the beginning of the project 3 years ago and at the end about 7 months ago. This has been long standing. The engineer wrote a letter basically saying the repairs we completed were sufficient and there was minimal water that he observed. He felt the structure would continue to function as intended with continued normal maintenance. All in all I had a structural engineer and a civil engineer involved in this project over the past few years. At this point they have both verbally said that even though water is present and likely enough to be above the barrier that they don’t have concerns about the structure since the wood didn’t show any signs of rot and it had been functioning since 1960s. 

At this point I’m considering selling the house, but I don’t know what to do. Everything I read online tells buyers to “run” if water issues are present; on the other hand I have engineers telling me it’s nothing to worry about as this has likely been happening for years with no adverse affects on the house. It does seem to only occur when we have prolonged rains. We do have some cracking above our corners of windows but nothing more than a hairline. We are also on fairly dense clay soils and I suspect some expansion and contraction occurs seasonally that may cause some of those cracks as the foundation slightly shifts. 

The yard has also been completely redone by a landscaper and graded which cost a pretty penny. I’m at a loss at this point. All the money my dad left me when He passed away went to buying this house and now I’m worried I am gonna get nothing for it if I try to sell it due to the stigma of water. I at least do have the written report by the engineer ... there’s also concerns about how effective putting an interior drain and sump pit would be due to the dense soil so it was suggested I save the money by both engineers. 

One other side issue is the person I hired didn’t wrap the trench in filter fabric. Do I need to worry about the trench sediment movement under minding the soil supporting the foundation? The install was a curtain drain at the footer level or a bit lower and they did generally follow the 1:1 and 2:1 rule except one area where the engineer we hired stated he felt there was minimal risk despite it being dug a bit closer since it’s on the gable  side of the house. 

Any ideas, or thoughts or anyone who’s experienced something similar I’d appreciate your input. My heart is broken at this point.

9,What is the non-industry specific title for the engineer that manages all software performance in a module assembly?,1581201015,"First to get the basics out:
The country you're from and/or asking about: United States
The industry you're asking about: Electrical/Software Engineering
Your current experience and degree/education level: Working on graduate studies in Energy.  Undergrad in Electrical Engineering.  9 years experience post undergrad in system, component, and module engineering.

Sorry for the vagueness in advance - I am trying to maintain both my anonymity and confidentiality of my employer. 

I am currently in the process of looking for additional opportunities but realized I do not know what the industry generic title is for one of my more impressive job roles.  I think an appropriate title will assist my career growth greatly.  **I am hopeful you guys can help me identify what the non-industry specific title would be.**

The position in question was at a large OEM, and the title was ""Software Lead Engineer"".  I believe this title is misleading because my job did not have me directly directing software coding engineers.

My role was ownership of software quality from requirement definition to delivery to the customer for a specific module within a much *larger product*.  I inherited a base line product/module and my responsibility was to update/upgrade the baseline module into the next year of production which increased the applicable interfacing hardware (introduction of new supplier solutions) and increased customer facing features.  Additionally the next year of production increased the number of applicable *larger products* and expanded the regions of sale and as a result the impacting regulations to manage.

Start of the project my role was to review all technical change requests proposed to adapt the module to the new regions, adapt the module to new *larger products*, and general customer improvements.  This portion of the role was primarily gathering requirements from requirement owners and vetting their value.  Often this portion included reworking requirements to minimize implementation risk or to improve implementation feasibility.  Additionally I managed all requests for quote sent to the supplier and lead cost negotiations with my hardware lead for engineering costs.

The second phase of the project I managed Software delivery from the supplier to the OEM.  This included defining deadlines for feature implementation, reviewing all open issues, and prioritizing the supplier on what items were must fix, what items were nice to have, and what items were a waste of time.  I managed this portion of the project through multiple OEM side subject matter experts, a supplier side project manager, and several supplier side technical leads.  I reviewed all proposed fixes and product changes, challenged items that appeared high risk, and ensured implementation reward vs. implementation risk was managed.

The third phase (that overlapped significantly with the second phase) was that I coordinated with the OEM validation team to coordinate what testing would occur and when.  I defined to that validation team what issues would be fixed, which wouldn't, and led negotiations when the team's didn't agree.  Further, I defined scope and managed regular testing of the module within the *larger product* utilizing the OEM side subject matter experts as primary testers.

The end of the phase I began to get warranty data on the baseline project and reviewed that content to feedback necessary/value add improvement into the project before delivery.

As a result, I became the subject matter expert for the entirety of the module's implementation.  I spoke to a colleague which reported to me as an OEM side subject matter expert on the project and he struggled to define what my non-industry specific title would be.  The way he put it was ""There were hundreds of engineers working towards the success of the module, but without EEGRThrowAway there was no module.""

The end result (and the metrics of whether I was successful) was on-time implementation, with a huge reduction in warranty even with an increase production quantity and increase in feature capability.

To be clear, I did not manage direct delivery of full module to the OEM production plants.  My hardware lead managed that portion - but our responsibilities were intertwined.  The phases above are loosely in chronological order - but input from each phase could occur at any time.  Throughout the project I was the primary reporter to management and leadership for software performance.",AskEngineers,False,EEGRThrowAway,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f0ywxy/what_is_the_nonindustry_specific_title_for_the/

I want to make a ""parking brake"" for my chair and while I may go with a simpler design I was trying to learn how a parking brake pedal works. I really like the idea of a single ""input"" device such as a single lever with no button. So you would pull on the lever to engage the brake. When you first set the brake you can push it in far or short so it ratchets to different positions. While the brake is engaged, if you press on it again it releases and returns to the ""off"" position.  


I cannot figure out how to find examples or diagrams of this sort of mechanism. Any time I search for ""paw and gear"" or ""ratchet with release mechanism"" it is always two different inputs, one to tighten the ratchet and one to release the ratchet.  


I don't need anyone to like design this for me or anything, I just need to know what it is called so I can find more information on it and how I might make one.

I'm a junior design engineer looking for some help in expanding my **knowledge in plastic and sheet metal design**. While detailling plastic and metal designs, I'm often faced with my lack of experience on how a design should be implemented. As an example, I could have to design a tamper evidence in a plastic part, an entire plastic enclosure for electronics or revolving doors in metallic enclosures.

The exhaust ports in the engines seem to be designed with [twin exhaust in mind ](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/24/b8/9724b8e6c691ef2900e625e7c06ac604.jpg), but I'm wondering if there would be any advantages  regarding exhaust tuning for engines [with a single exhaust port](https://blog.ktm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Moto3_MX2.jpg) splitting the tubes later on. 

And why have they decided to make the exhaust ports like that in the first place? I have read in some interviews and random forums that they do it for ""extra power"", to have more volume in the silencers (easier to get more volume with two silencers), and I assume when longer lengths are needed [\(twisting a thinner tube is probably easier\)](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.motorbikemag.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Leopard-Racing_KTM_3.jpg)

35,"""Electrical differential"" theory- is my head right here?",1581173662,"I do a lot of random mechanical side projects for fun.  One of those recently occurred when I managed to collect a pile of power wheels cars in various states of functionality.  Most of these were destined for the junk pile and so I don't feel too bad about plucking off parts and refurbishing as needed.

What I've done now is create a 6 wheel drive car- this is similar to a design I did back in college where front and rear sets of wheels pivot opposite each other, but the real subject of this post has to do with the motors.  In contrast to the mechanical solution I came up with back then (driven by a single motor), these wheels are each independently driven.

So this presents some complications with regards to the driving circuit.  The motors and gearboxes all vary a bit but I've done my best to match things up so they're at least close.  I feel like these naturally balance out to some degree- in my mind they're not so much ""fighting each other"" as they are cooperating.  

Firstly- is that fair?    

Secondly, they tend to draw between 1-10A each depending on load of course.  It would probably be a good idea to include an assortment of strategic caps, right?  *What* that strategy is remains TBD.

Thirdly, I bought [**a cheap speed control**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M5F5UDS) for this application- I'd like to at least have proportional control, but I wonder how a PWM control circuit like this would feel about supplying a group of motors in parallel.  (I can't imagine any of this would be sensible to wire in series).

One of my goals also is to pull this off using primarily recycled junk parts- I made an exception for the ESC, but would like to continue that theme to the extent that its possible.  This ESC is probably overrated, so I'd consider using a pair and splitting the load.",AskEngineers,False,salukikev,/r/AskEngineers/comments/f0skme/electrical_differential_theory_is_my_head_right/

I'm building a hybrid linear reluctance actuator in my spare time. This actuator  uses permanent magnets to 'preload' the magnetic circuit and electromagnets to control a mover. I've sized the magnets and coil sizes etc and all components are ordered and arrived.

I've got ordered neodymium magnets with an holding weight of approximately 20kg (~40lbs). As a result they are terrifying to deal with, especially in a home scenario. So my question to those with experience with magnets is what are the best practices when assembling magnets on steel structures and removing them. 

I got the basics as removing rings, keeping away stray metal parts and never putting hands and fingers between magnets and or steel. However, when assembling magnets they tend to snap into place when approaching the steel which I find rather incontrollable and not the safest. Same with removing magnets. So can I make some easy tools to deal with this problem. Like 3d print a disassembly jig or something.

45,(Trade Question) Mechanical Engineering Design vs Electronics Engineering Associates,1581133105,"Hey guys and girls,

First of all, I know this isn't exactly engineering but I don't know where else to ask this and engineers would definitely have the most valuable advice since you're generally the bosses of these people.

I recently got out of the Air Force but I worked as security forces. Essentially I was an AF cop. I did nothing technical or cool. Still, luckily I have the GI bill. I recently moved near a large defense contractor that offers about a million and a half jobs for engineers of each discipline but I want to be a technician.

Here's my issue: I would like to do the local community colleges mechanical engineering design program because I did CAD in high school and thought it was awesome. The local contractor, though, seems to hire mainly electrical/electronics engineering techs. I just don't know a ton about EE and I don't know if it's something I'd like.

I wrote the contractors, essentially asking their recommendations for wanna-be technicians and I've received no response in two weeks. 

So, for those of you in the know: Is electronics engineering technology going to be more valuable to me as a degree? Both programs are three years so I don't want to mess up on which I choose. 

Also, I've read a million threads on this sub and others about people talking about general engineering associates (the kind that transfer to a university) and you guys usually say to get the four year degree. Well, let me tell you, I'm terrible at math. I just am. And I'd rather be honest with myself now before starting college than pretend like I'm going to work my way up to diff equations. I barely passed algebra in high school.

I guess my question is if the research and development internship is offered, is it better to take that instead of an unrelated software internship even if it is within the government? I have been told by my parents(they work in the software group) as well as my parents supervisors that it would be easier to obtain my dream job if I take the unrelated Air force internship as it is a step into working for the government.

So, I’m a BME and recently got an offer for a pharmaceutical research internship this summer; it sounds pretty interesting and pays very well. It’s also out of state, which is good bc I want to leave the state I’ve grown up in after graduating. The problem is that I also applied to tissue engineering (TE) REU and Amgen Scholars programs but I won’t hear back from those until March. Plus, they’re rather competitive, so I don’t think I’ll get any offers from them, but it’s the last summer before I graduate so I figured why not apply.

As far as research goes, I’m more interested in TE than drug discovery (as far as ik, since I’ve never done research related to the latter) and slightly more interested in grad school than getting a job right after undergrad. But, I really just want a job doing research at least somewhat related to BME and I’m not totally confident a PhD would make it easier or harder.

I guess the upshot of it all is that if I turn down the industry internship and don’t get any offers from REUs/Amgens, I’ll just continue doing research at the lab I currently work in.

I'm currently debating switching to either Electrical or Computer Engineering and just taking up a CS minor. The reason I'm thinking about going EE is that I've heard that later on in grad school, it's easier to master in CS or CmpE if you're an Electrical Engineer versus trying to get a master in Electrical Engineering as a CS or CmpE major. Something to keep into consideration is that my school offers a CS minor to CmpE majors who take on two additional CS classes, such as Cryptography and IT Security, which is the field I hope to work in as of right now.

A new manager at my office has a terrible attitude, he huffs and puffs at anything at his desk, is incredibly entitled, will be very picky about the work he decides to do, leaves the office earlier than anyone else, and can be incredibly rude. He didnt realize it to the point that someone has quit because of being unable to work with him. Our director spoke to him a couple of months ago already after that incident and he said he would change, but hasnt. Other offices that we work with have complained about him to our director (same company, people we only work with through phone calls and emails), and someone spoke on my behalf about things I told them in confidence about how hard it is to work in the same office as him. I was then called in to talk to my director and Ihis manager was given another talking to. He is now showing tension towards me because of it, probably assuming that I'm the one that keeps complaining about him. I just want to have a normal work environment, free of drama, how should I approach him to tell him honestly about the way I feel in a polite way, in a way that would be constructive to us working together?

Invoices are still done in paper, and a new one is made every time there is a revision. Inspection notes are just scribbled on whatever paper he as nearby on site.

What I've done so far is digitized his invoices going back three years, but there's still a lot to do. I would like a suggestion for a software that fits our firm size. Most of what I've seen has been priced fairly, but theres just so many to choose from, and they seem large company focused. 

Critically, I would like any such software to include:

-the ability to create and manage projects


-view projects and their plans digitally (on a tablet or phone)

-enter notes to each project (e.g. revisions, inspection notes). 

-add pdfs or .dwg or such file types

-create and update invoices e.g. 
I click create invoice, i want to be able to add line items, and have the invoice save as I exit it

honestly, my dad is pretty techphobic so ease of use is my biggest need. A lot of the software I've seen so far (like Ajeera, others) are pretty complex and have enough functionality for an entire company with project managers, accountants, business guys and different engineering types.
