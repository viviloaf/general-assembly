2,Chemical Engineers - What would be the best kind of internship?,1359069221,"Hello folks!

So around this time of the year, it's time to register for summer internships. At this stage in my education, it's probably impossible for me to get an internship (according to my professors) as I am in the process (no pun intended) of studying Thermodynamics and all I know in this domain are mass/energy balances and those sorts of things.

However, seeing everyone rush to sign up made me think of what I will do when it's time for me to sign up, and how an internship will affect my life after graduation.

So my questions are, what would be the best kind of projects to get into for an internship? I know it's a broad a question, but I want to know which one prepares me the most (like plasma, polymer processing, etc...).

3,The properties of rubber in cold weather?,1359066545,"I have noticed that the wire from my earphones becomes bery hard/stiff in cold weather. I was just riding my bike and the wire was so stiff that it was hard to actually keep the earphones in my ear, since every little motion would get transferred through the stiff wire and moving the earphones around.

It made me wonder.. I know that you add softener to the rubber, but it was only about -5 degrees C outside, and they were really stiff and almost brittle. In production, how is this solved? it just a question of adding more softener, or is it impossible to have a span that is large enough to cover the entire range from -20 to +40 degrees, or whatever the maximum temperature you'd normally experience is?

5,Quadrotor Project - FPV and Image Tracking Questions,1359061582,"I am currently developing an Atmega2650-based quadrotor that can be controlled from an Android or iOS application via WiFi (ad hoc). Unfortunately, I am limited to WiFi protocol because the copter will be controlled from an iOS/Android-based phone. I will be using a base station only for development.

Eventually, I will be implementing FPV and image tracking capabilities and had some questions about feasibility and possible solutions. I realize this is an entirely separate, and very difficult project in itself. I have been brainstorming possible solutions for this implementation. The only limitation is that the video data will be acquired from a GoPro Hero 3 (h.264 format). I know that the Mega is not capable of tasks of this level and I am looking into more powerful processors.

I am trying to achieve the following specific goals:

1) Transmit live video stream from the camera to an iOS/Android application via WiFi.

2) Perform basic image tracking algorithms to aid in autonomous quadrotor movement.

First off, is it even feasible to send/receive flight control data and image data on the same WiFi connection while maintaining instantaneous control of the quadrotor?

If so, one solution I am considering is using an ARM-based processor running linux to handle all of the image processing and I/O. Assuming the communication speed is fast enough to relay flight control data, the image processor would then communicate with the flight processor via standard UART ports. I will essentially be creating my own WiFi video transmitter if I decide to pursue this.

Am I even on the right track to a feasible implementation of these features? Whether I am or not, I would greatly appreciate any insight regarding this project.",AskEngineers,transmissionzero,/r/AskEngineers/comments/177n80/quadrotor_project_fpv_and_image_tracking_questions/

16,I just finished a mass transfer test and i'm wondering if i did a big mistake or if my teacher was trying to mislead us.,1358994204,"[a poor sketch of the problem](http://imgur.com/QhzZglT)

The problem is simple, a sports gym is going to be built and they are wondering what's cheaper to heat, one pool 12x6 or two 6x6 pools, where the mean air velocity is around 2m/s. They want to maintain the pool at a 35oC temperature, the air has 30% relative humidity and a mean temperature of 25oC. The problem stated that the engineer wanted the first option but the architect wanted the second, someone from the organization told the engineer that if the cost for maintaining the pool temperature was 15% cheaper in the first option they would go with that, so you would have to calculate what's the best option, some conditions:

Because of the border, at x=0 in each of the pools you can consider the Reynolds number as turbulent. She gave an expression for the Sherwood Number:


Sh=0.04*Rex^0.85*Sc^1/3 

It's a local sherwood number, so you would have to integrate it for the whole pool.
The thing is, when i calculated Kc for the two options it was clear that the only variable calculating the evaporation rate was Kc, since the area was the same and the concentration difference too. In the end, the architect was right (at least from my calculation), was my teacher playing with us or did i screw up at some point?



My procedure during the test:
After obtaining Sc and Re for each case i integrated both of the equations, calculated Kc for both. To find the rate i simply multiplied the flux for the Area, that for both cases is the same. After that i used Chilton-Coulburn correlation to find h and use q/A=h(T-Tinf)",AskEngineers,ApocalipseDreams,/r/AskEngineers/comments/175xoj/i_just_finished_a_mass_transfer_test_and_im/

I'm not 100% sure of the purpose of this project in a Graphic Design class as it hasn't completely been explained yet but I'm guessing some of it has to do with being able to properly design something for a certain purpose.

For this we are only allowed to use paper and no form of adhesive. To be able to connect different pieces, the professor demonstrated creating tabs. 

I am hoping for some suggestions for a design. I did look at other posts in this subreddit concerning egg drop experiments and it seemed like all of them were able to use some sort of adhesive. 

I'm not 100% what type of paper I'm going to be using yet, but honestly it will probably be just whatever I can find (printer paper, newspaper, etc.) as I have to put this together myself outside of class by Friday's class.

I've been toying with the idea of building some HUD glasses, something akin to google glass just to futz around with. Specifically I'm looking at recognizing bar codes visually from a distance, so no lasers.

What are the pros and cons of doing a degree later in life, particularly one done part time over several (up to 8) years? 

What benefits does the prior practical experience (and perhaps also life experience) offer and what sort of position do you see these adult students ending up in?

I personally am a very hands on person with a burning desire to understand how everything works. Yet I could not cope being at a desk for long periods of time, nor am I particularly great at mathematical calculations, compared to many other people.

31,Looking for career advice from industrial/product designers and engineers on a Masters in Engineering followed by coursework in industrial design. CE vs ME and design opportunities afterwards. Maybe I'm just looking for life advice. (x-post /design),1358927151,"Well here it goes Reddit. I'm looking for some mob advice. It's a bit of a long post but I need some perspective on the career choices I have to make very soon and maybe a bit of a pep-talk. If it looks too long the TL;DR will sum it up.  

I'm 29, I have a BA in Biology and have completed 3 courses in industrial design. I'm also entering the second of 5 semesters in a Masters of Engineering program for which I have a full DoD scholarship that requires me to work for my previous employer for a minimum of 2 years after I finish school. I'll be 32 once my obligation is complete and I have little to no interest in staying at the job. The masters is basically a year of undergraduate preparatory courses and then a year of graduate courses.    

Starting this semester I'll be passing the point of no return in two respects: first, if I continue with the second semester I will no longer be able to repay the cost of tuition/living expenses out of pocket if I drop out of the program/scholarship; and second, I MUST choose an engineering discipline to focus in. The masters I'm in is basically a year of undergraduate and then a year of graduate courses.  

This is where it gets complicated. I should have decided between mechanical (ME) and computer engineering (CE) a week ago. Currently I am taking computer engineering courses with plans to concentrate in software engineering. I find the coding and embedded systems/microprocessor work I am doing now interesting but they are by no means my passion. It's more of a combination of having a group of friends in similar courses and being interested in the design applications that software and these types of devices can have (which admittedly I have only a limited exposure to). I also don't believe I'll be exceptional at CE or software development. It will be another job (though better paying than my current one) and I have no idea how I'll feel actually coding all day everyday for a job.  

The mechanical route also makes sense for what I do at work and aligns well with pursuing another degree or coursework in industrial design later on. I don't think I'll be an exceptional mechE. I do think I'll be a good product designer and have always loved the field but, I'm worried I have an unrealistic view of what a career in it will be like and it will probably involve going into some debt for more schooling. To pursue mechE I would have to change all my courses for this semester which is a really messy process (as one week has already gone by). A change like that is likely to hurt me academically. It's also more risky in terms of my career endgame because it seems to me that mechE's don't make as much money and have less job flexibility (I'm waiting to get jumped on for this comment).   


So my choices are:     

1. drop out of everything, pay the money back, and try to figure out what the hell to do with myself   nearly broke and paying rent with no masters or full-time employment;
2. finish the masters with a concentration in CE and try to parlay that into a career in product design somehow; or 
3. switch to mechE, potentially destroy my academic performance this semester, and try to parlay that into product design.\

**TL;DR:**
I'm having a 1/3rd life crisis trying to decide between mechanical engineering and computer engineering  when I really want to be a product designer which I've loved since I graduated from university with a degree in biology. I'm worried that I'm making rash decisions without thinking carefully enough. I need to pick something and stick with it.

Mainly what the equipment is used for, an estimated price tag on the used equipment, and if you know of any good places/websites where I can possibly sell it at.

If I am posting in the wrong subreddit, or if you need a better picture of any of the equipment, then please let me know. I greatly appreciate your help and I'm curious to what y'all come up with! Thanks!

38,Calculating torsional constant of a HSS28x28x5/8 with a hand hole?,1358885609,"Basically, I have a hollow steel section 28x28x5/8 and there is a hand hole in it that measures 9 inches vertically by 6 inches horizontally (the tube is standing vertically).  

The torsional constant equation for thin walled open tubes of uniform thickness is J = (1/3)Ut^3 where t is the thickness (0.625 inches) and U is the length of median boundary (in this case it is 74.875 inches).  

When you do the numbers you get J = 6.09 in^4 (compared to J = 227 in^4 for the full section with no hole).

This is fine but in the application, wouldn't the full sections above and below the hand hole resist some of that torsional buckling?  How can I correctly represent the torsional resistance of the section with the hand hole compared to one without?  

Some added info, the analysis was previously done in STAAD (2D modeling with member properties) and now is being updated with this hand hole.  Nodes were placed at the proper locations and the new moments of inertia and torsional constant were going to be replacing the full section properties at the proper locations.",AskEngineers,reno1051,/r/AskEngineers/comments/172os7/calculating_torsional_constant_of_a_hss28x28x58/
39,Determining torque requirements of a DC motor,1358884671,"So I'm an EE working on my senior design project. Part of our project involves an XY table.

To move the axes of the XY table we're going to use DC motors attached to toothed belts and pulleys.

We never used DC motors during the curriculum so I'm not quite sure how to figure out the specifications of the motors I need to order.

Let's say the motor has a 2.5 inch pulley on its output shaft and the load it has to pull back and forth weighs about 5 pounds. Let's say the load needs to move at a maximum speed of 2 ft/second.

The motor will be pulling the load horizontally and the load will be riding on some kind of bearing(not sure of its specifics either).

**tl;dr: How do I determine how much torque I need my motor to have?**
 
I'm assuming it has to do with:

* the mass of the load
* the friction in the bearings on which to load rides
* the size of the pulley on the motor's output shaft
* the required maximum speed of the load. 

Are there any factors that I've failed to take into account?

Is torque the only thing I need to look at? What about driving voltage and stall current?

Edit: ~~duh, what about output speed? I'm assuming driving it with a lower voltage(or lower duty cycle square wave) would make it go slower..~~ nevermind, I'm dumb. maximum 2 ft/second with a 2.5 inch pulley on the output shaft. Calculation of the maximum required RPMs is left as an exercise for the reader.

The motor controllers we're looking at using have a maximum output current of 3 A at 6 to 28 V. I'm assuming this is ample power to do what I need....",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/172njk/determining_torque_requirements_of_a_dc_motor/

48,Calculating wall thickness for a pulley hub...,1358835131,"I'm trying to determine the minimum wall thickness required for a pulley hub, which will be made from steel tubing, i.e. what would be the minimum thickness to prevent deformation of the hub while in compression (under pulley load). I know the load on the pulley, the diameter of the shaft, and the length of the bearing area. I have a few different material strengths to choose from.

This seems like it should be simple, but I'm drawing a blank (its been a while since I've taken solids), and I cannot find a similar example in any of my texts. It was suggested to me that I look at treating the hub as a pressure vessel, and apply the bearing stress at the inside of the hub wall. However, the only thing I can find to relate to wall thickness is hoop stress, which I don't believe applies here as the load is compressive...or am I wrong?

49,"Fellow Engineers of reddit, can you consult on a possible moral/ethical dilemma? ",1358834404,"Hey all, So I just wanted to gauge if this was a ""douche-bag"" move or if I'm in the right to do what I'm about to do:

So right now I work in Technical sales, consulting, and development for a start up company's North and Latin American division (i.e. US, Mexico, and Brazil). I've only been working at this position for about a month. The base salary is somewhat low but the company gives behavioral bonuses ( a lot of my current coworkers say that usually get 85-95% of the behavioral bonus) every quarter which make my salary package comparable to others who graduated with the same degree as me (Chemical Engineering). I also have my bus pass payed for (around $1000 value/yearly) and will be awarded 20,000 shares (.30/share currently) in the company after 90 days once the quarter ends along with the behavioral bonus.

Now the issue is that my background and passion is in microgrid alternative energy technologies such as gassification, pyrolysis, and catalytic research for PEM and SO fuel cells and a company I've been corresponding with for awhile literally works in everything I'm passionate about and is ready to finally hire me as soon as mid February. The base salary is much higher than my current base but slightly less overal than my current base salary + behavioral bonus combined.

Now the CEO for the company that I want to work for/wants me to join knows I'm working in technical sales so she said I can join her company as soon as I'm available but preferably as soon as possible.

**Now the dilemma is that I'm considering working at my current job until the end of the quarter so I can earn my behavioral bonus, acquire my 20,000 shares so I can sell them all immediately, and leave to work for the company that I personally want to work for.**

The company I'm working for now thinks I'm in in for the long run and is putting a lot of resources into accelerating my training such as flying me out to Italy to do a technical training course next month (because the soonest training course stateside isn't until June), paying for my flights to Mexico and Brazil for business, and handing me a lot of really high profile/value accounts to take charge of.

I've proven to be pretty good at technical sales so far coupled with the fact that I'm the only person fluent in Spanish and Portuguese so I'm pretty much the core of my companies entire latin american division.

**So I ask you all should I be upfront and explain my intentions and leave my current company once I can join the company I would prefer to work for or is it ok for me to wait till the end of the quarter and pretty much cash out as much as I can and then leave even after they had allocated so many resources and responsibilities onto me?**

64,"Capstone: Sourcing assistance needed, high vacuum and high voltage. ",1358784226,"I'm working on my capstone project, and building a Farnsworth Fusor. I had done a quick sourcing about a year ago, in preparation for submitting my design proposal; and now that I've gotten approval and actually beginning to build it, those parts are either no longer available, or in some cases, far more than double the anticipated price. 

If any of you have a source for low cost components for the vacuum and eletrical systems, it would be very much appreciated. I managed to get a good quality vacuum chamber for pittance, by luck of catching one on ebay by someone who had no idea what they had. 

For the vacuum pump, I want to ideally achieve 1x10^-4 ultimate pressure, or lower. I think the Welch 1400 will be the least expensive route, due to them being very common in many industries. Upside is, more pumps are lower price, downside is picking the ones used in labs and not a/c evacuation. I've found a major rebuild kit for $275, and am trying to find a pump below $200 that's not been beat to death. Anyone know a source for the kit at a better price? If the pump fits, anyone know a reputable rebuilt or surplus source? Ebay is proving useless, and I'm aware of the pchemlabs site. 

For sensors, I can never seem to find surplus, or refurb/used (you can replace the sensor for cheaper then a whole new unit). Ideally, I've figured a PVG-500S Pirani Gauge. Any direction here, below cost of new?

Can someone direct me to a place where I can either purchase, or get instructions to make an Oxy-Hydrogren torch? An Ultra-High Voltage feedthrough will cost far too much to purchase, however Dave Coultier has given some instruction on making my own with fused quartz tubes and a metal lathe. Practicing a few times making my own to get it right is still cheaper than buying a refurb. Problem is finding a torch to fuse quartz. Need oxy-hydrogen which everyone talks about and no one sells, unless one of you care to share?

Would it be cheaper to buy used fittings (I'm looking at 6"" cf blank, 2.75"" to vacuum, 6"" reducer to lead glass window, 8"" to feedthrough, and 6"" to sensors) or build a cnc lathe and cut them myself? Sources on ultra cheap pieces could be found where?

I am pretty sure I'm ok on power. I have a 10kV 2A supply that's from a medical lab to work with. If it doesn't, I have another school source. Parts to build a doubling ladder to reach 50kV are cheap on ebay. Going to oil bathe it. 

As per sensors, not only do I need to measure ultimate pressure accurately, I also would -love- to work in some form of x-ray and neutron radiation detection. I've seen information about these, however they are always -really- expensive to implement. If someone knows something I don't, and can give some low-cost direction, it would be a huge help. 

Externally, it's all being run behind lead shielding when at fusion levels. Visuals will be through cctv for safety. Considering setting up for 10kV demoing, without shield for visual show-off (why I want to get cheap lead-glass). Was thinking of trying a SoC computer for data acquisition. I'm weighing to possilibity of multiple raspberry pi's to run cctv/recording and sensors separately, or a single high-power alternative (there's many many other Arm SoC's to choose from). I've done plenty of work with microcontrollers, I wouldn't worry about difficulty of a SoC approach. 

That's basically my project, and where I am and the places I need assistance. If you see any flaws in the plan that could be done better or more cheaply it would be greatly appreciated, and if you 'know a great little shop' then I'm all ears. I am flying solo on this one, so no team to help me, unfortunately.

69,(ex)Civil Engineers or anyone who knows a Civil Engineer. I really need your input. ,1358752407,"Like the title says, I’m looking for some perspective from (ex)civil engineers who had doubt in college whether they would enjoy civil engineering or not. If you switched majors, which one did you switch to? Do you regret it? And those who stayed in civil engineering, do you like what you’re doing now? 

I’m currently a third year civil/structural student, and there’s been a growing worry in the back of my mind about whether civil engineering is the right major for me. I initially went into the major thinking about the massive scale and impact of the projects. However, as I take more classes and find out from other civil engineers about the profession, there are some things that I simply don’t like. For example, 

* Civil is closely tied to economic performance. When the economy is shit, so is the job market.  
* There are sub disciplines within civil with almost no overlap (structural, geotech, environmental), which dilutes the job market. 
* The lack of ability to break into other industries.
* There’s only one shot to build a building. That means A LOT of planning and managing involved leaving less time for engineering, whereas other disciplines are afforded the ability to build in iterations and improve their product.  
* Structural engineering feels like having the architect designs the building and hands off the calculation off to you. You get the hard work with no creative input, just making sure it passes code. 

Anyways, that’s a list of major things about Civil that has been bothering me. I’m starting to envy those who went the mechanical and electrical route because at the first job, they get to design and build cool things, something tangible that they get to hold at the end of the day and say I built this machine/circuit. I on the other hand, has to go through job experience and licensure before I’m directly involved with building design. 

Am I being too negative here? Is this just the syndrome of ‘The grass is always greener’?  Or is my worry warranted? Current or Ex civil engineers. Please be as brutally honest as you can.

80,Battery Backup: C/10 vs C/20 ,1358626674,"Need to address my ignorance on batteries and hopefully you guys will help.

Not knowing much, I GYM'd (FYI: Google / Yahoo / Microsoft search engines) it and got some understanding about how batteries are rated. 

But somethings are still not clear: 

Basically, all sources said that battery capacity in AH weren't completley meaningful as they change based on the load (current drawn). Thus, the C rating - C5, C10, C20 etc. - help with this with some standard hours, making it easier to compare the capacity of the battery in the market based on the discharge rate. 

So,

A 150 AH battery at C20, will last for 20 hours on a load of 7.5 A ( = 150AH / 20H)  
A 150 AH battery at C10 will last for 10 hours on a load of 15 A ( = 150AH / 10H)  
A 150 AH battery at C5 will last for 5 hours at a load of 30 A ( = 150AH / 5H)  

(or, we can also say that a 150 AH at C20 can provide a constant discharge current of 7.5 A for 20 hours, and so on ... )

So far so good, but this is where I get confused - 
How do we compare the backup duration of, say a 150 AH at C10 vs a 150 AH at C20 under varying load? Does a lower C rated battery provide more backup or less backup when the AH are the same? 

Most resources mention Peukert constant and so on to point out that discharge rate is not linear and higher the discharge rate, the lower the capacity. Understood, but it still doesn't clarify my doubt - the relationship between C ratings to figure out which gives more backup duration.

(This is for a home UPS).

The short version:  Is it acceptable to keep treat a heat number as a uniform batch for traceability if parts of the batch see different temperatures BEFORE they are re-heat treated?

Scenario:

You are heat treating a batch of 100 pcs of steel in an inline furnace (they have the same heat number from the mill).  You test the 4th piece and it does not meet spec.  By this time, pieces 20-40 are in one of the furnaces.  You decide to increase the tempering temperature.  Piece 41 is tested and passes.  You re-run pieces 1-40 at the same settings after 41-100 are complete.  (also, the number of times heat treated may or may no be the same, some once, some twice.)

90,"Another one of those threads: currently in Highschool, should I pursue Engineering in college?",1358558439,"Hey there, thanks for looking. I don't mean to seem like every other dreamy eyed highschool kid who makes these thread. Just wondering if you, a real person with experience, had any advice for someone still unsure of where they're going in life.
(Engineering life story below, skip this paragraph for the actual question)
I am currently thinking of college, and engineering in particular. Ever since middle school ""engineering class"" (we went into our school shop, teacher printed out Project Lead the Way designs, and we made them) I've been interested in it. Autodesk Inventor is what we'd use, and I was well ahead of most in my class using it. Then highschool came, and with it Intro to Engineering, the PLTW class. I was bored out of my mind. 90% of the kids didn't give a shit, and literally played games (someone found a copy of the first HALO, it was downloaded on all computers for nearly the entire year) While I found the computer work easy and often got it done well ahead and then joined in/ destroyed HALO lan matches, I didn't enjoy the class as much as I thought I would. Coming from an awesome middle school engineering teacher and ""honors"" engineering class, where we worked with saws, Autodesk Inventor, and sanded our projects until our hands were raw, to Intro where the highlight of the year was gluing together a cube from smaller cubes, my interest waned considerably.
My question is, (yes, i actually had a question ;) ) should I pursue engineering in college, even though I've ""missed"" (didn't take in favor of other electives) two years of engineering classes (currently a junior). Or will I learn/catch up more then enough to do well? I'd assume taking PLTW classes in highschool would put you ahead of a majority of new engineers. I'm currently in AP Calc AB, next year ill be Calc BC and AP physics.
Just wondering your opinions, as it's getting closer to senior year and I've rarely narrowed down any college choices, i'm giving careers a good hard look and from what I can tell engineering is one of the most rewarding in that you actually make/design/test things people use, with the potential to invent or innovate something that changes the world (with a little help from the business side).",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/16uoit/another_one_of_those_threads_currently_in/

Can I place a ""dummy load"" Q at the mid-span to find the deflection in the direction of Q that is caused by load P if I ultimately set Q to zero? I would solve for the new strain energy due to bending which will include both Q and P. I would then take the partial derivative of U w.r.t Q. If I then set Q to zero would that be the mid-span deflection caused by the single load P?   
 
According to the tables in the back of my text book:
Mid-span deflection due to an end load P is d = (5/48EI)PL^3 

However when I do what I stated above I get d = (1/6EI)PL^3

Is my process wrong? Is my math wrong? Is this difference due to the fact I'm neglecting U from shear? 
http://i.imgur.com/obxxV.jpg 
It's been about 5 years since I've used Castigliano's theorem.
Any help would be awesome. This is just for fun, not HW or anything. I already graduated. 

Update: My limits were wrong and I wasn't using the theorem properly. You can't just simply square the internal bending moment equation. The 2nd M in the M^2 term is a partial derivative. Partial of M w.r.t the dummy load Q. Here is my redo: http://i.imgur.com/vkbtNZQ.jpg 
This is a very powerful tool in finding deflections in any direction and location. You can place a dummy load anywhere to find the deflection in that location and direction as a result of other multiple applied loads.

The original pressure vessel is ~ 12 "" long and will see a pressure of 60 Mpa outwards, this will only act radially i.e. no end caps to worry about. Originally the plan was to get a 5"" O.D. steel billet and machine a 1.5 "" hole out of the center of it.

I guess the simplest way to deduce this would be to see how much extra energy is required to move the car from point A to point B with the extra cargo, then use the engine's power output to deduce the amount of fuel this would take or something like that. However, I'm not sure that this will work and that this whole thing is highly dependent on the car. But what do you think of this method? Would it give a reasonable approximation or not?

I'm just going to lay out my ideas in hopes that you guys can dissect them and let me know if I've got my head in the clouds or if it'll be possible to **feed everyone on the planet**.

* First off, I want to build a multilevel structure, really as high as possible, depending on the needs of the business.

* Second, I want to grow fish and other plants in an aquaponics system such as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JFs5V4YaTY) on every level. We're talking floors full of independent systems that trade nutrients and water between fish and plants (minus the awesome accent).

* Third, I want to cover the building in some sort of low cost high efficiency solar panel structure, [such as](http://planetsave.com/2012/08/28/low-cost-high-efficiency-solar-power-breakthrough/) that would allow the building to run without a power source in less developed areas.

 So that's pretty much it. It seems like systems such as these are pretty efficient in people backyards and stuff, but I've looked around and can't see anyone using aquaponics in a mass scale such as this idea. Obviously, the amount of power needed to run this system will be extensive, and I really don't have any numbers for you guys to crunch, but I don't know where to turn next. It seems to me the biggest problem with famine in the less developed countries is the lack of arable land and water. Well, this system eliminates the need for soil, because the plants can be grown in a shallow layer of gravel and get their nutrients from the fish waste. I guess my question, after reading all of this, would be: Is this feasible? Even if this is a really expensive project to get off the ground, people make donation to feed children all over the world in immense quantities. Rather than giving them fish for a day, I say we grow them their own. Please leave me any feedback or advice on how to improve this idea and/or tell me if I'm crazy.

58,Compressed Air Drying,1358255359,"I am a mining engineer at a mine and I have been tasked with solving the problem of our compressed air lines freezing.

So far I have realized that the compressor on the surface is raising the temperature of the air which is allowing it to soak up more water. When that air line goes into the mine the temperature drops below the dew point, especially on cold days. This causes the water to condensate and when the lines aren't used that water freezes, causing a blockage in the line.

Basically I am thinking that an ""after cooler"" will be an cheap and easy way to dry our air. As I understand this needs to be on the surface right after the compressor and before the receiving tank. My concern/question is that the after cooler, as I understand it, will cool the air to the ambient temperature. The ambient temperature in this case is the outside environment which is cold. The air will then travel into the mine which is most likely going to be colder than outside, and won't that just cause instant condensation at the bottom of our shaft? 

Is the bulk water storage part of the after cooler that will collect water before it enters the mine?

We really just need our lines to not freeze. So I wouldn't think we need 100% of the water removed. Any advice on this is appreciated as well.
Any information would be greatly appreciated. I am new to compressed air and need direction from r/engineering.

I should probably mention that we are talking about a compressor that delivers around 3000 CFM at 100 PSI. Is an after cooler feasible at such volumes?",AskEngineers,cweese,/r/AskEngineers/comments/16m6e1/compressed_air_drying/

I'm making a USB charger and I'm a little confused by the maximum current that is allowed.

79,Would anyone be interested in an Open Sourced Ventilator project?,1358125363,"I mean a medical breathing machine when I say ventilator.

Problem: Ventilators and CPAP/BiPap machines cost well into the thousands of dollars. There exist many at-risk patients who cannot afford this or do not have insurance that will cover it.

Method: In theory as far as I can tell a ventilator type device (pumping only air) consists of an air pump, a flow valve, and a pressure limiter as well as a flowmeter, and pressure meter. The critical functions of the device are controlling the valves and pressure limiter based on inputs from the meters as well as an internal timer.

Expected result: A circuit board design and supporting microcontroller software to run the unit which in theory could use any available set of valves, pumps, and meters provided all of the parts were there.

Why? It seems like in a critical situation one could probably build a ventilator for under $1000 before including batteries. Opening the standard would challenge pricing on the basic units. This in turn would free up more patient funds for other features (like buying more batteries) as well as expanding access to critical care devices by allowing for more variety of mechanical components to be used.

- I was considering storing the compost itself in mesh-floored drawers arranged in a number of layers to maximize SA:V ratio and decomposition rate.

- Warm, delicious compost air would be vented w/ a small fan through an insulated pipe. This would narrow to a thin tube and run through a radiator-like heat sink inside the structure. Another small fan would circulate indoor air around this, hopefully yielding some heat.

- Compost air would vent outdoors without mixing with indoor air so the building wouldn't smell shitty and its occupants could continue to get laid.

So this is my first post, and I'm looking for some help.  If you guys think there's a better subreddit, could you please point me that way?  I have a quite a few questions in this post, so I appreciate any and all help I get! 

The quick back story, I'm a college student (ENT/MKT major) and I love to tinker with things.  A while ago my mom asked me to make her a new kind of snow brush.  Being that my mom is awesome, I'm trying to make one for her.  So far I'm about 75% done, but I'm stuck.  :(  Sadly I don't know a lot about engineering which is where I hope you guys come in... 

So here are my questions I'm really hoping you guys can help me out with...

1)  Does anyone know how the bristles in snow brushes are inserted?  I've asked some EGR buddies and they weren't sure.  At first I thought it was a form/poured type of situation, but when you look at them it looks like drill marks?  If they're inserted, does anyone know how specifically?

2)  Secondly, since I just needed to make one brush, I thought I could just buy some brushes with longer bristles and basically tear a brush apart and reuse them.  However that's become a rather huge pain/mess.  I've looked around online, but I cannot for the life of me find a synthetic bristle seller in the US, let alone someone who would sell me a small quantity.  I keep finding manu's in china that want to see tons, or thousands of dollars worth which obviously is a no-can-do.  I think i might try to ask for a 'test sample' but I am leery dealing with people so far outside the US.

3)  This one doesn't have to do with the brush.  There's a type of spring loaded pin that I always see in extension ladders/tables.  You push the two balls on the ends in, and then extend, and the spring pops them back out at the next available hole.  Does anyone know what the name of that spring is? or how to go about building one?  I'm mostly stuck on attaching the ends so they don't pop out...  I've gone to all the hard-wares in my area, and they couldn't help.  Hopefully the Reddit Gods know a little more than they do.

That's all I have, thanks a lot for reading this guys.

TLDR:  Trying to build a snow brush for my mom...  Do you know how they're made? where I can buy small amounts of synthetic bristles? Do you know anything about spring loaded pins?

* A continuous miner operator sitting on the machine is exposed to a noise level of 90 dB(A) when sat 3m from the noise source. If this operation were to be made a line of site remote operation with the operator being a equivalent distance of 12m away from the noise source what would his noise exposure be?

* Determine the equivalent 8 hour noise exposure level for a worker exposed to an equivalent continuous sound pressure of 80dB(A) over a 12 hour shift?

Yours in servitude.

I recently graduated college back in december '11 and landed this job in July '12.  I used adderall a handful of times during my college years for the pure reason to study.  Other than that, i've never abused any other drug.  I've never even touched weed.

I also used it recently to study for the GRE back in October.  There are no records of me using adderall and anyone that knows I've taken it knows not to disclose the usage and anyone that may silp up, I can attribute to my fraternity brothers using it and they must have mistaken me to be lumped in with them.  From what I read, since my last usage was so recent (3 months), there is not enough time to mitigate concerns regarding drug use.  

I currently have three options:  I can be 100% upfront and most likely get denied clearance because of recent use, I can be half honest and say that I have done it back in college and not mention the GRE since I really didn't tell anyone I did it (but someone may slip up anyway when they get grilled), so that way if it comes up, I didn't omit information, or I can flat out not mention it and make sure all my friends know to not mention it.

44,2.2 metre cantilever in the design of a prefabricated tower. I need some structural advice. Photos and diagrams included.,1357659546,"Hi everyone, I have a question regarding the floor and wall construction of a prefabricated timber module if it were to have a cantilever of over the end corners of the building.  I've included some diagrams / images in this post to help show what I mean.

I am designing an apartment tower made up of prefabricated modules for an architecture studio. The professors criticised the structure and suggested we ask an engineer! So here I am. I'd be very grateful for any advice or a nod in the right direction. Thanks in advance.

I would like the type of floor and wall construction to be timber for the reason that it's flexible and would make craning the modules onto site less of a mission. 

The main problem with the structure is that to give the building its [appearance](http://imgur.com/a/qFz1H) I need to cantilever out by 2.2 metres at the far corners. I am wondering, what type of structural system would be best suited to this type of cantilever. The floors and walls are currently 350 / 300mm thick but I am unsure what sort of beams would need to run through the floors and how it would connect to the central wall. Here are images of the [floor plans and the construction detail](http://imgur.com/a/aTvqQ) at the edge where two of the modules connect. 

Ideally, the dead loads would all run through the central core. The cantilever would also need to support the weight of the glass along the facades. 

Let me know if this is too vague as I will upload more drawings!

46,Manufacturing process for a custom linear actuator platform,1357630036,"I'm attempting to do some DIY mechanical engineering.  I'm trying to figure out how to manufacture a custom platform for a lead screw/stepper motor mechanism.  The goal is to create a compact platform that attaches to a 1/4"" or 3/16"" lead screw (6""-12"" long).  The platform has to have two parallel rack gears on one side.   Here is a ridiculous ASCII diagram of the mechanism:

     ____________________
    |            ________|
    |     __    |_|______   &lt;- Rack gear
    |    |__|    ________|
    |           |_|_________&lt;- Rack gear
    |_______________________|

The hole on the left is for the lead screw and nut (not to scale).  The slots on the right are for a pair of pinions that support a vertical shaft.  Another  mirrored platform sits opposite to this, allowing the independent platforms to move together to translate the shaft, and opposing to rotate the shaft.

So the question is what an affordable, hobbiest method of manufacturing this?  It seems like something that can be assembled from layers.  What kind of plastic should I use? The mechanism doesn't have to move very fast.  I think 2-3 in/s max.  

I don't have any of the tools to mill/drill or machine the platform myself.  I can generate mechanical drawings for a fabrication shop, but I want to know what to ask for, and I'm a little paranoid about over-engineering this.

 I'm building a ship out of metal; Album Link: http://imgur.com/a/7VWpl.

It's relatively light at 30-40 Lbs, measuring about four feet long by three feet tall. My overall plan is to mount it to a wall. Every part of the ship will be moving; the sails will move in and out as if they're being blown by the wind, the masts that hold the sails will move up and down, and the body of the ship will rock giving the illusion that it's sailing on rough seas. 

My first thought was a crank shaft, but I decided that the movement would be too repetitive and uninteresting after a few minutes. Ideally I'm looking for random or semi-random movement that eventually will conclude with the ship realigning itself into its normal form, if possible.

Today I found a Sculptor named Reuben Margolin that uses sine waves to create movement. He constructs a linear wave in which he adds one wave with three peeks and a second wave with four peeks, creating random/semi-random movement using circular motion.

Here is a link with him describing/showing the idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dehXioMIKg0  7:00-9:35.

I was thinking of using his circular motion idea and building a clock above the ship with arms that turn and give it the sine wave movements. I also like the idea that different parts of the ship would move at different speeds depending on which hand it's connected to (hour hand, minute hand, and second hand). Then I could connect a weight to the clock that slowly falls and provides the energy to move like a cuckoo clock.

The idea of using waves and time to move the ship really excites me. I feel like this is my strongest idea for the moving ship so far, but I'm here to seek advice if anyone else has different ideas or tips to help guide me in the right direction.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Any suggestions or questions would be greatly appreciated!

Diagram: http://i.imgur.com/HEiS5.gif

The circles are wheels, and the ball-bearing friction on these imaginary wheels can be ignored for this question. The black thing in the middle represents a load of arbitrary size. Gravity is normal, surface is flat.

Question: what would a stress-strain curve for the force of the weight look like? How can I achieve a flat-line here? Would a torsion spring at the fulcrum be a better solution?

I basically need someone to lay this out in a physics program and tell me how to achieve a constant force against the weight, which would make the weight accelerate downwards naturally at a fraction of the gravitational constant.

Make sense? I'll answer any question to the best of my ability. I need someone who knows a lot about springs who could recommend a simple setup like this using the cheapest parts available. I'm not going for perfection...I'd be happy with a near-flat stress-strain curve. This theoretical 2d rig would have to support about 50kg and would need to reduce its fall rate by 1/2.

For school I need to create a structure called a boomilever (cantilever), the basic skeleton of one is shown is the pictures above. The challenge is essentially to build a support system to hold up a 15 kg. weight hanging under the structure. I know the basic idea for building one (lots of triangles...) but is there any design that's mathematically the ""best"" design? The winning boomilever will be chosen based on the lowest weight, and if it survives the 15 kg..

Feel free to re-upload the pictures with your best design, ms paint is fine.

More details:

-I'm aiming for about .5 meters long (1.5 feet)

-The weight can't be more than 25 cm from the lowest point of the 
structure

-It can only be wood, I was thinking of balsa.

**edit**
-The weight is required to hang at the end of the structure must be (when measured from the centre) 40-45 cm. from the wall

-adhesive used being only glue (not putty)

-all parts of the structure more than 1.3 cm. away from the structure must be made out of wood (doesn't specify what type, it just says it can't be bamboo)

-and there isn't any restriction to the sizes of individual pieces of wood

 If you have any more questions, please ask.

I'm a physics postgrad working on developing some vacuum equipment, and as part of my project I have to measure the permeation of gaseous helium through various types of glass, at pressures down to UHV (say 10^-9 Torr). The glass is a 500-micron thick circular 1"" wafer, uniformly clamped (glued) at the circumference, with an evacuated chamber on one side, and a chamber with variable helium pressure on the other. Before doing any lab work, my supervisor has asked me to do some calculations of what sort of relative pressures my glass samples can withstand before breaking. Obviously we don't want the samples breaking, if nothing else because the fragments would *wreck* the turbopump blades. If you want more information on the experiment setup, I can give it to you, but hopefully that's all the background we need.

I'm basically here to ask for help on how to calculate what the safe limits of my system will be. My supervisor has already shown me [this page](http://mech.vub.ac.be/teaching/info/Ontwerpmethodologie/Appendix%20les%203%20Useful%20Problems.pdf) (pdf warning) with some relevant equations on it, but during my undergrad and masters I didn't spend a lot of time studying this area so my background knowledge isn't excellent. I intend to get hold of some of the reference texts in the bibliography, but in the mean time I've looked up things like the [Kirchoff-Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_theory) theory for thin plates, but on Wiki it looks like a dense mess of contextless tensor maths which I have trouble following.

I'm just a first year engineering student so I am still a bit naive and unsure about the practical aspect of engineering, so I hope to ask a few questions. Pretty soon I have to select my specific engineering major, and I have been researching and I feel like mineral/mining (are they the same?) seems pretty good. It's not an overly competitive faculty, meaning I can most likely get in, and it's very small compared to something like electrical engineering which is about 5 times larger. What surprised me the most is that mineral/mining engineering seems to be one of the most well-paying careers, yet it is in high demand relative to others. I was wondering, why is this? Is there a reason no one wants to do the work? Is the education more difficult? The work unpleasant? Any kind of info you can help give would be very much appreciated.

I am at a loss for where to start. I often wonder if I could make a sort of hour candle using a tube and some sort of slow venting plunger. A long time ago I concocted ideas for making a microwave attachment. I also wonder if I could get a simple signal sent into my phone from an outside source and to register it. 

Heck I would be happy to be able to figure out exactly how a high school teacher turned some old style ball mice into buzzers (only first press registered) for a programming competition. 

If life has taught me anything I imagine the first thing someone will say is to pick up some items and do. With that assumption I would imagine starting at the buzzer problem would be an excellent middle ground. 

I guess I would begin by assuming and click of a mouse completes a circuit. With the ball removed we can potentially assume no data transmission (or be thorough and yank wires to test what happens when, this is a fuzzy spot for next step).

30,I'm about to graduate from mechanical engineering. Did I make a mistake?,1356888869,"I am a 23 year old mechanical engineering student that will be graduating from a state university this May and I have no idea what I am going to do after. I am beginning to think I have made a mistake in choosing mechanical engineering. I have been doing a lot of things to try to make up my mind but haven’t been able to decide what I should do.

**School Info:**

I obsess with knowing how to do things perfectly. I read all my textbooks for fear of missing information, even though I could get good grades without knowing all that info. When I find the answer to a homework problem I redo it using all the methods I’ve learned. I see this as a disadvantage because (in my experience) supervisors want their engineers to solve the problem as quickly as possible, even if there might be a better method out there.

I really enjoy school. I am good at school; I have a 3.7 (92.5% avg). That being said, I don’t know if I enjoy the engineering part of school or just school in general. I like to sit down with a problem, solve it, give it to the teacher, and they tell me how well I did. I like having the feedback of grades. E.g. if you get an A, you did well.  This doesn’t necessarily mean I want to continue school. I want to know what it means to enjoy school; what would I be good at if I like school?

I thought about going to graduate school because I enjoy school. I got a job working for a professor to see if grad school would be for me. It has only been one semester and I haven’t decided. Plus, it might be too late to sign up to go to grad school in the fall.

I have also thought about switching majors. I liked my math, chem, and phys classes and it bothers me that we only use the very basics of the stuff from those classes in my current classes. Also, I really liked the general programming class I took and thought software or computer engineering might be for me. I talked to the advisors in that department and sat in on a few classes. Still, I could not make up my mind.

**Internship Info:**

I have had two internships. The first one was eight months long in quality engineering at a furnace manufacturer. The second one was 3 months long in a medical device company as a manufacturing engineer. The first thing I noticed was that things were not as concrete as they were in school. It is hard to explain why I didn’t enjoy it much. It had something to do with not having solid solutions and feedback. I did enjoy the second internship more. Not just because I liked the place more, but because I had more experience and felt more comfortable.

I tried to get an internship as a design or research engineering but was unable to. I did talk to some of the design and research engineers in my company and it seemed like just another department within the company.

**Summary:**

I believe I could get an engineering job before I graduate but I want to find something that I really like doing. Things that I am considering are:

* Grad school in mechanical engineering
* Undergrad school in software/comp engineering
* Engineering job right after I get my BS in ME
* Anything

I feel like I am being picky. Most people would be happy just to get a job but I want to be happy/excited/content with going to work every day. I would really appreciate anyone who could give me insight on what I should do. I want a goal to shoot for before I head back to school from winter break.

57,"Request for Professional Opinions Regarding the Claims Made in the Documentary ""Revelations of the Pyramids.""",1356627459,"Hi. Recently watched the doc, ""Revelation of the Pyramids"" (full: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ooy2LTJoMVM#!), and the end claim was hinged on numerous seemingly unexplainable mathematical and engineering feats for that time. To me, a guy with a pitiful grasp of both subjects, it was incredibly astonishing. I am skeptical however, and would be incredibly appreciative if experts in these fields would shed light and give an objective second opinion on the validity of these claims and if they are as mind-blowing and unexplainable as they seem to laymen.

Claims Included (taken from http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread842144/pg1):
...
3) The Great Pyramid has 3 chambers inside. With breath taking precision, the builders cut a passage through the solid rock, 300 feet long by 3 feet wide, to reach the lowest chamber.

Architects claim that keeping the tunnel at the exact same angle is a mind blowing feat that would have needed very special tools. Precision tools that would have to be needed for the entire building process. That which cannot be explained by a copper chisel and stone.

4) The builders worked with more than 2 million stones, all of different shapes and sizes, making accurate building much more difficult. Despite this, the upper chamber is perfectly horizontal and vertical. The builders got it right to 1/50th of an inch. This is a feat any modern structural engineer would envy. The Great Pyramid stayed in tact through earthquakes that flattened everything around it (or would if they occurred).

5) The position of the Great Pyramid is absolutely precise. It points North within 5 hundredths of a degree. Even in the 17th century, thousands of years after the Great Pyramid was built, they could not come close to that degree of accuracy.

6) The Great Pyramid has 8 sides, as several aerial photos have shown the apparent illusion. Building an 8 sided pyramid is much more complicated than building a 4 sided pyramid. The accuracy had to have had been to a centimetre, a millimetre. With all building techniques and modern tools, architects and structural engineers claim we would be in big trouble....

8) In 1859, an Englishman John Taylor, discovered if you calculate the two prominent dimensions of the pyramid, you get the mathematical formula for Pi, one of the building blocks of science, mathematics and engineering. A structural engineer goes on to explain the significance of Pi in the Great Pyramid: The half perimeter of the pyramid is the biggest horizontal visible dimension and its height is the biggest verticial invisible dimension. However to get the visual and explanation you need to watch the video....

9) If you look at the various dimensions of the pyramid, each part can be multipled by a whole number to give the total height of the Great Pyramid. The surface of the 4 sides, divided by the surface of the base equals the famous Golden Ratio, one of the key principles of aesthetics and design. The Golden Ratio is unique and occurs all over the natural world, from plants, to the human form and great art, a constant in the universe. By dividing the half perimeter by the total height, you get the Golden Ratio squared.

10) If you draw two circles, one inside, and one outside the base of the Great Pyramid. If you subtract the length of the inside circle from the length of the outside circle, you get the Speed of Light at 299,792458, this is the number in the pyramid: 299,79 ",AskEngineers,MementoMori29,/r/AskEngineers/comments/15iwsz/request_for_professional_opinions_regarding_the/

Mechanical engineering has always appealed to me because of how ""tangible"" that it seemed.

I've been planning on switching again at the end of this academic school year, but figured it would be worthwhile to get some outside opinion on this matter.

I've thought about EE quite a lot this past semester and realized that EE has tangible aspects of its own- it's used in designing laptops, headphones, cellphones, etc etc.

However, my dad says that people who design such products make up a very small percentage of electrical engineers, and that 95% of all electrical engineers in the end will end up coding chips all day (using VHDL, if I remember right).

I value my father's opinion a lot because he's an software engineer himself, but is he right in what he says? I'd prefer not to code chips and play around with VHDL all day, so realistically speaking, what other possible career opportunities am I looking at if I stick with EE?

Lastly, does the major I stick with truly make that big of a difference in terms of what my future holds?

85,Have an idea for a new gaming mouse. (Trying to reinvent the wheel.) Maybe this is a safer place to suggest it?,1356256259,"The basic premise: to move all movement controls (WASD) to the mouse, leaving all other controls on the keyboard. Accomplished with a mouse that has two new directional buttons in place of the wheel, to serve as Up and Down (while LMB and RMB perform as Left and Right).

The reason: It all comes down to keeping your fingers on the keys. If WASD are your directional keys, and you want to use any other control (like swapping weapons or calling for a medic), you have to let go of your movement controls. And letting go of your ability to maneuver, even for an instant, can be lethal. But with all the movement handled by the mouse you'd never have to let go, you'd never have to sacrifice maneuverability again. 

It would also free your hand from it's traditional anchorage at WASD where all other controls have to stay within reach. 

Controlling movement with the same hand that controls perspective ought to be quite natural. The only learning curve I predict is in the FPS genre, where firing with one hand and aiming with the other might be awkward, or less effective with reflex shots. You might argue that with a gun IRL you aim and fire with the same hand, but I think that's misleading. Anyone who knows what they're doing fires a gun with both hands, and aims with their whole body, not just from the wrist forward. The real learning curve is muscle memory, but we reteach ourselves new game controls with almost ever new game.

Batteries seemed like a boring option to me, so I had a look at using a compressor to store the energy as compressed air that then flows through a turbine and generates electricity. The main problem seemed to be the heat exchanges that needed to occur (hot during day, cold during night)  . Then I got to thinking why not do it the other way round and store the energy as a vacuum by pumping air out of a vessel during the day then putting on a turbine to harness power from air returning to the vessel at night. My hopes are that this could also create a cooling effect through the day (Maybe for air conditioning or a cold room) then heat at night (for... heating). 
I assume that because I couldn't find any information about this it can't be done, maybe the vessel would need to be ridiculously strong, or perhaps there would just be too many losses in efficiency, but I was hoping to get an answer so I can get some closure on the issue and/or get on with designing them something that will actually work.

With a few differences though, which is why I can't just go to a hobby shop and pick up a pre-made set. However, I'm not to familiar with the terminology or math I'd need because it's not my field of study. 

I have a power supply already done. What I need is the transmission, motor, and axles that will physically move everything. 

Requirements:

1. Simple as possible. Direct motor, to axle, to wheel setup would be best. 
2. It should not be able to turn (goes in with simple as possible)
3. entire platform should weigh less than 1kg, probably going to be around 0.8 kg at max. 

What I'm asking is where should I look for parts like this? How would I be able to choose a proper motor? (Power supply is around 10V with approximately 10 amps as well). Also, knowing proper terms for things would also be helpful.

12,Abrasion resistance for outside of piping?,1356022222,"Hello Folks,

I'm currently working on a project in the material conveying industry, and have come across a scenario that I am not very well versed in.  We tend to specify abrasion resistant elbows and pipe in some projects depending on the abrasivity of the material we're conveying.  In this application, however, we are more concerned with the external abrasion as a result of the gas flow (flue gas with fly ash) around our pipe.  I'm not very familiar with getting externally hardened pipe.  From what I've seen, the majority of hardened steels and cast iron have tapering hardness towards the outside of the pipe.  From what I've found, the resulting outside hardness is lower than we are looking for.  We're shooting for about a Brinnell hardness of 450 on 2"" ID pieces of pipe of 10' and 14' in length.

My question are this: 

1) Is hardened exterior piping something even exists?  I have had a hard time locating it.

2) What are my best options for hardening the exterior of pipe? Hardfacing?  Ceramics? Induction hardening?

Thanks guys!

13,Non Engineer looking for help with fabrics (material science I suppose),1356017233,"My background is Math. I'm in the process of designing a custom seat. Here is a description of the problem as I understand it:

&gt; The seat is a piece of fabric strung across two metal rails. The rails are roughly 40 cm apart (adjustable to tweak tension), and about 20 cm long. The seat must not stretch downwards more than 3-4 cm when it is sat upon (assume the heaviest person who will use it is 150kg). What sort of fabric should I use for this? How much tension will it need? The rails are laser-cut steel, what should I cover the edges with to reduce wear? Can I just hand the fabric along with the design to a tailor to have it cut and sewn the way I want?

While I could just start buying fabrics and trying them out, I thought I might ask some engineers about it first... What sorts of fabrics should I look for? Where can I find them?

The idea is to have a 3-DOF manipulator mounted on a mobile robot. I want the manipulator to correct for small disturbances made by the base, for example I want to keep the end-effector at a fixed location while the base moves around (obviously within the workspace of the manipulator).

I understand to do this I need to take the position of the fixed location, subtract the current position of the end-effector and that is my error to be corrected. What I don't understand is how to form a block diagram and transfer function to represent the system.

I have the Jacobian\Inverse Jacobian and forward\inverse kinematics calculated, and I'm using a vision system that can track the position, velocity, and acceleration of the end-effector.

I want to come up with a block diagram of the system that corrects the end-effector position using PID control so that I can derive a transfer function. Once I've got the transfer function, I'll be able to do analysis on the control system to determine the various gains and sampling times I can use that ensure stability, I'm just not sure how to take that first step and form the transfer function.

Inside the chamber I have a soccer ball connected to a hose that runs through a penetrator and outside the altitude chamber. At 50,000ft, the outside pressure is so great, it causes the ball to inflate. If I tie the line back to the chamber then it equalizes.

I'm writing a story right now and I would really like to ask you guys for some theoretical help. I have no one in my personal life who could answer this and I was wondering if you guys had any thoughts or places I could go to seek out more information.

**The point**:

I have a huge domed city in a story I'm writing, and I mean it's huge. In my head it's around 50 miles in diameter and built using giant honeycombs for integrity. There's also a large station suspended above the top in which a lot of environmental control systems are housed.

I need to know how 'tall' this dome would need to be, assuming the materials are advanced enough where their strength is irrelevant to the design and cost is no object. I don't want to say that this dome is 1 mile tall and 50 miles wide and have someone get up in my business about how the grade of the honeycombs might not make sense (or that honeycombs are impossible in this design - that is another thing that can change if I've misunderstood something about it).

Why is this all important? Well, I don't want to give a lot away about the story (especially if it sucks so bad that it's unpublishable - but that's a problem for /r/writing, not you guys :)) but something big falls off the ECS and I want to know how long it will fall before it impact a building.

I'm visiting a friend in Europe, and I brought my American PS2 and a few games with me on the trip.

The problem is that after running fine for about a minute or two, the console will power down without warning. Interestingly, if one continues to power it back up, again and again, it seems to take less and less time for it to power itself down, eventually powering down immediately after being powered on.

* I want the red LED for kicks, how much will it harm performance and how can I minimize this? Hook it up in parallel with the other diode, or just lose the LED?

* In steady sunlight, do solar cells' output fluctuate much and could this harm a phone?

I'm using my GI Bill as I was in the Navy in their nuclear power program.  I work extremely hard at school and receive top grades (I got my first B last semester, 89.2, assholes).  I don't have to work because my GI Bill pays my rent, which allows me to focus more on school.  I realized that I have two years to shape myself in to the BEST entry level candidate possible.  What can I do to capitalize on this?  

I know getting an internship is crucial, but what else? Should I be involved in school programs? Volunteering? Should I be trying to make contacts in the engineering field? 

The last question might be a bit off topic, but as a female (an attractive female, at that) how can I show people that I'm not just a pretty face and that I have worked extremely hard for what I've achieved, and also that I will work hard for their company.

79,[Controls/Panel Equipment] I need the name for a physical switch that will only operate when powered,1355500846,"I have 6 signals coming in and going out of a cabinet.  Under certain circumstances we want to hijack the incoming signal, modify it, and put it out on the same output that was previously being used.

However, we want to make it so that the PLC that's modifying the signal is physically not in the signal path whenever the operator hasn't turned the switch to ""test"" mode.

We also want it to be failsafe, so that if the PLC dies the switch won't do anything.

My thought was a switch that requires power to operate and which returns (hopefully spring-return or something) to the ""not-test"" mode when power is lost.

I'd like to put a watchdog relay in the cabinet and wire that to the cabinet power and cut the cabinet power in the event of a PLC failure, which would hopefully pop this switch to ""not-test"" mode and lock it in that mode so no one can turn it (unless they lift, bro).

Also I'd like to do this with one physical switch for all 6 signals, but that's not a requirement.  I can easily tell the operators they have to turn 6 switches.  Of course, this introduces failure points which is undesirable.

Anyway, my biggest disadvantage in this (cabinet design) is that I don't know the terminology really well.  Does this have to do with things like ""pull"" and ""throw?""

91,Laboratory Vacuum Pump: What's the best way to create an inert atmosphere using a positive displacement pump when pulling vacuum then repeatedly flushing with inert gas? (leakage / backstreaming),1355453995,"If I pull a partial vacuum to 50 millitorr but then it stops, there is some sort of a steady-state flow of air/oil moving into the system, correct? The only other option to maintain a constant 50 millitorr seems impossible, which would be the gas molecules inside the chamber are ""fixed"". If there is either backstreaming of oil into the chamber that I'm trying to evacuate and fill up with high purity inert gas, or there is some sort of a leak so outside air is getting inside the chamber, what would be the best way to get a clean atmosphere?

Example: I attach a quartz tube onto the vacuum pump hose, and tighten down the hose clamp. Now I pull a vacuum so the quartz tube is partially evacuated. The gauge goes to 2,000 millitorr fairly quickly, about 10 seconds, and in another 20 seconds the chamber is at 30 millitorr. Now the gauge stops moving and holds steady at 30 millitorr. I then turn the valve to cut off the vacuum pump. At this point, **sometimes the gauge pressure starts to rise, and other times it remains fairly still**. Then I'll fill the quartz tube up with high purity argon. I repeat this process 2 more times, and then I'm ready to seal the quartz tube.

Assumption: My sample is not outgassing.

Details: I use some vacuum silicone grease, the oil on the vacuum gets changed regularly as well as the filter. I want as pure of an atmosphere as possible, i.e. 100% argon. I want as little oxygen, water vapor, and oil vapor in the chamber as possible.

Ultimate Question: When I pull down a vacuum and the last few millitorr take the longest, is it even worth it to pump the vacuum to that base pressure? Would it be smarter to just start backfilling with argon at a higher pressure, and dilute the system more times? If after closing the vacuum pump valve and I don't see the gauge pressure rising, I assume there is a negligible leak. However, sometimes the gauge rises in pressure the first few pump downs, and then it remains steady on the final pump-downs. I'm guessing this is water moisture adsorbed on the surfaces that is  being pulled off at first, and then on the final pump-downs there is no more absorbed water.

Sorry for the huge post with lots of details, this seems like a really important aspect to look at for scientific experiments demanding high-purity environments!",AskEngineers,science_question,/r/AskEngineers/comments/14tmny/laboratory_vacuum_pump_whats_the_best_way_to/
92,Is it possible to send text messages via shortwave radio?,1355451583,"So, a little back story. I'm a Sophomore Computer Engineer who is currently without a phone. Instead I've been using my iPod and one of the free wifi texting services (Vonage, Textfree, etc.) and I've been itching to get a phone, but they're expensive. Really all I need is a reliable internet connection, because then I can use my iPod and not have to worry about data limits and money.

So, my theory is that as long as I don't spend hundreds of dollars I'll be saving money in the longterm AND I'll have a neat little experiment to talk to potential employers about. 

The most obvious answer to transmitting a signal over a distance of 35 miles (my house to the city where I work) is a shortwave radio. So my thinking was that I can't really send a signal directly from my iPod to the Internet via shortwave and so I'd need some sort of device in between. 

My hope is that there is a device out there on the market that can take signals from BlueTooth (my iPod) or provides WiFi (for my iPod) and then transmits that over the shortwave radio to my receiver that will be conveniently placed in a WiFi zone. My receiver will then take that message and give it to an old laptop I have sitting around, which will then use the browser-to-phone texting capabilities of one of these apps to send the text.

This is in no way a means of sending a text quickly, but as long as it work a slight delay doesn't bother me. I figure sending it back will be easy once I can send to it. Obviously I won't be able to use the Vonage (or other) app outside of WiFi (it's going to try to connect to it's home site) so I'll have to design some way to send via a custom app or a webpage on the magical device.

So tell me, is this possible? I'm up for a challenge, but I don't want to spend more than $1,000. So that's obviously difficult. ",AskEngineers,Braanium,/r/AskEngineers/comments/14tk6b/is_it_possible_to_send_text_messages_via/

I make $15/hour and happily took the job because I was homeless at the time, but this is my first job out of university. I have been a good worker and very versatile for both manual labor in the field and my AutoCAD skills.


The new job - urban land surveying in Boston for $20/hour. He said ""$20 to start"" which shows some promise of 3-month-eval. Also, doing some AutoCAD, but mostly plot plans.


Current job just offered me full time position (benefits) for $20/hour. These guys believe I am making over $20/hour possibly at the other job, the thing is it's only 3 of us here so if I start bickering about salaries and such then I don't want to shoot myself in the foot and lose the opportunity. 


I have medical coverage until I'm 26 anyways (24 now). Perhaps I should shoot back with $25/hour at my current job without benefits, since I really don't need them anyways until later.


Or, should I request more money at my other prospective job? They seem to be pretty excited about hiring me so I might be able to squeeze some more out of them. Shouldn't I be making $30/hour as an entry level engineer anyways?


Nutshell:

New job - Making surveying my specialty when I'm already an engineer (bad thing? not sure) and offering $20/hour ""for now"" without benefits. The work sounds fun and the people there all seem like cool folks. 30 minutes added to my morning commute.

Current job - Staying in engineering and pursuing my PE (always good), $20/hour, full time benefits. The people here are becoming increasingly enjoyable to work with (now that I know how an office works heh). 


So Reddit, in your experiences what advice could you give me? I hope to find someone with good ""discussing salaries"" skills and experience in the field and in the office. Should I just float over to the new job and all the while plugging away at landing that $30+/hour job?

I am designing a fluid system that uses four pumps to mix four fluids from four separate tanks into a common header, which will deliver the mixture to the point of use. Each of the pumps is to meter a varying amount of fluid depending on product set points. I am planning on using internal gear pumps due to fluid properties.

I have create individual system pressure/head curves for the entire system, for each pump, and at various maximum and minimum flow scenarios. Therefore I have a decent idea of the pressure profiles, but my question is, does the first pump to deliver to the mixing header have to overcome the additive pressure of each of the following pumps? Does that mean the last pump to mix into the header only has to overcome its own friction to pump?

Finally, we were planning on doing controls on this project with individual volt/hertz VFD control on the pumps with feedback from mag meters on each pump. Am I going to have control stability issues? (Can i compensate by slowing down response time or am i going to be way off?)

Then, the song travels to the sound card, which is then outputted to the speakers. At the same time, the application software stores data to the RAM.

57,Managers/people experienced with the hiring process: Is there such a thing as TOO high of a GPA when applying for jobs / interviewing as a college undergrad?,1355099556,"**Please understand** I'm ***NOT*** asking about the GPA vs. experience tradeoff. 

So I'm a Junior ChemE student at a relatively reputable, accredited university in the Southeast. As it stands, I'm over 80% of the way through my degree, and unless I catch an awful curve ball next semester, I'll likely be maintaining a perfect 4.0 by the time job interviews come around.

I am of course proud of my accomplishments, but I fear they may backfire on me by the time I start sending resumes out. The average GPA of my class is somewhere between a 3.1 and 3.3. I worry that potential interviewers will see my resume and abnormally high GPA and perhaps skim over it thinking ""this guy must be anti-social and have no life outside of studying"", which honestly is not the case. 

I have a perfectly active social life, held a year-long co-op job which was highly-demanding of ""people skills"", and have a good network of colleagues and professors who acknowledge my efforts. I just made it a priority to plan my schedule out in such a way where my priority was taking the toughest courses with the department's ""easiest"" professors - a policy which definitely paid off.

I guess what I'm looking for is some input from people who have some experience in the hiring process. If you saw somebody fresh out of college with a 3.9-4.0 GPA, would this be an immediate eyebrow-raiser? If so, would it be detrimental to the point where you may even rule out an interview? 

I'm confident that in an interview I could explain my situation and convince potential employers that I don't live in the library, but that'd be hard to do if the employer isn't even willing to interview.

I appreciate you guys' help. I'm trying to be as humble as possible here, so I do sincerely apologize if I'm coming off in any way conceited. Definitely not my intention - its a difficult subject to ask about.


**EDIT**: I welcome any anecdotal evidence anyone may have to offer as well. Even if you've never hired somebody, if you know someone who you believe was skimmed over because of the ""overachiever"" mindset, I'd like to hear about it. I plan to talk with an adviser at some point to get opinions on the matter, but most of them are not experienced in industry. Any advise you guys have is welcome.

Problem solving is problem solving, so I got some useful skills out of it, but I can't see myself being interested enough in what they make to do it for the rest of my life. 

That said, I have a performance review and end-of-term presentation next week in which they might ask me point-blank if I want to come back next summer (the presentation will be in front of my entire dept). Should I just tell them, ""I appreciate the opportunity, and have learned valuable skills, but am not sure this is the best path for me, yadda yadda""? Do you think that would affect their reference letter for me once I ask for one?

In this economy it seems silly to tell someone up front this early that I don't want to come back if they'll have me, but I feel if I'm going to need their reference for another place to work it's just better to tell them now.

63,Yet another for the materials engineers - archaeology-related (stone tools and such).,1355072961,"Hi there, people who are much better at math than me!

Got a question that hopefully will find a couple answers here.  At the least, maybe it's an interesting problem for you guys to ponder, and I'm out of ideas.

I study stone tools, specifically various forms in the prehistoric past.  We see a lot of trends in different shapes being used at different times and in different places, and one big assumption archaeologists frequently make is that those shapes are stylistic choices, rather than being based on some specific material-based property of the tool (and its shape) and what it's intended for.

What we forget is that the people who made stone tools were engineers.  They designed their implements based on their knowledge, the constraints of the materials they had available (stone) and the purpose of those tools (projectile, knife, etc.).  Even the size of the intended prey likely had an effect on what kind of tools were made.

**Example**: Suppose you have two possible targets, a mammoth or a whitetail deer.  You issues of size, body shape, speed of reaction, and anatomy to contend with.

You could count on hitting a mammoth if you got close enough, so maybe you might make a more one-shot type tool (like a Clovis point: http://i.imgur.com/BBgxZ.jpg).

But with something like a deer, there's a much greater risk of missing.  But if you hit, there's less to penetrate, you can perhaps be more assured of a kill.  So maybe you might make a tool more like this: http://i.imgur.com/1zir0.jpg (no scale in the picture, but this is a smaller tool, and a little thicker and shorter than the Clovis).

Obviously these are very different tools, and they probably are different for specific reasons (possibly relating to what I'm talking about).  But without a solid way to evaluate performance under a similar set of conditions, it's almost impossible to make any solid argument about it.

What I'm coming to you guys about is this: I want to figure out a way to model stress / forces on different shaped tools to determine if certain forms react significantly different under different kinds of stresses.

Essentially, assuming the same type of material (for this purposes, let's say a type of flint) and the approximate same size, but with different characteristics of shape, how would such tools react under conditions approximating use as a projectile, i.e., impact from the front.

I could do what a lot of archaeologists have tried to do - make different shapes and experiment by throwing them - but it's hardly scientific, because there's no way to ensure similar forces for each throw, that each tool is made the same except for its shape, and so on.

I thought maybe you guys might have software that could model such things, or even there might be someone who would be willing to collaborate on a paper / research project.

Any interest?  Or ideas?  Anything at all?  Bueller?

Article reports 20 billion pieces / year: http://www.cnbcmagazine.com/story/the-real-toy-story/1061/1/

Avg lego piece is 1.1g (wikipedia).

Total plastic used per year is approx 1.1g * 2*10^10 =20,000 tonnes.  

Precision is 10 micrometeres in ABS.

Can anyone help estimate?  What would they likely get ABS at?  Like 2k USD / tonne? 

If so then material cost is on the order of 0.002$ / piece.  Does that sound right?  So what does it cost to mold 20,000 tonnes of plastic?  They would prob do their own tooling right? ",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/14dxf2/estimate_the_production_cost_of_a_single_lego/

 For those wondering, the requirements are that the bridge have a mass of 25g or less and it will rest across two separated surfaces (one of which is lowered 10mm just to piss people off.)  The bridge must be at least 300mm long and no longer than 400mm.  It also can't be taller than 150mm above the upper support surface and no wider than 80mm.  The load will be applied in the center, or 50mm to the left, or 50mm to the right.  Finally, the goal is to go for efficiency.

17,"Currently in regulatory work, thinking of moving to design, is it worth while?",1354711283,"I'm largely interested in the opinion of many of the rest of you for this issue, because I can see it going in a few ways. 


Some background information: I have a BS in Civil with my EIT and have been working at my current job for just under a year. 


 Currently, I am working at a regulatory agency (State Gov't) in a specialty group for Hydraulics and Hydrology, the job is stable, the hours are set and going forward it is a very simple job, this however is not what the rigor of engineering school trained me for, and because of it, I generally find the work boring and the work load to be lacking. Some serious good has come from this work, as I am both extremely well versed in an important aspect of site design work (regulations) and now have contacts within my regulatory agency.


However, I have just recieved an offer to become a site design engineer, while this is much more in line with what I would like to be doing and what I trained for in school, it (likely) requires taking a 10k salary hit, and that does not include the lost benefits, so in theory, the loss is even greater.


I can see this going forward in a few ways:

1. Private sector at the top end will almost always pay more than a state regulatory agency, plus I will be promoted in private based on competition with people with similar skills (my state uses a test for groups, so being in a specialty group ultimately hurts me in studying for the civil service) but it will take me years to recoup the salary change alone. I see this as the risky option currently, but it also represents an investment in an ability to use my skills for other companies.


2. Because I was originally hired by a state agency, my salary was negotiated for before I even started, does anyone have any good resources to learn to negotiate the current offer I have? I feel that I have at least some leverage because that kind of salary hit is a strong incentive not to go.


TL;DR : I work at a regulatory agency, and have an offer for something I'd prefer to work with, but at the cost of great benefits and 10k of salary.",AskEngineers,BagelDay,/r/AskEngineers/comments/14biwf/currently_in_regulatory_work_thinking_of_moving/

Im guessing no one would want to read this as its very boring but its worth a shot. Anyways heres the question that has been set. Any tips would be great and Ill buy the best helper some pizzaaa.

1) A patient’s vagus nerve gives bursts of 3mV pk to 7mV pk when epileptic activity occurs, and the signals that compose these bursts have a frequency spectrum between 500Hz and 10kHz. The bursts occur every 0.01s. We place two non-polarizable electrodes (e.g. silver chloride) percutaneously
along the outside of the nerve membrane in order to pick up the activity. Each has an electrode electrolyte impedance of 2k ohms and half-cell potential of 1mV (dc). The tissue between the electrodes  exhibits a resistance of 100ohms.
The patient’s bed is close to a power socket and interference from power cables nearby is picked up by the connecting cables with 5mV amplitude at 50Hz. Also, the BBC Radio 4 radio station is located nearby transmitting at 0.2 MHz, causing an additional 1mV interference.
We want to connect an amplifier to the electrodes through zero impedance connectors in order to get an output of at least 6V pk-pk for the smallest signal. We also want this amplifier to eliminate offsets and interference. Our subsequent stage is an old-fashioned oscilloscope with 50ohms input 
impedance.

A) Draw a block diagram with the amplifier given by a “black box” with only input and output impedance, and the electrodes given by the equivalent lumped-impedance circuit (ignore parasitic capacitances). The oscilloscope can be just a black box with input resistance. If 9V batteries are available to you, please decide on the following characteristics of the amplifier to be used:

1) Gain

2) Power Supply

3) Bandwidth

4) Input impedance

5) Output impedance

6) Linear input range

7) Linear output range


B) Now please design an amplifier with the specifications you have decided above. Make sure to include a filter that will cancel any external interference. Where will you place the filter
and why?

C)Choose a real op-amp from the Farnell catalogue (http://farnell.com/) and justify your 
choice.


D) Finally, after having designed your amplifier, please give the block diagram of a system that can detect when the bursts are exceeding 5mV (no need to include the oscilloscope in this diagram, the amplifier can be again drawn as a “black box” and the electrodes as input 
connectors to the amplifier).",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/14ao36/hellooo_im_offering_anyone_who_can_give_me_some/

*•	What was  your contribution to the project?*

•	*Why did you select this particular project to present to us?*

•	*What type of results did you have?*



I'm a sophomore in college, so my experiences are rather limited.  It's come down to two options:  my intro to engineering final from last year or my Eagle Scout project for high school.  

The engineering project consisted of working with a group of four other students in order to harness power from three available sources; the instructor constructed an artificial environment that provided solar power, wind power, and water power.  Using MATLAB, an estimate was provided for the amount of power available from each source. Then, the project was built under the constraints of a fictional budget.  We wound up with a fairly basic, unattractive windmill design that managed to harness some power.  It's not exactly a grandiose project, but it's obviously engineering related.

My Eagle Project was on a much larger scale.  I held a carwash fundraiser, a donation drive, and other events in order to raise ~$5,000 in cash, food, and supplies for a local animal rescue.  I also built two benches and a table for their adoption facility.  I led the entire project.  What worries me is that it has little to do with an engineering and it was completed while I was still in high school.

If you were interviewing a sophomore Mechanical Engineering student for this position, which would be more attractive to you?

Just wanted to pick the brains of some fellow engineers.

I have a progressive cavity pump which handles a high temp slurry (liquid is water).  
I am experiencing an overall reduction in flow and frequent plugging in the suction side of the pump.
The pump suction piping is a lot longer than it needs to be, and includes a 5' length of flex hose.

I am thinking what is happening is a classic case of pump cavitation and that the best remedy would be to cut out the suction piping completely and mount the suction side of the pump directly to the tank discharge. I also think that i may be having some issues due to pumping a mostly water based slurry at ~200 degrees F. I don't have a lot of experience with vapor head calculations.

(Using direct voltage instead of batteries),1354209588,"So, uhh, I'm currently an apprentice of sorts for some industrial electrical engineering, and of course this has sparked my interest for doing this sort of stuff in my spare time.

So, I got some cord with two phases(I think they are called in English?) - not even any PE, which would have been irrelevant anyway.

And then I had the lightbulb and circuit board that goes with it. So I figured what would happen if I plugged in the cable in a regular outlet at my appartment and, with the uninsulated edges applied them on the circuit board where the batteries should go. 

Of course, I do realise that the batteries that go with are normally 3V (and two of those), and that my power outlet is probably 220/230V, so naturally I didn't expect huge success. I had thought the bulb would explode, though, but what happened was a massive bright blue light and the relay to turn. 

So my questions are:
How can I have similar easy fun?

24,Masters in Product Dev from Electrical Engineering?,1354069255,"I don't know if r/product_design can help, I'd figure I'd try r/AskEngineers first.

I'm currently an EE major (going to be a junior next year, taking a year off doing research ATM) concentrating in Robotics &amp; Controls.
I have a growing interest in going into product design type work, specifically in medical devices/prosthetics. I am considering applying to graduate school for product development type programs after I finish my EE degree, but it seems to me that the majority of 'design engineers' have a background in mechanical engineering.
My university's industrial design department has a minor program which I'm looking into, but it's a very popular minor and it's not easy to get in. 


Am I at a disadvantage because of my EE background? Would it be wise to take some courses in CAD/mechanical engineering? Apart from starting a portfolio immediately, are there any other ways I can prepare myself from now for graduate school in product/industrial design?



Just to clarify, this is an example of the type of graduate product design programs I'm talking about: http://www.cmu.edu/mpd/

It's just for fun. Anyway, my plan is to use the Dragon12+ board that I have, an LM34 temperature sensor, and a little 5V fan.

My goal is to read the temperature, convert it with the A to D converter, calculate the actual temperature from the values in the conversion registers, display it on the onboard LCD, and when the temperature reaches 85F, turn on the fan. Once the temperature gets back down to 80F, the fan would turn back off. So, really, the only temperatures I care about are from about 70-90F (Giving some extra room on both sides of the scale). How could I build a circuit to limit the temperatures that the sensor reads?

Would it be better to just implement it on the software side? My problem is that the A to D converter is 10 bits, so the resolution is (roughly) 5mV (5 volts over 1024 bits), and the sensor increases 10mV/degree.

35,Homemade diode question (crosspost from askscience),1354041501,"Question about making a homemade diode to surface physicists/chemists. I want to see if I could make a cheap, low efficiency solar-active schottky diode (for fun - no real purpose yet - but ultimately making an extremely cheap, but exceptionally weak, solar cell for experiments).

Plan was to create a cheap schottky diode in a manner similar to Dye-Sensitized Solar cells, but only using the TiO2 interface. So I got cheap titanium dioxide powder from a soap manufacturer (no idea which type of TiO2 it is, maybe rutile?). And I have a sheet of copper from home depot for flashing (uncoated).

Here is what I tried which does NOT work:

 1) Dissolved the titanium dioxide powder in acetone/water mix (few drops acetone to several drops water to a small amount of TiO2) in a mortar. 

2) ground the paste until it resembled paint (20-30 minutes). 

3) Spread a thin layer of the ""paint"" onto a thoroughly cleaned copper (cleaned using sanding, washing, acetone rinse) using tape and straight edge to give a thin film. 

4) Heated the copper+paste under high heat from an acetylene torch (until glowing red) and slowly cooled.
The top layer of the TiO2 flaked off during cooling leaving a thin white-ish layer that was insulating (measured with resistance check with multimeter).

I would expect this to form a simple schottky diode between the TiO2 layer and the copper, but the diode function of the multimeter shows nothing.

Questions: 

1) Is the TiO2 layer too thick? (since the depletion zone would only be &lt; 1 micrometer) 

2) Can I stick an aluminum tip multimeter probe directly on the TiO2 layer and on a clean section of the copper to measure the diode? 

3) Does the carbonizing on the edges of the copper (and the reddish copper oxide edges) effect the TiO2 region? 

4) What should be changed to make this work?

47,What kind of sensor and control would I need in order to detect vibrations in a spinning metal rod? And offset them?,1353981533,"I am building a spring winding rig. It is a 3ft+ long metal rod placed inside a drill chuck and spun at around 3000rpm. A wire is wrapped around the spinning rod to make long springs. The drill is mounted to a track, and automatically trips a switch once it reaches a predetermined point. The wire is fed onto the rod through a stationary plastic feeding block. 

The rod starts to harmonically oscillate while it is spinning. If the oscillations get big enough, there is enough force in the spinning metal mass to offset off-center enough, to bend the rod at 90° and make a joly fine mess.
To counteract that and kill the harmonics, the speed of rotation can be adjusted up/down a few % for a few seconds. 
All easy to do by hand. But I am lazy, and I have 10000 of these to make. 
I have already automated the rest of the functions of this contraption. 

Now how do I build something to do this automatically? My first thought was an arduino with a vibration sensor (do they exist?) that would control a PWM switch wired for 120v. So I dont have to hack the drill, I could simply plug the drill into the PWM and I would be set. (I am already doing that with a dimmer switch to control the raw RPMs. It is how I manually control the speed now.)

* A 2-piece donut shaped weight, call it 800-900 pounds, that has enough space for the trunk of the tree to not touch it while it circles the tree. 
* A winch at the top of the branchless section, plus a pulley system that would allow the weight to be lifted evenly and make the velocity ratio higher. The winch would have to have a gearing system to allow it to switch to generator mode.

Using the unused power from the solar panel, winch the weight up slowly. During the night, the winch would become a generator as the weight descends. I figure it might be good for like, 50 watts a tree.

I could learn it again easily, but if I'm asked to solve a problem in an interview I think I would choke really bad. My whole life I taught myself to believe memorization was for suckers. I had a phone interview a few years ago and wasn't able to tell them what a pointer was. I'm very good at programming, yet I didn't know what a fucking pointer was because I thought I was above memorizing jargon. I basically fooled myself into believing I was fine when really I was fucking lazy and wrote off anything that required more than minimal effort.

So anyways, I'm currently going through some scary self-examination. I'm afraid I don't know anything practical so I'm trying to jam myself full of information from all facets of electrical and computer engineering and I might be slowly losing my mind. Anyone have any experience similar to this? Any advice? How much do interviewers value intelligence/ability to learn/problem solving skills versus knowledge? I'm gonna really buckle down for the rest of my studies, actually read my textbooks and such. Right now I'm studying for the FE exam, I figure that's worthwhile.

My immediate supervisor generally knows what we're working on, but his superior, who is disposed to micromanagement, does not work in this building (or state for that matter).

ava = [0.9, 0.95, 0.85, 0.9, 0.9]

where **cap** contains the generation capacity in MW of a power plant and **ava** contains the availability of the plant over a period of time. The original data contains about 250 plants though, I am just using this data as an example.

Basically I want to generate a cumulative probability table so i can say that the probability of supply falling below *x* is *y*.

The catch is that I can't assume a normal distribution because of some tail difference and I can't figure out how to implement the exact solution.

Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?


My method:
I started with an array of [1, 0,......0] where the first element represents the probability of zero generation and each element represents the probability of that many MW (e.g. the 5th element along represents the probability of generating 4MW)

Then, say I wanted to add a power station of **5MW** with an availability of **0.9** i would write in MATLAB:

conv([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],[0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9])

here is the question: http://imgur.com/nnUzv

I am a leaving certificate student in Ireland (equivalent to SATs i think? im 18 and it is my final exam in school).

We were given this question to work on for homework, as a challenge rather than as real practice since our teacher admitted that it was beyond the scope of our exam, but still manageable for us if we put our minds to it. 

I am okay with the basic principles involved of up vs down, left vs right, resolving vectors, converting trigonometric functions, making the line of slope into the x axis etc, but i think am having trouble with the basic wording of this question. 

My understanding of friction was that in order for a particle to be in motion had to have a minimum force greater than uR (u being the coefficient of friction, and R being the reaction force in the y direction) in a certain direction. My exam deals only with particles on the point of moving, as in the question, but I do not understand how a particle can be on the point of overcoming friction in both the positive and negative direction of the x-axis, since the forces would surely cancel eachother out, right?

I think i am capable of tackling this question, although maybe i am just having trouble with the wording of the question and the concepts involved, since they are beyond the scope of my exam. 

I thought perhaps that the question implied that in the instance when a force of 4p was applied, the object would be on the point of moving in the positive x direction, and that if that force was then removed, and a force of p was applied, then the object would be on the point of moving in the negative x direction (assuming that you have your x axis in line with the slope). The question seemed to imply though, that both forces are acting on the particle at the same time.

Any information that could help me is greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance, Dan

I have a decent balance charger for charging at home and properly keeping the cells in line.  However, on the go, I would like a simple ""plug in"" connector to a wall outlet to obtain about 80% state of charge.  The idea is to get four 20v laptop power chargers, wire it in series for ~80v.  Since they are voltage and current limited, I think this just might work.  Assuming the cells are perfectly balanced, it would charge each cell to 4v.  By avoiding a full charge, I'm fairly sure it will keep a bad/unbalanced cell from overcharge.  Just in case, I plan to implement voltage monitoring which will automatically turn off a relay to the chargers in the event a single cell passes 4.2v.

In my spare time, some of my engineering-related hobbies include woodworking, fixing random shit, attempting to fix car problems via internet forum directions, etc. So, my interests lie in a lot of aspects of engineering and I could see myself going many different directions.

I do think I want to get away from the ""static"" nature of civil engineering, although geotechnical was something I enjoyed and did a lot of upper div work in. I see a lot of programs in things like ""industrial engineering"" and ""applied engineering,"" but I don't even know what those terms really mean in terms of job opportunities.

24,How are the forces exerted on the human back by carrying a heavy object different from those exerted by unsupported breasts? And how does a bra redistribute force to relieve back pain/damage? [possibly NSFW],1353466950,"Throwaway, as this is a somewhat embarrassing subject.

**Question:**

I know of women who can carry 15kg objects in their arms all day (taking frequent breaks) without experiencing back pain. However, if those same women do without a bra, leaving their 2.5kg breasts unsupported, they experience backaches in their lower and mid-spine within the hour. Why is this? Why do their backs not grow strong enough over time to support this weight? Also, how exactly does a bra redistribute force such that breasts no longer cause back pain?

Please don't brush this off as trolling; many people near and dear to me have suffered severe medical problems as a result of poorly-supported breasts, and so any answers which may help educate people on this topic are greatly appreciated. (Full disclosure: My aunt, whose breasts appear to be roughly 2.5kg, experienced early-onset osteoarthritis of the spine, possibly due to very unsupportive bras--the very weight of her own breasts may have induced severe trauma/injury to the cartilage between her vertebrae. I am also a female with 2.5kg breasts, and am concerned about developing this condition.)

**Suppositions/Possible Factors:**

* Range of motion experienced when carrying a heavy object is more limited (only standing, walking, squatting).
* Breaks are taken when carrying a heavy object to allow time to recover.
* When carrying a heavy object, muscles of the arm, back, and shoulders are involved. With breasts, only muscles of the back and shoulders are involved.

Background: I’m a MechE, working as a general engineer, and I’ve got to put together a scope to have areas around my jobsite surveyed.  Specifically, I need to find the elevations of multiple (probably around 50) points, with the ultimate goal of determining the likelihood of flood damage (the job site is located at the confluence of two rivers).  Tidal data and predictions come in from NOAA using MLLW (mean lower low water).

Question 1: What datum should I specify in the scope?  There are so many (NAVD88, NVGD29, etc.), and none of them seem to have any clear relation to what NOAA uses to generate its predictions.  I need a fixed datum that allows me to relate the tidal data (in MLLW) to the elevations of specific points around the site.

Question 2: What information do surveyors generally require in scopes to provide accurate estimates?  Should I include the exact coordinates of the points I need surveyed, or will marking them with a spray-painted stake during the initial walkthrough suffice?

Question 3: What kind of accuracy should I ask for/expect?  I need precision to about the .1 or .01 foot—are there substantial costs associated with this level of precision?  Are different types of instruments used (lasers vs. a map and compass, for example) for different level of precision?

Question 4: Assuming I’ve got to have 50 points surveyed, how much can I expect the job to cost?

Question 4a: Once I’ve got the surveyors out at the site, what is the approximate incremental cost of having them do each additional point?

I have no idea where North is, and I just call every day of the week Tuesday. 

Now, I work a contract job that pays just over minimum wage. I want to better my life and improve myself by getting a degree. I don't want to further myself in the art/animation field because A, I'm not willing to relocate to LA or NYC, and B, I know how tumultuous the animation industry is, and I want a stable income.

39,Why can't we standardize our laptop power plugs?,1352729825,"I tried Googling both the wider Internet and Reddit for this, but came up empty.  [This ""universal"" laptop brick](http://i.imgur.com/JBBvF.jpg) sort of demonstrates my point.

Growing up with lots of little toys that ran on DC, I've seen a gazillion different plugs come in a gazillion different sizes.  Many times, I've discovered certain sizes appear to be standardized on voltage, as two unrelated devices desiring the same voltage often use the same plug.  Laptops, however, seem to have no rhyme or reason to their plugs.  They appear to have the exact same range of gazillions of possible plugs.

On a desktop, I can grab just about any power supply and slot it in just about any machine (given a similar architecture/power requirement, since modern computers generally take additional power over older ones), and I can use whatever AC plug I find lying around.  Internally, all the components use the same DC plugs from the power supply.  Once in a blue moon, you might find a component that comes with an adapter, but that's generally to account for your power supply just not having enough of a standard plug (the most simple being fan adapters).

Now I realize that laptops are still highly proprietary and the internals are almost guaranteed to be plug-n-play incompatible, except for possible expansion cards, extra memory, and, on older laptops, wireless cards.  That said, why aren't the power bricks standardized?  Why does Lenovo (for example) have small plugs, large plugs, and now [a rectangular plug](http://i.imgur.com/X6lYQ.jpg)?  Couldn't the brick be standard and all the proprietary stuff be internal?

tl;dr: Is there an actual engineering reason behind the lack of standardization for laptop power plugs, or is it just to sell more accessories?",AskEngineers,ndgeek,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1329th/why_cant_we_standardize_our_laptop_power_plugs/
40,Drying/Desiccating by Vacuum,1352714285,"I'm sorta working on an invention that requires use of a vacuum to dry/desiccate stuff. I'm trying to calculate the amount of power that would be used each time it is turned on, so I can calculate the cost of running it. I was told that the amount of heat energy and the amount of vacuum energy is roughly the same.  I would want to get down to a vacuum pressure of 8 torr/mmHg or 10.7mbar, so water would boil at the lowest temp of 5C.

So I calculated it with the following scenario:

Lets say there is a vessel filled with ~40L of water, lets say room temp 20C.

I used the following formula: (1atm * 40L) / (0.08206 L atm mol^-1 K^-1 * 293.15K) to get the number of kiloJoules required, 142895kJ, and converted that per hour to watts for 39.7kW

If I changed it to 5C, it would require more energy, correct?

Is this right? or would lowering the pressure either increase or decrease the amount of power needed. I can't be sure if the original suggestion given to me was correct. I would assume that the colder the water, the more energy that would be needed?

45,Arguments for or against spoilers on cars,1352691586,"I am a pretty big motor sport fan, of which formula one is my most favoured form. From this interest i have come to understand a fair bit of the principals and technology behind down force and it's effect on handling. I am however ever always observing and sometimes involved in debates about weather a spoiler on a road going car has any purpose at all. Now we have the down force argument which is what most people are focused on however i have always thought that some spoilers are simply there to tidy up air flow and/or make the drag of the car less. 

For instance my wagon has a spoiler on the back of it (see below) which i dont think is going to be doing much, if anything at all for down force. Would i be correct in thinking it would help with the drag of the car though?

And on the other argument about down force do the spoilers on sports cars really help a lot? Or is it a case of (as many people argue) needing to be going very fast before a spoiler will help with any down force/cornering and therefore not being needed at all. Say for instance in the case of a Subaru WRX (see below).

Does a test exist that can show how effective spoilers are on road going cars? Have there been any tests done regarding these questions?

Any insight you could give me would be great. I am really fascinated by aerodynamics and wish i had the know how to work in the field. Being able to discuss things like this with people who are trained in it is a great privilege and i would ask you to please forgive my lack of knowledge or clarity in anything i have asked.

Another thing, is how will two electromagnets and the distance between them will affect the field strength. I am assuming the fields will add up but not sure if the distance between them (a few centimeters) will be significant enough to account for any drop.

I was thinking about future fuel regulations today and thinking about how the industry will meet them.  To me it seems there are two ways to make today's style cars meet those regulations - through more efficient engines and hybrid drivetrains and by channeling Colin Chapman who said ""simplify and add lightness.""  

The IC engine has become dramatically more efficient in the past 20 years through better computers, direct injection, variable valve timing, new materials, better FI, etc., so it seems that gains there are going to be incremental.  Hybrid drive trains are certainly a big possibility, especially if a consumer friendly KERS system is developed or battery tech takes off.  Other advances such as electric power steering and low RR tires that actually hold the road can also help with efficiency.

**I'd like to focus this question on ""adding lightness.""**  I am a Lotus fan and that company, more than anyone, has traditionally focused on lightweight vehicles, most recently though the use of luminum ""tubs"" and chassis.  A nice video is here: [Lotus aluminum bonding](http://green.autoblog.com/2008/01/08/video-lotus-ferrari-tesla-are-using-lightweight-aluminum-in-t/)  In fact, Lotus Engineering has pioneered and licensed a lot of the tech involved ([link](http://www.aluminum.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=29336)).  

In terms of ""tubs"" and chassis components, aluminum is much lighter than steel, but also costs significantly more and is not very ""repairable,"" making seemingly minor wrecks a total loss.  Carbon fiber is certainly lighter, but costs much more and cannot be manufactured quickly.  Can anyone offer anymore on this topic?

In terms of body panels, it used to be that fiberglass was lighter than steel - is that still true?  How much weight is saved by the use of carbon fiber?  Is aluminum still lighter than steel?  Where does plastic fit into all of this?  Are there any other options for lightweight body panels?

67,3D printed Slew/Ring bearing,1352517380,"Hi All,

How can I design a 3d printed ring bearing that can be pulled out of the printer and used almost instantly?

I've been looking at ring bearings/slew bearings.  I have an idea that requires a large bearing that can take 150 lbs of force axially, and maybe 75 in any other direction.  I want this bearing system to be affordable.  I've looked at the MTM snap bearing system out of MIT, and it would do the trick -- at a cost of about 30 dollars in bearings from SDP/SI, and a lot of machining time.  Their system is a hub and mount made from HDPE sandwiched between 2 thrust bearings.  The HDPE acts as a plain bearing for radial loads, and the thrust bearings handle the axial/torque loads.

But, their system would cost $30 just in bearings and be complex to manufacture.  I could 3d print a part using a laser sinter process for about the same cost as just the thrust bearings, and save a lot of labor in assembling such a bearing -- if I could figure out a design that can be 3d printed in a single shot.

Here's an example of a Groove-race bearing 3d printed and functional:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOEbZ98J1Ks

So, plenty of questions to figure out, mostly process related.  I plan on using the EOS Polyamide-12 process.  ( Aka Shapeways/Ponoko strong and flexible 3d prints ).

This is a laser sinter process with the following limits:
1. 1mm wall thickness.
2. 0.3mm feature size.

Instead of using balls and races, I was thinking of using cylinders in a V pattern -- a cross roller ring bearing, like this:
http://tchs.en.alibaba.com/productshowimg/552681613-200130973/cross_roller_slewing_ring_bearing.html

I'm not sure what my clearances have to be in everything to get a bearing that works, but doesn't ""Jiggle"".  I'm also no sure how to minimize friction between the axle and the roller for each of the small rollers in cross roller bearing structure.( Should I design ballbearings/races into the axle system?  Can I just use a straight axle and let friction run its course? How do I get the unused powder to drain out of the system? )

Any thoughts on how I can design a slew/ring bearing that can be 3d printed and functional right out of the printer?

Thanks!

Izod impact strength is defined as the energy that is necessary per material thickness to puncture the given material. Wikipedia link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izod_impact_strength_test

I know that the Izod impact strength of a material is temperature dependent quantity; generally it increases with temperature, because a material becomes more ductile with increased temperature and is less prone to getting punctured.

**Question:**

Is Izod impact strength linearly dependent or is the relationship more complicated? Specifically, is the relationship linear for plastics? If it is non-linear, do you think it is ok to use a linear approximation for preliminary calculations?

It is claimed to contain enough ethanol for 400 trillion trillion pints of beer. Assuming ""beer"" is 4% alcohol here, that's about 7.4 trillion trillion liters of ethanol.

The cloud is of low density, and contains around 30 different compounds, including ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, but ethanol is the largest constituent.
