However, the answer key divides the input and output voltages to get a turn ratio, and then divide that by the efficiency, to get a higher turn ratio.

I can't find the formula they're using online anyway, and I don't get the same formula when I imagine that all the inefficiency is due to leakage of the magnetic field.

48,Should I go for engineering now?,1526064965,"Hello! First of all I dislike math, it's not that difficult (at least in veterinary) but I still failed the first math course, I never put effort into most things anyway so idk if I'm really bad at it or just lazy.

As a kid I found it amusing to disassemble toys &amp; small machines to understand how they worked, recently I bought an cheap-but-broken dot matrix printer (I love the sound of those things but I'm poor) I had a blast turning it into individual pieces to clean it up &amp; reassemble it to have it working, so far it's the only kind of stuff that I sincerely put effort into.

I know engineering is way so much more than printer maintenance but so far everyone have told me to study that &amp; I'm running out of ideas.

However I suck at maths, my teacher told me there aren't bad students but bad teachers, so should I just try another field with less math or the most math-heavy field I could because it is the only thing that puts 'that' smile on my face? Am I considering the wrong field?

56,Eurocode (Uk) - Disproportionate Collapse - Key Beam Supporting Load Bearing Wall,1526049328,"Hi,

I have a bit of a conundrum regarding the key element design principal.

As a background to what I have reviewed; using EC 1991-1-6 and reading both IStructE manual (Manual for the design of building structures to Eurocode 1 and Basis of Structural Design) and SCI P391 (Structural robustness of steel framed buildings).

I have a structure that falls under Consequence Class 2b. It is 6 storeys tall; the first two levels are of steelwork frame construction with composite slabs and the rest are timber frame with loadbearing walls. 

Where a timber load bearing wall (supporting 4 storeys) is supported off of a steel beam, I believe the beam is a key element. Due to this, I believe the beam needs to be assessed under an accidental combination with an additional applied load of 34 kN/m² over the slab the beam supports. Is this a correct approach? 

Alternatively should the accidental load be only applied over the surface of the beam section or not at all?",AskEngineers,SocialSystem_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8io7z8/eurocode_uk_disproportionate_collapse_key_beam/

58,"HVAC Engineers, question about outside air and RTUs",1526045177,"Hey so my question is just in regards to how the outside air works with RTUs. Say a unit is supplying 2000cfm. If you set an outside air damper to 0&amp;#37;, then you have 2000cfm S/A, 2000cfm r/A. Say you then turn the damper to 25&amp;#37; and you get 500cfm O/A.     

Now the question is, does the 500cfm O/A pressurize the building? I always assumed there was some relief damper that would also exhaust an equivalent amount of return air, ie \(2000cfm r/A from the space, 500cfm O/A, 500cfm relief\). But I recently came across a plan than uses the O/A as makeup air for an exhaust fan, so it would be more like \(2000cfm S/A, 1500cfm r/A, 500cfm O/A\). In the second case, if there were no exhaust fans, the RTU unit would effectively be pressurizing the building. 

Can any HVAC folks help clear this up for me? Do you always assume some type of relief for the outside air? Thanks",AskEngineers,lifesondeck,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8inq0i/hvac_engineers_question_about_outside_air_and_rtus/

The way that the beams go across the room, they intersect in the middle at an X shape, and there is about a half inch between them and the ceiling, which is how the strap fits over.

When I hang on the strap ends, it definitely feels like it holds the weight, but I hear a light noise when I let go, so I'm thinking there may be a slight bit of give in the beams.

There is a neat word \(adjective\) in my source language, but that does not imply that there is one in English. I truly do not know. So far, I tried stuff like socket, slot, clamp with the addition of adjectives like fastening, clamping and holding.

73,What should we be using instead of LogMeIn?,1525990026,"I work for a company of \~60 people, with a few offices around the country.  Our biggest office outside of the main office I believe uses a VPN to access our main company network files.

I work in one of our small offices, just myself and our office manager.  We have our main computer desktops at our 'desks' on the other side of the country.  We access those desktops through LogMeIn \(free version\) to work for 8\+ hours a day through our laptops we have here with us \- none of our work is saved locally.  

We are structural engineers doing  heavy 3D FEM modelling and drawing/sketching for a lot of our day, so the small latency and easy misclicks are very noticeable.  While the setup does work now that I'm used to it, whenever I am in the main office \(once/twice a year\) it is a massive difference being able to work on the native machine.  

There has to be a more efficient way to do this, can anyone suggest something?  Or is this someone normal?  I was chatting with an acquaintance who does IT/networking and he was appalled at how poor the setup is.  We have an outside company contracted to do our IT, and they keep one guy in house to take care of most of our stuff \- they are pretty resistant to changing anything, so if I want something different set up I will need to have a good argument for it, and a pretty well defined plan of what we want.

Side note, I'm pretty sure their reasoning for wanting to keep our desktops local is that we have some really expensive software on them, and they want to keep the machines near the IT guys in case something goes wrong with it so they can get their hands on it instead of walking us through a fix.  Both of us here have masters degrees in structural engineering so we aren't computer illiterate and are capable, so I don't know that that is necessary, but it obviously isn't up to me.

The first part is easier in my opinion. I was thinking of some sort linear, in line, lever action spring mechanism so that when the pallet hits, it is sprung into action. The hard part is then it would not retract when the pallet retracts. I am trying to avoid the use of motors as well, to limit cost. Any bright ideas?

My trouble is with the simulations, and have a tough time understanding the variables, controls, duration, and what constitutes a fair test. I have been instructed to follow my supervisor testing method, which is still unconvincing to me. He recommended using dyes, and litmus paper to track rainwater flow.

I'm a mature (40s) engineering student (2nd yr ME). I work at a minesite that's closing down soon, hence the career change. I've finally secured a part-time job in my (non-technical) role so I can study full-time and hopefully graduate at the end of 2020. It's tough financially but worth it. My work has a careers placement programme since we'll be out of a job soon, but I'm not sure of its value. It _could_ set me up nicely with project experience etc, but I don't know it that's really on offer. I have been trying to get such opportunities but it seems the company just wants us to stay in our lanes.

Recently a mate offered me a job. He manages CapEx projects ($1M+) and thinks he can use me as a project co-ordinator. Proper money, great experience, but a full-time job, so studies will have to slow down.

Am I crazy to stick with what I have? I'd be walking away from the career programme (of questionable value), a corporate share plan, a potential payout and the dream of graduating before 2022.

91,Help with choosing a Masters in Aerospace program,1525944309,"Hello Everyone,



If possible, I would really appreciate some help right now with choosing a graduate program.
I have been accepted into the following programs and am now in the midst of figuring out which program to choose:


 -  University of Toronto: 2 year M.Eng Aerospace Engineering


  - Cranfield University: 1 year M.Sc in Aerospace Dynamics


  - Nanyang Technical University/Technical University of Munich: 2 year joint M.Sc in Aerospace Engineering




Just a bit of background on myself. I completed my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering at another Canadian university. I have a Canadian citizenship so in terms of tuition University of Toronto is the cheapest for me. In the future, I would like to pursue a career in North America.




I have read reviews in which people say the joint program between Nanyang and TUM is not that great, and it is also the most expensive out of all three (not to mention I would be paying 2 years worth of living expenses). So I am actually leaning towards not picking Nanyan/TUM. I know that University of Toronto has a higher ranking than Cranfield University, but it is an M.Eng program and the possibility of a PhD in the future has crossed my mind. Everything I've read about Cranfield also bodes well, so I am having difficulty deciding.



Would any of you have any suggestions and/or insights into these programs? Thanks a bunch!

Imagine a bundle of 15 feet of towing or recovery rope that needs to be shot across a small gap, with the thrower's end still tethered - however normal hand throwing methods will not be possible due to operational limitations.

The idea is to place the bundle of rope or lightweight chain on the end of a long pole (setting both an elevated starting point and the takeoff angle) and use a powerful short travel spring ""shot"" to set the line over the obstacle.

You could for instance lean the top of the pole against a bus or truck at roof level, and 'pop' the bundle of line across the roof and down to the opposite side at street level.

I was wondering about how to change the stlye and pace of improv. Rolling chairs would be a great addition, but most roller chairs are large, more function/comfort over presentation, and noisy. 
Not the best for improv.

 I don't want wheels. They look corny and sooo 3,500 B.C. And chair casters depress me.

I was thinking, like MARBLE sized wheels at the base of the chairs. Mabye built within the stem of the leg, like a ballpoint pen.

3,[Question] What are your experiences as an audio/acoustic engineer?,1525902094,"To start off, as the title states, I'm interested in the field of audio engineering. I know that many people tend to misconstrue professions and regret jumping in before having a full realization. I wanted to come here for some first person insight to better inform myself before making a big decision.

That's all you really need to know, but for anybody that would like some context allow me to explain...

I currently work as an engineer in the HVAC industry, and I'm doing quite well for myself. The job pays well, and I even make commission. The benefits are also great, and if I was into HVAC I'd really feel like I nailed it straight out of the gate. But I'm not passionate about it, and I'm not very good at putting my all into things I don't care about for long periods of time.

This has been picked up on by my superiors and is something we have talked about, and though I \(of course\) told them I am ready to really get into things and buckle down, it just doesn't feel right.

I've been producing my own music and teaching myself more about the basics of audio production, and have always been passionate about music in general. It's interesting to me, not just because of the music but also the possibilities \(I hope\) when it comes to various technologies that we use everyday.

But I'm hesitant.

**\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-**

So I'm coming to you guys to get some answers.

What is the main purpose of your specific position? How did you get there?

Did you take a specialized curriculum or did you enter the industry fresh?

Is the field really as broad as I'm imagining, or it there not much demand?

What would you advise for somebody that is looking to become involved in the industry?

12,Being an engineer as a very socially anxious person?,1525882449,"I graduated college a little over a year ago and have been working at my first full-time job for almost a year. I am working at a very small engineering consulting firm as an electrical engineer. One thing I have learned about myself is that I am not the best communicator and I get EXTREMELY stupid and nervous when put on the spot in front of others. I am inherently a very shy, timid and anxious person. Due to unexpected circumstances (project manager's death a few months ago) I have had to handle all client interface and attend client meetings by myself. I usually do not mind meetings or discussion with my boss/my coworkers, but interaction with the client, having to come up with answers on the spot with a bunch of strangers listening to me, etc is very daunting. In the several times I was put in this position, I failed to deliver. Just yesterday I had a conference call with the client. Each time the attention was directed towards me, I got super flustered, my mind blanked, I said stupid things I didn't mean to say. It was SO painfully awkward and I felt like an idiot afterwards (as usual).

I didn't know a lot about the industry when I took the job, but now I see that any form of consulting work is NOT for me. While I am aware this might be a special case because of my former boss's passing, and because usually the consulting part of the job isn't the responsibility of an entry-level engineer, I don't think I EVER want to go back to this field of work. I recently accepted another offer as an entry level software engineer at an automotive company (completely different than what I'm doing right now obviously) and will be putting in my two weeks' notice next week. My question is, what is the ""typical"" engineering job like? What can I expect from my new job? Are meetings with customers/clients usually handled by a project manager or supervisor? 

I also want to note that I do not ever have conflict with anyone in the office, I get my work done, and I don't struggle to ""get along"" with others.

I believe this results in condescension and difference in pay and growth opportunity.

I had an interview recently for an ""Engineering Associate"" position. I asked them what this meant and they very gently told me that they treat it as a tier between technician and engineer. The job description seems like engineering to me (some design, specification and procurement, troubleshooting).

Another example I can think of is in controls engineering. There are the guys who know how to design an enclosure, and then there are people designing the system with PID loops and whatnot. Two people with BS's in EE, and same title (""Controls Engineer""), but I believe are treated and paid differently. I see this distinction between ""specifying engineer"" and ""design engineer"" as well.

What's going on here? What is the difference between these two categories of engineer if it's not education? Is it just a spectrum of hands-on vs theory? Is this confusion/separation the result of companies not actually knowing what an engineer is/does, and thus strapping the word 'engineer' onto any technical role they need?

I expect to graduate next Spring (2019) with a Bachelors in ME and a minor in general Business Administration. This September will mark two years for me at this company. 

So my department is a manufacturing lab with  all sorts of machining capabilities- CNC, Additive, etc. We pretty much manufacture hardware for R&amp;D and sometimes help with production operations, but usually just help build prototypes. I really like building things and seeing products come from nothing, especially when I do it with my own hands. I also enjoy the people in my department since I’ve been here for some time now. Side note: Late last year, my boss did ask if I was interested in a full time position, to which I said absolutely.

However, the program I am in at UCF is a partnership between the company and the university, to get college students professional work experience. One of the conditions of this program is that I am only allowed to work a max 25 hrs a week. Because of that, after my inquiry to one of my supervisors, that is why they don’t put me on an actual engineering job simply because I cannot be here long enough during the week to see it through (which I totally understand). 

So my day to day tasks are pretty menial like switching out our chemical labeling systems and ESH management, fixing things around the shop, moving things around. I do however, have some machining experience with one of the machinists. I am working on a Emergency stop design I drafted up right now. I have also welded on simple things before. I figured any experience is certainly better than no experience. But since this is my last year in school, I want to get ahead as much as possible before I enter the field fully.

I know Cd and Ct are used as closure relations for volume-averaged modeling.  I am looking at a different paper that uses the nusselt number correlation to do a fin analysis of the metal foam.  They have made no mention of the dispersion coefficient, however.  I know for air (which the 2nd paper uses exclusively) does not need to bother with the dispersion coefficient since it is negligible.  But my question is that if they were using water, would they somehow have to incorporate it into the interfacial nusselt number correlation (which is in the form Nu=Ct*Re^n*Pr^m)? I don't think so, but I'd like to get someone to chime in if possible.  Thanks. ",AskEngineers,tubbyocharles,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8i0m79/dispersion_coefficient_and_nusselt_number/
29,Worst Case Scenario for Steam Flow in a boiler?,1525808340,"Hi guys.  I decided to try my hand at sizing a PRV for a steam boiler.  I came up with a simple example and wanted to see if I could solve for the minimum required orifice area.  I have a boiler spec sheet, the P-3 pressure vessel manufacturers report and some other bits of info and got stuck on the steam flow of the boiler.  I also have the selected PRV that came with the boiler, and wanted to verify its size.

They used the following:

* Set Pressure = 170 psig

* Capacity = 12,135 lbs/hr

The maximum output of the boiler states that its 5,175 lb/hr, but that's given the normal operating conditions, as follows:

* MAWP = 170 psig

* Normal Operating Range = 70 - 150 psig

* Boiler Heating Surface Area = 388 ft^2

* Boiler HP = 150 BHP

* Steam Output = 5,175 lb/hr

* Max Heat Output = 5.022 MMBtu/hr

* Nat Gas Supply Pressure * 3-5 psig

* Heat Input = 5.908 MMBtu/hr

* Boiler Eff. = 85%

* Nat Gas Consumption = 5790 SCFM or 64.6 GPH

* Water Supply Flow/Press = 660 ft @ 15.4 GPM

So I was able to confirm their calculated steam output fairly easily, and using that I sized a valve that was much smaller than what they have selected.  Assuming a fire case I wasn't entirely sure how I would analyze the exact situation and calculate the worst possible scenario.

For some reason I believe the info listed above does not represent the worst case scenario and represents a maximum output at the controlled variables, meaning if you were to turn everything up, you would only get 5,175 lbs/hr out of the boiler.  

What I want to figure out, is if something were to break, and you could not control the maximum steam flow generated, how would you determine this number?",AskEngineers,bnich11,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8hzmcr/worst_case_scenario_for_steam_flow_in_a_boiler/

39,How to rotate a part in combination with linear movement?,1525794243,"Mechanical design question again. 

Simplified layout of setup is [here](https://imgur.com/a/9JRoS6m). Basically a part \(up to 15""x15""x12"", 550lbs; big cube in model\) is loaded by a robotic arm onto a chuck \(thin plate in model\) in position 1. I then need a mechanism that allows the part to be rotated 90 degrees, dipped into a cleaning bath at position 2, returned to position 1 and rotated back to  horizontal position to be removed by the robotic arm. The complication is that the positioning at 1 has to be very precise since it is the loading/unloading position for the robotic arm. There is also the consideration of making a mechanism that can be built around the constraints of the tank.

I have come up with two clunky mechanisms. The first uses a double rack / pinion setup, but control would not be ideal and the racks/pinions would have to be immersed in the ultrasonic bath. There would also be backlash in the gearing so positioning at the top would not be ideal. The second is using a combination of rotary/linear cylinders, which would be expensive and not very elegant.

Is there a mechanism that can perform this task for such a heavy payload? The positioning in the bath does not have to be precise, but precision is required at the top. Simultaneous rotary/linear movement might work, but I would prefer the movements to be independent.

&gt;&gt;As an engineer I love the electric vehicle technology. However, I have been troubled for a longtime by the fact that the electrical energy to keep the batteries charged has to come from the grid and that means more power generation and a huge increase in the distribution infrastructure.

---------------------------------------------

INTERESTING - ONE OTHER QUESTION. IF ELECTRIC CARS DO NOT USE GASOLINE, THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN PAYING A GASOLINE TAX ON EVERY GALLON THAT IS SOLD FOR AUTOMOBILES, WHICH WAS ENACTED SOME YEARS AGO TO HELP TO MAINTAIN OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES. THEY WILL USE THE ROADS, BUT WILL NOT PAY FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE!

In case you were thinking of buying hybrid or an electric car:

Ever since the advent of electric cars, the REAL cost per mile of those things has never been discussed. All you ever heard was the mpg in terms of gasoline, with nary a mention of the cost of electricity to run it. This is the first article I’ve ever seen and tells the story pretty much as I expected it to

Electricity has to be one of the least efficient ways to power things yet they’re being shoved down our throats. Glad somebody finally put engineering and math to paper.

At a neighborhood BBQ I was talking to a neighbor, a BC Hydro executive. I asked him how that renewable thing was doing. He laughed, then got serious. If you really intend to adopt electric vehicles, he pointed out, you had to face certain realities. For example, a home charging system for a Tesla requires 75 amp service. The average house is equipped with 100 amp service. On our small street (approximately 25 homes), the electrical infrastructure would be unable to carry more than three houses with a single Tesla, each. For even half the homes to have electric vehicles, the system would be wildly over-loaded.

This is the elephant in the room with electric vehicles. Our residential infrastructure cannot bear the load. So as our genius elected officials promote this nonsense, not only are we being urged to buy these things and replace our reliable, cheap generating systems with expensive, new windmills and solar cells, but we will also have to renovate our entire delivery system! This latter ""investment"" will not be revealed until we're so far down this dead end road that it will be presented with an 'OOPS....!' and a shrug.

If you want to argue with a green person over cars that are eco-friendly, just read the following. Note: If you ARE a green person, read it anyway. It’s enlightening.

Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, ""For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine.” Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.

It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.

According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity. I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery. $18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery. Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $0.10 per mile.

The gasoline powered car costs about $20,000 while the Volt costs $46,000-plus. So the American Government wants loyal Americans not to do the math, but simply pay three times as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run, and takes three times longer to drive across the country.",AskEngineers,Bleach3825,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8hsxk1/will_someone_who_actually_knows_please_tell_me_if/

1. I have a huge interest in cars, but I am unsure if I will be limiting myself in the future

2. I am very academic and I am worried I won’t be pushed academically at the Apprenticeship as the first 2 years are spent back at College working towards NVQs (National Vocational Qualifications)

3. I am worried I will miss out on the “University Experience” and I might possibly find something else I’m interested in

4. I could go to University and just end up at the same place in loads of debt rather than have been earning in the same time

Would love any advice/thoughts from some Engineers.

When looking at the closed loop poles, they are all strictly in the LHP, so the system is obviously stable. But then what is the point of looking at the GM and PM of the open loop system?

86,Where to mount oil fuel vapor catch cans based on temperature for quickest condensation.,1525653926,"I was sent here by r/fluidsynamics 

They gave me the long and short of it but I want to get as much information as possible before cutting into 500 dollars worth of fittings and line and mounting this all up just to find out it is wrong. 

So I’m building a catch can system for my pcv system. I understand the combustion aspect of a vehicle and the pressures created in the crankcase and the byproducts produced. I will write a few short paragraphs about that for the setup to the question just in case someone here does not know about that, but would know something more about the fluid dynamics of the byproducts.  So, here it goes. 

My car is a turbocharged vehicle. Fresh air comes into the inlet of the turbo, through tan intercooler which cools the forced and heated air that is created by the turbo spinning. The fresh air is sent through the intake manifold and into the combustion chamber when the piston moves down. At the same time fuel is being pushed into the combustion chamber via a fuel injector. The fresh air and fuel is compressed and ignited as the piston pushes up and the spark plug sparks. The exhaust gasses go out the exhaust manifold spinning the turbo faster, this same exhaust air is sent through the exhaust and out to atmosphere. 

Now not all the fuel and air is burnt and sent out of the exhaust, and some oil also enters the combustion chamber. There is pressure created during this process that gets into the crankcase and this pressure needs to be relieved. The heat, pressure, oil, fuel and air turn into an acidic vapor which is pushed out of the crankcase via the pcv system. (Positive crankcase ventilation system) this mixture is then routed through vacuum lines and re-enters the intake system creating lower fuel octane levels and gunk inside the engine essentially requiring more maintenance, less power, lower fuel efficiency etc. 

The catch can system is meant to collect as much of this vapor as possible and turn it into a liquid through baffling systems. My personal car has 3 pcv valves to push dirty air out of the crankcase ( one is internal but I have built a system to reroute that to external), and one pcv system to pull in fresh air when needed. 

I have been told to just run filters to atmosphere to fix the problem but this is horrible for the environment and I’m not trying to make that happen. 

My plan is to run 3 catch cans. So each pcv out to its catch can in, routes through the baffling system to the catch can out connected to an inline filter which will connect to the vacuum line originally used by the system... aka catch can and filter inline between pcv out and vacuum. 

Now onto the question. This is high temperature vapor that I want to condense as quickly as possible into fluid that can stay trapped in the can until I empty it out for proper recycling. Obviously this mixture has acidic water in it but also fuel and oil vapor. I am very good with tools and my hands in general I can basically mount this anywhere in the engine bay. But what is the best place to mount it. Do I want the cans closest to the area they are normally running through to keep the temps close or do I want them in the coolest place available in the engine bay so the temperature is lower but not by a ton, or do I want these as far forward inside the bumper to allow them to condense at ambient temperature which will
be much lower than the engine bay temperature. 

Close to turbo is hottest part of the engine bay, close to the intake manifold still hot but less than turbo area.. front of engine bay would be the coolest are inside the bay and easiest for accessibility.. inside the front cover would be hardest to access and maintain but would give the coolest temps. 

One thing to keep in mind I do not drive the car much and never less that 10-15 miles and every time I do take it out I make sure to allow time for the engine to warm up to proper operating temps, then give heavy acceleration for a bit to blow everything out of the car. 

Sorry for the long winded text I just want to make sure you have all the information to give me the best answer you can. I truly appreciate any input and help you can give me. ",AskEngineers,invalid-user-name-,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8hjnfw/where_to_mount_oil_fuel_vapor_catch_cans_based_on/

It seems even more confusing that it is using Datum B (MMC) but there is no apparent dimension between B and that left side edge... so how is exactly referencing it's true position from it?

I'm looking to make a basic one stage coil gun, just for fun. The plan is to 3D print a bobbin/tube with a line break sensor right after the coil. This way the coil will be de-energized right as the magnets are in the magnetic center of the coil.

The projectile will be a stack of round magnets measuring 21mm with a diameter of 8mm. Without a linebreak, the prototype is working fairly well at repelling the magnets out, they shoot pretty far. I have 20 feet of wire wrapped around about 

I have two lead acid batteries, both 12V. I also have magnet wire, 28 gauge and 22 gauge. I was wondering what was more important in a coil gun's design, winds or current? As it stands, the 22 gauge magnet wire is about 1.5 ohms / 100 feet, or 0.15 ohms per 10 feet. That means a 20 foot coil with about 150 winds has a resistance of 0.3 ohms. At 24 volts (assuming batteries can source the current), that's about 80 amps. In parallel that would be 40 amps.

I can't find any consistent information on the internet, which is why I'm asking here. What equations should I use to model this?

Also, what's the optimal ratio of current to turns? I doubt 1 loop with a hundred amps would do very much, but neither would 100k loops with hardly any current. Where is that sweet spot? ",AskEngineers,piecat,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8hix9u/winds_vs_current_in_a_coil_gun/

I still do, I know it's one of the best in Europe and it will give me many job opportunities later. 

On the other hand, there is this university of technologies in my country which offers the same bachelor and master programs but in french! In the end they give you two diplomas (one from my country and one from France) and it's like you've studied at uni in France. There are some interships here and there and this is an awesome opportunity. 

But I am really starting to hesitate between both. I want to do my best but how will my decision regarding the university have an impact on my career later? I want to pursue a career abroad, for that I am sure. I am worrying that the big companies won't take me seriously  in case I won't finish my degree in a top university? I know... This may sound stupid, but I really don't know how these things work. I know that good grades aren't enough but the experience is also important.

I'm thinking of EE as I would like to work within Renewable Energy and I also have a passion for audio equipment (Amps, Speakers etc...) and would like to be able to DIY &amp; repair some vintage equipment I have gathered over the years.

Two things I've been considering:
Stay put in current location and job and do part time CC w/ transfer to uni.

Pros: Income + Decent School (NJIT)
Cons: full time work + Course Work.

Move back home with folks and focus full time uni work.

Pros: No Rent, can focus full time
Cons: No income / independence

Paying for school isn't too much of an issue as I have managed to save a fair amount over the years.

2,How to design a cleaning system to remove surface oil,1525611571,"I'm trying to design the layout for an ultrasonic cleaning system and have some questions regarding system design.

The machine will be placed in an automated cell serviced by a FANUC robot arm. The parts will generally have just been machined, so they will be covered in oils/coolants/chips. Once the part has been cleaned in the bath, these oils/coolants will obviously rise to the surface of the bath. When the part is removed, it will pierce this top layer of oil/coolant and become dirty again. How does one go about avoiding this? I am investigating weir design, but I'm not sure if this is the best option.

I have seen general layouts of other similar machines where there are multiple tanks with different cleaning agents that fill the ""cleaning"" (ultrasonic) tank at different points in the process. [See schematic](https://imgur.com/a/T4LUJek) from a similar machine. The schematic only has one of the cleaning agent tanks, but you could imagine that there are three or four. Some questions regarding this schematic:
1) What are the three symbols at bottom right? I'm assuming the middle one is pump but I am not sure.
2) What is going on with the double weir design in the storage tank? Is that some sort of design to help remove oil? I would imagine that water coming in from the cleaning tank would drain immediately to sump once it hits the second weir.

I was just noticing that in my front wheel stick-shift civic, that whenever I’m on an incline, I lose traction very easily. I assume this is because as the car is leaning backwards, the y component of the force of gravity is felt less on my front tires therefore lowering their traction. Would the inverse be true for rear wheeled cars on a drag strip? Would the incline allow for more torque starting out and thus more power? Or would the incline slow the car down proportionally to the extra power it gets.

I graduated from a undergrad with BS in Biology and grad school with MS in Biomedical Engineering from the same school. My plan was to go to medical school. Therefore, I worked at research labs and volunteered at hospitals during the summers. However, with financial difficulties, I decided I had to fold my dream and venture into the industry.

After finishing grad school, I worked at a medical device company as its regulatory affairs specialist. I was desperate to get a job when I graduated so I grabbed the first opportunity that came my way. Ever since then, I worked at 2 different companies, all as regulatory specialist. So with having 3 total years of experience being in the regulatory team, I sought out many recruiters to help me find jobs in the research or product development area since I wanted my job to be more technical and hands\-on. 

This has been a nightmare for me since every single recruiters I talked with gave me the same answer: ""I believe it will be hard for you to find a research job since you have extensive regulatory and quality experience. You have no internship or any relevant experience that we can use."" I even specified that I am willing to take an entry level position to help me build my career.

I am in desperate need of help and guidance to somehow dig myself out of regulatory affairs. Does anyone have similar experience or have any suggestions that may help me in my search?

Right - I want to preface this by saying I don't really ever do projects like this, so if I seem like an idiot, that's probably because I am. Maybe it isn't possible, I dunno, but I would love it if anyone had any ideas.

So I've got this replica of Excalibur - https://ibb.co/gCkW8n. I want to try and create a functional Sword In The Stone, and by functional, I mean there needs to be some sort of device integrated into the construction that allows two modes - one where you can easily slide the sword out of the top, and one where it will not move even with the application. The sword is probably about 2.5 feet long and weighs approx. 8kg. It is blunt.

Originally, I was planning on just planning on doing a craft where you could slide it out whenever, but this would be much cooler. The original plan consisted of:
-Some sort of wooden base (to stop it falling over, it's heavy)
-Cutting up some styrofoam and sticking it all together to put on top of the base
-Modelling clay on the outside, painted to look like a rock

Anyway, I'm trying to think of ways to construct and integrate a device (and that might mean the plan above being heavily altered) into the construction to allow the bi-functionality.

These diagrams are terrible, I'm a geneticist, not an engineer, but my initial two ideas were:
-https://ibb.co/cBxuTn, having some sort of circular ""clamp"" that could be tightened around the blade using a cord. I realised after I drew this that I wouldn't have a way to unclamp it so I think that sucks.
-https://ibb.co/eVRAJn, OK, so then I was thinking about a more complicated frame to hold a device that would clamp the sword from either side, some sort of button, I dunno.

I'm rambling, I'm aware both of those ideas are terrible.

I just finished my second year of studying Computer Engineering at my nearby state school and I am starting to reconsider whether or not this is for me. I am currently at a 3.19 (finals haven't been graded yet) and I think I have sort of lost interest in the classes I am taking. I am sick of shitty professors who don't explain themselves well, and shitty TA's who I can barely understand. I really just want to start applying all the theory in real-world situations but we haven't done that yet and I fear I am slowly getting burnt out from this stuff.

I am considering changing to computer science next semester, where I have a little more freedom on the types of classes I get to pick, required credits per semester will be lower too which might give me more time to make some personal projects and what not. 

With this summer coming up I am going to be working part-time, collect my thoughts, try new things, going to attempt to build a website for a family friend, and try to find a good reason to stick through it.

48,Switching to Second Shift as a Manufacturing Engineer,1525456457,"So, my boss just came up to me today asking if I was interested in switching to second shift as a manufacturing engineer. He didn't give me much detail on anything else but just asked me if I would consider it. To give you guys some background, I currently work a sporadic schedule since my partner works late valet shifts, which completely messes up my sleep and I end up coming in closer to noon to work my 10 hour shifts. I also work one day a week at a climbing gym and in my free time I try to go out and climb after work or make jewelry to sell.

These are the benefits that I have seen from this:
1. My partner and my schedules would line up better, we would probably argue less..
2. I would be able to get in my morning workouts without feeling a time pressure.
3. I could wake up later.
4. My coworker mentioned that typically second shift engineers make more than first shift since it is a more difficult position to fill (?) (Could someone verify this?)

Negatives:
1. The climbing gyms are only open until 10 PM so I wouldn't be able to climb during the week with any of my friends and during the weekend the outdoor area I go to only offers half day Sundays (pre-12 PM)
2. It is difficult to find climbing partners in the morning to switch belays with.
3. I would only be able to climb Friday after my other job after already climbing and half day Sundays outdoor.
4. I wouldn't have the option to come in earlier to leave earlier.

I don't know, I am feeling really uncomfortable with the idea but it does have some sort of benefits. What are your experiences with working second shift or of someone you know who has? Is it true that I could argue a higher pay?

Here is how the current electrical works. the

1\) stator generates power \(AC\-alternating current\)

2\) The generated AC goes to a regulator and rectifier

3\) it goes into the battery

I've bought it to a neighborhood ""mechanic"" and cut a wire which turned out to be the voltage limiter. What happened now is that the stator is supplying more than 12v to the battery causing it to boil \(over charging\). It solve the problem of battery draining fast but it also led to the battery getting destroyed fast.

My initial idea would be placing a relay so that the voltage limiter would only be severed when i need additional charging in the battery. otherwise it would be back to the old wiring.

2nd choice would be to look for a better regulator that could handle the increase in voltage. I need guidance on this since i don't know how to check the regulator's capacity.

77,How would I make a strong bridge for a project?,1525389269,"Me and 2 friends are trying to make the best bridge that can support the most weight. Weight will be added to the center of the bridge. Bridge must be 12 inches long and must be at least 6 inches off the ground. You can't have columns closer than 6 inches (this is to keep people from making their bride with just columns filling the bottom.). The width must be 3-5 inches. My groups idea is to take rulers and glue two together with super glue then take paracord and wrap it tightly around it. We will have one of these on each end of the bridge. Then we thought we could drill a hole into the top of each column (this will be relevant in a sec). Then we were going to weave the paracord into a tight net like cloth and tie it through the hole with zip ties. Then for the main part we are going to use a tarp(figured this would hold lots of weight without breaking) and tie that down on top of the paracord net. The way we thought this would work is that weight would be added to the center causing the tarp to go inwards but the net underneath would allow it to hold more weight before it just sinks so low it counts as it breaking. 

The only problem I see with this is that the rulers may be too weak. If they are clamped in one spot and weight is added to the center of the bridge then once it hits a certain point the rulers will just snap.

84,What Diametral Pitch values are achievable for machine shops?,1525374613,"**Some background and context:**

I am designing a rack and pinion system for a large double leaf bascule bridge. This is a very large project costing 10s of millions of dollars in structural work, so to a certain extent the cost of the machinery is not too much of an issue.

I am currently using the AGMA standards 908-B89 Method for Determining Geometry Factors, and 2001-D04 Fundamental Rating Factors and Calculation Methods for Involute Spur and Helical Gear Teeth. Using these standards I can calculate the geometry factors and bending/pitting strengths of a gear of any Diametral Pitch and geometry.

The rack gears have been coming out to be 15 to 18 feet in radius depending on the Diametral Pitch/Number of Teeth. There will only be 4 total racks. I am trying to keep the size of these racks as small as possible.

The Diametral Pitch range I am working with is between 0.5 and 0.75 with 0.6 giving me the smallest rack diameter.

**Questions:**

Are gears of this size cut with a traditional hob or milled out with a CNC machine?

If hobs are expected to be used, would a shop have hobs in this size range? (I've seen some that specify they have hobs at 1/2, 3/4, and interger sizes, but not 6/10 etc)

How costly would it be to develope a custom hob of this size? (Not looking for an exact number, but maybe just range)

I have contacted a few machine shops I know we work with to ask them, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask here as well.

85,Can exhaust airflow/CFM indicate the cooling performance of a portable air conditioner?,1525365810,"So [portable air conditioners](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/) are notoriously elusive in terms of accurate testing. The DoE devoted a huge [122-page report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/04/f30/Portable%20AC%20TP%20Final%20Rule.pdf) to finding a way to accurately and reliably test these things for cooling performance. The conclusion was that it's almost impossible to do so given the huge range of variables that could affect performance (humidity, external temperature, infiltration air conditions, placement in home, etc.)

I have nine of these things (testing for a pro consumer review outlet) and I'm looking for a way to test for performance in a cramped apartment in Boston with rapidly fluctuating temperatures and humidity shifts. I can only test one or two a day, so there's no way in hell measuring temp changes over time would reliable indicate performance given those hourly/daily weather changes.

So! I'm settling on the tentative conclusion that exhaust airflow (in the form of cubic feet per minute) could provide an extremely loose but somewhat trustworthy indication of performance, the idea being exhaust airflow indicates the speed of warm/hot air that is being extracted from the room (the faster the better), but also the volume of infiltration air seeped into the room via negative pressure displacement of the exhaust air.

For tools, I have a handheld anemometer (for calculating CFM), wattage meter, dB recorder, and basic thermostat/humidity meter.

The primary issue is that there is only 1 PE that I know of in my organization, an electrical engineer working in an entirely different role. My state requires 5 references (easy enough) of which 3 should be PEs ""familiar with my character and professional reputation."" I assume my best bet is to network with PEs who will be able to vouch for me, but is this sufficient as they will not have been involved in my work? 

The secondary issue is that the experience requirements are ambiguous at best. I believe my test experience will count as almost all of it has required me to develop test methods, understand and apply code requirements, and make recommendations based on results and analysis.

Formatting isn't my biggest issue, even though the changes would change an A paper to a C paper, my biggest issue is the content.

2,"[Question] Interested in Architecture/Construction careers, torn between Civil Engineering &amp; Engineering Management majors",1525318116,"Hi everyone, I'm an 18 year old high school senior who committed to a college for Civil Engineering several months ago. My main interest is in architectural/construction practices, so I would be taking the structural-focused concentration in my undergrad program. 

Yes, I know that some schools offer architectural engineering programs (which is a much more relevant set of studies to what I want to end up doing for a career), but none of the few schools around me that offer that program were a good fit for me. Also, I am aware that the sort of career I want is a very niche field, but I've come to terms with that given that architecture is my passion (And no, I don't want to just study plain ""art-based"" architecture; I'm not good enough at art and much perfer the collaborative, problem-solving aspects of engineering).

I've been reading a lot lately about how a lot of structural guys feel unfulfilled by their work, mainly because of the stress and liability associated with such important and tedious work, and also that many people in this line of work have switched to management positions, which pay more and are broad enough to encompass more aspects of construction-related work.

That said, I'm left wondering if going the bachelor's in civil, PE in structural route could limit me to a very specific and unhappy career path. My school also offers a really good Engineering Management program, which I think could be a better choice for me since it's broader and may allow me to do the kind of work I want in construction/architecture firms, rather than being streamlined to assess structures every day.

I'm looking to hear the perspective of current engineers who work in either field that could share their experiences and help me choose which one might be a better choice for me given my (extremely vague- sorry!) description of my ideal career. Thanks &amp; all questions are welcome, didn't want to give away too many specifics about my future school for the sake of privacy.

21,How to add air/porosity to calcined kaolinite clay.,1525284300,"First time posting on reddit, looking for some help solving a problem we have at my work.

We’ve just started making calcined clay to be used as a field conditioner for baseball fields.  We bought some of the competitors stuff (Turface brand) and did some comparing and their stuff is about half the weight per volume of our stuff.

We think the main issue is Turface has more air in their product than ours (creates more bubbles when submerged, some of it floats where as ours sinks).  Another issue is ours has some silica sand in it and we’re working on getting that resolved but we’re not sure how much impact that will have.

How could we make ours more porous/lighter?

I’m thinking we would need to manage the amount of moisture in the clay when it’s loaded in the furnace or adjust the temperature so it’s not heated up to fast or too slow.  Someone else suggested somehow adding air to the clay before it’s loaded. 

Interested in what you guys think.

25,Maximum Flow Rate from an Overhead Water Tank,1525280235,"I've got a probably fairly simple question that is doing my head in, even while ignoring all losses for the sake of simplicity.

Situation:
A water roof tank that feeds a few tanks at ground level. Let's say this tank has an average water level of 3m from the surface to the bottom of a 4"" pipe entry. From the pipe entry to the exit at ground level are a further 19 m (all vertical).

What dictates the maximum available flow rate from that specific pipe? I'm under the impression that the discharge flow rate at the bottom can't exceed the flow rate entering the pipe, which would be solely based on the 3 m of head?

But at the same time I can't reconcile that with the idea that velocity head would increase as potential head decreased (which in this case would be 19+3 = 22m).

Is this at a constant pressure, and therefore Charles' law? I'm thinking that since Charles' law states that at constant pressure, the absolute temperature and volume of a gas are directly proportional, and therefore the increase in temperature would just cause the gas to expand, which is what pushes the piston.

I think I'm just confused a bit. Does the gas do work on the piston to move it, and so it has nothing to do with the pressure? (i.e. the reason it moves is not due to an increase in pressure).

Would the combined gas equation still tell us this, because you'd just have p1 &amp; p2 the same in the equation? Do you always use the combined gas equation, and not the individual gas laws, because the combined one takes into consideration all of the other ones?

Essentially I plan to be out in six months to a year. In the end the decision is mine alone, but any input is appreciated.

**Goals**: Build a successful game changing sustainability minded startup before I’m 30 (22 now). If that doesn’t pan out, a healthy contingency plan where I’m making a lot of money, traveling a whole bunch as a part of my job (this is a huge one), not doing a lick of actual engineering work, surrounded by people that inspire me, and in heavily windowed buildings with amenities. 

**Job 1 Pros**: Large, universally known corporation. High salary. Potential for movement into other organizations which fit my interests, or into a different large company in a leadership role. Maybe I’d be able to leverage this into a traveling, high paying position for my next job?

**Job 1 Cons**: I’ve worked in the same building  as a co-op before, it’s a godawful environment. I’d be downright miserable there and I can’t guarantee I could perform well enough to transfer to a different department. No natural sunlight. 6AM start time. Immersed in the drone and overwhelming stench of a dreary manufacturing setting. Working with the world’s least personable ancient people, no one can think outside of their job.

Racist feel (never experienced anything bad, but a couple years ago I could tell they weren’t too hot on having a young brown dude telling them what to do). Notoriously political. 

**Job 2 Pros**: Travel, about 50-70%. Six week training period in a completely different culture.  Friendly, diverse people in a start-up environment with the luxury of job security. Constantly making contacts spread out over North America. Better job description. More varied role, most of which is talking to people. Potential for growth if I were to stay, likely establishing offices in other countries like Germany or India. Lovely building where I get to alternate between a cubicle and a nice, clean lab. Did I mention I’d constantly be at the airport?

**Job 2 Cons**: Salary is 15% lower and gives me less bargaining power down the line. Not a big name, other employers wouldn’t take me seriously if I were to apply. Less motivation to transition out. Niche market, I’d be boxing myself into a corner. Further from my industry than the other job. 8AM start time. Not much physical activity.

The reason I am contemplating this is I have been undertaking project manager for the last four years and am the only project manager in the lower band, with all my fellow colleagues being in the higher band. By resigning I force the organisations hand of having to replace my position, which I am also going for.  

While this seems good in my head, the risks are they just don’t hire me and thus i have to find another job and it also means that I most likely will lost me accumulated leave. 

Just wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts in this space or anything I’m missing. 

Further to this the industry is about to go through a boom period.

73,"Question for working chemical engineers (others that deal with PV-OP controls may also apply), regularly dealing with process control maintenance/fixing...",1525142791,"So, I'll try to make my question as direct as possible, since this is something I'm having difficulty researching as part of my literature review. I've finished a paper, but I'm still on my term for Msc in Process Control and my prof wants me to explore another problem, but it's related to parts of process control where I'm not sure where to look. The premise is as such:

Let's say you come across some oscillatory signals from the system, and it is assumed that you already know it is due the actuators/controls. However, looking at the PV-OP signals, it seems really hard to know whether it is due to a tuning problem, stiction, failing sensor, or from other external disturbance affecting your system. The only way to know if it really is because of a certain problem, you check the tuning parameters, and see if it stabilizes. You wished that there was an automatic system that reads the PV-OP signals and determines whether the problem is due to suboptimal tuning or something else, but alas, your firefighting job as a ""tuning"" engineer continues.

As a follow up to this, I want to know:

1. Is this hypothetical scenario true to an extent? Is there really no autonomous solution for this extremely specific occurrence? (Ignoring root-cause solutions of course, which is why I assumed that it the problem is already determined to be coming from the controls)

2. If it is true/untrue, could I get some links to papers regarding problems or solutions to this exact issue? Like, EXACTLY tailored to a problem of ""is it because of shit tuning, or other things?..."" All I've been doing the past week is using terms like ""fault detection diagnosis control tuning"" in sciencedirect and going through a bunch of papers that are way too rigorous and don't detail the surface of the problems like how I described it.

I want to connect a hydraulic motor to a gear, that is going to drive a second gear. I want (let’s say) 100 Nm torque on the second gear, which has a fixed radius of 0.5 m, so a 50 N force.


How do I go about finding a hydraulic motor that can supply this force/moment to the second gear? From what I can tell from various suppliers is that they only give a torque value. If I want to connect a gear to the output shaft of the motor, the torque of this gear will be greater than the torque of just the output shaft. The force will however be the same. 


What I am thinking is that I take the torque value supplied by the manufacturer and divide by the radius of the output shaft to get the force, and this value must be equal to or greater than 50 N?

5,Need to design a laser sensor based system to measure thickness. Is my method correct?,1525078007,"I am asked to design a system that can measure the thickness of a material on a conveyor\-belt. The system has to be based on one of the Keyence IL\-series laser sensors \(\(link to PDF\)\[[http://dynamics\-automation.com/pdf/Keyence/LS/il\_ks.pdf](http://dynamics-automation.com/pdf/Keyence/LS/il_ks.pdf)\]\). The height varies between 20 and 30 cm and I want the reading to be exact on 1mm. The result should be read in on a PC through USB with a samplerate of 5Hz.

I have no experience with this sensor, but saw a video where it gives the distance relative to the reference \(positive or negative depending on further or closer to the head\). The method I have in my head goes as follows:

The conveyor\-belt will be the reference. This would mean that I would need the IL\-600, because it has a reference distance of 600mm from the head and the closest it can measure is 200mm from the head. This equals to 40cm above the reference. Choosing for the IL\-600 would mean that I lose all the distance under the conveyor\-belt, but I still have to pay for this range.

Next, I would use the analogue current output \(4\-20mA\), because I want the result to be sent over a long distance. This way, it would be less sensitive to noise. Next, I need to read in the current using some ADC, this is the part where I'm struggling:

I think I need a 10 bit ADC, because the measurement range goes from 200mm \(\+4mA?\) to 1000mm \(\+20mA?\) from head. This means 800 values and 2\^10 = 1024.

I would like to have a samplerate of 5Hz, but I think this has to be done from the PC. I'm struggling to find an ADC that has a 10\-bit digital value and USB\-output. Would an Arduino be a solution? It can be powered with \&gt;7.2V on the power pin \(that way it doesn't need power over USB\), has a 10\-bit ADC and has USB, if I'm right?

Am I making any mistake here?

2. extending the hood around the lens. It worked, but I had to extend it out quite a bit further than I would like.

3. narrowing the tube between the LED and the lens. worked to an extent, but this would gradually diminish my light output. I also tried using several small tubes to guide the light better with the same  result.

12,A physics PhD: good or bad for engineering job prospects?,1525047698,"Hey everyone,

I posted this on physicsforums but I thought it would be beneficial to get some insight from engineers as well!

I'm a student who is currently undertaking a Master of Physics (coursework &amp; research) at the University of Western Australia. I have also previously completed two Bachelor's degrees: one in physics and one in electrical engineering (with honours). Next year, I am hoping to start a PhD in high-energy physics (HEP) somewhere in Australia, however, I am really struggling to choose between doing a highly theoretical topic (such as supersymmetry, string theory, etc.) or doing a topic that is closer to the experimental front (which would involve analyzing data provided by CERN and getting my hands dirty).

My inability to choose stems from the fear that following my passion (theory beyond the SM) will mean that not only will my research have no industry relevance, but that I will also have VERY hard time finding academic jobs relevant to my field (I've heard through the grapevine that you have more chance of becoming a professional athlete than becoming a professor in theoretical HEP which is honestly quite dejecting). Also choosing the experimental option would at least provide me some skills in signal/data analysis (which is honestly a very interesting area to me as well) that I could apply to some areas in industry.

However as I mentioned before, understanding physics beyond the standard model like string theory is undoubtedly my passion so I would really like to pursue a PhD in it to determine whether or not it can become more than just a hobby. I've heard of theoretical HEP PhD's going into finance, etc. when finding an academic position proved fruitless, but if I'm being honest, that doesn't sound all that appealing to me. Which leads me to my main question:

In case I can't find an academic position in theoretical HEP, do you think my EE degree and MPhys (both of which involved experimental research projects highly focused on signal processing and data analysis) would be sufficient credentials to land a job in signal analysis/engineering? Or perhaps if I'm lucky, even some area of industry research (if so, what areas)?

Further, do you think having a PhD in theoretical HEP, in addition to my other credentials, would be a benefit or a hindrance in securing these types of jobs?

Some potentially relevant information:

I have 12 weeks of work experienceat an electrical engineering company

My EE research project involved analyzing audio signals to achieve desired acoustic properties

My MPhys research project is about detecting gravitational waves which involves heavy signal processing and manipulating large sets of data (100GB+) using python

By the end of this year my MPhys research should produce at least 1 or 2 papers in the Physical Review Letters journal

I want to place cinder blocks on my roof, arranged sort of like the 6 on dice. I'll lay a large tarp over the cinder blocks and then pin it down with more cinder blocks.


The theory is to prevent the solar load from the sun from hitting my roof as much as possible. I am willing to treat the tarp as a consumable.


 I WILL get permission from my landlord before putting things on the roof.


Is this a good idea? Will it work? Are there better or more cost effective ways to keep my house cool? Any precautions I should take before doing this?

22,Career Advice. Sort of in a Tailspin.,1525032965,"Hi,


I am a Engineer with 4 years of Experience. Around 10th grade I got sucked into the family electronics business. Together we shipped 1000s of products for T&amp;M. Linear Power Supplies, USB Function Generators, WiFi Farming Sensor Systems.


I did everything technical. Circuit Design, PCB Design, uC Programming and even computer side interfaces. Its a family business small scale and this is what we do. Every thing I know has weeks and months of hardship and doing things the wrong way. I remember that the first PCB I designed, the tracks were so thin that they ripped when soldering.


Started with PIC16/PIC18 and then Cortex M3/M4. Worked with PSoCs and Xilinx Virtex FPGAs. Have a VLSI masters with good grades. Thesis was on FPGA computational accelerators.


I eventually got tired doing all this alone and decided to get a job. Unfortunately, living in India where the majority of opportunities were Software, I landed a Software ish job where I don't even get to program. I am a very fast learner with impostor syndrome so pick up things fast. 


The only programming I am doing is in Python to automate my work. Its easy and comfortable and I like my boss but boring. 


I don't know how to find roles where the positions are not as rigid and I can do a more Hardware (not Chip Level but Board Level). 


I feel overqualified for what I do, under-qualified for to do anything else and sort of in a tailspin as to how to go about with my future. I am bored working 2-3 hours a day. I feel like my mind is loosing its edge. 



I don't mention most of my work with the family business because it is not full time barring 2 years but I feel as if I am underselling myself. I also don't know if I can claim the experience since I did not learn any specific domain fully.


Should I put out everything I did because it may come off as bullshitting ? 


Do I lose credibility by saying I worked for my family business ?


Is there any hope for me to find a job where I can work as part of a team that has end to end ownership ?


Is the problem geography ? Should I look for work outside of India ?

25,What's the relationship between the power input and the gear ratios of a planetary gearbox?,1525027646,"Hello :) this is my first post ever.

Background: I'm a structural engineering student who has found an interest in wind turbines. Right now I'm doing a small project where I'm trying to design a 3D printed 300 Watt horizontal axis wind turbine. In this context I have a question that I've had trouble finding clear answers to on the internet. 

The question is mainly directed to mechanical engineers. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/kQlPIHR) is a simple sketch of the setup in question.

The [motor](https://imgur.com/a/TZjfQKk) 

For this question let's assume the power coefficient ""Cp"" of the wind turbine is 1.0 (this is impossible, but for now let's roll with it). 

**The question:**

Let's say that the input power P from the wind has a certain value at some wind speed. This makes the rotor spin with a certain rpm and torque, since P = rpm * torque. Let's say the motor has a torque resistance of 1 N*m and the planetary gearbox has a gear ratio of 1:6. This means that the ""high speed shaft"" in the sketch has 6 times more rpm than the rotor and the ""low speed shaft"" - but doesn't this also mean that the torque is 6 times smaller? In other words; does this mean that the torque produced by the wind on the rotor has to be 6 times larger than the motor resistance in order for the turbine to start spinning? (For this assume that the efficiency if the system is 1.0, meaning no friction or heat loss from the bearings or gearbox etc.)

If this indeed is the case then good - I just have a hard time accepting it I guess. 

However if I'm completely wrong I hope someone can give me a good answer coupled with an amazing explanation. 

I hope someone can help me out and that my question is understandable - if not then feel free to comment or send me a pm with questions and I'll do my best to be more clear.

66,Leaving my First job before being there even 1.5 years,1524882840,"I graduated from college and spent about 8 months looking for a job after graduation.

I have been at this job for just under a year and a half.  While working there I have done various projects, but many of them seem to be started, and then stopped to work on another ""hotter"" project (This seems to happen to most engineers).

I am on the standards team and haven't been doing much standardizing of things, and even what I suggest takes a long time to implement (See example below).  I have been getting a bit annoyed I guess with management, and how nothing really seems to be changing at any decent speed.

Last week a recruiter emailed me and since I have been annoyed and working overtime I figured I would look into it.  I had the interview and spoke with the company and they verbally gave me an offer.

I would be making ~20% more money (I am making 51K, New job is at 60K)
The commute is 5-10 min farther (about 30 min so still fine with me)
My current position I am doing mechanical engineering and supposed to be standardizing their machines.  I am fairly decent at this and do enjoy my work, just not the management and poor procedures.
The new position would be a mix of mechanical, process control, and electrical engineering.  This would allow me to gain much more experience.  I have done some process control during a co-op and a bit at my current job, and the electrical is high-level stuff (Making sure a 24V thing gets 24V and not 240V, or 480V basically).  I have done a bit of that at my current job as well.  Neither of those two fields though am I strong in, and that is making me hesitate.

Any advice for me?
Is it bad to be leaving a job because of management after such a short time?
How do I actually leave if I decide to because I have no idea?
Should I ask the company to write up the offer for me before bringing it up at my current job?
Anything that I am missing?


TLDR;
My current job has shitty process making me work overtime/Saturdays.  I have suggested improvements but they take very long for simple things.  I am annoyed by it, but like the actual work, I do.  The new job would give me 20% raise and would have a much rounder experience (Mechanical, process, and electrical).


Example:
The current job I work at makes what they call subassemblies, which is a bunch of parts that are mated in the model and just kinda float there.  To show how the parts actually go onto the machine they take the model number and make a ""-detail"".  Then they use that ""-detail"" for their drawings, while the other model is for the Bill of Material for their parts system.

I started my 2nd week making a model, and wasn't taught how they do things, so I saw the end product and was like ohh yea I remember this from school then used an ""envelope"" for the frame to keep it out of the BoM.  I went through and finished up the drawing and the checker thought it was good.  Maybe a month-month and a half later someone looked at the model and can down to tell me I was wrong in doing it that way and to follow procedure on how to make it.
During the next engineering meeting I brought up my way and asked everyone why we don't do it that way, no one had any answer, the head engineer told me to look into it some more.  So I did, next meeting, told to look into it more again, next meeting, they decided to do it, and I will do training during the next meeting.  Well, I think 3 more meetings went by until I did the training (I was ready the first one).  During those 3 meetings, I brought up another way to help speed up our large models (SpeedPak).  Well after I did training, they decided to see how well SpeedPak works with envelopes (It doesn't matter, still works fine).  I spent a month or two trying to get time to look into SpeedPak more to find the best way for us to implement it.
Then once I was ready again they pushed back my training to show everyone how to do it.

So total I suggested to use ""Envelopes"" which is a very simple change that improves our drawing, and models by making the mates correct and parts no longer floating, and it took about a year for them to start implementing it.  I think me and another engineer are the only two who do it though.

70,Efficiency of heating water,1524877929,"This is a general science and engineering question without practical use. I'll delete if this is not the right subreddit. 

Water is known to have a high specific heat capacity (1000 calories per liter per °C). This means it takes lots of energy to heat water to a temperature, but hot water can therefore release lots of energy as it cools. 

When I make tea, I have to heat water to a certain temperature, requiring lots of energy use. That's almost entirely lost to the environment because I leave it to cool on the countertop. 

Given that, [hypothetically] what do you all think the most efficient process to heat water to a selected temperature be? 

The best device I can think of is creating a sun oven (with a large lens focused on it) to heat the water as the tea is made, then submerging a (sterilized) piston in the water. The heat of the water causes a temperature change in the gas in the piston chamber, which causes work to be done as the gas expands, which can drive a generator and charge a battery.

I've just finished my 2nd year of studying mechanical engineering at the University of Toronto. Since in our 3rd year, we can opt for the PEY (Professional Experience Year) program, in which we apply for internships available through the program, it is obviously wise to take the summer to prepare in some capacity.

Unfortunately, it is close to May and I haven't applied to any positions, so I am very likely out of the running for engineering work. I should also mention that my GPA is not particularily good (&lt;3.0). I wouldn't say I have a tough time learning, in fact I understood pretty much everything that was on our curriculum; I'm just not very good at preparing for finals. Regardless, I'll need to garner some skills outside the classroom to help distinguish myself.

My question is, what sort of work can I get involved in over the Summer break, to help grow my knowledge/skills so that I may grow as a studying engineer, and have a better chance at getting hired at the positions that interest me most? 

I am currently on my schools Formula SAE team as a member in Engine section, so I plan on devouting a decent amount of time to working on our car and learning about our section.

74,How does Remote Braking Systems work?,1524867133,"&gt; A remote braking apparatus has a vacuum conduit network that operably connects a vacuum source to both the power boost of the towed-vehicle and a pair of solenoid valves. A vacuum cylinder receives vacuum from the solenoid valves as directed by an electronic circuit connected to the vehicle's battery. The vacuum actuates the vacuum cylinder causing it to move between a resting position and a braking position. A cable mechanically interconnects the vacuum cylinder and a brake pedal of the towed-vehicle. The cable passes through a cable shield tube that is anchored to both the vacuum cylinder and the firewall of the vehicle, thereby directing the movement of the vacuum cylinder to the brake pedal, allowing the vacuum cylinder to control the movement of the brake pedal. In response to a signal from the electronic circuit, the solenoid valves direct vacuum into the vacuum cylinder, causing it to move from the resting position to the braking position, pulling the brake pedal and applying the brakes of the towed-vehicle.

I'm designing a retention mechanism that will interface with the typical webbing/D ring setup in motorcycle helmets. After prototyping is finished, I hope to having it third-party safety certified through Snell. 

When they certify the retention mechanisms they fix the helmet in place, fasten the retention system, and subject the retention to two loads; a static load of 23kg for one minute  to observe stretching, and a dynamic load by immediately replacing the previous weight with a 38kg weight that is dropped 120mm down a guide rod into mechanical stop. 

Picture of testing apparatus [here. ](http://www.smf.org/images/RigDynRetention.JPG)

I'm boot strapping it so I want to be sure it's up to par before committing the money to certify it. 

My thinking is that I can avoid recreating their test explicitly, saving time and money, by finding the static load equivalent of the most strenuous part of the test- the weight drop. i.e. hanging say a 300kg weight for X amount of seconds to simulate the same amount of energy it would undergo otherwise.

6,Industrial Engineering vs. Operation Management,1524794903,"Hi, I'm currently a first year student at McGill University (Canada) in the Bachelor of Commerce program. I come from a scientific background and was kind of bored this year with most of my core courses, except Statistics and Operation Management, which I really liked. Throughout the year, I struggled (and still am) about what career I want to pursue. Because of my interest in science and because I liked stats and OM, I thought about going into Industrial Engineering next year. However, I cannot decide between changing into IE or stay in the B.Com and do a major in Statistics and a concentration in Operation Management.

If I stay in my actual program (B.com), I could be done in 2-3 years. If I switch (IE) I have another 4-5 years. But I am very young so I don't really mind spending more time in university if it can lead to the career of my dream.

Here's the basis of my hesitation: the school where I want to pursue my IE program is not well know/prestigious, especially if you go out of Québec/Canada. (School would be ÉTS Montréal)

Therefore, am I better off with simply a B.Com (stats, operation management) but with the ""McGill"" name on it? or am I better doing my engineering degree, even if there is no name recognition associated with the school?

Also, do you know the difference in jobs related to the two different programs?

The turbulence of the stream will result in the air from both sides getting effectively mixed, and then redistributed roughly evenly onto both sides of the opening.

Here's how I did it.

I assumed that I can treat the blade as if it was a flat panel flying perpendicular to the air. Of course, it's actually moving at an angle, but I don't know what the angle is, or what effect that has on the downforce. But it can't be more than the force with perpendicular motion.

The force on an object moving through air is defined by the drag equation:  

    F = .5 * rho * S^2 * A * Cd
    where:
    rho is the density of air (1.2 g/l);
    S is speed;
    A is frontal cross-section area;
    Cd is drag coefficient.

I rearranged to solve for speed:

    S = 1 / sqrt(.5 * rho * A * Cd / F)

Then I can have power:

    P = F * S

Force, for both of its instances, is the weight of the craft. I used the weight of an Apache, 17,650 lb.

For area, I couldn't find out how wide the blades are, so I referred to a [picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/McDONNELL_DOUGLAS_AH-64_APACHE.png) I found on Wikipedia, and [this online ruler](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/tools/pixel-ruler.html). It seems the blades are about 25 pixels wide, and 586 pixels long. (Technically, it's two blades, but I couldn't measure just one, since it's partly hidden.) Wikipedia also says that the rotor diameter is 48 ft, so the blades must be 25 / 586 * 48 = 2.04778157 ft wide. I measured width near the tips, but it seems reasonably constant.

So, 

    F = 17650 lbf,
    A = 48 ft * 2 ft = 96 ft^2,
    rho = 1.2 g/l,
    Cd = let's say 1,
    P = 1 /sqrt(.5 * rho * A * Cd / F) * F = 12752.8255 hp

But the Apache's engine only has 2 x 1,690 = 3380 hp. Therefore, [bumblebees can't fly](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bumblebees-cant-fly/).",AskEngineers,Tiiba,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8f0018/i_tried_to_calculate_how_much_power_a_helicopter/

39,Hired as an engineer but seem to be considered a technician?,1524714657,"I was recently  hired by a large tech company after applying to a mechanical engineering  position. The interview process went very smoothly, \(3 very technical  interviews \+ expenses payed visit to the company before an offer\). I was  offered a reasonable salary from what I'd read on glassdoor, and told  that I would be working on ""build team"" which was described as a team  where ""you wouldn't be working on designing high volume plastic  injection molded parts."" I questioned this a little more but the  offer\-er \(actually the head of the engineering department\) insisted that  there was ""basically no difference."" I have two years of experience and  no prior experience designing high volume parts, so this seemed like a  reasonable offer.

I accepted and have  been working for the company for about 1.5 months. After my first week  it became clear that build team was really more of a technician role  \(everyone else on build team had applied to a technician position\). The  vast majority of the work that I've done so far has been assembling  prototypes, and several people have refereed to me a technician. Overall  I feel like I was actively deceived into taking the position \+ a mix of  frustration and embarrassment that this will tarnish my resume.

I  recently spoke with my direct supervisor about this, who insisted that I  was doing really good work, and that I could do very well at the  company if I stuck around. They also said that they ""don't really  consider me the same as other build team members who's job is to  assemble things and not ask questions."" There is no precedent for  technicians/build team members becoming full fledged engineers, and I  have been given slightly more interesting work since bringing it up, but  no clear action from a managerial standpoint.

Another  strange factor is that I've spoken with two of the other younger  \(full\-fledged\) mechanical engineers who \(after they both told me  their/asked my salary\) told me that I am being payed in one case more,  and in one case just slightly less.

Anyone  have thoughts or advice from a similar experience? I am planning to  start applying to other jobs, but fully uprooted my life to come work at  this company and actually would really like to work here had this not  happened.",AskEngineers,SoftReturn9,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8ezs0m/hired_as_an_engineer_but_seem_to_be_considered_a/

42,Need some sort of single phase motor relay with delay?,1524711719,"Hope this is an appropriate post for this forum?

Helping a friend with an aquaponics setup.

He has an industrial hot water heater setup - basically a radiator in a box, with a single phase fan motor that forces air through it. Draws less than two amps. Has a big-ass capacitor as well. Fairly typical.

As a temporary fix, I switched it with a baseboard heater thermostat. A simple bimetallic type, will do 24v-240 v.

I wasn't sure how successful it would be. Worked for a while, then freaked about a bit and was stuck on. Apparently it would tend to chatter when it was right in the verge of switching on or off....So not ideal. 

I will scrap the thermostat and want something more suitable. I'm thinking a relay with incorporated delay as per the title. I guess it should be mechanical so I don't get any current leakage. 

He has a multi zone valve control for the hot water system. 

For one reason or another, he doesn't want to actually control most of the hot water circuits, but the heater puts out limited heat when the fan's not running. 

24vac is available at each zone control, so I thought I would connect the thermostat to the thermostat input, and use one of the zone controls to power a relay that will control the fan, so the coil will be 24vac, fan load will be 120v @~ 2 amps.

Any suggestions for a suitable mechanical relay, with delay? (I can add something separate, I guess, but that's getting pretty elaborate.) 

I'm assuming the controller has no incorporated delay, so I think I will need to allow for a delay to avoid chattering.",AskEngineers,Alan_Smithee_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8ezi20/need_some_sort_of_single_phase_motor_relay_with/

73,How to quickly stop a hobby motor (cheaply)? [Question],1524606764,"I asked a while ago about linear actuators/flexinol for a project I'm working on, and (while I'm still investigating that) for the moment, price is winning out.  I've designed a very crude ""linear"" movement system based on a hobby motor spitting a platter (~4-5"" across) through a gear assembly, with a straight linkage connecting a point on the edge of the platter to the object I need to move linearly.  So when the platter rotates 180 degrees, the linkage is at its maximum extension.  Rotate another 180 degrees, it reaches minimum extension.  Think train wheel linkage.  The benefit of this system is simplicity - I don't need to change the direction of travel of the motor, it just spins in a single direction, and stops at various times.

I intend to place some sort of switch to detect when the platter is in ""maximum extension,"" and when it reaches that, I would like to cut power to the motor to leave it right there (until I trigger it again).  Unfortunately, the whole system has some inertia - so when I cut power (disconnect the mosfet), the motor doesn't stop right away - it gradually slows.  (Don't worry, I didn't forget about a flyback diode for inductance!)  I'm hesitant to just increase friction because I want the whole device to be as silent as possible.

My question, then, is this: How do I quickly stop the motor when it reaches maximum extension (and presses the button I intend to install)?  I know I can physically tie the leads of the motor together to achieve ""electrical braking"" where the back-EMF is used to oppose the movement - but I'm not sure HOW I would implement this: my understanding is that to use a MOSFET I would need my microcontroller at the mosfet to have a common ground, and I don't see an obvious way of doing that in this setup.  I could use a relay, I suppose, but a mechanical one won't be as fast, and a SSR will be more expensive.

Perhaps electronic braking isn't even the best idea - maybe there's something I'm missing!

So, TL;DR: Need to stop small hobby motor (5-12v) as quickly as possible.  Priorities, in order, are (1) Reliable, (2) Silent, (3) Cheap, (4) Simple.

My 3rd graders are trying to engineer a water filter to place outside the school so (hypothetically) homeless people could collect rain/stream/etc water and run it through to filter it a little. I bought a TDS meter to measure our results. We made proto-types in 2L bottles using combos of sand, gravel, charcoal, and cotton balls (as I've seen on many youtube videos displaying this concept). As we filter the muddy water through, it definitely becomes more clear (muddy black to pale yellow/gray). They were excited it was working! However, the TDS reading jumps from ~200 for the muddy water to ~1000 after its filtered....
Any ideas how to fix it? There doesn't appear to be any visible excess sand/charcoal particles running through that is coming out in the filtered water.

I drive the motor with two phases (it is a two phase brushless type), and notice that it moves forward in little lurching steps rather than smoothly (it is driven by a two nice sine current sources).

Today I looked at how much current would be needed in single phases of the motor to move it forward and I noticed a compliance or springiness in the system where it can move forward but when the current is zeroed it moves backwards to where it was. Let's say it is at angle A. It goes to angle B then you turn on the current, then you 0 the current and it returns to A. If you exceed a critical angle then it moves forward and does not move back.

What about the design of the bearing is most critical in affecting this kind of behaviors? I'm not a mechanical engineer.

4,Leveraging Offers for a Salary Raise - Is this okay?,1524532299,"Hi Reddit. I had previously posted on this subreddit in regards to salary vs years experience and got great feedback. I thought Id give it a shot again and ask for all of your experiences/ advice again.

I have been working at a large engineering consulting firm in the greater Toronto region for 6 years. I have progressively worked my way up to the role of project manager on large scale municipal infrastructure projects. I currently have 5 direct reports, and manage and direct the work of a team of 10 members.

I am very happy with my job, but very unhappy with my pay. I currently make $75,000; market value based on OPSE salary surveys for someone in my role is $100k. When I have complained about my salary, I have been told by my superiors that I am gaining valuable experience which will be worth it in the long run and have sort of felt brushed off. Furthermore, I have been given the option on company shares and have been told that this shows commitment on the part of my current firm and that ""there is a plan for me, be patient"".

A month ago I decided to test the market and have just received an offer of $100k from another consulting firm. I am in an odd spot because I love my current job and I genuinely do enjoy all of the learning opportunities and prefer not to leave. I have also been told that my salary review at my current job will be completed in the next few weeks, with a raise coming in June. Based on past experience, I am not expecting a jump of 25k that it will take to get me to market value as this would represent a 33% raise. In the last few 6 years the largest raise I have received is 13%.

In this scenario, if I were to present the offer I have to my current employer do I risk compromising my reputation by forcing their hand? I am confident they will match the offer once presented as counter-offers were presented to two of my colleges in lower standing, when they received offers from competitors (both left for other reasons).

Furthermore, would it be unethical of me to do this to the company that has presented the offer?

10,Would more electricity be used with a boiler set at lower or higher settings?,1524523430,"(I tried checking on Wikipedia to see what they're called in English, but it's not too clear; I'm talking about devices that store hot water in a tank to be distributed to the kitchen, bathroom, and any other taps and such, which will heat the water in the tank when it is bellow a certain temperature; and for this question in specific, I'm talking about electric powered ones)

----

With a lower setting, it would use need less electricity to get the water to the target temperature, but then you would be mixing less cold water to get the desired temperature on the shower and faucets, using more hot water to get the same flow, causing the tank to empty faster and make the boiler have to heat a much large quantity of water per use. Meanwhile, with a higher setting, you would be using a lot less hot water to get the desired temperature at any given flow; but the boiler would have to fight a little harder against ambient temperature to keep the tank at the set temperature, and would also be working harder on every liter of water that goes in.

So what is the end result on the power bill after, lets say, an average of one shower a day, and two sessions of handwashing dishes a day, for a month, assuming there was no change in the weather, temperature of the incoming water supply, and usage patterns, for lower and for higher settings? Can this even be answered in general, without the specifics of the model of boiler used, local weather etc? And does the answer change with more or less usage, more or longer showers etc?

28,Piping Standards Advice - Poor Industry Practice,1524491053,"Throwaway account - Hey I'm a Mechanical Project Engineer with 6 years of experience.


I have experience project managing on the client side - pipelines, pumping and piping systems.
However, I feel like being on the client side has not given me enough experience to really exercise duty-of-care when overseeing contractors delivering piping systems to me. My project colleagues aren't engineers. I've never really worked in the piping design space - and don't have any senior mechanical engineers who can mentor me, and management aren't aware of all the specific piping requirements.


I'm only superficially familiar with the piping standards (ASME B31, AS 4041). These standards aren't statutorily-binding, however should be followed for duty of care. I feel like the implied expectation on myself as an engineer is to ensure contractors are qualified to the right welding standard, doing the correct welding procedures, and conduct Non Destructive Examination etc.


The industry I work in has contractors who don't really know the standards inside out yet commonly fabricate and handover piping. Engineering Design is seldom done from a stress analysis point of view. I'm expected to QA/QC their work, but it seems like the whole industry is ignorant apart from fabricating, hydro-testing and putting things into service.  A lot of the time, the project involves tying into existing infrastructure where you can match the existing to absolve risk, however, the standards stipulate proper design must be done.


Has anyone got advice who has worked in this industry? How can I train up really using piping design standards when I don't do it on a day-to-day basis (with no mentors). I can read the standards and create my own spreadsheets and use software, but I don't have anyone who can pull me up when I do wrong.

I didn't study Chem or physics in school, and am okay at Maths if I apply myself. Ive been at a loss of what to study, but have always found engineering an interesting area, and had it recomended to me in high school following a personality test (taking this with a grain of salt).

I'm planning to work on electromechanical contracting, designing of power systems on construction projects. As far as my knowledge, construction industry is popular in Australia, so, there must be relatively good opportunities\(hopefully\), right?

I'm open to any thoughts you have about my situation that might be helpful in any ways. Thank you for your answers. Cheers.",AskEngineers,sharker739,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8dzvjg/finding_job_in_australia_as_an_electrical_engineer/

81,Controlling TEC/Peltier Plate modules,1524324565,"Hey guys, so I needed some help regarding controller a Peltier plate module for a recent project but I want to use a bang-bang controller instead of a PID controller. 

Background: Trying to cool water through a peltier, which is in a container, which has heatsinks on both ends (cold and hot end). The cold one uses very thin fins that are spaced closer together (inside the container) to ensure best heat transfer and get the water cooler while the hotside is exposed to the envioronment (outside from the container) with a computer fan on top of heatsink.

I'm kind of running low on time (have like a week) and believe that pid isnt necessary since the temperature won't be fluctuating too much. I have a TMP 36 temp controller connected to a microcontroller which would read temperatures and if temp dropped under 13 C, lets say the bang bang controller would turn off the peltier. 

***My idea is to use a bang bang controller to turn peltier on/off but ease the on/off with an RC circuit that is connected from microcontroller to bang bang. I feel like this would delay the amount of time it takes to get the system to  0 and then back to 1 to reduce damage (I guess?) to the peltier for long term instead of an abrupt off/on. Is my idea correct?***

11,Calculate number of turns in electromagnet using resistance,1524236151,"Hi All,

So I have two bobbins, both holding a certain amount of very thin copper wire. Bobbins are the same size, one was wound by hand, the other was wound by a sewing machine. 

I was able to count the number of turns that fit onto the bobbin when I did it by hand. It was 1200 turns. I then measured the resistance of the electromagnet, and my result was a resistance of 96 ohms. This was ~200 feet of wire. 

I was not able to count the number of turns when I wound it by machine, but my assumption was that it was winding it tighter then I did by hand. This seems accurate, as when I measured the resistance of the electromagnet my result was 120 ohms. 

My larger question here is - ""is the resistance of the electromagnet simply a function of length of wire used - or is it a function of the number of turns"". 

Since my resistance is 25% more, does that mean that I am using 25% more wire (eg 250 total feet of wire in the second bobbin). Or does it mean that I have 25% more turns (eg 1500 turns in the second bobbin). There is actually a pretty big difference when you think of the two options, because my bobbin is thin so the circumference of my initial turns was small, and my last turns had a circumference much larger than the initial turns. So if it's the 25% more wire, it will be maybe 1300 turns total.

Any input is appreciated!

23,Sealing surfaces between two different metals and wide temperature range. What to look out for?,1524199219,"**brief story**

So as of right now I am prototyping and I require the thermal conductivity of copper and the strength of a stronger and stiffer metal. These two metals need to seal together using tension. Such as bolting and a gasket.

So I realize the issue here is thermal expansion. So on research it appears that certain alloys~ of Stainless steel and copper has near identical expansion... but not exact.

https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-expansion-metals-d_859.html

**Questions**

1 - Would this cause issue for temperature changes of 50C? Would this be doable with  certain gasket or non-permanent sealing agents?

2 - what sort of life span would the seal have?

3 - Googling some of those stainless steel show no results. How do I get access to these specific metals?

4 - Tips and suggestions.


**Notes**

The sealing surface is a circular shape similar to a pipe gasket.

It is imperative that the sealing does not take too much space.

The surfaces will be subjected to fairly rapidly changing temperatures.

The seal will not be subjected to bending or impacts of any kind.

However the seal will not be subjected to much bending or impacts.

I eventually want the end product to last years

**Edits**

Forgot to mention. The dealing surface will not be large. 7.5cm radius Max.

I'm a 2nd year MechE student that has pretty much done nothing but go to class, hang out/drink with friends, and play video games for the first two years of college.  I am in a fraternity (hence the drinking), but other than that, have done nothing to further my professional career.

I've got most of college paid for through scholarships, and my parents pay the remaining plus food/rent/etc, so I haven't had a job either. Most days I get up, go to class, go lift, play Fortnite, do HW, hang with friends, go to bed, repeat.
 I've realized recently that if I continue this path, I will graduate with a decent GPA, but have no job lined up and I'm trying to avoid having to work at Starbucks with an engineering degree..

Luckily, I've kept up a decent GPA (3.5), but I have barely any relevant engineering skills. I have a very basic understanding of Excel/MATLAB, but besides that I have no experience with AutoCAD, power tools, etc.  A few of my friends are doing internships, but given that I haven't done a whole lot in college, I think I would have trouble getting one.

41,Properly Sizing Grounds for Primary and Secondary sides of transformers.,1524176097,"Hello all, I work as a distribution engineer at an electric cooperative. We are currently working towards re-doing all our overhead and underground specs for designing line. We are going through and updating the materials used to build these units for inventory control and are makeing sure we are up to code with our specs. In the process I have run into an issue with grounding, specifically on the primary side of pad mount transformers and am hoping someone here will have some insight to help or let me know if we are on the right track.

The first thing we did was look into the NESC code sections 93.5A which states “The grounding conductors for equipment, raceways, cable, messenger wires, guys, sheaths, and other metal enclosures for wires shall have short time ampacities adequate for the available fault current and operating time of the system fault-protective device. If no overcurrent or fault protection is provided, the ampacity of the grounding conductor shall be determined by the design and operating conditions of the circuit, but shall be not less than that of AWG No. 8 copper. Where the conductor enclosures and their attachment to the equipment enclosures are adequate and continuous, this path can constitute the equipment grounding conductor.” This is the portion of code we believe we should be following for grounding transformers.

With this being said we provide transformers up to 167KVA 1PH 120/240, 300 KVA 3PH 120/208, 1500KVA 3PH 277/480, and up to 8MVA 3PH 2400/4160. Our system is 25KV phase to phase. The way I am interpreting the code we would need to calculate the maximum fault current on the secondary side of the transformer and size our ground so that the protection device (fuse) will blow before the fault current melts the ground. Should we be sizing based on the annealing properties of the wire which occurs at 250 degrees or the Onderdonk (yes this is a real term) melting point 1083 degrees. Is this the right way to view this? The reason I think we need to include the secondary fault current into this is because our ground and neutral tie into the secondary side of the transformer before the meter which is our point of demarcation. My thoughts are that we would need to be up to code since it is still our facilities. Should we possibly be using the NEC standard for grounding transformers?
I ran calculations based on the annealing point which would require very large grounds, up to 250 kcmill in certain situations; which seems ridiculous. We already use K-type fuses which generally blow in .2 seconds depending on the loading so there is no way to change fuse types. Changing the fuse to a smaller fuse helps a little bit but doesn’t affect to much. Do you guys have any experience on this? Am I looking into this the right way? I would appreciate any help or input, if you need any more information just let me know.

63,Land Development or Public Utilities,1524116270,"Hi all,

I'm looking for a bit of advice from engineers with experience in public utilities (especially water, sewer, and storm) or land development.

For the past year I've been working for a municipal utilities department as an EIT.  Recently, I've been asked if I would be interested in a promotion from EIT to Engineer I, but this would require leaving the utilities department and moving to a land development role that reviews and manages large scale construction projects like apartment complexes, shopping centers, etc.  

My educational focus was in water resources and I do enjoy using this experience in my day to day job.  There is a good chance that my utilities department would create a new position for me in 1-2 years that would match the salary of my current offer.

So I'm at a bit of a crossroads.  Deciding whether to stay with the utilities dept and hope for an eventual promotion or accept the current offer and change roles to land development?  I'm not totally sure I would enjoy land development as I've been told it heavily involves meetings with private developers/engineers while my current role has much more design and field work.  I'm a little worried that land development will remove most of the ""engineering"" aspects of my current job, however, a 15% raise would be really nice.

Any insight from engineers with sewer utilities or land development experience (from the public side) would be greatly appreciated.

65,Specific Calculus Question? Didn't cover this one in academia,1524113817,"This problem concerns a research project I'm working on.

I'm creating a product at a certain rate, and various parameters determine how fast I can create the product, but also can increase the production costs. Let's assume I'm immediately selling every product produced, so gross profit is directly proportional to production.

If we just consider a single production parameter and keep the rest constant, the net profit (or NPV) always increases as the production parameter increases, however, it's basically an S-shaped curve. The rate of change of net profit increases up to a certain point, at which point the production costs of the parameter overtakes the increase in profits and the rate of change of the net profit begins to decrease (the net profit value never begins to decrease, however). All other parameters kept equal, the most cost-efficient scenario would clearly be at the inflection point of the S-curve, where the rate of increase of the net profit is the highest.

Ok, now what if this is true for each individual production parameter? That is, let's say for each production parameter, if all other parameters are held constant, the most cost-efficient point is the inflection point of the S curve.

My main question is, if all of the parameters are do NOT interact with each other (if they are independent), is the optimal production process that which has all the production parameters at the value of their respective inflection points on their respective S-curve which holds all other parameters constant?

In the real world, these parameters probably interact with each other to an extent, but I am hoping it is to a negligible extent. Also, when considering this system, it is more accurate to think of it as a multi-dimensional problem, with each parameter having its own axis, and net profit being the result of the function: Proft(para1, para2, para3, para4, ...). Talking about things in terms of inflection points makes sense when you're only looking at one parameter (planes don't have inflection points right?). I have no background in multi-dimensional problem solving, but I am pretty sure that multi-dimensional functions will have a point where, for a given direction, there will be a maximum ""slope.""

My hypothesis is that, if the parameters are INDEPENDENT, there will be a specific point on the function at which there is a maximum ""slope"" in EVERY relevant direction (since each parameter always increases net profit I'm only concerned with positive directions.) And that that point can be found by locating the value for the inflection point for each parameter, all other values held constant.

After messing around on Excel, I'm pretty sure I've all but confirmed that this is true if the S-curve relationship is modeled using a sigmoid function: 1/(1+e^(-x))

I realize that my academic career in engineering has only taught me a fake, dirty type of math, and there are probably much more elegant, understandable ways to pose this question. Shame.

I was wondering what you think is the single most important lesson/experience I get out of the senior design project if I want to go into the aerospace industry?

Options available to me are the following:

&gt;SAE Formula 1 (combustion or electric)

&gt;SAE Aeronautics

&gt;Human Powered Vehicle - basically a high speed bike

I am most interested in the Aeronautics project as I have a huge interest in thermo fluids systems and I am considering volunteering to be the team lead on the Aerodynamics subteam or the structures subteam. However, I am enticed to join the SAE Formula team or Human Powered Vehicle team for the fact that it seems they get an insane amount of machining experience as part of their senior design project (moreso than Aeronautics).

So based on your experience, what do you think was the most important lesson to take out of the senior design team? What types of things do you wish that you COULD have gotten out of your capstone if you had maybe chosen a different project? I ultimately feel as if the Formula team may be more challenging since it seems that they have a lot more manufacturing to do and their project seems much more intricate (maybe I will learn more), although I am ultimately more interested in the SAE Aeronautics project.

83,How do you deal with an engineering manager that only wants solutions solved his way?,1524070536,"Some background:

I have about 5 years of experience working as a R&amp;D engineer. I've been working at this new company for about 3 years, mostly doing R&amp;D and managing engineering projects. 

I'm pretty good at what I do, I've figured out unique ways to solve engineering problems and hold a few patents on some of my projects.

My boss is  a pretty great guy, except he has this habit of assigning tasks to me and wants them done **his way**. I was pretty okay with it when I was just starting out at the company, but over the years I've grown pretty resentful and feel like I'm just an accessory to my boss, basically doing grunt work that he either doesn't want to do or doesn't have the time to do. He's a good engineer, but I feel like I'm not going to grow very much professionally with his kind of managing style.

I don't want to say that I'm always doing grunt work, the issue is that when I'm actually doing R&amp;D and managing projects, he always finds a way or reason to butt in and make me solve problems **his way**, which is incredibly frustrating. He has a lot more experience than I do, so I undestand that sometimes his solutions might be ""better"", but there are many instances where I took his direction, went along that path, and ended up coming back full circle to my initial direction anyway.

I like working at this company, and I'm constantly learning things, so I don't want to just peace out and try much luck elsewhere just yet. I've talked to him about this before, and he admitted that it's something that he's aware he does and promises were made about how he'd give me deadlines and more ownership over projects instead of just assigning tasks. But he's kind of reneged on that and gone back to his old ways.

I feel suffocated at work, the only real outlet to my creativity is how I choose to solve problems and I feel like that's being denied to me.

What's the best way to handle this situation? I'm assuming many engineers here have dealt with this same situation before. Engineering is a field where there is no ""right way"" to solve a problem, my point of view is that as long as the problem is solved, without making any compromises you wouldn't normally make - it's a solution that works.

98,My boss won’t listen to my advice ideas.,1524025430,"My boss is basically a manager with some traditional old engineering education. My education is more current and I have more practical hands on experience developing products than he does. 

Sometimes he will come up with an idea, and he will want it to be implemented in a certain way which is not always the best way, I try to tell him the easiest way of achieving the task based on my experience but he never listens and forces me to implement the product the exact way he wants it. 

It’s really frustrating because he does not value my ideas just my labour.

99,Easy(ish) method to calculate structural load capacity?,1524025227,"So I work at a distillery as a distiller/mechanic/safety specialist.. it's a small operation and we wear many hats. I'm a self-taught metalworker, fluent in cutting, notching, mig welding, and other basic techniques. My usual type of product is absurdly overbuilt industrial furniture. So: I have designed and am about to begin work on a ground based catwalk platform that will measure 22 feet long 44"" wide and 60"" tall at the walkway with hand rails coming up to 36"" above the platform. I'm using 2x3/16"" angle iron for the walkway frame 1.5""x1/8"" wall square tubing for bracing and 4x4""X1/8 wall square tubing (for the main vertical supports aka ""legs"") there's going to be some other components in there too but that's the basic idea, I showed my design to a structural engineer, he seemed somewhat impressed and said it would work fine, and gave me a few tips on design. However he brought up our friends at OSHA and load cap issues. I asked him how to calculate it and he essentially said there's no way I could do it without going to engineering school. So I'm hoping I can use the internet to prove him wrong, either way I'm sure the platform will be fine in the end because I'll do what I always do and overbuild it to the point of absurdity...but it would be nice to be able to know exactly how much weight it will hold. My higher math is somewhat limited but if someone takes the time to explain things to me I usually pick up quickly. Hope y'all can help. Thanks!!

0,Am I being exploited?,1524023542,"Backstory:

I've been working for a company as an engineering technician. When I first started, I was supporting some of the process engineers in my department on processes and improvement projects. Over time there have been lay offs and some engineers have quit. As a result, within 6 months I've become in charge of 4 processes and am acting as the process engineer of the areas. They've promised promotion to being a process engineer once I have more experience. However currently with the added responsibility and stress, it doesn't seem the hassle for the paygrade I'm currently on. It doesn't look like they're looking to employ more engineers in the department to minimize labor costs. Many of the people in this company look over worked already. 

Should I look for other employment?  Because I'm lacking resources on fully understanding these processes to give much guidance. At the same time, this is my first job out of college (chemical engineering major) and it was difficult getting an engineering posiiton prior to working here.

Should I stick it out getting underpaid for the responsibility, but learn a lot? 
What are your thoughts?

1,Unemployed Recent Graduate Mechanical Engineering Seeking Career Advise,1524023014,"TL;DR - Recent Grad (Dec 2017) with B.S in M.E applied to 100 jobs, gotten 13 interviews consisting: 1 video interview, 6 phone interview and 6 on-site interview, but no job offers. Advise on how to keep my optimism up in job searching? Should I settle for a non-engineering job to fill-in the growing gap between my graduation date? Is the recent oil &amp; gas bust in Houston flooded the engineering market with many experienced engineer, making the job search harder?

**Background about myself:**

Just recently graduate from December 2017 with B.S in Mechanical Engineering along with a mathematics minor. I am also FE Certified which makes me an EIT. I have neither internship nor co-op experience, but I was offered a job out of state (A family friend I knew offered me). Though, I had to reject it last minute due to my father becoming seriously ill. I decided to find a job within the city (Houston), but it seems I haven't got any luck.

**Today**, I listed my 100th job application and did a self-reflection per se. Out of the 100 job I have applied, I got ~13 interviews which consisted 1 video interview, 6 phone interviews, and 6 on-site job interviews which led to no job offers. All of my resumes are catered along with my cover letter so I'm quite sure that is not the problem since I actually got interviews. I also got a good portfolio with projects that I have done as well as things that I am currently working on to improve my drafting skills along with using FEA analysis on certain 3D CAD Softwares. Lastly, I follow the advise in typical job search such as following up after an interview by sending a thank you note, checking for updates in a certain time frame, and other etiquette.

**My Interviews:**
Company 1: 1 phone interview, 1 on-site interview, 1 video interview. I honestly nailed the phone interview along with the first round on-site interview. They then sent me a video interview where I record myself for some odd reason and answer the questions while I was being recorded. Honestly, it was harder than I expected, trying to sell myself in front of a camera without any body language, facial expression, or something to get a feedback from. They sent me a rejection email the next day. I asked for feedback, but they just told me that I did not have the skills for the position which I found odd since I got 2 interviews prior it.

Company 2: 1 phone interview and 1 on-site interview. I honestly was able to answer everything nicely. I struggled on a few questions, but in the end I somehow was able to get through it. They called me back the next day, the recruiter said that they had to close the position due some restructuring they are doing with the company and telling me that I was a perfect candidate which doesn't really encourages me.

Company 3: 1 phone interview and 2 on-site interview. I was used to phone interviews by then and I nailed it easily. As for the 1st on-site interview, my first interviewer haven't even had the chance to read my resume and he just asked me technical questions. After being removed from school for about 3 months (This was in March), I struggled on some questions. He then passed me onto his supervisor for a 2nd round interview on that same day (I actually didn't know I was gonna get interviewed 2 times that same day). The supervisor just asked me the usual questions like tell me about yourself kind of deal and etc. I honestly did pretty good there I think. They gave me a tour on the place afterwards. It's been 2 weeks since I have followed up, and it seems they are not interested since I haven't gotten a reply.

Company 4: I got 1 phone interview and 1 on-site interview. Honestly, when I walked out of the office, I was 100% sure I got the job. I nailed all technical questions, regular interview questions, and they did a mini-CAD test where they gave me something to draw and I had to remake it within a certain amount of time. They were impressed all-around (they told me during the interview) and told me they will get back to me ASAP. I followed up today and the owner of the company decided to close the position and not hire anyone. I was really disappointed since it was a dream job I actually wanted, but I had to move on.

Company 5: 1 phone interview and 1 on-site interview (scheduled). I nailed the phone interview and they scheduled me an on-site interview. Honestly, after the few interviews that led to dead-end, I have pretty much got my answers memorized as well as reviewed my Fundamentals in Engineering.

Company 6: I just recently got a phone interview with the company and they are about to schedule me for an on-site interview sometime next week or the week after.

I noticed that after my interview with Company 4, my depression is getting worse. I was having some troubled thoughts when I was washing my kitchen knife this afternoon. To the experienced engineers on this subreddit: do you guys have any good advise on how to keep my optimism up for job search for my first job? I'm also getting worried that the growing gap between graduation and my first job is lessening my chances to get a job, should I settle for a non-engineering job to fill in the gap? Lastly, I'm getting a feeling that the recent oil &amp; gas bust has flooded the engineering market with lots of experienced engineers making the competition here in Houston a lot harder than it used to be.",AskEngineers,Jaypesee,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8d2ppb/unemployed_recent_graduate_mechanical_engineering/
2,Help With Fitting For Oxygen Cylinder Outlet,1524019650,"First time purchasing an oxygen cylinder and regulator. I have an H cylinder of oxygen with inlet connector CGA-540. I want to have an output pressure of at most 150 psi, but no less than 100 psi.

6,Does engineering bring you *fulfillment*?,1524011122,"I'm a 2nd year Civil Engineering student. I went into the degree because it was the highest academically ranked course I could get into, thought it would make me rich and happy but its appearing to do the opposite.

Most of my classmates tell me they really enjoy engineering. They all talk about how rewarding it is to finally understand a difficult concept. Their leisurely discussions often revolve around engineering concepts and they seem to genuinely enjoy doing physics/maths, some students even watch maths related videos on youtube for fun. 

For me, engineering has never been enjoyable. I've never enjoyed maths or physics, engineering is the last thing I'd ever do in my free time. I'm interested in things such as marketing/psychology/behaviour economics, when I talk to most other engineers about these things their expressions are blank, I get along much better with business/psychology even law students. 

After a long group study session, my friends leave the library with a look of fulfillment whereas I feel tortured by boredom, our contrasting emotions also highlight my dissatisfaction. 

For example, after learning laplace's theorem last week, my friends non-sarcastically exclaim ""wow, that was so dope, it's actually so interesting, I can finally do more problems now"" while they go home excitedly to review the concept again. To fit in, I used to feign enthusiasm and say similar things but I realized I couldn't believe it no matter how much I lied to myself. Now, I just keep quiet and think ""wow, I'm one step closer to never having to do this boring shit ever again in my life, one theorem down, twenty more to go, god help me grind through this boring ass subject so I can get a high paying job to achieve financial independence and retire at 35 to drink champagne with supermodels on my yacht in fiji""

Another incident that left an impression on me was when I found these videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqfSHCxZrLE   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FssJcjOIB7A  and showed them to my engineering classmates. 

I had a mini-breakdown after watching those videos because I realized that I would be a terrible civil engineer, having to look at maps all day and do mathematical formulas, I would be either extremely depressed or get fired for poor concentration and performance. On the other hand, my friends say ""yeah that looks cool"" they're genuinely content with doing mathematical formulas and analyzing maps all day - something which would make me depressed.

The biggest problem for me is that civil engineers don't make a lot of money despite all the time they spend studying and working. Other engineering students don't seem to mind though, perhaps they find fulfillment in engineering alone or their family is already very wealthy (mine isn't).

Civil engineers have a starting salary of around $55,000 with a slow progression to 6 figures. I work part time in a sales job at a tech startup and I could easily make $60,000 in my first year if I work full-time, given my current performance, I have a very good chance of earning 100k within 2 years. Also, I don't need a degree to enter sales and I enjoy it 100x more than civil engineering. 

Right now, dropping out of engineering to study business or going straight into work seems like a no-brainer to me. 

Has anyone themselves been in a similar situation, and/or know someone who has?

I am trying to understand more about FEA and solving problems from a book. I have encountered a simple frame connected to another frame with a damper in between (see attached image). I am trying to get the mode shapes and frequencies etc. My issue is setting up the problem. Most example problems are of a 3D part so I don't have to add or design much. In this case I have been given the dimensions of the frame, the cross sectional area and the damping in Ns/m. I know we can have damping constants alpha and beta, and even use 'DAMPED"" in modal analysis settings in WB but how do I apply this damping? 
I have created the model in Design Moddler, then added the cross sectional area for the line bodies, opened mechanical, added the constraints, and meshing all that jazz. Now how do i add the damping value in the system? Can i add a APDL command that specifies that there is a damper between the nodes (where the damper meets elements 3 and 4) or some other method?

Thanks

Thank you for reading/answering my question.
(Long story short: question about education and stuff)

I want to become a Bionic Engineer. Currently i am a high school student in Russia. 
So, this engineering sphere undoubtedly is (or will soon become) a mixture of many different sciences: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Neuroscience, Computer Science,  traumatology and so on. Here i speak about the nearest future and prostheses that would interact with human brain and neuro system. Considering all of this, as a student i have no idea which education programme to choose. 

As far as you might know Russia in not the leading country in Medicine and High Technology. The situation with our Universities is almost the same. But anyway there are some good places to study, for instance: MSU or Bauman Engineering University. Anyway, i won't be able to move to US or Britain to get my ""first level education"" - it is to complicated for me and my family at this moment. 

So, my questions are: Would it be better to start with some fundamental science or with engineering ? What exact programme would you recommend?

33,"Fear of new company ""harmonizing"" job titles. Am I missing out on a pay raise?",1523944125,"I said ""I"" in the title, but this is actually about a friend. He currently has the job title of Engineer. Our job titles range from: Associate, Engineer, Senior, Principal, Senior-Principal. We have just been bought out by a new company which uses job titles: T1, T2, T3, T4, T5. From what I can tell, it appears that these titles are pretty much equivalent, Associate=T1, Engineer=T2, ..etc. Although, I've read that the new company assigns job titles fairly predictably: 0 years = T1, 1-2 years = T2, 3-6 years = T3 ...

Now, my friend has been working here for three years and has 5 years of experience. He's talked to his boss about being promoted to Senior Engineer and he was told no. I'm not sure if he asked them when they *would* promote him (he didn't say and I didn't ask). However, he just came to the realization that with the merger, it's possible that the new company might see his years of experience and change his title to T3 (i.e. Senior Engineer) but without receiving any type of raise or wage increase. Technically it wouldn't be considered a promotion, they would just be ""harmonizing"" our job titles to fit their standards.

Obviously that seems absurd to me because he would be placed in the same category as others who have a higher salary due to their ""promotion bump"" when they became Senior Engineers. Are his fears rational? Has anything like this happened to anyone else here? Would a new company just move people's titles around based on experience, without regard for their previous title/salary?

I'm not asking of the boom/bust cycles; I have family in the industry and it is not something I'm unfamiliar with nor will be surprised at.

1) But truly, how many more years, decades (maybe centuries?) of viable work is there left? Can anyone really know?

I've attended some Shell executives speeches before and one even mentioned he would encourage his 1 year old son to study petroleum engineering. But then again, it wouldn't really be fitting for a Shell executive to tell us to all run ASAP. At the same time, I've heard others (usually those outside of the industry) say it will all be dead and gone by 2025.

2) And a follow up question: when the industry does start declining, what do you think will happen? Will big majors and companies start to pivot? Are all the clean tech initiatives that they are pursuing on the side just for show, or is it something they actually hope to expand into?

3) Lastly, from an employee perspective, would they just kick me to the curb if I wasn't already working on those projects? is there any hope to switch?

•Is a public non-specialized college acceptable for potential employers? [SEMO/SIUC]

•Is Power or Energy Systems a viable path for making some serious savings and investments while living semi- frugually?

1) I'm just about done with my associates degree and I'm having anxiety about planning for my future. I'm from Southern Illinois [US] and I don't have the ability to uproot for college unless absolutely necessary for future job finding ability. I'm not sure if anyone in this sub is familiar with SIUC and/or SEMO, but they're public colleges that aren't specifically for engineering and the only two options I have. Will it be difficult to find an electrical engineering job (not locally, anywhere really as long as it's after college) if I don't attend a specialized school? I'm receiving an associate's from a community college in a couple semesters. 

2) I'm an engineer at heart, but not a 9-5 worker type. Dream life is to try out projects and find a niche market or two to make money on the long run. My main plan is engineering schooling for the knowledge and a degree and a job to fund future projects until one can take over as my job.

I'm loving PID theory, seems really interesting because I love math and this provides me with a mathematical problems to play around with. Here's my question.

Let's say I just want to focus on a P-Controller. So the PID function K(e)=Kp*e(t). Or K(y)=Kp*(SP-y), where y is the measured pitch angle, and SP is the set point (ill keep the SP constant for simplicity.

In real life, the turret goes up to the SP, then it oscillates for a bit till it settles a tad below its setpoint. How do I find the function that predicts this?

What I got so far is y(t) = G(K(y)), and G(u)=r*y''(t), where r is a constant of proportionality and y'' is the second derivative since I'm assuming that since the output of P equation is a number that goes into the pitch motor, and that number controls the amount of current entering the motor, then the output must be proportional the the torque of the motor. Therefore, G=r*y''(t). Is it possible to figure this out or am I biting more than I can chew?

Thanks for taking the time to read this....

I'm making a swing set for my kids, and I need help sizing a beam to span about 18 feet.

The beam will span between two large oak trees in my backyard that are 18 feet apart.  And from the beam, I will suspend 3 or 4 swings for both kids and adults to use. 

I was planning on using either a pressure treated 6x8 piece of lumber, or a 20 foot length of 4"" schedule 40 galvanized steel pipe as the beam.  

The beam will rest on a ""floating bracket (linked below) to allow the trees for movement i.

Does anyone know how to properly size the 18' beam?

70,Why did power lines arcing cause lights on dimmer switch to turn off?,1523847356,"We're getting hit with a bit of an ice storm and I just observed an interesting power phenomena. The following happened, twice over the course of an hour, so I'm fairly certain of the cause/effect just not why.

1. 3 LED bulbs on a dimmer switch were heavily dimmed. The on/off switch was set to on and the dimmer was at it's lowest.
2. There was a bright arc flash outside. I believe it was from nearby transmission lines. It was very bright blue/white flash that was clearly visible through heavy curtains.
3. The house power flickered, the 3 LEDs bulbs went out and stayed off. The rest of the houses power stayed on.
4. When I raised the brightness on the dimmer portion of the switch all 3 LED bulbs turned back on immediately. I didn't touch the on/off portion of the switch.

What caused the 3 LED bulbs to go out? They weren't permanently damaged since they turned back on when the dimmer was made brighter. A few more potentially relevant details.

1. It's an older dimmer meant for incandescent bulbs that looks like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimmer#/media/File:Electric_residential_lighting_dimmer_switch.JPG). There is a physical on/off switch and separate dimmer control.
2. The nearest point on the transmission lines is approximately 55m away and between 20 and 35m off the ground. I didn't have a clear view of where the arc flash came from.
3. After raising the dimmer and the lights came back on, I was able to lower the dimmer back to the lowest. All 3 LED bulbs stayed on and dimmed as expected.",AskEngineers,SupercollideHer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8ckgqr/why_did_power_lines_arcing_cause_lights_on_dimmer/

82,"Completely punted a final and went way under the expectations I had set out for myself. Feeling depressed, questioning my priorities, and I'm completely lacking motivation to study for my last final. Please comment if you have any wisdom to impart from your own engineering undergraduate experiences.",1523817611,"I'm a 3rd year EE student, but I've been here for 5+ years because of mental health struggles. I've had trouble figuring out a balance between perfectionism _(not wanting to be a 'bad student', not wanting to disappoint professors who care about teaching, and wanting the best for their students, fear of submitting subpar work or slacking off)_ and realism _(""C's get degrees"", personal projects/extracurriculars/co-ops/internships/networking is more valuable than a perfect GPA)_. I don't really have strong opinions for how to tackle a term of classes, and what to prioritize. 

This term (January - April 2018), I approached it with a ""get straight A+'s"" mindset, and tried to work on building my work ethic and not letting anxiety get the best of me. Tweaked my study approach, worked on priming myself to put school first, didn't procrastinate, etc. and it was actually working. I went into finals this term with A+ grades in every course, felt happy and proud, told all my friends and family, and I felt confident in my ability to study and prepare. One midterm I got a 90 when the class average was 68, in a semiconductor materials course that is notoriously difficult. For once, I felt like a model student, and like I was finally doing what was expected of me. I didn't feel like a disappointment anymore.

In hindsight this led me to misjudge how prepared I was for my most recent final. This class has a final that's worth 60% of the grade, and I felt good about how I was going to do, only to walk in and have no idea how to solve anything. I had a panic attack in exam because it caught me completely off guard. My A+ is going to tank to a C final grade, and I felt so ashamed of myself. It was a fair final, though, and all I can do is take responsibility and learn from my mistakes in how I prepared for the exam. My pre-final grades weren't indicative of how I'd do on the final, and I fooled myself into thinking I was alright. 
 
I have to get back on the horse and keep studying, but I just feel so defeated. Why should I care? Like, all I need on this upcoming final is 15% to pass the course... if C's really do get degrees and A+'s don't matter, then what's the point? I feel lost and hopeless... I thought I had finally figured out how to get through my degree without feeling anxious and overwhelmed... I thought I had figured out an approach that worked for me, but it feels like months of hard work was for nothing... if all that's going to happen is a shitty letter on a transcript, then what's the point?

92,"Is it possible to create a completely transparent ""crystal ball"" with a holographic projection inside it? And if so...how would you go about it?",1523772235,"The physical reference is the clearest way of communicating something. Instead of saying ""Knife"" if I show you the knife I'm talking about it would be a much more accurate and faster way of communicating all the intricacies of the knife as opposed to using language which is subject to interpretation based on each persons experience / links and references with that word.

This is why I want to create a ""crystal ball"" 

**Why I am doing this project**
  
Because I'm trying to build a course series (as part of an education company to change the way education works by fixing it - make it fun, engaging, and memorable)

I had an idea of maybe having this crystal ball show you physical references of what I'm talking about in the courses. If for example we're talking about french pronunciation, it would show you a 3D holographic projection of a scanned French mouth in this ball and you can turn it around to see what the mouth looks like on the inside when a french person is saying the ""eu"" sound or whatever it is. 

So from an engineering standpoint...I assume:

1. This ball would fit in your hand comfortably. (so it's not that large)
2. It would be many different points of light / projection (maybe 100-200) enveloping all around the ball - but they're very small, and they all come together to make this image. I'd rather this be RGB showing an accurate color recreation as opposed to just blue (I don't know if this is possible) with as much detail as possible (like a 3D image you'd see in a blockbuster film) (I don't think the idea of one light source is possible if you want to make a near realistic holographic image but please correct me if I'm wrong. I still prefer the many small transparent projection points around the ball but I don't know if that's possible or feasible either)
3. The ball would have a **memory chip, CPU chip, battery and receiver / bluetooth chip** that are all transparent (and the visuals displayed in it sync with the course you're listening to)
4. The ball might potentially have a ""touchable"" layer on the outside so you can control how big the holograph is, or turn it around, and so on. But this is optional. 

**Operating environments**

As a non-engineer, don't know if I'm interpreting this the right way...but this would be for students in a [physical package / product like this.](https://imgur.com/a/IWrhj)

So I suppose my questions stated more accurately would be: 

1. Do transparent RGB tiny (the size of a pin point lets say) projectors exist? Would them coming together in the hundreds produce the ability to create an accurate 3D holographic image? 
2. Do transparent memory chips, CPU chips, batteries, and bluetooth chips exist?",AskEngineers,massimosclaw,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8cdee4/is_it_possible_to_create_a_completely_transparent/

I feel like I will have a better opportunity for a job and choice of industry if I stay in grad school and get internships during the process. 

I do currently have an interview opportunity with a company and am about to go forward with it but I am not interested in their industry and the job I will be interviewing for (its the 3rd round of interview) is not chemical engineering related (Systems Engineering). Is it worth it to take this opportunity with this company or should I go to grad school instead (I will be taking loans out for sure) and will have a better choice later in life.

CS is not really harder than any other field of engineering, and it has a lower barrier to entry, since data structures/algorithms knowledge is all that's needed to be productive in contrast with the amount of knowledge you need to know to do something in analog IC design (EE) or control systems design (ME).

But **even after normalizing by dividing CS salaries by 1.3 to account for the saturation of CS jobs in SF bay** ($21 is SF bay living wage compared to $16 national average per http://livingwage.mit.edu; which is a liberal estimate since not every CS grad lives in the Bay Area), **CS salaries are consistently much higher**.

13,Secondary Retaining Wall/Footing Proximity,1523689040,"Moved into our new house and have been working on a master plan with a landscape architect. She's not structural/geo (said as much), and the retaining wall element of the design has been a catch point for me.

Basically the property to the east is 4 newer homes with a 4' retaining wall (pre-fab blocks) built by the developer. It's about 4"" off the property line, but the soil appears to have been sloped up from the grade of my property to the base of the wall, which makes my side yard/alley (about 7' wide) unusable as a walkway with wet winters making it a mud slip-and-slide.

The plan was to build a small retaining wall on the property line below the larger retaining wall so we could level the walkway and the corresponding section of back yard (can't level it by filling since it's already too close to the house siding).

Shocker alert: No engineering training here. I've cleared it with the city, and since my wall would be under 4', it doesn't require a permit.  But I've done some internet pokage and have a few questions:

1) Is it completely insane to disrupt soil that close to the footing of the larger wall? I'd heard not to touch anything the same distance out from the wall as it is tall (4' in this case).

2) Should I plan on installing a drainage pipe in any backfilled gravel? Wondering the cost/benefit breakdown of loosening more soil vs. improving drainage.

3)If at all feasible, what material is best? Timbers are obviously out because I can't deadman--so pre-poured stackable blocks? Pour a solid concrete wall? Pour a configuration footing/wall?

4) Is this even worth bringing an engineer in for, or does it break any engineering rules so badly that it's not even worth exploring?

I'm a happy DIYer, and if it came down to having to pour some kind of reinforced anchor points every 4 feet I'm fine doing that--but I have an idea how powerful some of these forces are and recognize a little hydrostatic pressure would gleefully blow out a poorly executed plan.

Wondering if I could get some assistance with a little project I am working on.

I have a 1996 Harley Sportster, which has no fuel gauge.

I've already upgraded a lot of the electrical (lights, ignition system etc) and am wanting to put a fuel gauge on it.

My biggest concern is if the paramaters for the fob are different than the steering wheel button, not tinnitus.

That said I could just fix the stock fob but the beep would in turn make the horn honk for both lock and unlock if I tap into the white wire in the drivers kick panel.

I'm trying to blend together pristine PLA pellets with graphene nanoplatelets using magnetic stirring with chloroform as a solvent. From what I understand, it takes about 1 and 1/2 to two hours for the PLA to dissolve in chloroform.

Then, I add the GNP with a little more chloroform and let the whole mixture stir for another few hours. Then, I sonicate the solution for 25 minutes (pulse: 20 on, 30 off; temp: 45) to 'complete' dispersion.

What happens next is that I use a force-spinner to try and spin the fibers. 4000-5000 RPM depending on fiber quality for 2 minutes. The results so far has been that it just spits back out the liquid polymer or just a wet, rubbery solution that is definitely not fibers. Tried to speed up, nada. Slowed it down, waste of time.

I did trials with neat PLA, and these parameters work. Successful fibers. Obviously, the nanoparticles skewer things.

According to rheological data, my solution isn't viscous enough. I've magnetically stirred it longer as well as added heat to evaporate more of the solution during stirring (and subsequently cooled). No dice.

PLA-to-chloroform ratio: 1/9 (ex. 15 g of PLA / 135 g of chloroform)

GNP-to-chloroform ratio: 1/4 (ex. 0.8 g of GNP / 3.2 g of chloroform)

People out there, any clue what I'm doing wrong? Any bit of help is greatly appreciated. All the papers I've read skip on these deceptively important little things (or use equipment my lab doesn't have), and my advisor is one of those ""find out yourself"" kind of people, so he's barely any help. Not to mention, he's been breathing down my neck about it and getting on my nerves.

Worse yet, I still have to make fibers with HBN and MMT next, but if I can't get GNP nanoparticles right, then what's the point in moving on?

The local big state school offers both a non-thesis master of engineering degree and an MS in engineering management, and I applied and got into both. Now I am having trouble deciding where to go.

I'm torn on which one to select because I think both can be helpful to me, but I need some more input. I like being an engineer and I like the technical/analytical/theory side a lot. However, where I work it seems like the ""technical track"" guys plateau and never really get to have a say in the direction that the product development should go. To quote my boss, ""they can give you a number, but if you ask them to make a decision they'll freeze up.""

Instead, most of the decisions about adding/changing features, new products, etc. come from management, who all either have MBAs or BS degrees and decades of experience (I think there's only one who has a technical masters). I applied to the engineering management degree because I thought maybe it would be a good blend of technical and business. However, I am a bit worried that it's a bit of ""two halves don't add up to a whole."" Googling hasn't been terribly helpful, either, as 99% of the results are from schools selling the program or undergrads asking about it right after college, rather than professionals who have one and can talk about how it helped (or didn't help) them.

Ultimately, I do want to end up on the management side, but not any time soon. I know that even by the time I would finish either program I still wouldn't have enough technical experience to manage engineers well. It is crystal clear which managers jumped out of the technical side too soon and which ones have real technical chops from working for 10-15 years as engineers first. I think the M.Eng, along with a PE (which I will be eligible for when I finish) would give me additional technical credibility, as well as letting me do more interesting engineering work. However, I am worried that I won't have *any* training in the other things that managers need to know, like accounting, finance, etc.

I have thought about doing the M.Eng now and maybe an MBA later. However, I have a wife at home and we want to have kids in the next few years, and my current company has decent tuition reimbursement, so I don't know if I'll want/be able to go back in several years, and don't want to bank on that.

The datasheet I'm looking at can be found here http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tpl5110.pdf

Okay, so I don't want to kill you guys with details. But basically I'm looking at this nanotimer in order to time the 'on' time of my product. For simplicity think of a light bulb. I'm trying to utilize this timer so that when I press a button, the light bulb goes on for one hour and then turns itself off. 

This nanotimer says it has two states 'one-shot' and 'timer' mode. From my understanding, timer mode is more so designed for the light to automatically turn itself on as well (which I don't care to do). So, the mode I believe I want is 'one-shot'. Eg I need to press the button every time I want the light to turn on, then the timer turns it off after an hour. 

On page 3, it says that pin 6 is used to control the mode of timer vs one shot by setting the value of it to HIGH or LOW. My question is how do I actually select high or low?? Like it's just a pin, and nowhere else throughout the document (that I see at least) does it tell you what to do to get it to the value 'LOW'.

35,How did you get into Quality Engineering?,1523638080,"This is a question I like to ask every Quality professional and you always get different and interesting responses. I will start by describing how I got into Quality:

I am an Industrial Engineering major. In 2015, took a QA course at Iowa State that required a Junior Design project- I was able to work with a Fortune 500 company and also shadowed a QE- Now when I look back, the project was so basic and stupid but even one year of experience in Quality will teach you a lot of valuable skills.

After that, I did an internship in Plant Engineering over the summer, and accepted a Quality Engineering Co-Op with a large Fortune 100 company for Fall, so I was gone from school between May-December. These 4 months being a QE Co-op taught me pretty much all the basics and fundamentals I needed to be ready for a entry level QE position

I am graduating in 2 weeks and I started looking for a QE job last December and I was surprised by the rate of responses my resume was getting. 

Anyways, the job offer I accepted pays at least 15K more than if I had just looked for typical entry level IE positions or Manufacturing Engineer positions.

I feel that Quality is definitely not for everybody but it is a great field. Obviously, it is not all roses and there will be stressful and chaotic days but I feel that overall, it is a great career path if you want more of a niche, a more specialized career path within Engineering.",AskEngineers,IowaStateEngineer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8c0nb9/how_did_you_get_into_quality_engineering/

This leads me to get a minimum bore size of 0.25"" using the mass*1.25 (for a 25% cushion).  Did I do this correctly, or should I be using the 250lbf to calculate my bore size?

51,Finishing first year MechEng. Not sure where I'm going with the degree.,1523594363,"Sorry if this is a frequent post or more suited to one of the engineering student sub, but I thought it would be better to ask the guys and girls that have already made it in to a role in engineering.


So, I'm a first year MechEng student in the UK. I've had some ups and downs personally this year, but overall I've got through the course without any issues. My final exams are coming up and I'm pretty confident that I'll do well. The issue is, I'm still not quite sure where this course is taking me. 


When I chose MechEng, it was because I liked Maths, Physics and Chemistry. All fairly problem solving orientated subjects which MechEng is as well. The other reasons is, from the outside looking in it seemed to be the broadest of the courses  available, giving me a good basis to change direction (my uni allows me to switch between several disciplines after first year, also seemed that it was the most broad in terms of job prospects after uni). I thought that over the course of the year I would have a clearer idea of what I wanted to use the course for, but with about 6 weeks left before I'm finished I'm unsure. 

Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed the course. I've found it engaging and challenging in the right kind of ways, but it hasn't really funnelled me towards any area in particular. A big part of my course is doing a placement year between 2nd and 3rd year and I'd like it to be something relevant, but as you can probably tell I can't find something relevant if I don't know what I'm aiming for. I'm just kind of worried that I've got in to the course for the wrong reasons and if I'm going to jump ship it needs to be now, as I can't afford to finish a degree that in the long run won't help me. 

So my questions to you would be:

1. Did you go in to engineering with a solid idea of where you wanted to go? Regardless of your answer, how has this helped or hindered you?
2. Am I just not looking in the right places for inspiration?

-Nuclear and luminescent spectroscopy: Intelligent materials, nanoparticles, therapies against cancer (hyperthermia).

experimental automation: control of advanced mechatronic systems. These are systems that due to their nature (non-linear behavior, open-loop instability, high degree of coupling, small size and high performance, singular applications, etc.) represent a challenge from the point of view of control. Among others we can highlight: magnetic levitation systems, actuators based on intelligent materials.

-Electronic and optical excitations in nanostructures: study from the theoretical point of view phenomena related to the interaction of electrons and light with nanostructures (nanoparticles, nanowires, thin atomic layers and surfaces), such as quantum effects and excitation of plasmons, excitons, etc ... In particular we are interested in areas of plasmonics, nanophotonics and techniques such as electron microscopy and spectroscopy (EELS), tunneling microscopy (STS), photoemission, near-field microscopy or optical detection.

-Other groups: circuits and electronic systems in high freq.; inteligent interfaces, speech and language tech. ,automatic translation ...

66,I need help in understanding exactly how reaction wheels work.,1523551560,"I’m in a pre-engineering college course, and we’re at a point in the program where we need to create a personal project that demonstrates what we’ve learned.  I chose to replicate the system of reaction wheels that are used in a satellite to maintain its orientation in space.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_wheel

I was planning to use an Arduino and a 3x motor control transistor to control 12v motors spinning weighted wheels in all three axes to do this.  The system would then be mounted on a globe mount with concentric rings to allow it full three degrees of freedom.
I got a basic demo built, that you can see in the following picture.  When it’s done I would like to have a the thing mounted in a small package (with batteries instead of external power supplies), but at the moment it’s all spilled across the table.

https://i.imgur.com/C9BcZvE.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/k5eDMGe.jpg

My problem is that the frame isn’t spinning.  The wheel is spinning at over 1000 RPM.  It weighs about 300 grams.  The frame is about 1.95 kilos.  I assumed that I would be able to control the frame’s rotation pretty much directly in relation to the wheel’s spin.  I know that there’s a related effect used on the space station with Control Moment Gyroscopes.  But those are more complicated.  I wanted to just have each wheel’s axe run coaxial to the degree of rotation I wanted to spin on the frame.

I was inspired by this toy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y
It doesn't appear to use the CMG principle (where each reaction wheel is twisted to provide the torque, like when you're holding a spinning fidget spinner and you try and rotate it against it's axis of rotation, it resists providing torque).  It looks like the frame is responding directly to the inertia of each wheel directly.

This model https://i.imgur.com/Zz5umi4.png shows approximately what I was planning (with one wheel on it for the moment controlling the movement coaxial to the support beam running through the box).   I would later add the other 2 motors for controlling the remaining degree of rotation, trying to place them around the box’s center of mass.  Though, even with three motors, it would only be able to spin in two degrees of rotation (which is fine for now, I want to keep this simple and realizable).

My big worry is that the reaction wheel effect (based on conservation of angular momentum) only comes into play during acceleration.  Is that correct?  Would the frame only feel torque when the motor starts to spin up?  Or could the frame’s inability to spin be caused by something else.  If it's the former, then the test shows that initial acceleration phase isn't enough to move the frame.  Thanks to anyone who can help with this.  I would really appreciate it.

I got a call from one of the top companies I interviewed today and they made an offer for an Engineering position, the salary is about 10K higher than some of the previous offers I received plus they are willing to pay for my relocation(job is in another state, 6 hours away).

I don't know what to do at this point. If I accept their offer than fail the class and don't graduate, I will feel pretty guilty and it will be a very uncomfortable situation. On the other hand, part of me does not want to pass this opportunity but I am trying to find the best way to handle this. 

This is a great company, excellent benefits, pay at least 10K higher than the competition, perfect place to start my career as an Engineer, however, not sure what to do at this point. I will have to make a decision in the next 2 days, so any help is appreciated!

70,"Given a noisy data set, should a trend line be fitted to raw data or to the rolling average of the data set?",1523543592,"My problem is when using ball tracking software, the velocity data is noisy (due to pixelation, there is no build up of error going on just small error in the tracking of the ball in each individual frame) so I use a rolling average to better present a plot of velocity vs time. I also want to fit a linear trend line to the data with Matlab so the gradient can be used as an estimation of the acceleration. I had expected the gradient to be unchanged by the rolling average compared to the raw data but its significantly different.

Which trend line should I use to produce the best estimate of the acceleration of the ball? (This is high speed footage so the acceleration can be assumed to be roughly constant over the very small time segment which the ~80 frames cover)

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm strongly considering moving to Zurich (from Germany) in the near future. I have a M.Sc. from a German university and couple of years of work experience in academia.

88,Is Power Engineering a Dead-end for Innovation?,1523495862,"I'm a junior electrical engineering students, during my last year I have to make a decision whether to specialize in power engineering or communication &amp; electronics engineering, specialization will be in the form of taking 5 courses in the chosen field. Most students choose to follow the power engineering path, mostly for the reason it is less math-extensive and it slightly tackles renewable energy topics. I did very poorly in every power course I took before this point (e.g. circuits II, electrical machines), mainly because it was just too abstract and boring, like literally, it's the same circuit but in different configurations. Not to mention there was zero motivation to investigate problems such as power factor correction. And worst of all, instructors at my school are not qualified properly to teach such courses at this level; for instance, I never learned what is the real meaning of reactive power, until I had to google that, and before that I used do abstract calculations. When I realized that I know nothing about power engineering, I decided to read on my own, and that's when I came to the conclusion that power engineering isn't interesting at all. 

The generators, motors, transformers and transmission lines used these days are the same used 50 years ago, what happened over the course of 50 years are little optimizations, and they are largely driven by the material and computer revolutions, not something original nor classic in power engineering. Perhaps that's how it will stay for a while. Don't get me wrong, these machines get the job done, they solve the problem they originally were designed to solve, but that's just about it. I think any new power engineers are actually ""maintenance"" engineers, they don't add any new value to the field. Any problem to arise in this field, probably its solution has already been found in the past. 


On the other hand, in communication &amp; electronics engineering, your imagination is the only limit. Basically it is the contrary to power engineering.

90,Vibration Damping for Indoor Cycling,1523494681,"I live in an apartment building and occasionally use a [fluid trainer](https://www.cycleops.com/product/fluid2) or [rollers](https://www.cycleops.com/product/rollers) to train for bike racing.

Recently my downstairs neighbor made some comments about the noise, which I believe is more a result of vibrations sent through the trainer into the building than the actual noise that I am able to hear in my apartment (which, according to advertising materials/product reviews is probably a little over 60 decibels).

The first thing I have done is purchase [these](https://www.amazon.com/Diversitech-MP4-V-Anti-Vibration-Pack/dp/B00BVEMLR4/ref=pd_bxgy_328_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B00BVEMLR4&amp;pd_rd_r=E86020JY0NDBY642WTB9&amp;pd_rd_w=LxqfN&amp;pd_rd_wg=AmWab&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=E86020JY0NDBY642WTB9).

I downloaded a Vibrometer app onto my phone and measured the floor vibration near the rollers earlier tonight. Without those pads I was getting vibrations of about 3 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (I know nothing about this, its just what the app uses), with the pads it was measuring between 1 and 2.

This seems to be pretty low intensity vibrations, but I think the machines are resonating (again not sure this is accurate) and causing a low rumbling I can hear in my apartment and may be much louder in my neighbors.

What can I do to further isolate these vibrations? My thought is to make some kind of ""sandwich"" of vibration isolation materials, but I am having a very difficult time understanding the specifics of how this should work.

For example some materials are rated for a certain weight, usually in pounds per square inch. I assume me (165), plus the bike(15), plus the trainer (15?) weighs  about 200 lbs. 

Is a material going to behave differently if I place in directly under the 8 feet (about 1.25"" diameter each, so I figure about 25 lbs/inch) than if I put it between two 2'x2' sheets of MDF and set the trainer on that (so I would have 200 lbs distrusted over 4 4""x4"" pads putting me at closer the 3 lbs per square inch).

1) Do you think I have correctly identified the source of the noise?
2) Do you think my ""sandwich"" idea will work? 
        If not what would be better/easier?
        If so, could you offer me some information (I am happy to do some reading if you can guide me to it) on what materials I would want to use and some specifics of how it would be constructed?

I work in a woodworking shop to I have access to good variety of saws and presses (if I want to do any gluing) as well as some metal working equipment (MIG Welder, small mill) to actually put this together.

And a solution that took 4 hours to build (or 3 clicks on Amazon) would be much preferable to something that took 40.
