4,How can I optimize a small pull solenoid given the following constraints?,1514867078,"I am in need of a small pull type solenoid.  I've done my own research and experiments, but I'm having a hard time understanding what is feasible and optimal given my constraints.  I'd appreciate any suggestions or insights.  Thanks!

- Pull type.  I already have a returning spring force through the use of a small rubber band pulling in the opposite direction.
- Max dimensions: Length about 15 mm by 6 mm diameter for the cross section.  My understanding is that a bigger apparatus will have stronger pull force, so I expect the full space to be used, but smaller is ok if not.
- Stroke is about 2 mm in addition to the 15 mm length, so the unenergized total length is around 17 mm.  It's ok if the plunger comes out the ""back"" end of the solenoid because there is more than 2 mm available space on the back end.
- The solenoid's duty cycle is tiny.  Even 5% is probably way too high.  Each pull event only last as long as it takes the stroke to move 2 mm and happens every few seconds at the very most, so there's not any ""holding"" action required.  Pull events are not at a steady frequency.
- The coil needs to be unenclosed, so totally open frame.  The reason for this is that I want to use the coil as an inductive sensor transmitter during some small amount of the off periods of the duty cycle, [similar in concept but not exactly the same as these folks at NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3244006/).  If I enclose the whole coil in iron, then the magnetic field can't escape and it wouldn't be a very good transmitter.  I know that foregoing an iron enclosure will probably sacrifice pull strength.
- I've done experiments using a plastic, hollow coffee stirrer and 32 awg magnet wire.  I've also tried removing the plunger [from these tiny solenoids](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0105UOS4S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and using the coil itself.  I've tried sucking in nails.  I've also tried sucking in a stack of 2mm diameter neodymium magnets with a 4mm magnet ""cap"" at the end like [the team in this PDF paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0bf9/4d2ecfff433ea5097aca4a3e9c9f593b8368.pdf).  One thing I haven't yet tried is putting two magnet caps on opposite ends of an iron core that extends all the way through the coil and 2 mm out the other end to get simultaneous push and pull action.  In all cases, the plunger is sucked in quickly, but the force is pathetically weak.  Even the tiniest friction from my fingers keeps it from moving (no rubber band at all).  I'm using a 9 VDC, 650mA wall wart with a 10 Ohm resistor and my coil resistance is around 4 Ohms.  Also using flyback diode.

Some questions:

1.  My biggest question is what do you all recommend?  Is there any obvious best path to follow, or worst path to ignore?  All my other questions are just variations on this theme.
2.  Should I use an iron plunger or a permanent magnet neodymium plunger?  Or a combination of both?  I don't expect differences in cost to be consequential.
3.  Given the selection in 2), what geometry should I use?  Should an iron plunger be approximately the same length as the coil?  What about a neodymium plunger?
4.  How do I decide how much of the cross sectional should be plunger and how much should be coil?  Is there a standard ""best"" ratio to optimize the pull force?
5.  If iron plunger is the best, at what point do I have to worry about eddy current losses when using the coil as an inductive sensor transmitter?  If instead I use a plunger made entirely of neodymium (with [""permeability comparable to air""](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/235959/magnets-in-transformers-design)), are eddy currents no longer a concern?

27,Recently graduated and feeling stuck in an industry I have no interest in,1514756247,"I graduated with my degree in April 2017 with the hopes of getting my involved doing any type of work within the industrial or energy sector. So far, this has proved to be a much larger challenge then I imagined. I am starting to think that this ""dream job"" may actually just be a dream. I'm just looking for any success stories or advice that can keep me motivated.

Before completing my degree at University I went to college and got a diploma in mechanical engineering (Canada). I have never been the person who knew they 100% wanted to design cars, aircraft, etc. so I figured this would give me a better understanding of what I wanted to do without committing to a 4 year program. Since I really enjoyed any class related to energy, thermodynamics and fluid dynamics, I decided to take a job working as a technologist designing HVAC systems at a consulting firm. The work was interesting, however industrial and energy systems had started to become my primary interest and I knew HVAC was not the (ideal) career for me.

This is where I decided to go back to school with the intent of getting my foot in the door with a company in either of these industries. After finishing my degree, I decided to travel for a few months and take advantage of the freedom which would be coming to an end very shortly. I was torn about this decision as I knew that waiting to find a job would make things more difficult, however I also knew that this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.

This is where I have started to regret my decision to work in HVAC and to travel. Over the past 6 or 7 months I have only been able to get interviews and job offers with companies focused on MEP design. I have been reluctant to accept these offers as I feel this will pigeonhole me into a career which does not excite me. I am open to any industry that will diversify my experience, however I already am already beginning to feel stuck.

I have no family members or family friends in engineering. I am trying to network however there has only been a few social events put on by the provincial professional association in the last few months. Sometimes there is a stretch of days where I can't even find a relevant positions to apply for (I've been applying to ones with the required experience ranging from 1 - 7 years). My cover letters are customized to each position I'm applying for and I change my resume to include relevant skills and/or keywords to each job posting. At this point I would even love to get a position as a technologist or draftsperson just to get my foot in the door and meet people. However I have not had any luck with this either, and my time being unemployed is only growing. I'm assuming this is only hurting my odds at finding an EIT position in the future.

I don't have anyone to get career advice from and I'm just feeling quite lost on my options. Is going back to MEP deign better than waiting to find something in another industry?",AskEngineers,marard1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7nb6h9/recently_graduated_and_feeling_stuck_in_an/

30,Disengageable *and* Anti-Backlash Lead Screw Nut?,1514749490,"Hi all,

I have a situation where I need to use a fine-pitch leadscrew to very precisely push and pull on a hydraulic plunger (for a micropositioner-style device). This is essentially a microhydraulic actuator that is controlled by fluid in a syringe-style chamber; I'm pushing and pulling on the ""syringe plunger.""

I need to be able to disengage the nut from the screw to allow for coarse manual motion of the syringe plunger, so this implies a mechanism likely along the lines of a lever-actuated split nut with a detent spring---pull and hold the lever to open the nut, move nut+block along screw to desired position, then let go of the lever to re-engage the nut to the screw (with perhaps a small wiggle to let the nut fall fully into the threads).

However, with this design I do not see a way of incorporating the typical anti-backlash mechanism of two nuts with preload between them. That is, the moment I'd disengage the nuts, the spring would push the pair all the way apart, removing all anti-backlash preload from the nut pairs while also misaligning them to the screw threads.

While it's indeed possible to remove any leftover backlash in software, these micropositioners are near-constantly performing back-and-forth motions, and taking up the basklash slack so frequently by quickly spinning the motor to the ""other end"" of the backlash results in nonzero amounts of visible jitter whenever their motion is reversed.

***TLDR:*** **Do any of you happen to know a nut mechanism that allows for both nut disengagement from a fine-pitch leadscrew and re-engagement anywhere along the screw length, while also mechanically reducing backlash as much as possible?**

40,Building a coilgun for a Science Fair project,1514678942,"I have an upcoming G9 Science Fair Project, and I've decided to build a Gauss rifle for it.

I've read some guides such as [this advanced one](https://diyhacking.com/make-coil-gun-without-camera/) and [this very basic guide](http://www.miniscience.com/projects/Gauss_Rifle/index.html), and figured out that I need the following:

* A PVC Pipe or piece of wood to use as a frame
* High gauge copper wire and insulation tape for safety
* Capacitors to store power
* 9V batteries
* A SCR transistor to act as a switch
* Bolts or magnetic ball bearings to use as projectiles

I need to do an experiment with the project, such as experimenting with different voltages and seeing how much the projectile punctures materials such as foam or cardboard of different thicknesses. I have the following questions:

**1. What capacity of capacitor bank do I need? The guide I was reading suggested a 400V 3300uF capacitor, though those are very expensive, and I think 50V would be enough.

41,Anyone familiar with Energy Manager Roles in industrial settings?,1514677962,"I am interviewing for a role called ""energy manager"" in a large industrial facility, &gt;500,000 sq.ft.  This position will likely ask me to get a Certified Energy Manager designation at some point, and that is described as :

&gt;The Certified Energy Manager is an individual who optimizes the energy performance of a facility, building or industrial plant.  The CEM® is a systems integrator for electrical, mechanical, process and building infrastructure, analyzing the optimum solutions to reduce energy consumption in a cost effective approach.  CEM’s are often team leaders and help to develop and implement their organizations’ energy management strategies.  CEM’s have gained increased recognition within the energy industry and by companies looking to strengthen their competitive position by having a CEM on staff.

They are looking for someone to work closely with the utility to reduce their energy usage.  The early focus would be on the industrial equipment - mostly plastics processing and printing, but could go as far as solar power generation research and evaluation or similar.  The company hasn't had anyone in this role, ever, or even something like this in their strategy, so it could be daunting, but i can also see it being something that the board/executive love the idea of but the reality is it is quite difficult to implement for the savings they want.

63,Air pressure before a fan with restricted input,1514527080,"I have an air intake with a filter on it. This is roughly a 1m^3, with one side leading to a fan. Assuming equal pressures on the downstream side of the fan (away from the filter), will the pressure inside the cavity increase or decrease as the filter gets dirtier? Or will it follow some complex curve which I need to supply more information? 

I don't know what to think. In the extreme case where the filter blocks all airflow, it seems like the fan would keep pulling air out until the airflow bleeding back around the fan would equal the airflow going through the fan. To me this seems like a vacuum. However I know that moving air has lower pressure from Bernoulli's Principle, so a clogged filter will had less moving air, so lower pressure.

I alo found [this](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/264213/a-fan-is-connected-to-a-pipe-what-happens-to-the-airflow-after-the-pressure-dro) which lends me to believe its a complex answer.

65,Should I quit my internship?,1514519146,"Hi r/askengineers, I am wondering - Should quit my internship?

Without giving away too much detail about where I am working, I will explain my situation and try to be as unbiased as possible.

I'm in my junior year of a Mech Eng. degree and I got my *first* internship sometime in the summer of 2017. I have been working there ever since and the internship offer is to last until graduation (approximately May 2019). I do decently in school (3.5 GPA) and actually received word of this internship from a professor who recommended me to the company. I live in a competitive area and now that it is winter session, my chances of applying for different internship positions elsewhere may be limited. The company itself is relatively small, with only 5 engineers and myself as the only intern. Since my employment, I have had the chance to learn a lot from the engineers at work. Typically, 2/4 of them can be very helpful, while the supervising engineer and engineering manager can be pretty damn hard on me.

As the only engineering intern, I am given an incredible amount of work. Mostly, I am happy to be given the responsibility and opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects for the company but on the other hand I feel as though my responsibilities go beyond the scope of a typical engineering student or intern. Still, I am glad to put my best foot forward, but it is typically at the expense of being consistently yelled at or berated for ""fundamental"" mistakes I make. I have thick skin (worked in construction for a few years before returning to school) and I know what it means to work hard, show up on time, be professional and learn from mistakes and move on, but I am tired of being yelled at for my mistakes as an intern.

90% of the things I am doing are things that are completely unfamiliar to me. Generally, using the tools and knowledge I have learned from school (theoretical classes, Solidworks design, lab test reports, etc.), I typically have an idea of where to begin and will do my best to work in the necessary direction, but often am only able to ask 2 of the 4 engineers questions due to my fear of being yelled at for asking. I always look for a solution before asking questions and make sure that if I do ask a question then I have a few different ways I tried to approach the problem first. I feel as though I am often given a real engineering task with no direction, no experience and a minor ability to ask questions depending on whom it is that I ask.

I never lied about GPA, work experience, or project experience on my resume when applying to the position and now I am being given tasks and expected to deliver without error, otherwise I am berated for it. What gives?

My weakest area is Solidworks Drawings. We didn't get to go over these much outside of the basics in the first (and only) design class I have taken. I typically don't have an issue making parts or even drawings for the parts (I am not an expert by any means, but I can manage), but knowing what SHOULD and SHOULDN'T be detailed/highlighted in professional drawings is my biggest weakness along with being somewhat slow at design. I learn A TON everyday I feel, but I feel as though I am not in an environment that is learning friendly. I have yet to take the GD&amp;T course at my college but I plan on taking it over the summer once I complete the required prerequisites this spring semester. I am hoping this will help significantly improve my GD&amp;T skills, but until then I am left to doing my best to complete drawings based on my judgement and learn from my errors.

This internship is seriously putting a dent in my self confidence and making me feel like I don't belong in engineering. Can anyone lend some advice to me? I am considering quitting and telling my engineering manager that I think they need someone with more experience.

Thank you in advance for your time!

I am working on a project. I saw the [claw pickup mechanism](https://goo.gl/images/35RSx2) and thought it might be a nifty contraption to have the claws at two ends and a mechanism with a single latch that would close it and lock it at the same time.

So, I went ahead with a simple clamp design. Now the issue is that I am blanking out when it comes to the mechanism to open/close it and lock it. Any help would be great.

What I need is a mechanism, preferably spring loaded, that would open/close the claws. I need it to be low profile. I thought about going with a wheel/disc and rotating it a quarter turn to move the shafts connecting the claws. Rotary motion to linear motion. But I feel that there is a better way of doing it.

84,"[Structural] I need to repair and replace a section of framing from a second story, exterior load bearing wall. Are my plans for this project acceptable, and do you see anything I could improve? (Drawings included)",1514472140,"Tried posting in /r/structuralengineering, but haven't had much of a response. Hopefully you guys can help me out.

[Here is a link to some screenshots of the Sketchup drawing I created.](https://imgur.com/a/VHRBZ)

[Here is a link to the actual Sketchup file if you have access to the software.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bh75iVzvfcxzG7w5HCGtXNI8zIaOeuoI)

If anyone would like to view the Sketchup drawing, but doesn't have access to the software and don't feel like creating an account, I can send you the login information and you view it from the free webapp they make available.

 Here are the basics of the repair. A roof cricket located at a chimney chase deteriorated and leaked water for a long time. It went undetected for too long due to the sneaky path of the water. The framing was damaged in this section and is about to be replaced. 

To remove the damaged framing, I'll have to support the load the wall was carrying. The parts that will be replaced in this section are the subfloor, bottom plate, studs, and the double top plate. The rim joist managed to survive with zero damage, thankfully. Exterior wall and roof sheathing will be replaced after the framing section has been repaired.

I have added a total 6 jack posts to carry the load of the roof. The first 3 jack posts are located in the bedroom with the damaged framing. On top of these three jack posts is a 10' 4x4 piece of lumber that is running underneath the bottom chords of the truss roof. The bottoms of the jack posts are directly on top of a floor joist. On the first floor, directly underneath these jack posts, are another 3 jack posts. These jack posts have the same 4x4 lumber on top of them, but it is running the length of the floor joist above. They are adding support to the floor joist that the jack posts of the second floor are sitting on top of. The first floor of the house is concrete slab. The jack posts of the first floor are sitting on top of a 10' long 2x6 piece of lumber (laying on it's side), that is directly on top of the concrete slab.

The jack posts are located 4' in from the outer edge of the bottom plate and rim joist. That location was chosen for subfloor replacement. I'd like to be able to get the biggest possible piece of subfloor installed while removing this wall, and of course the jack posts would be in the way, so my current compromise is that 4' mark. It does leave a significant portion of the roof trusses cantilevered from the support of the jack posts. This is my primary concern, and biggest question. Do the jack posts need to be moved one or two joists closer?

I will be adding a new vertical piece of webbing to each of these Fink Trusses for reinforcement. It will fall at about the point where the jack posts are supporting the trusses. 

The floor joist that is sandwiched between jack posts has been reinforced to withstand the new strain from these jack posts and to give it a wider surface area to support.

A few other notes and details... The floor joists are 16"" on center, and so are the wall studs. The roof trusses are 24"" on center. The strange looking, incomplete, floating framing in the drawing is the chimney chase. Any of the oddly spaced wall studs all have to do with chimney chase framing. The jack posts are rated at about 9000lbs each in compression at their current extension. The house was built in 1979. The rafters are 12' long 2x4s. All framing is of 2x4 stock with the exception of the floor joists. There are metal mending plates connecting all truss parts , but are not pictured. The three cylindrical columns on each floor of the drawing are the jack posts and their proposed locations.

The Sketchup drawing detail is extremely accurate, down the inch.

The studs, truss bottom chords, and chimney chase framing parts are all labeled in the drawing. I will be replacing the stud section of framing (including equivalent plates) running from S2 thru S10. The bottom chords supported by the jack posts are R2 thru R6.

So, any thoughts on this plan? I think I covered everything. Any additional bracing or reinforcement needed that you can see?

93,The first siren was made in roughly 1819. Why weren't they invented hundreds of years before that?,1514422006,"What am I missing?

Isn't a siren just three basic things(?):

- moving parts
- energy source (a hand crank, etc)
- a stream of air

I'll leave this here: [How Does A Siren Work? (Mr. Wizard)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsfczwy3KOE)

The sites I looked at credit the invention to Charles Cagniard de la Tour in 1819. Wikipedia is a bit of an outlier it also mentions John Robison in 1799. But the text hints that a working example of Robison's device probably doesn't exist.

&gt; [Siren (alarm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(alarm\)#History)
&gt; 
&gt; **History**
&gt; 
&gt; Some time before 1799 the siren was invented by the Scottish natural philosopher John Robison. Robison's sirens were used as musical instruments; specifically, they powered some of the pipes in an organ. Robison's siren consisted of a stopcock that opened and closed a pneumatic tube. The stopcock was apparently driven by the rotation of a wheel.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1819 an improved siren was developed and named by Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour. De la Tour's siren consisted of two perforated disks that were mounted coaxially at the outlet of a pneumatic tube. One disk was stationary, while the other disk rotated. The rotating disk periodically interrupted the flow of air through the fixed disk, producing a tone. De la Tour's siren could produce sound under water, suggesting a link with the sirens of Greek mythology; hence the name of the instrument.

I think [this](https://i.imgur.com/9fZvL7l.jpg) is De la Tour's siren. But Wikipedia calls it a ""1860s-era siren"".

About the etymology...

&gt; siren [premium.oxforddictionaries.com - paywall]
&gt; 
&gt;**Etymology** 
&gt; 
&gt; Middle English (denoting an imaginary type of snake): from Old French sirene, from late Latin Sirena, feminine of Latin Siren, from Greek Seirēn. 
&gt; 
&gt; In classical mythology the Sirens were bird-women whose beautiful singing lured sailors to their doom on submerged rocks. People hear a siren song or siren call when they are attracted to something that is both alluring and potentially harmful or dangerous. In 1819 the French engineer and physicist Charles Cagniard de la Tour used siren as the name for his invention of an acoustic instrument for producing musical tones. 
&gt; 
&gt; Later in the century steamships began to use a much larger instrument on the same lines as a foghorn or warning device, and in the Second World War sirens sent people scurrying to bomb-shelters for protection from air raids.",AskEngineers,MWM2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7mj5an/the_first_siren_was_made_in_roughly_1819_why/

I haven't studied ventilation, so I don't know if I'm interpreting these numbers correctly. Since the air compressor will draw in up to 5200 m^3 /hr, will I be able to maintain 100 Pa internal air pressure with my fan that operates at 5500 m^3 /hr?

I'm not so much concerned about the air pressure as I am the heat rejection. Will the fan actually move 300 m^3 /hr of air in excess of the compressor demand out of the exhaust vent? Or am I misunderstanding how ventilation works?

So I feel like now that there are a lot more postings in my area, that I should start applying for some of these positions I feel is more in line with actual engineering experience. But I do feel an obligation to stay with my current employer. How often does this happen, and how soon is too soon to switch positions? Has anyone else been in a situation similar to this? What are my career options outside of this company if I stick in this manufacturing/machining role? If I apply to jobs, is it better to include or exclude my current job I've only been with for so little time?

Ultimately, I see myself as a project engineer or if I had to be more technical it would be in piping, pumps, water systems or utilities systems I'd like to get into.

I want to stress a few things:

1) I am incredibly grateful to have my current job

2) I'll still work very hard in my current job, look for opportunities to learn/apply myself and know how to make the best of my current position.

3) I do believe the reason it took so long for me to find a position after graduation was moreso due to external factors. I work very hard and am confident in my abilities as an engineer and resume.

I'm working in manufacturing. I don't really have a job description, so it's hard to say what I should be doing. I was given one big project when I started, and finished it a month ago.

I was given a few other projects, but I don't have the tools to complete them. I've asked my boss almost daily for said tools, and his response is always ""I'm busy."" I offered to set up said tools and he told me to worry about my own job while he did his. So these days I have nothing to do at work, and fill my time putsing around on the completed project.

My boss always says he's busy, so I've tried to come up with other projects to work on. When presented with the last one, he openly mocked me to a colleague: ""look at this guy, coming up with his own projects! I'd say focus on what I've given you and don't worry about that area of the plant.""

I don't see this getting better anytime soon, because even in the height of the busy season the other engineers seemed to spend most of their days on Facebook and YouTube while our boss is too busy to sit down and give us more projects.

I want so bad to do more at work. I work best under pressure and right now I'm under none. If I have to be there anyways I'd rather spend my time on more important things than Reddit.

I did a phone interview and when I hung up the phone I had the impression that the only reason they called me was to yell at me and tell me the things on my resume were wrong.

I applied to work for Company A, who had recently acquired Company B. Company B built small batches of bespoke hardware for research customers. I mentioned on my resume that I had spent several years working with Company B's hardware and had implemented major upgrades and additions to it. The interviewer asked me one or two technical softballs, then asked me what I had improved and why. I gave a few details to show I wasn't making it up, and explained that we were a research organization and our needs were continually evolving. They were clearly offended that I believed any of their work could be improved upon. They spent a few minutes telling me that Company B's hardware was very, very well designed and essentially flawless. Then they ended the call and I got a rejection email a few days later.

I fully understand ""don't badmouth people in an interview"", especially not the people you're interviewing with, but this was a technical question, and the bulk of my recent work, and I went out of my way to explain that we were modifying the hardware to meet changing needs, which was more or less the job I was interviewing for. I genuinely felt like the only reason they called me was to yell at me for messing with their designs. I don't feel the least bit bad about it. Actually, their entire department imploded a few months later and business news still uses it as an example of Company A's hubris. What I'm wondering is how common this is.

21,I really need help deciding between Electrical Engineering and Software Engineering,1514308514,"I started College going for Software Engineering. After a while I started losing focus/interest in some pf the topics presented and procrastinated so I withdrew and decided to take some time off to think about what i'm going to do. If I go back I may finish the Software degree and at least get my associates but the thing is I don't know whether I want to go for a bachelors in Software or Electrical Engineering.

I don't have a problem with software, I mostly just got a little lazy or disinterested in my lab work which is why I stepped back for now. Websites and Programs have always been something that I have wanted to learn how to make. Even stuff like video games or operating systems, i'm interested in learning the process of how it's made and what is involved in the process. However, I too have been very fascinated recently with how electronics work on a physical level. I've been reading alot about electricity and circuits and have a desire to built my own PCBs and gadgets, learning how all power systems, circuit boards and ICs work.

So, there are a lot of questions I've developed about both careers that I was really hoping some of you could shed some light on. I don't mean to take up a ton of anyone's time reading/answering all of these but I wanted some clearance on the following:

1- What does each of these engineers actually do on a daily basis? It seems pretty simple but I still don't have a clear understanding on what they are ACTUALLY doing most of the time. Are EEs involved in the idea/features of the project? Are they just doing a lot of math or are they actually designing the scematics/PCB? And for SEs, is it just putting code together, testing and flow charts or is much more involved?

2- Time away from the computer. I don't have a problem sitting at a computer for a long period of time but i'm curious as to how much each engineer actually does on the computer vs away from it. Do EEs do a lot of hands on work? Are SEs mostly on the computer? Do you get to stand/move around often?

3- How much of an opportunity does each career allow you to work from home or abroad? I'd imagine SE jobs can allow you to work from home occasionally? Do EE get any opportunities like this or do you always have to be present?

4- How much communication is involved with each? Are you constantly talking and working with each other or do you often get opportunities to work alone and focus by yourself?

5- Lastly, if I did get my associates in SE and got a bachelors in EE, do you think there would be a decent amount of opportunities in getting a SE (or at least programming) job if I wanted?

26,Help Designing Centrifugal Extractor Fan For Workshop,1514285249,"So I got this 5sq/m room in the basement where I will be setting up a general purpose workshop for welding, woodworking etc. Space is limited which is why I have decided to build my own compact extractor fan that can be used for both dust collection and fume extraction from spray painting and welding. I know very little about fan engineering and my math skills are elementary school-level, so it would be very helpful of someone could walk me trough it or share some good resources for newbies.

The plan so far is to mount the fan in the ceiling with the exhaust duct going into the wall and blowing the air outside and a connection hose for the inlet that can be plugged into either a dust collector or a fume extractor arm for welding.

I'm thinking about making the impeller out of laser cut 3mm steel sheet. Starting out as a disc with a hole in the middle where the motor will be mounted, and with precut slots that fit the blades so they can be welded in place. The motor is an external rotor three phase 890-1260rpm 0.38kW Ziehl-Abegg that will fit inside the impeller, making it nice and compact. Will likely also make the fan housing out of 3mm steel to reduce noise.

31,Best option to get into consulting,1514260144,"Hi All. My question today is fairly subjective (or at least it is in my opinion :D). I have two options - to either stay with my company, or take a new job in the defense industry. My goal is to get into consulting in the future, whether it be a Deloitte or EY, or a smaller firm.  

I currently work in distribution - as an analyst. I pushed my way into working more as a systems roll out analyst for my company, am fairly underpaid for the area I reside in (we'll say ~15% below average) and have been there for almost a year. The company I work for is fairly large internationally, and is interested in sending me abroad for 2 years to help out with software roll outs across different subsidiaries in Europe. This opportunity would allow me to go through roughly 2-5 project life cycles and gain international experience. Overall I've learned a lot so far and made some good friends, but at the same time am unhappy with certain aspects of my job. 

The other option would be to take the job in defense contracting. I would be a mid level systems guy, in a more technical roll than I was before, for one of the largest contractors in the US. This company also supports furthering education, i.e. an MBA. Taking this position would require a move to a new city, and would pay roughly ~30% more (with no negotiations - I would 100% push for more seeing as how I would have to relocate). It would also be my second move in as many years...I worked for another company as part of a leadership development program for roughly 2 years before transitioning to my current job.

Now if I go abroad a lot of things would be covered (i.e. housing, car, etc) - giving me the opportunity to pay off a considerable amount of student debt, as well as explore new places, and learn new languages. The second option has it's perks too - I'd be able to move back home, take advantage of rent free living with my parents for a bit, pursue an MBA and make some dents into my loans as well. It also gets me in the door at a very reputable firm, a household name here in the US.

What are your thoughts? What things should I consider? Any advice is appreciated. I haven't been able to make up my mind.

Edit: It looks like I should have been a bit more clear.

Now that I have that done, I want to build a simple frame for it for fun. But I started thinking: *I wonder if there is a way to harness the intense heat generated from this and create a solar powered foundry?* So I started thinking a bit and I figured that I need some way to disperse the heat over the walls of the foundry.

So now I'm thinking about using some highly thermally conductive solid material for the walls, but making them hollow to have space for a fluid of the same nature that can withstand temperatures in excess of 1,650°C (3,000°F) without boiling.

The problem is I don't know what materials to look for, and I need something affordable as I am just a 16 year old boy, pretty much relying on my parents for any money.

58,Looking for some input on DC circuit project,1514133010,"Hey guys, I'm trying to design a custom circuit board to function as a tail/brake light and turn signals for my motorcycle. Basically I'm going to cut and solder a printed board to look exactly like [this one](https://imgur.com/H4rMcNX).

This is the [logic diagram](https://imgur.com/gIqMpdf) I have come up with. The tail light signal is always on, and I plan on bumping down its voltage so that the LEDs are dimly lit when only tail light signal is energized, then LEDs will grow much brighter when brake light signal is turned on. The LEDs will be split into a left and right leg so they can be used for left and right turn signals, respectively. I have the NAND gates there so when the flasher signals are energized the LEDs will switch off, per their respective sides (flasher signals will be repeatedly turning off and on when activated, just to clarify).

Ok so just some background real quick, I'm a ME student so circuits are not my specialty, I just taught myself some transistor basics yesterday in order to form the NAND gates. Therefore I apologize in advance if my circuit makes no sense. That being said, [here's the circuit](https://imgur.com/4FeXN65) that I constructed based off of the logic diagram. I built a prototype of this circuit [here](https://imgur.com/CcXn4n6) but my transistors started smoking.

The part that I'm mostly stuck on is the resistors, mainly where they should go and how much resistance I need. I think that's why my prototype circuit is failing.

I did take some voltage readings as follows:

Vtl = 8.0V

Vbl = 10.5V switch ON; 8.0V switch OFF

Vl = Vr = ~5V

LED operating specs = 2.0V, 20mA

It was hard to get an accurate voltage for the flashers because they are flashing on and off and I'm using a shitty meter. I did also notice that I'm getting ~20mV on left flasher when right flasher is switched on and vice versa.

So basically I'm just looking for feedback on my circuit design and perhaps some guidance on my resistor values and placement.

59,How would you design a craft to break the absolute maritime circumnavigation record (driven by any mechanical or natural means)?,1514132022,"So it’s about 23,000 miles of  open ocean, around some great capes and high seas, varying and unpredictable conditions. Let’s say we’re going for the unclassified absolute speed record, which currently sits at 40 days, set within the last year by an exotic multi-hulled sailing trimaran, IDEC Sport, crewed by 6, averaging 30 mph. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEC_SPORT

The best attempt by a motorized vessel is a tie between a submerged US Navy nuclear sub in 1960, USS Triton, Operation Sandblast, and a custom exotic trimaran (wave cutting design and fully submersible) driven by two apparently commercial off-the-shelf 500 hp diesel marine motors. Both vessels did in about 60 days.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MY_Ady_Gil 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Triton_(SSRN-586)

So how would you beat the record? Any first world country with enough motivation could probably do it without difficulty by throwing enough money at a purpose built nuclear ship, so I’m not interested in that. How might a team of amateurs do it with a limited budget? 

Minimum payload is one sailor, essential navigation and communication equipment, and food and water provisions for as long as he or she will be at sea. Supply/refueling stops are allowed as often as necessary but need to be done at a port.

I think small and efficient hull shape is critical but what about propulsion? Solar + battery bank? Sail? An efficient gas/diesel motor? Combination of any of those? If you’re going motorized, is a screw the best way? Or would some kind of bio mimicking design best, with a tail fin or something?  Hydrofoil? Hovercraft? Ground effect?

Or you could go full sci fi and design a practical supercavitating submersible that would blow the record out of the water. How close are we to that? I know it’s already been implemented in torpedoes. 
 
EDIT; Holy shit, apparently someone has already made a working experimental supercaviting boat, Juliet Marine Ghost:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjh2vxwYLeM

I wonder how he’s propelling it, if it’s just straight hot gas from the turbines out the back or what.  Same for the supercavitating gas in the front? And I wonder if you could make it work with an old turbocharged flat four out of a Subaru Forester XT.

60,What may be the easiest jobs in software or hardware engineering?,1514110610,"i am electrical engineer with two years of internships and I have found out that this career, or at least the jobs that I was performing, are very hard and boring, and that there may be no point in continuing. This doesn't necessarily mean that I would like to quit engineering and toss my degree away, but rather that I would like to try something easier and possibly more interesting before finally giving up.

With all of my jobs the main problem was low productivity. It especially went low after few weeks of  employment when the interest factor faded away. I have found out that the hardest jobs were research and development tasks, especially if they demanded pro-active approach of work with high responsibility and if I was required to drive the whole development. What a nightmare. Drive the development and be responsible for something that is hard and not even remotely interesting. I think that I should stay away from true development activities with long development cycles, as it gets boring pretty fast and at the end I do nothing. The most horrible tasks were developments of new concepts for unique products, where you are the only one knowing your stuff and where you have to juggle forward and backwards with mountains of scientific papers, which you don't understand. Horrendous. Too much thinking. In such cases, usually I just switched to youtube/ reddit :).


I have also found out, that I very likely suck at problem solving, logic and analytics, which are engineer's core skills. I had bad grades during my studies, but I thought that it was only because I've found my studies being boring and rarely interesting. In fact, I hated my studies. I dodged most of lectures, which weren't obligatory for a student to be present at. Few times it happened that assistant kicked me out of the lab during practical work, because I was mentally absent. I was just sitting there like a duck,  daydreaming and waiting for other students to do the work for me (practical work was always team work). When there was an examination period, I started to learn 1 week before exams and hoped for that 50% minimum in order to pass it. Luck and gambling was how I passed all the stuff. 

If I had to name subjects which I found the hardest, they would be: Math, digital logic, low level programming, signal processing, electronics and anything that includes word ""systems"". FPGAs and the low level embedded systems stuff is a nightmare for me, probably one of the hardest topic I've came across. As the complexity of a matter increases, I get stuck or completely lost. When I look at schematics with more than 20 elements on it, I see stars. When I look into more than 1000 lines of low level algorithm code, I see hieroglyphs. Horrible. The only subjects that were remotely interesting and not that hard was were the ones dealing with alternative energy sources and energy markets. Basically no math and details, but more like a broad topics consisting of politics, ecology and economics where some technical knowledge was required so one would be able to differentiate between active and reactive power. Listening to these lectures was like watching a documentary on discovery channel. 

At the end of the day, if you would ask me, why I've chosen EE path, I would probably say because status and money. Being (electrical) engineer sounds bad ass and pays good. It's the real profession. Otherwise, I don't really know what I'd like to be nor what I'd like to do in life professionally, as the only thing that interests me for a longer time and gets me hooked in, is playing PC games and composing music.

69,Could my ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) be shorting out capacitive touch screens?,1514030028,"Due to a genetic cardiac condition, I've had an ICD (internal defibrillator) since age 17. My current ICD was implanted in 2010, so it's a bit elderly as far as medical device technology goes. After a spate of capacitive touch screen issues (definite hardware failures -- seeing no recovery after entirely reseting the devices) I've started to suspect my ICD might play a role. 

I'm no electronics engineer, but this is supported by a few anecdotal observations -- I have a weak ability to sense electronic fields and detect abnormalities/fluctuations in current, especially in the side of my body where the ICD is installed. For example, I was able to correctly identify a malfunctioning electric shower, even when the electrician was finding normal voltmeter readings -- but only with my left arm. Turns out some idiot had drilled part of the shower hardware into a mains line, but the electrician wasn't able to detect any issues until I was able to pinpoint the area. So, there's some likely precedence that my internal electronics can interact with external ones, to some degree.

Further to that, my sister who has the same condition and thus an ICD has reported the same thing. Both of us have a tendency to find our mobile phone screens suddenly develop unresponsive areas, with no other obvious damage. And again, it's definitely a hardware issue -- no amount of rebooting, reseting or reinstalling corrects it. They just die, far far quicker than they should. So. Could our ICDs possibly be to blame?

Say tou do have the control systems, actuators, material and all that to create such a epitome of mechanical magnificence; what energy source would be required to not only lift--but manevour and ""fly"" such a heavy mechanical machine? 

I know there's a pretty basic equation that derives from physics that would give us the answer of this given the weight. According to [this](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Property:Weight) they can weight anything usually over 20 tons. Let's say 30 tons for a normal one. We'd need something with some serious propulsion to lift and maneuver 30 tons in the air. It's ridiculous, I know. 

But I came here to ask you guys just for the hell of it. What type of energy source would it have to be and how much of it would we need? Is there anyway we could utilize maybe a hybrid power source? Solar + mechanical or something?

The mat material is prone to wear and sandwiching it would give me a solid surface I wouldn't have to worry about tearing up so much for use as a table top.

Will an M.S. in Civil/Environmental do much to increase my job/earning potential to make it worth the time?  Does anyone have an idea what the job market would be like for an engineer with a PE and MS but only a few years of work experience?  

I have a pretty good job now that I enjoy so that makes it hard to leave.  However, I also fear waiting too long and it being more difficult to do this later in life (I'm currently single/no kids).

If anyone has a similar experience or an opinion I would appreciate hearing it.  Thanks!",AskEngineers,2997925,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7linj6/experience_vs_ms/
78,Classes to take for Robotics Fundementals,1513960236,"Hello All,

I am a Computer and Systems Engineer and am going into my senior year. I specifically want to concentrate in Robotics and my school luckily has a concentration for this. I took Robotics I this semester and it was rough. The class went in depth into classic Robotic Arm concepts, such as forward/inverse kinematics, Jacobians of articulated arms, planar kinematics,  pin-hole camera model for vision etc. I got through the class alright, but felt the whole time that I had a pretty weak grasp of many fundamentals. I feel as though I need a stronger fundamental knowledge of control systems and linear algebra. I took a basic multi-variable calculus class before Robotics I, but that class did not prepare much for Robotics I.

My dilemma is that as computer systems engineer, many seemingly relevant control classes are part of the mechanical department, which I do not have access without special request and would not fulfill my graduation requirements. In my department I have access to classes such as Digital Control Systems and Real-Time Applications in Controls and Communications. Although these concepts apply control to to electrical systems I can't imagine the root concepts are too different from Robotics.

What other classes can I do to better prepare me for the Robotics? It seems many Robotics classes are very much applied and if you don't understand the fundamentals you have to treat a lot of math as a black box. This very much makes me feel like I am missing out.

82,Need help with troubleshooting elevator access control system,1513934189,"The elevator where I work has a card-based access control system.
You tap the card, then you wait and press the floor you want to go.

The problem here is that the wait time is something like 3-5 seconds every time.
If you press the floor button too early, there is a good chance that that entire attempt will be invalidated. This means that you'll need to tap your card again and repeat the process.
One observation here is that the wait time seems to be longer the higher the floor you want to go.

The company that installed this system for the building seems to be into making the most $$ out of this. The building manager said they have asked them to come look/fix this issue many times but nothing improved (and they charged a high fee every time). To really upgrade the entire system would cost very high fee. 

I simply do not understand why the system (which only controls 4 elevators and a few gates) would exhibit such high delay. I could provide some more info about the specific equipment/software used by the system, but initially I just want to know whether anyone in this sub could help me with this.

However, I had so much fun building it that I became somewhat obsessive about the next version which I believe I can get lighter/warmer.

[Here are my current options](https://imgur.com/a/xbR0k) that I'm deciding between (blue is cold, orange is hot, black is shell material). It seems intuitive that option 1 is correct as the point is to trap a heat bubble around you, but I don't know how reflective material works with extreme cold right on the other side.

Also, if you know of any possible way you can estimate how cold the outside has to be to drop the interior below 98.6 degrees (given, x"" of loft, y% of heat reflection, etc), that would be awesome. Obviously real world would not be the same, but an estimate would be really nice.

12,Question about actual mechanical advantage relating to a DIY project for the disabled- most practical way for someone to get their own dead weight off the ground,1513827117,"A friend in her 20's was diagnosed with ALS last year and I've been following her video updates. In a lot of them she cries when mentioning falling down before reaching the toilet, bed, or dinner table. Sometimes this results in accidents, sleeping on hardwood, or laying on a linoleum floor for hours until someone comes home to help her up. It sounds like the problem is solved once she's back upright, but if her upper half reaches the ground she doesn't have the strength in her arms or legs to get the weight of her torso up (and she isn't overweight by any means). I desperately want to help find a way for her to at very least get herself to a rolling chair so she can get from room to room. 

Unfortunately my degrees are in the soft sciences- I only remember that pulleys, gears, levers, etc will reduce how much effort it takes to move something. As a kid I was so lightweight that pressing on the height lever of an office chair would actually raise me instead of lowering the seat, so that came to mind. I remember as a kid lifting my friends on a hydraulic jack inch by inch with ease, but I don't know what I can use to get the 4 feet of lift needed for her to straighten her legs underneath her.

This scholarship is not prestigious in an academic sense as it involves volunteer work, but it gives me around $3000 for the year.

The real dilemma is that I feel like my grades/research will suffer as a result of this added volunteer work.

Since the scholarship itself does not help my engineering skills, I am questioning my involvement in the program as I ultimately want to head to graduate school. The time spent in the scholarship could be better spent studying or joining an engineering group that would help in scholarships or side projects that I am interested in.

The only problem is the monetary benefit of this scholarship is going to be gone. Ultimately, I will be forced to either take on some more loans to balance going to school or keep going with the scholarship and perhaps let my grades/research experience suffer. While grades for the first semester are most likely going to be good (hopefully all As), it has been a pretty rough road balancing extracurriculars out.

So my question is, what do you guys think? If I were to keep the scholarship, of course there would be less of a financial burden for my self and my parents, but I feel like keeping the scholarship would inhibit my ability to succeed with my grades and research. If I were to leave the scholarship, the likeliness of me to maintain my grades and my research will increase, but I would not have the financial support that I would now.

While I know student loans are a big problem, I am sure that I will be able to pay them off. Especially since there opportunities in graduate school were funding can be established, I do not think money will be a long term problem as long as I can handle them in the future (which is hard I am sure). 

It is just that I have four or five years to learn what I am interested in and get involved in research/internships/clubs that may help me get a job in the future, but this volunteering for a scholarship is a time drain and may not be worth the decrease in GPA or time involved in clubs and research. Especially since GPA and research/projects may help in getting me into a good graduate school with research I am interested in.

I have been thinking about this decision for a long time, but I simply want someone else’s opinion on this matter. And of course there are my parents who may not be happy with my decisions.",AskEngineers,dadadadathrowaway,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7l4r62/money_problems_scholarship_vs_gpa_and_research/

20,Long term career prospects in the engineering field into corporate strategy/finance,1513796270,"Hi all, I've been graduated for about 1.5 years out of school. I've worked for a failed multi-million dollar startup and 2 F100 manufacturers on contract. All in middle management roles.

In short, I went into engineering because I have see it as a discipline where (arguably) most of the intrinsic value of a corporation is made. I've always had a keen interest in business, but I felt that understanding the core fundamentals would be essential to turn concepts/prototypes/research into something of financial value would be good to have. I'm starting to doubt that people in the upper ranks value that experience when compared to stellar financial performers.

Long term, I've always wanted to move into finance, particularly focusing on industrial companies like the ones I am in now. Corporate finance, equity research, PE and VC come to mind. 

Designing machine components and sizing supplier parts does not excite me one bit. Carefully researching and implementing a long term plan to outsource expensive components from the financial perspective is something that does. I prefer the ""macroscopic"" POV.

However, it seems to me that little engineers make this transition. Most that take the ""management"" route fail to pass the level of plant manager (stuck in middle management), while the corporate/executive level roles are held primarily by ex consultants or investment bankers. 

Now I'm starting to find myself at a crossroads in my career path. I'm really dissatisfied with my current jobs. I don't care about the day to day operations, design or middle management as much as I do the higher-level strategy and it's implementation. Plus, the proverbial ""glass ceiling"" most talk about here turns me off too. I'm considering joining one the big 4 auditing firms, boutique investment banks or other financial based roles even before I get my P.eng

Does anyone have any experience transitioning from engineering middle management roles into corporate  finance/consulting/private finance here? I'd love to hear about your experiences and advice.

When it has more load exerted on the gearbox output shaft, what impact does this have on the load on the motor when comparing a high reduction and low reduction gearboxs? 

I've discovered that the low reduction (high speed) gear box causes the motor to get hotter when the load on the gearbox output shaft increases. Compared to a high reduction gearbox (slower speed) with the same output shaft speed (it is sped up with a smaller pulley on the input shaft). I don't know how to explain this though bc it doesn't make sense to me.

Is this something I should be proficient at or does it depend on the job and how large the company is? I'm a third year mechanical engineering student at university and I've been interning at an aerospace company local to me for about 6 months now. I had a small amount of prior experience using SolidWorks in school where we took a class and learned how to model and create some drawings, but the class I took was a few years ago and I don't have as good a grasp on solidworks as I did a few years go.

At my work, I typically assist in writing different types of documents for our parts (test procedures, CMMs, PMAs, SSAs, PSCPs) and I have to reverse engineer some parts. Although I typically don't have trouble creating a model, I find that depending on the part I can be a bit slow. Also, I find that when making drawings I often make mistakes or don't know exactly which dimensions to put on which drawings. (We have top level drawings and so on...) So sometimes I find myself getting yelled at for missing things I wouldn't have known to look for in a drawing. I am learning, but I am also tired of getting yelled at for making mistakes.

So my question first is, how can I learn exactly what dimensions I need to put in a drawing? How can I get better (other than the obvious practice) at learning exactly what needs to be put into a drawing and what doesn't need to be there? I understand the overdimensioning/underdimensioning idea but I am talking about specific things like overtravel on a switch... etc...

And... is my lack of skill in Solidworks Drawings something that I should be worried about for the future? Will this hinder my career and growth as an engineer?

Can anybody help me negotiate this offer? I don't know if it's unheard of to ask for 87K and then they come back at 1/2 or 3/5 the difference.

49,Why do we use statically indeterminate structures?,1513706981,"When you add a 3rd support somewhere in the middle of a simply supported beam it  increases the  reactions of all 3 supports (sort of). Do we add additional supports for stability? Would it make more sense to just remove the redundant support and get a smaller reaction on the 2 end supports?


Edit: here is an example I posted in a comment

If I had a simply supported beam (pinned on both ends) at 1.25 ft long and place a 5kip load at .5 ft my reactions at the 2 ends are 3kips and 2 kips. If I place a 3rd support at 1 ft such that the beam has a support at 0 ft, 1ft and 1.25ft the reactions become: 1.75 kips, 6.25 kips and -3 kips. This is solved using standard statically indeterminate beam analysis. Why would I want to add that 3rd support to the system?

Edit part 2: From what I've gathered here, it is definitely safer for the object being supported because it reduces the internal stresses of the object. This happens because often times, the primary stress governing deformations and failure is bending stress and a support in the middle section reduces bending. 

The load on the support is definitely larger because of the redundant support. If the support cannot handle the load then that is obviously a problem; however, the answer to the original question ""why do we use statically indeterminate structures"" is because it makes the object being supported more stable.

55,How is a modern capacitive touchscreen made?,1513671953,"you know like for our phones. I understand that indium tin oxide(ITO) is sputtered (a type physical vapor deposition process) onto some sort of substrate like glass. But aren't the electrodes supposed to be arranged in a specific pattern. With silicon chips i know about masks and photolithography to get the patterns 'etched' into the material. but i don't understand how sputtering alone can make the [patterns](https://www.dmccoltd.com/english/museum/touchscreens/technologies/images/img9.gif) that allow a projected capacitance touchscreen to work. I understand how sputtering can coat a material in ITO pretty thoroughly, but for some reason i never hear of any process after this for touch screen manufacturing. so what exactly happens after sputtering ITO on glass or plastic. How do they form the electrode grid? Is it just with sputtering alone(if so how) or is there some other process involved that for reason i can't find any information about? every time i search for how a touch screen is made, i get only very shallow explanations. I'm kinda hoping someone here can enlighten me. perhaps an MSE person or a more advanced device EE than me.

59,"Did I make a good decision transferring colleges? And turning down a co-op offer? I fear I've made the wrong decision, transferring for perception vs. reality.",1513658621,"I won't know what was best until I've seen for myself, but I'd like to know what *you* think about my decision to transfer from UW Madison to Georgia Tech. I'll be a student at GT in Spring 2018, and besides leaving my close friends, I'm feeling conflicted about turning down my first co-op offer so I could transfer. The offer was for  a 'Quality and Customer Technical Support Co-Op' position and many people told me to be wary because of the title and how they only gave me a week to decide, leading me to think they were just trying to hire anyone and that the position wouldn't be so great. But I'm an engineering student and I feel like any experience would be useful, I'd be testing SSDs and HDDS for Western Digital, and the interviewer seemed very nice, I'd have paid housing and the whole deal sounded OK besides the 1 week decision. I'm a sophomore and even if this co-op isn't *the best* like at Google or Amazon, I feel like it would give me better chances at those companies in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

When I think about the offer and how I turned it down I can't feel anything but that I made a mistake. In the time I had to decide I was super stressed between going to GT (where I've always wanted to study) or taking this co-op that appeared out of thin air. I'm venting but I really need to, I've been really stressed and everyone is telling me it was the right choice to go to GT if I wanted to, but if I got an offer like I did at UW Madison I feel like I could have paved a great path for myself here. 

&amp;nbsp;

When people ask me why I transferred out of Madison I feel like I don't have enough reasons (it's a great school!), which is weird because before I found out I got in I *really* wanted to go regardless of me really like UW Madison, but now that I'm going I feel like both colleges are fine and that staying at Madison, taking the co-op, and continuing with classes here would have been easier and the better choice. I felt  pressured to go to GT by some of my peers in classes at Madison and family members, but I really don't know if I made the right or at least a smart choice. GT is an amazing college and I hear the offers and opportunities there will be better, but I can't help but feel that since I was given an offer for a pretty good co-op while at UW-Madison that I'd be fine here, though the time to turn back has passed.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for reading :) I've been having a hard time coming to grips that I'm leaving UW Madison and that I turned down a *good* offer to do so.

A few days ago, I just got ""let go"" from my work due to inadequate work performance. I tried to pry for further info, but they batted my questions aside &amp; said that it was a combination of factors (attitude, inadequate work, asking too many questions; etc).

Needless to say, I cried on the bus to home. But in a weird way...I was somewhat happy. I get to meet new people, learn an entirely new industry, and dip my hands in the workforce. What's done is done. I can only grow from this &amp; look forward the future (in hindsight, I knew that this was going to happen).

So here's my question:

- What do I do now? I can try and job hunt like a madman (using recruiters &amp; the internet), but I doubt most companies are hiring over the Christmas. Do I use this time to relax &amp; learn something new?
-  Do I include this job in my resume? I've only been working here for a few months. I left on good terms with them, and they said that I can use them for references. I also made some great coworkers that can vouch for me.

66,What type of compression springs should I use to create a platform that wobbles when gently pushed?,1513632421,"Hello!

I am currently working on a design for a few kinetic platforms that will be used to display my sculptures in an upcoming interactive art exhibit. My inspiration for these platforms are the spring toys found on a playground such as these [here](http://www.hendersonplay.ca/MotionPlay.php).

[Here is a rough side profile drawing my design](https://imgur.com/RBwMHAt). The bases of the platforms will have a width and length of 50"", and will be resting on top of a tube weighted down with concrete. My dream for these platforms is that people will be able to tap them and then cause the platform top to wobble (which ultimately will cause the resting sculpture to move slightly).

The platforms will be holding up different weights; the lightest will be about 50lbs, while the heaviest will be about 130lbs. This is including the weight of the platform. 

I've done some research on the physics behind springs, but it is a little above my head. I've used some rough calculators online to try and get a cost estimate of how much one would cost, but I do not think I know the benefits of each material, how many springs etc. 

I'm wondering what resources would be best to come to these solutions: 
1) Do you think this design will allow the platform to wobble when touched? If not, I am open to alternative design suggestions. 
  
2) If yes, what type of compression springs would I need for that? 

3) In the drawing I included a few blocked in springs between the top of the platform  and the base. In my research, the heavy duty springs cost over $200. I may have been looking at the wrong type of springs. Will having multiple springs on the base allow for the desired wobbling affect?

Now, I won't have to explain this because you guys are engineers. Riddle me this, I have measured my resistance at approximately 75K ohms. this means that to get .0075 A across my heart, the voltage needs to be 562.5 volts, more or less, assuming I grasp both hot and neutral so it goes across my heart. Now, tell me how a 9V dc battery could POSSIBLY stop a person's heart? There are FAR too many 'old wives tales' and urban myths abounding. Furthermore, I have dismantled and repaired countless appliances that could possibly be tossed into a bathtub, and in each and every case the positive and neutral wires are less than 3 inches apart. We know that SOME current flows through the water and down the cast iron drain pipe to ground, however you want me to believe that more than a tiny fraction of the current would eschew the easy path of 3 inches or less accross the water to traveling at least 2 feet, then through the high resistance body, then through the relatively high resistance cast iron drain? We know from our studies that voltage is the same everywhere in our parallel circuit we have created, but resistance dictates the current drop in each leg and I am thinking that one inch of water is MUCH less resistance than probably 3 feet of human and 3 feet of water.

72,Good material for an electrolysis cell membrane?,1513612876,"I have made an electrolysis cell, that I use to generate hydrogen and oxygen. That in turn is used for a torch that I use as a complement to my propane torch, for when I need a little more heat, since I don't want to invest in an acetylene torch at the moment, and this is a pretty fun and interesting project regardless. The cell itself is currently 14 pieces of stainless steel 10x10 cm plates in series, which I power from a rectified arc welder.

I'd like to separate the hydrogen and oxygen though. One reason is safety. Though I do have two flashback arrestors, one bubbler and one brass wool based, it sometimes goes past the first one and it damages the bubbler, not to mention it's a bit scary. The other reason is I'd like to experiment with different ratios of hydrogen and oxygen, and also maybe use it to generate oxygen for the propane torch. 

I've concluded that to separate the gasses, I need a membrane between the electrodes. I've googled it a bit, but I can't find anything that is useful in a DIY setting. Apparently commercially some ceramic or asbestos based material is used, but I can't see myself DIYing that or getting a hold of that material. 

So, I need an alternative material but the thing is I'm not sure what properties of this material are important. Obviously it needs to be able to let the electrolyte through, so I'm thinking something perforated, like a mesh or a cloth. It also needs to *not* let any gas through. My first thoughts were tissue paper, the kind that doesn't disintegrate in water, or maybe just a textile cloth. I quickly realized that wouldn't work though, as the sodium hydroxide used in the electrolyte surely would dissolve them pretty fast. I also thought about using a very fine stainless steel mesh, but I'm a bit concerned because that sounds very much like just another electrode in series with the other stainless steel plates. That would mean the oxygen would be contaminated by some amount of hydrogen, and vice versa. Also, while the thick stainless plates may not dissolve very quickly, they're not 100% immune to the corrosive lye, and that might be a problem when using very fine mesh.

I can't really figure out what the key properties of a good membrane would be. Does it need to be electrically insulating in order to not act as an electrode? What materials should I be looking at?

I can not move for family reasons and there are no other job opportunities in the area for helicopter pilots.  Long story short is I think it is time for a change and from the research I've done this seems like something that would be a good fit for me.

I have a technical mind and I love building things.  I've designed and built wood lockers, hanging light fixtures, floor lamps and wall clocks.  I've remodeled houses including electrical, plumbing, framing and everything in between.  I am currently building my own two seat kit airplane.  I enjoy problem solving technical issues and finding ways to make things work.

I know there are many areas such as civil, electrical and mechanical engineering technicians but I don't understand exactly what they would see every day or which direction would be a better fit for me.

Note: I put what I am trying to figure out specifically I'm brakets but you don't have to answer that.
So hyperphetical situation:

* You have a long iron wire (~3kg/m) (on the moon)

* You want to magnetically levitate a vehicle/train/robot above it a bit like a monorail

* It would be preferable to use electromagnets

* A cable providing power from the ground is allowed. (its actually the rail that will be moving but not important (orbital ring rotor but hey...))

so: how much power would you need to keep the platform afloat?

I figured the equation is roughly (vehicle mass * gravity) * (efficiency of magnets and power transfer) watts.

So what kind of magnet efficiency can I expect?

How does vehicle height above the wire/track effect that? (Inverse square law of efficiency?)

How much does superconducting magnets help?

I have no work experience. I graduated from a decent technical university and hold a mechanical engineering degree. I graduated 1.5 years ago. I have been unemployed the whole time.

86,Why would receiving a call on a cellphone trigger a GFI electrical outlet?,1513560478,"Alister had a hell of a time tracking down the reason why his washroom GFI (ground fault interrupter) tripped on random occasions; i.e., the electric outlet would lose power and need to be reset.

Alister would love to hear comments from any engineers about the cause. The arc fault breakers operate on the principle of detecting RF (hash on the A.C. waveform from an arc somewhere in the circuit) and would be susceptible to tripping from stray RF. The GFI breakers simply detect unbalance between the hot and neutral wires and shouldn't be affected by RF any more than a normal circuit breaker.",AskEngineers,unique616,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7khyij/why_would_receiving_a_call_on_a_cellphone_trigger/

92,Which Msc/school for the job I want to do?,1513541135,"Hello ! 
I m currently a french student studying ""engineering"" (a very generalist program) and I have to choose a school now . Next year I ll be going to the said school and after a year I ll become graduate (french system is a bit particular) 

So have to choose a school in which (hopefully) I ll be able to specialize . I know what kind of job I want to do (even though I dont know the exact name), so I came here in order to ask you for advices in terms of Msc or schools that might be particularly helpfull for my future carrier .
(and also to know the name of the job I am aiming for) 

I want to optimise buildings (high performance building / energy efficent are often the names of the course) . For instance, in terms of heating power, there is a lot of energy waste in standart architecture. I want to choose the materials in accordance with certains conditions (geographical and financial) in order to maximize the energy efficiency of a building for economical purposes (For the building to cost less to the owner in the long term) That while also optimising the comfort of the people living in this building (light, air quality, soundproof). 

from the results of my research (on the internet), I think I ll need knowledge related to the quoted above things. 
I also think that I ll need to know how to use standart softwares to simulate the result of some layouts in order to choose the ""best"" combination of materials and their layout.

So in order to learn about all that I was planning on going to a school and take the option "" building and environment"" which I ll be studying for a year (theorically)

Afterward, according to the french system I ll have to opportunity to go study aboard for one up to 2 years in which I can get my msc/ms. 

After a lot of research I ve concluded that MS related to the job I wanted to do are :
Optimizing building efficiency (MS in 2 years) 
and Advanced building simulation (Msc in 1 year)

And while it's going to be hard to enter to the schools that teach them but I have hope.

However, there are exactly two choices. And here are the issues:
The first choice:

- It have a lot of courses that are pretty much the same as ""building and environment"" I ll be taking as option.

- Will studying only building and environment + energy efficienct building be enough to work? Is there a need for more a more detailed knowledge directly related to ""classic civil engineering"" aka solidity? 

- from what I can read on masterportal + websites, I only learn very basic knowledge about simulation

With the second option, the issues are : 

- The only country in which I ve found it is England. (but the school teaching it is fairly famous, not one of the best but still) So I m wondering whether this msc is very known, very useful or anything. 

- With brexit enforcing laws from 2019, I m not sure I ll be able to study in England.

So if you have suggestions (are there other choices, which one is the best? taking those options is a good idea?), or can inform me of the name of the job I m aiming for, tell me about its validity and use, please comment below .

Thank you in advance !

1. How important will my GPA be when applying for jobs?
2. How important will internships be when applying for jobs?
3. Are future employers likely to take into account my situation, or maybe even value my ability to juggle all of these responsibilities at once? Or will my application simply be filtered out by some kind of GPA-based algorithm before it's even seen by a real person?

In both of them there's a relevant bulletpoint that reads:

I'm not a native english speaker, hence I'm in doubt whether I understand it correctly.

   * Does ""need not be"" essentially mean ""doesn't have to be""?

   * If 1 is true then what's the point? Why would it ever have to be over 0.9 VH? Why not 0.5 VH or 0.8 VH?


   * To me it reads like this requirement applies at all altitudes, but I have a hunch that they meant ""At SL, VC need not be..."" meaning that it only applies to sea level flight. Otherwise, why would we ever climb to altitude where VH is much greater than at SL, if VC would still be limited by what is achievable at low altitude?

I want to make a press brake in the 60-100 ton range, and have two large circular flanges I want to use for my frame.  Here are the specs on the flanges:

O.D. 74.625""
I.D. 56.000""
Hole Pattern 27 holes on 68.625"" diameter.
Hole diameters are 2.375""
Flange thickness is 0.750""

The flanges look like they were either CNC flame or Plasma cut, and the grade of steel is unknown (not a casting).  My initial thought was to space the flanges a few inches apart and bolt together with spacers, say every third bolt hole.  For the hydraulics I was planning on using a few 20 ton air/over bottle jacks plumbed together with an adjustable hard stop on both sides of the press bed.  The press bed would be supporting the flanges across the horizontal diameter, with supports running down to the bottom as needed.

So the big question is, can these flanges support the load safely? Or is this just a stupid idea.  Not knowing has kept me from working on it.  I need a press brake badly, but I do not need a gigantic piece of scrap on my hands!  I've scoured the internet and found a few formulas that ""might"" be what I'm looking for, although difficult for me to understand.  Everything seems like a shot in the dark.

19,Second Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering,1513367092,"Hi all,

I’m looking for some advice regarding going back to school for a second bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering.

Background: I’m currently 33 and graduated with a B.S. double major in Physics and Astronomy from the University in Maryland in 2006 (GPA 3.48). I’ve been working full-time in fields outside of the sciences since then. I feel so completely unfulfilled in my career path and need to make a change.

I’ve been researching getting a second bachelor’s in engineering, and I’m most interested in MechE. Because my first degree was obtained over 10+ years at this point, I would basically have to start from scratch. I don’t think a Masters program is feasible due to the length of time I have been out of school and the required prereqs.

The prospective of taking out so much money in loans (since I wouldn’t qualify for grants/scholarships due to already having a B.S.) and being so far behind the game due to age is extremely daunting.

Is there anyone in a similar situation that has successfully gone through this process, and is there any advice you could offer?

20,Electrical Engineering degree without Co-op,1513365520,"Hello everyone, earlier this year I had decided to remove the co-op option from my degree due to some personal issues I was having at the time along with other things. As I was in the process of doing this, the head person of the coop program emailed me to make sure if I was ok and if I really wanted to do this, to which I replied yes.

In that email I had also mentioned that I am fully aware of the benefits of the co-op program and that not having co-op on my degree will make it harder for me to stand out amongst other graduates.

Here is my question though, just how much will this hinder me? I know it will to some degree, but will it just make my job search after graduation a little harder, or will it be incredibly hard to find anything? 

If it helps with any answers, I’m currently in my second year of electrical engineering in Ontario, and if my personal situation changes I know that I have until the first term of my third year to get back in.

21,"Reddit Help Me! Career switch from Mechanical to Software. here are options that I found, help me pick one please! F1 F1",1513361924,"Hi Reddit,

I am a mechanical engineer graduated in 2015 from a well knows university with 3.6 GPA. I worked in aerospace for couple years as a manufacturing engineer and currently work in automotive industry for the past year.

After 3 years of regret depression and dissatisfaction, about 6 months ago I took edx CS50x class which I fell in love with and finally decided that this is what I want to do with my life, to switch my career to software engineering and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make it a reality! I started my intensive research of ways to accomplish it and came up with the followings: 

0) since I already have ""an engineering degree"", work on a portfolio, study interview questions and apply! (fake it until you make it)


1) Getting a second bachelor degree in CS (2 years since I already took a bunch of math and physics and couple programming classes)


2) Getting a masters degree in CS (6 months pre requisite ""certificate"" and 2 years masters)


3) Getting a certificate in a certain language and make a portfolio (python/C# offered from my university for a good price, 4-6 months)


4) Online Coding Bootcamp + MOOCS + portfolio (either FreeCodeCamp or paid ones like coding dojo, 4-6 months)


5) Self Taught through books! Already bought a few books that suggested on reddit

since I already am an ""engineer"" and have ""or other equivalent"" degree personally I am leaning more towards combination of option 3, 4 and 5, to earn a certificate and become specialized in a certain language, and build a general understanding of other stuff like HTML/JavaScripts and make a portfolio.

tldr; What are your thoughts on options above? I would appreciate every answer I could get :)",AskEngineers,rohamisamazing,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7k1ild/reddit_help_me_career_switch_from_mechanical_to/
22,What would you put in an engineering tinker kit for kids?,1513356633,"I'm trying to put together a ""tinker kit"" for my son as a Christmas present, but I'm struggling with what I should put in it. A little background: my son is 10, but tests several grade levels ahead in math and science. He's wanted to be an engineer since he was 5 (specifically, he wants to be an engineer who designs trains and rail systems, but he also loves programming, robotics, electronics, and just building things in general.) I've done a lot of googling, but I can only seem to find tinker kit suggestions for younger kids. So my question is, thinking back to your childhood, if someone handed you a box full of junk that you could mess around with, what would would you want in it?

He already has an Arduino, Raspberry Pi,a huge collection of Lego Mindstorms, various components (diodes, jump wires, breadboards, etc.) a soldering kit, usb wifi adapters, at least 5 laptops worth of stuff he disassembled and saved, a couple computer monitors, and a few Arduino/Raspberry Pi project books.

So far for this tinker kit, I've bought him pretty much every sensor you can get for the Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi, a couple module displays, digital multimeter, wire stripper, and a tiny screwdriver set. I'm probably going to add a few dollar store electric toothbrushes for him to take apart and salvage the motors. And this is where I get stuck. I need more stuff for him to take apart and build into something new. Or other supplies that I might not be considering. Thanks for any help you can throw my way!

23,Travel oscilloscope recommendations &amp; weird signal interference?,1513353667,"**To avoid a potential X-Y problem, the reason I'm planning on getting an oscilloscope:**


An equipment control panel has turned into a bit of a pain in my rear. There's a small RS-485 serial Modbus network in there connecting a few VFDs and a PLC, along with DC drives, transformers, and a couple dozen (new) digital sensor feeds.

While a 7.5 HP VFD is running and powering a motor ~125 feet away (Yes, that's bad. No, I didn't choose it, and I can't change it.), the Modbus network drops most packets, but the PLC is usually able to get through. Usually. Eventually. When the VFD changes frequency, the problem gets much, much worse for about 30 seconds and then stabilizes. Every few weeks, the problem gets worse for a few hours and transmission success rate drops to single-digit percentages, then it returns to normal. 

For extra fun, the building recently saw *significant* extra equipment added by a contractor that may or may not have modified or pushed the limits of the building grounding system.

* Problem #1 is that the VFDs have a hard-set alarm &amp; shutdown after 30 seconds. This kills the panel.
* Problem #2 is that it's never good to lose touch with your motor controls for 30+ seconds, so a bypass &amp; reset is a temporary fix at best.

Ground wires have been verified, wires are run against the backplane, EMI filter and ferrite chokes installed on the VFD power supply, and I'm about out of ideas. My next step is to scope every single wire connected to the 7.5 HP VFD, figure out once and for all where the interference on the RS-485 line is coming from, what path it's traveling to get there, and deal with it. Somehow.

-------

To check the ground wire noise, +-5V DC RS-485 signals, 24V DC power, and 480V (VFD power, VFD output) lines, I'm looking at using a Picoscope 2204A. 

That's good up to 20V, so I'll need an attenuator in the range of 15-20 dB to bring down the 480V power to something that won't blow out the scope. Should only need a 1-2W attenuator since the oscilloscope's resistance will be so high, right?

Is there another sub-$500 scope anyone would recommend instead? Is this going to run into problems trying to measure the Modbus DC signals? Is there a really obvious alternative that I'm missing here while banging my head against the wall?",AskEngineers,Reddiphiliac,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7k0kqp/travel_oscilloscope_recommendations_weird_signal/
24,The back of the spaceX dragon solar panels has some interesting shapes. Why are they there?,1513353590,"Every so often I see something and go ""why is it like that?"". I had this experience just now while watching the spacex CRS-13 stream.

When the dragon solar array deployed we got some clear shots of the rear of the panels. The white panels have some black details, lines and spots which look like conduits of some sort. 

Where the lines pass through the circular spots they deviate from their regular rectangular shape into a little S that passes through at 90 degrees from the ""regular"" direction. I have circled an example in green in the picture linked below. I've also circled one of the black spots in blue. 

I'm most curious about what this deviation might be. But I'd also like to know what these lines and shapes actually are! My total guess is that the little S bend might be something that can add some flexibility in case of vibration, or expansion and contraction due to changes in temperature?

Excuse my typos, it's late here :)

I have some hot plates with three-point set screw adjustments (think screwable feet, except slightly better because you adjust from above and have finer pitch). I need the plate surface to be as perfectly horizontal as possible, so that compounds we heat and cast in dishes do not set with uneven thickness. 

They have to be releveled often—every time the plate is nudged or shifted. This happens somewhat often (once weekly), and apparently cannot be avoided. People just have to shift the damn thing.

We have been using a bubble level, since it seems to be a bit more accurate than a digital level from a hardware store. However, we still get results that indicate slight imperfections in the horizontal leveling... a tenth of a degree is still enough to make our polymer castings slightly out of spec. We only heat the plates to 60C, and have verified that there is no error from measuring at room temp vs measuring at their setpoint.

I absolutely love creating things that function to achieve something. 

Everyone  I work with sees my projects and just generally knows me is always telling me I’m far too intelligent to be a paramedic.(I personally don’t think it has to do with intelligence, I just took the time to nurture my knowledge of a strong interest)

https://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/article/hires/1225756/1225756.jpg

The reason this happens is because of a temperature inversion that creates a base of low density air that gets blocked by 11,000ft high mountains, which keep the low density air trapped by a layer of high density pressure, creating a bubble where every emission gets trapped and has nowhere to go but out through the canyons. 

After seeing how bad it gets, I’ve never been this concerned about the air quality.  Besides what we already do on our own to reduce our carbon footprint, what could we do to improve the air quality in Salt Lake City?  (Or any areas that have the geography to create a smog bubble.)

Would it even be possible to create a couple hundred tubes that ran up the mountain, or through each canyon, where on the inside of the tubing there would be very large fans ever mile or so, creating a “vent”, essentially sucking the smog and low pressure air out from underneath the high density bubble up, out over the mountains, relieving the area of pollutants?

I just moved here and have been on top of one mountain (Snowbird) since moving from the east coast, so maybe this is a far fetched idea, given the size and terrain of the landscape we’re dealing with.

59,Benefit of having a P. Eng. (Industrial) and B.Sc. (General)?,1513193288,"I’m currently half way through my second year of engineering. 
The way the engineering program is structured here is we spend two years at my current school (SMU) and get a diploma in engineering then move to another school (Dalhousie) where we do two more years (3 if we choose to do coop and I will) and graduate with an engineering degree. 

My current school is offering us a program thing where we can spend one extra semester here (6 classes/18 credit hours) and graduate with a Bachelor of Science along with the Diploma in engineering before I transfer to Dal to complete my industrial engineering degree. 

Would there be any benefits to getting the B.Sc (ie. higher pay in the future or more job opportunities) or would it be a waste of time?  Thanks!

63,Christmas present for my dad,1513184435,"Hello reddit,


This Christmas I want to give an original present to my dad. It’s really hard to give him something he likes because he just buys al the stuff he needs himself (tools etc.) and doesn’t really care about much else besides chocolate. Consequently, at birthdays, Christmas or father’s day he’s gotten so much chocolate that he doesn’t really like it anymore.


I admire my dad because he had to quit school at 14 to go work in a factory because his parents didn’t have enough money to support all of his siblings (he was the oldest). However, this didn’t stop him from building our entire house by himself, designing and building over 100 wood chippers in his spare time, and setting up a heating system for our house which is really efficient, despite it using wood for heating. He uses a really high-tech wooden stove that recirculates the smoke for a second burning, which also make it more environmentally friendly. This heats a large water reservoir which is used for heating our house and showering etc.


I would like to give him something so he can expand on this system. I was thinking of a temperature sensor and according (simple) data logging system, so that he can track the temperature of the reservoir. What would I need for this? I came up with:


-	Thermocouple
-	Arduino
-	Some type of battery solution to power the Arduino


Would this suffice? Is there a more user-friendly way to log the data?


Thanks!

68,Is there a specific term for the difference between the total strength of N poles and S poles around a ferromagnetic sphere?,1513181760,"I have noticed something around magnets: when the same-poled magnets are attached to a ferromagnetic sphere, the strength at the other end is stronger than different-poled magnets attached to the same sphere.

I'm doing a lab where I'm investigating the effect of number of N poles (and their total strength) and the number of S poles (and their total strength) in the resultant magnetic field strength through a ferromagnetic sphere.

So a brief overview of my experiment: For each configuration, the magnetic bars are arranged in a tetrahedral shape around a small iron sphere. All N poles have the same magnetic field strength and all S poles have the same magnetic field strength. (but their magnitudes don't equal each other)

- Configuration #1: 4 N poles, 0 S pole

- Configuration #2: 3 N poles, 1 S pole

- Configuration #3: 2 N poles, 2 S poles

- Configuration #4: 1 N pole, 3 S poles

- Configuration #5: 0 N pole, 4 S poles

For all configurations, the dependent variable is the measured magnetic field through the iron sphere.

My question is, how can I quantify the independent variable?

Right now I have calculated ∑(N poles field strength) and ∑(S poles field strength), and thinking of either using the difference or ratio between them. The problem with ratio is, however, on config #1 and #5, depending on whether I'm calculating the ratio N:S or S:N, I get a div/0 for at least one of them. (and I need minimum of 5 independent variables)

Does taking the difference sound reasonable? And I tried to do some research about this, but don't even have a single idea what this is even called.

I returned it to the store, and the replacement amp was working fine in the store (even tried it barefoot), but when I took it home, I got shocked. Again. So here's what I think happened: 
* 1.) It's the outlet causing this. (I think it's unlikely, given I'm able to use my other guitar amp and bass amp just fine.) 
* 2.) It's the power cord causing this. (We were using a different one in the store.) The cable is a 2 pin power cord where you put into the outlet, but the other end that plugs into the amp looks like this
If it is the power cable, would converting it to a 3-prong plug solve the problem, and would the ground pin on the 3-prong plug still work when it's plugged into a 2-pin adapter?

80,Variable dump load,1513129053,"I am creating a battery capacity tester for aircraft batteries. This is to test if a battery has gone bad when it doesn't appear to be putting out the output to start an engine. Corrosion issues or failing starters happen too. Being able to assess the battery health would help a lot during diagnostics. But I don't deal with this a whole lot; it would just be nice to have the extra diagnostic tool.

To test a battery's capacity, I am to charge a battery, apply a load equal to a 1C draw until the battery reaches a minimum voltage, and compare the time it took to reach that voltage with manufacturer spec for pass/fail.

To add complexity, I need it to be variable. I am dealing with multiple brands of battery, each with different Ah ratings (therefore, C ratings), as well as those which are 12 and 24v. But this should be pretty easy to do by providing multiple taps.

The part I am having most difficulty with is figuring out what type of dump load I should use. It's pretty obvious it will be heating element wires, but I do not know which metallurgical type.

I estimate that I will be dealing with wattage in the range of 250 to 700 watts.

I do not know the math involved in calculating the temperature rise of a conductor for a given amperage to make sure I don't melt the wire. I will be fine with tables for open air, if anyone has them.

If I were to use nichrome C, and 1C is 23 amps, I calculated a 12 volt battery will need taps just over 8 feet long on the wire if the resistance is .06488 per foot (10 gauge), and taps at 16 feet if it were a 24 volt battery.

I know, though, that the resistance will change with temperature, so this may not be an ideal metallurgical composition. But, so does a battery's voltage change as it discharges, I just need to get it in the ballpark; a 10% margin of error, for example, is hardly anything to worry about.

Alternatively, if anyone has a dramatically better idea, feel free to throw it at me, but keep in mind I unfortunately can't go dropping $500+ on a purpose built device. These things are VERY expensive, running 1.5k+. I do what is termed ""line"" maintenance and inspections in my shop, beyond that, it goes to a better equipped facility. This is for diagnostics.

I've thought about using lightbulbs too. But I would need a *lot* of them for 12v!

I know I need ceramic insulators too. I've already seen various places that sell these specifically for heaters. But also open to ideas here too!

82,"RS422 USB Serial to a USB Female-Female, then to USB Serial RS232. Possible or gibberish?",1513122987,"Hello, friends.

My question today might be embarrassing. 

So at work I've recently joined a project that is long overdue. The short version is that I have a Microcontroller and a load of sensors to integrate, whose data is gathered through serial ports. Let's just say I have two sensors right now: one that uses RS232 (sensor A) and another RS422 (sensor B). I also have RS232 USB Serial to TTL adapters and it was suggested to use both adapters to connect to the MCU's serial ports with these sensors.

Now here's my question, as I'm not even sure if this works: I've been told to connect B to the board by inserting its RS422 to USB Serial, connecting this end into a USB female-to-female, and into this the USB Serial end of the RS232 to TTL adapter. It's basically:
(Sensor-B-422-----USB-male)-----&gt;(USB-female-USB-female)-----&gt;(USB-male----232-Board)

Does this even make sense? Driving voltages, signals and the protocol itself are different between standards. But somehow my mind gets off the highway when I'm trying to understand what is happening at the USB interconnection (probably nothing). As far as I'm concerned, for communication to happen I need to adapt the RS422 to RS232 (or directly go from RS422 to TTL, but that doesn't answer my question).

Thank you in advance, and have a great day.

Soon after defending my Master Thesis, I was contacted by a thermal engineering company to work in aerospace projects (since my thesis was kinda related to thermal engineering). Since I didn't have any other prospects and I had been rejected from all graduate programs I had applied to, I accepted even if it meant changing countries. I have been with them for a year now, and I absolutely hate it. I despise the job, how the employees are treated, and the fact that the salary barely sustains me and leaves me with very little (if any) savings.

I am starting to realize that I don't like the job because I did not have thorough training in thermal engineering, and this company simply hired me because they needed to meet a certain employee quota (their turnover is horrible and basically every employee is trying to escape to somewhere else).

So it is clear that I want to find something else. The question is, **what can I do in aerospace?** There is a million possible career paths, and I find it daunting to pick something, with the fear of it being another overly technical job I am not prepared for, or a dead-end. My end-goal would be to work for a bigger company, such as Airbus, or a space agency. 

So with this in mind, I have been trying to find a job for the past 6 months, especially in Systems Engineering, as in my uncultured mind it seems like a not-super-technical job that I could see myself doing. This hasn't been fruitful at all, and I haven't even landed an interview.

I was recently contacted by a company to work in Germany as a Test Engineer (supposedly for space), but I have been told by colleagues that Test Engineering would be a dead-end for my career, and that it is a job more fit for a technician than an engineer with 2 Master degrees.

Of course, I have no clue if this is true or not, and I am very afraid of changing countries yet again, to find myself in the same position I am now. What are your thoughts on this possible change, the career of a Test Engineer; and what suggestions do you guys have for me?

Thank you for your time reading this!

**TL DR:** Young aerospace engineer hates his job and wants to change. What are viable careers in aerospace that you think I may enjoy?  
**TL DR 2:** What do you think of the career prospects of a Test Engineer? Do you think it can be a dead end job?

97,Unsure to continue (unpaid) internship,1513080802,"Hey guys,

Currently started a new position in this internship that is going to be most likely unpaid (I don't know the full details yet, but it is part of a placement program which i can use to my advantage for course requirements - in terms of work experience). 

Anyway, the role is an intern in a construction contractor firm (small-ish), where my duties have been doing payroll, updating cost/supplies etc on an excel file in the database, and then mostly manual labour  on-site of construction.

I don't really have a mentor to go with as he seems too busy with managing his multiple projects. My first day was just me doing the excel work (payroll and such), and then the next 2 days I have just been told to pretty much go on-site and report to the site supervisor/foreman. I try my best to shadow wherever and help out the on-site labourers where possible. I haven't even been briefed about the project I'm on, and practically had to learn off the other intern (although very briefly) what the bloody project was about (NOTE: i've only met him for a day before he was kicked out). 

But mostly, I have no real idea what the hell to do. I don't really feel I have much guidance and this work isn't what I hoped to do. Plus the site itself has no accessible water in its portable for the workers. 

I've put up the idea of me coming in not on a full-time M-F basis, but rather a 3 day basis so I can work my other part-time job just to earn some dosh. 

At the end of the day, I just feel like this internship doesn't seem to be run too well, and I could just be some cheap/free labour ultimately. My fellow peers in the program that offered these internships seem to be doing more office-based work such as tendering and some type of designing in other respective contractor firms.  I understand that hands-on physical work is very beneficial, but I don't really see any reassurance in some type of structure or layout this internship has for me. 

I had another intern, but he was already kicked out by the firm as they didn't like him to be a cultural fit. That other intern was a good guy honestly, but he wasn't 'the best socially'. He asked too many questions or didn't know when to keep his mouth shut, but I guess that is just part of being an intern where you really just want to ask what the hell is going on sometimes. I felt like they should have given him more of a chance or given him some more 'assertive' commands to put him in the right track (he did start a bit earlier than me). 

I was asked by my site supervisor to order in some concrete to the site, and I called the firm office who redirected me to my 'supposed mentor/manager' who did help me, but gave off the vibe of ""don't try to call me unless they aren't stupid questions kind of thing"". It was my first time doing this - billing a reasonably big order to the company accounts and I wanted to be sure i billed it correctly etc. He is a good guy i'm sure, but perhaps he may have taken in more responsibilities than he could have actually handled ? 

Deep down, I don't mind coming in for 3 days a week, even if i don't have some proper guidance, I can at least experience labourer life and construction of any civil works in the field, but I am also worried about whether I'll honestly be some cheap grunt and it is a 1 hour commute each way for me...I have no outlined start and finish time for most days even apart from ""Start early and leave... when it is deemed appropriate"".

9,Thoughts on the engineering? happiness? Career path? ...and ramblings of an unhappy accountant,1513013087,"I’m writing this in my cube at work and getting ready to pound my head against my desk. I’m turning 30 in a month and reality/mortality is setting in. It's filling me with such a deep sense of sadness I almost can’t put it into words. I’ve been working in accounting for about 10 years. I started work as entry-level accountant at a food service company and slowly worked my way up through the ranks over several years. I moved to a small solar startup after 3 years with the food service company. The job gave me a little more flexibility with the type of work and analysis I did. It was interesting but I didn’t find myself fulfilled. At the time, I was told by nearly all of the fellow accountants that getting a CPA would open up “big” opportunities with the choices of jobs. When I was about 23-4, I took their advice and started studying. I passed the exams, got my professional hours signed off on, then got the license. I found a better paying job at a tax firm, and boy did I hate it, from day one I realized that I had made a big mistake. I stayed at the tax firm for about 2 years which brings me to my current job. I went back to that same food service company in a finance rather than accounting capacity to try yet another avenue in corporate America. The job isn’t terrible but it’s not satisfying. After working in tax, audit, ledger, and finance I realize something. I love business but I HATE accounting/finance. The problem is I don’t really have anything to show for a day’s work. I’ve known my whole life that I’m a physical problem solver. From the time I was a little kid the only thing that could keep me in my seat was putting together models of cars and airplanes, I’d be able to sit hours on end assembly every tiny little piece. What I’m discovering now is that I think I need to be solving spacial problems either mentally or physically (ideally a combination of both) professionally in order to find professional fulfillment. When I was in high school and college I worked in auto repair shops and for a construction company. I really enjoyed the work, getting my hands dirty, understanding how the mechanics of the things we use everyday work. One summer I took it upon myself to build a deck for my parents (with no prior experience and no help) it was exciting learning, planning, and creating something from nothing. Throughout the years when they’ve had work done to their house I still have my mom calling me telling me that she received another compliment on the deck from a contractor. When I work on car projects, it consumes me and all I can think, going to bed waking up. When I worked on the deck it was the same thing. And that’s where my head runs away. I am more proud of the summer I spent building the deck than the 2 years it took me to get my CPA license. Objectively my life isn’t that bad, I make about 90k a year (in the Philadelphia area, which makes for a pretty comfortable living), I have no student debt, I’ve been super lucky with the opportunities I’ve been given. I should have nothing to complain about. Nonetheless, knowing I’m not contributing to the world in the way I’m built to is killing me. I’m not opposed to cube life and I’m not opposed to long hours. Professionally I’m looking for that feeling after a long day’s work of being able to say this thing exists at least in a small part because of me. I mean D*amn it if I design a screw in a widget that made someone life easier I think I’d feel pretty good about the hours I spent making it. I am 100% certain that I want to create physical objects that have never existed that is what my brain is built to do, regardless of what the object is I do have a strong background in math it isn’t something that scares me. What does scare me is looking at the cost of going back to school. I found a pretty good program at Boston University called Leap. Specifically made for non-engineering looking to get a masters in engineering (https://www.bu.edu/academics/eng/programs/leap/). I went to an open house last year when I was considered a career switch but never pulled the trigger. The program all in from their website is about 70k a year including room/board and food (https://www.bu.edu/eng/prospective-graduate/apply/graduate-tuition-fees/). Not being rich I’d have to take out loans, the program doesn’t tell you how long it is but they say it’s anywhere from 2+ years depending on what credits they can transfer from your bachelors. That means a min 140k of debt which (presuming I get zero financial aid &amp; that it gets done in 2 years and not the plus) I guess isn’t THAT much over the course of the rest of my life but it’s a very scary number to commit to. That brings me to my questions, (1) for engineers or those of you that have switched to engineering from other profession are you guys satisfied with your job in the sense that you get fulfillment from knowing that something exists in this world because you designed? Every now and then you read about engineers going back home and work on designing in their spare time just for fun. You never hear of an accountant doing a tax return because they're bored at home. I’ve read in several posts on reddit that as you move through the ranks in larger engineering companies you move further away from designing components and move closer to management roles, dealing with personnel and working on budgets (something I’m very familiar with). (2) Is it still fulfilling knowing that you in some way are directing or making larger design decisions?

I've had no luck getting a position yet (I do have a FT job to pay bills), but I've had some interviews. It seems like I need more controls, matlab, and python to learn for robotics jobs. 

Is it worth it to learn some of the skills I mentioned for a few months and create a small portfolio and demonstrated projects? I was considering learning Python to create an AI chat bot, and using MATLAB/Python to control an autonomous car with an arm. I feel like self-driving algorithms and adaptive control needed for the arm would make me a better candidate, and machine learning with Python should be useful for jobs like autonomous vehicles that's both controls &amp; AI. It's more time between school/job but more experience. 

Basically, learn and apply to jobs I'm interested in vs. get a job asap in something I'm not necessarily interested in.

On the attached picture at the link bellow, you can see that the cold start button C is at the ""off/up"" position blocking the movement of the E and A (injection pump lever) going astern. When C is pushed down, spring D pulls E and A astern were i suppose more fuel is flowing to the injectors for the startup of the engine.So once the engine has started it disengages by the governor  and sets to the position of the image and idle revolutions(?). Now, if we would like to give throtlle from idle, shouldn't the A move astern? But since the C is now blocking it from doing so,the only option is to go towards the bow were i suppose less fuel is injected and at the end of the travel it should shut down. Is there a chance that the current position of the image is maximum throttle? then i understand that A going towards the bow will diminish the fuel. But if the image shows idle position then the only option is shut down of fuel moving A towards the bow. Also G and F looks like the only way that engages with other parts is only to act as a stopper to E and A. Any input would be much appreciated, thanks. Pictures at the link

It is time to test the anchors to see if they are strong enough to support climbing . According to standard the bolts should endure a perpendicular pull of 15KN . Since we live in a very remote area we don't have access to the proper testing equipment therefore we have  played with the idea of making a tester . 

My question is if we design a cantilever system with a car jack which produces the push motion and attach a bar to a swivel on the other extreme and finally attach the expansion bolt to the middle of such bar.  

According to our limited knowledge, we should have 217 Psi on the car jack to produce 15KN of pulling force .  However we don't know if there are other factors we are not considering such as steel deflection , or the jack readings are not calibrated for just jobs , etc .

60,How to be a desired engineer after being let go after a year at my first job?,1512747371,"Bottom line is that I am about to be fired from my first job out of college after a year working there. 

I am the most junior engineer in the firm, and I've been on a PiP for the last couple months. Reasons for putting me on the PiP were from things out of my control such as a shop's quality, being late and costing 5 times as much as a senior engineer had gotten at a later time (given it was all approved by the manager, and the PiP occurred 6 months after the whole ordeal with the shop, and had already dropped them as shop). The other reason for my PiP was that my drawings weren't good enough, attributing that to the lower quality from the shop. I found it funny as they were all reviewed and signed off by the manager and senior engineer at the time of being sent out and my drawings have been used at different shops with no complaints.

All in the while, my work has been directly being used to bring in millions to the firm as deliverables on a contract. My documents and drawings have met or exceeded all internal documents quality. 

3 months prior to the PiP, I was given a reward that placed me at the top 10% performers in the company. So that PiP came from almost nowhere. Supposedly my job is being dropped as the contract for my project is concluding (my job was never advertised as a contract job) And that I am not a fit for the other engineering jobs in the firm (read: inexperienced)

Either way, I met and exceeded all the milestones stated in the PiP, but had the manager move the goal post twice (and ""extending"" the PiP twice), insinuating that it's coming from above my manager. Understandably, my morale isn't very high (I used to work from 8 to 10-11pm, occasionally all nighters) and now I am sticking strictly to 8-5. I worked these hours as I naively felt that I needed to put in the hours as the junior engineer. 

I've been feeling very downtrodden recently as I've been applying and getting denied while still trying to meet deadlines on my day job.

64,Sailor asking for advice on whether to go for a second bachelor's degree or a master's after getting out of the Navy.,1512726942,"About 6 years ago, I graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in Biology. In my studies, I lost my drive and ended up with so-so grades, debt, and no lab experience.

After I graduated, I ended up enlisting in the Navy and joining the Nuclear Propulsion Program. But due to my grades, I knew that it was unlikely that I would go in as an officer. I intended to apply for officer programs once I was in. So I progressed through the training pipeline. I performed fairly well and graduated the pipeline as a Electrician's Mate (Nuclear). 

After that I got to my assigned ship. I trained, learned about the plant, qualified, and learned to maintain and fix equipment. I ended up being a workhorse in my plant which led to me becoming a maintenance manager and also helped me get awards and solid evaluations. I also ended up transferring to another division that trains new sailors and assists in qualifying new watchstanders.

Now I'm in my last year of a six year contract with the Navy. I really like the science and technology involved in how the propulsion plants work, but it's not the same as the passion I had toward physiology and neurobiology. But during my time in, the cons have been outweighing the pros for whether I should stay with the Navy.

Now I am trying to make my decision for what I will do once I leave the service. I have always been interested in medical devices, like prosthetics. With all of the advancements that are being made, I'm becoming more fascinated about the possibilities.

 I want to take what I have learned during my time in and apply that knowledge.

Disclaimer: I do not intend to ask you for your ideas and then run with them. I am simply looking for someone more well-versed than I in this field to point me in the right direction.

I have been brainstorming this idea for awhile now, but i'm having trouble taking my vague concepts and transforming them into an actionable project.

The essence of my idea is as follows: The manufacturing of a child's car seat, complete with an embedded weight sensor, that has the capacity to communicate an alert system to a parent's smartphone in the event of an unattended child left in the car. 

The question I've had the hardest time answering is: how would the digital output signal from a pressure sensor communicate with a smartphone? Would Bluetooth be a viable option here? 

In other words, could you please offer any guidance you might have on how a weight/pressure sensor might reach a smartphone, and the steps that might take place in between?

Thank you again for any help you can offer!

74,Terminated From An Internship After The First Week,1512691418,"I recently began a part-time internship at a small (less than 8 employees) consulting firm within the Power industry.  I was terminated this week because I wasn't ""quick enough"" after my first week (3 days at 5hrs of work per each day). The thing is that I finished every small assignment that was given to me during that time. I'm feeling kind of down about it, because I was really trying, but I don't feel 24hrs total of working is enough time to evaluate my work performance. 

I was terminated because It was taking me 1 to 2 hours longer than it should have to complete some of the tasks (documentation, looking over spec sheets, making sure the correct legal aspects were used within contracts, etc), along with asking too many ""basic questions"" that were already covered during the brief training that I was given, and that I lacked initiative, and I didn't pay attention to detail to a great enough extent. I had never missed a day of work, or had been late, and the work that I did finish was approved by the engineers/managers.  Also, four hours was all I was given for training as well. 

Is this what a typical internship is like? Should I ask less questions? Does anyone have any experience with mentoring interns/junior engineers and could provide some guidance?

I am at a crossroads. I am debating whether or not to accept a spring co-op position at NASA's GRC. I am currently a sophomore at OSU majoring in Aerospace Engineering. I know that this is an amazing opportunity that doesn't come along too often, but I am also a little skeptical about taking a break from school for over a semester. Taking this co-op would set my graduation back by 1 year as most courses in my major are only offered once a year, but it would also give me the opportunity of a lifetime. 
I am also in a tricky financial situation as I am getting Ohio residency this year so I will have to be financially independent while working there.

87,Should I pick up a second internship or undergrad research?,1512616861,"Hello everyone.

I am a fifth year senior with not a lot of work experience. I'm studying electrical engineering with a math minor. I'm interested in working for a defense or aerospace contractor doing RF stuff or controls. I just started an internship that is basically just being a mechanical engineering intern/machinist for the university. I mill parts, perform different tests, and occasionally help small businesses with electrical designs.


Next semester I will only have two classes, capstone and economics. I will barely graduate with a 3.0. I already enrolled in a one credit undergraduate research position doing RF stuff for an IOT device (which I play around with in my spare time) for next semester. However, I will still have tons of time as my internship is only 12 hours a week and my undergrad research is only 1 credit hour. I literally have 4 days a week where I am doing nothing.
Should I look into getting another undergrad research position or look for a second internship? 

I got an offer to work for a industrial automation company doing troubleshooting and working with techs repairing assembly lines for 15 hours a week as well as an offer to do paid undergrad research in robotics/controls for 12 hours a week.

Which one would be better for working in the defense industry? Ultimately I want to go back to graduate school but have the company pay for it after a few years of work.

I am currently in school working on a mechanical engineering degree and have been getting applications out for internships for summer 2018. I've gotten 6 apps out to BNSF and Norfolk Southern combined, and this is where a couple questions of mien come in.

I've been turned down for 2 of the 6 positions, and otherwise I've gotten past the second interview-type step for the other positions for BNSF and past the first hurdle of simply sending more info in for Norfolk Southern for those positions. I think that I'm a fairly good fit for the positions that I'm still in the running for, so I have a bit of hope that they'll pan out. I've read a bit about the railways in a couple spots (here, Glassdoor, other online reviews) and I'm hoping to learn a bit more.

I've read a good bit about some animosity between hourly folks and management at both BNSF and Norfolk Southern and resentment due to the long hours and constant on-call status. Online reviews seem to be mixed at best, but it looks like the majority of the reviews are written by hourly, union-involves folks or other younger, entry-level and intern-type employees. 

If I have somehow reached someone who has experience in working with or hiring interns for a large railway, can you describe what you're looking for in an intern?

16,Change BPM and apply pitch correction to streaming music?,1512541019,"I have not seen this done and was just wondering if it's a technical challenge. In any dj software or app I've used that uses mp3s, it seems a song has to load (render the waveform) before the software can adjust the tempo or correct for pitch. I believe you may start manipulating tempo on any part of the wave form the (virtual) play head is on - that is, the entire song doesn't have to load for you to start playback and shifting things. All DJ software I've seen works with locally stored MP3s. Every MP3 has a few seconds of 'load' time to render the waveform (I understand MP3s are compressed and that they must be processed for playback). I was wondering if it's possible to do this with streaming music such that the latency isn't too bad (and how much buffer is enough to make changes that feel instant)?

Work life balance is very important to me and I want to plan my career in a way that would allow me to eventually live rural, rather than in a large urban center. From what I have learned so far, it seems that this may not be possible in this career, especially early on.

 I trying to answer these questions:

Are there opportunities for engineerings to practice in the biomedical field with only a bachelors degree or is it necessary to continue with further education?

If I were to eventually pursue either a Masters in Biomedical what difference do you think the undergrad backgrounds of electrical vs mechanical engineering make?

 Are biomedical engineers typically employed in academic research or is there a substantial private industry in Canada?

Do they ever work in hospital environments?

49,Advice regarding a Simple Wind Tunnel,1512436607,"Hello r/AskEngineers! I’m a student studying in what would be the equivalent of high school. I have a competition on building a model RC plane out of foam and carbon rods and off-the-shelf servos and brushless DC motors. The task is to fly the plane through a simple obstacle course, though from how it is arranged it is simple to manoeuvre through (level flight-&gt;180 degree level turn-&gt;repeat until X laps are completed) .


In terms of plane design I already know the basics of how a plane works, but I would like to make a [cheap wind tunnel](https://imgur.com/gallery/1m88I) (not sealed, so not exactly a tunnel) with a few goals in mind to facilitate the design of the final plane:

* To test the effects of horizontal/vertical stabilisers/dihedrals on flight stability, with varying sizes, positions, angles of attack

* To determine the centre of lift of various models, with varying wing shapes and sizes by changing the centre of mass/gravity of the model until it is balanced (when the line of action of net lift and weight are on the same straight line, there is no pitching moment)

* To determine the magnitude of vertical and horizontal force acting on various models (lift and drag) with varying wing shapes and sizes and varying angles of attack

* To test the effect of control surfaces on the flight attitude of the model (servos will have to be installed for this part) with varying control surface sizes and at various angles (to determine what operating range of control surfaces I need)


I may also plan on conducting other tests if needed.
Some other relevant tests I plan on doing:

* Testing the motor with propeller attached onto a model to investigate the significance of propeller torque on the model of certain mass and load on wing (for a propeller monoplane design)

* Measuring the force of propulsion of a motor with propeller attached


However, I have a few questions regarding this approach. 

* How do I obtain a laminar flow from a fan? As far as I know a fan/propeller may not produce a completely laminar flow of air. Is the vent enough to smooth out the airflow, making the airflow laminar enough for testing?

* I am not sure how to measure wind speed. I know I can somewhat vary wind speed by adjusting distance between the model and the fan. I do not have access to a digital anemometer and am interested in making a simple ping pong ball anemometer, where you tie a string to a ping pong ball, place it in the wind and measure the string’s angle with the vertical. Will this be good enough? I am not sure about how to calculate wind speed from the angle measurement, though I believe it is related to the magnitude of drag force.

* Will placing the springs above the model greatly affect the lift generated? I read that obstructions on the top of a wing would affect lift, whereas the bottom of the wing is less susceptible to this effect.

* In the school club I’m in (the club takes part in the competition), we have an alumni working as a trainer, but from what I have learnt from the alumni trainer, building the RC plane was often based on past designs (i.e. more or less copy the plane with similar dimensions) but I thought that this was a bit “unprofessional” as I wouldn’t have learnt much from just copying a plane, nor do I know much to improve the design. The alumni trainer claimed that just learning to fly the plane was enough. (Our school had won before, but I still feel that there was also a lack of competition as competing schools were more likely to be split across 2 different categories.) Is building a wind tunnel to test various designs then a viable option, or is it a waste of time/resources? As far as I know no one in the club has done something like this before.

* The model will be scaled down by half in all 3 dimensions in order to reduce material usage and to reduce the load borne by the springs. What effects on the experiment results do I need to take note of when scaling down the model? How do I need to scale measurements accordingly for calculations for the actual plane? Do I need to scale for airspeed?

&gt;2-	Detailed design (design of all parts including material selection)

&gt;3-	Engineering drawings (detailed drawings of the final design (2-D) with dimensions using AutoCAD or a similar software)

&gt;4-	Manufacturing, assembly, and costing (a description of the manufacturing process suitable for each component and the final assembly of the vice, in addition to the estimated cost, including material and manufacturing costs).

We literally just finished the design of shafts yesterday, we took the basics of failure under static forces and fatigue, and we are just getting into the components part of the book (shigley's book that is). Our professor said to not come to their office if we want any help with the project and we are entirely on our own with this.

I'm not asking anyone for a full solution obv, but I have a few questions that I'd be grateful to get answers for:

1. How do we get started in doing this project when it comes to picking the model of the vice and designing it (dimensions etc)? Do we just pick an already made vice model and change its dimensions per the specifications or what?

2. How do we know what the forces and the stresses (critical ones that is) are if we don't even have the full model of the vice?

3. Are the forces that vices are subject to static or fluctuating/completely reveresed?

4. Any general advice when it comes to design projects? I really want to become adept at this stuff but I'm at loss at what to do here as this is our first ""big"" project that we have to do in our program (I'm a junior).

65,Bored at Work- How to Keep Motivated / Interested?,1512397067,"Long story short- I have been with my current employer for 2.5 years, working as a manufacturing engineer. The job was fascinating when I first started out. We do a lot of sheet metal fabrication where I work, i.e., punching flat patterns on various turrets, bending parts on press brakes and then welding &amp; painting. I have been tasked with making the less sexy aspects of our processes more efficient and it’s not turning me on. How to keep motivated?

Long Story:

For the better half of my career, I was kept busy (and very engaged) programming six-axis robots to do various mig weld jobs. Before my arrival, the robots were seldom used and viewed as “wasted money”. I found a way to put new products on the robots, developed new fixturing and made new programs to keep the machines busy. This was pure joy and hardly felt like work. It kept me busy for about a year and a half. My first six months a mix up of ramping up to things, learning processes, etc. 

For the past six months I have been off the robot projects, working on more “people oriented” 
projects. I have been improving various manual labor tasks in the facility, making them ergonomically friendly and efficient. It does not keep me motivated, I’m quite bored and I have expressed this to my manager. A lot of the things I have been working on are little things that literally anybody could do. Order new tools, send assembly station XYZ back to the toolroom and make it 6” taller so the 6’-4” dude working there doesn’t have to hunch over all day. LOL

Anyways, how do you keep interested at work when things are a bit dull? I know this project isn’t forever and needs to get done, but man! I just feel like a zombie at work. 

I’ve toyed with the idea of automating more manual processes, but there is so much diversity in the assembly processes of our products it’s not really feasible to have automated machines. Every customer wants their product assembled to a different configuration than everyone else. There’s way too much customization at the assembly phase to make this feasible and management doesn’t want to invest a large amount of capital to change things up. Quick wins only.

66,Career/Major Change Advice,1512394984,"Hello,

I have some questions about a career change that I'm potentially thinking about doing but need some advice before I make the change.

I'm currently working as a chemical process engineer. I have a BS in ChemE, going for an MS in engineering management and already have my black belt in Six Sigma as well. I have come to realize that there are jobs for software engineers everywhere, at least it seems that way, and this has kind of made me think about pursuing a BS in computer science or maybe just a minor in CS not sure yet. 

It just seems that jobs for ChemE's always seem to be in the middle of no where or only in certain areas of the US as opposed to software engineering jobs being available just about anywhere. I may be wrong but I'm just in a position right now where I'm away from everyone I know (SO, friends and family) and it has come to a point where I'm not enjoying very much. I also like the idea of there being jobs available everywhere if I decide to move to a different locations later on in life and I also love tech and the idea of working with it as a software engineer sounds very interesting to me.

Some of the questions I have are:

* Would this be a bad career move/change for me?
* Would I be decreasing my earning potential going from ChemE to software engineering? (Research I've done shows that both seem to have about the same earning potential short and long term)
* Would I have a chance to find a job as a software engineer having only a minor in CS instead of a BS in CS?

99,"23 year old undergrad in Mech Engineering. Entering my senior year, and I hate it more than anything. Will it get better?",1512247814,"I’m about to enter my senior year. This current semester (2nd semester junior year) is absolutely crushing me. 

To start, fluid mechanics and materials science are killing me. I’ve never worked so hard, and I’m scraping by with high C’s. I’m in office hours, Tutoring, group meetings, and Saturday review sessions every week just to maintain those C’s. Everyone is struggling but it seems that they find these subjects interesting as well. I do not. Materials science was interesting for 1 week while we looked over failure analysis-what I intend on going into. I excelled in this unit and felt like the light at the end of the tunnel was near, until we went deeeeep into corrosion and I wanted to blow my brains out again. 

To top this off, I am a female and I have never encountered any form of sexism in my school until this semester. I’m thinking I just got stuck in the wrong classes with the wrong boys (I’m one of 3 girls in the program). I get excluded from group projects, even group texts about homework I get left out of. I have MAJOR imposter syndrome. My materials science professor regularly makes sexist remarks in class (“forging is a real badass field, of any of you boys want to be forgeman, you get major cool points. Ladies you can be forgeman too but it’s a lot of hands on manly hard work”). When I went to his office hours he asked why I don’t study with my peers and I honestly told him that I’ve been having to shrug off a lot of comments lately about being a girl. If I get a good grade it’s instantly discounted to “oh what did you do to get that huh? Extra time with the professor? How do your knees feel?”. He said that I should just shrug it off because they’re boys and they are just joshing me around, and that he’d be “lying if I said I’d never partaken in that kind of behavior myself”.

0,Questions about something called a “Polish Calculator”,1512238396,"So this is probably a really stupid question. I work at an engineering firm (not an engineer or involved in engineering) and a coworker complained to me that another coworker yelled “I hate this Polish shit” at his desk. To no one in particular he says he was frustrated with his calculator. The coworker in question has asked for him to be fired because her parents immigrated here (US) from Poland and she is highly offended. 

I did some googling and it seems there really is a thing called a Polish Calculator but they seem old and outdated. When I asked some other engineers about them, they said yes they are real and they all seemed to have one in their desk but said they don’t normally use them only for certain things which I don’t remember why they said. I was going to give him the benefit of doubt and ask him to please be considerate but the complaining employee will not accept this and is badgering me and threatening action if I don’t fire him. 

So I guess before I pay for a lawyer to deal with this, I just wanted to ask if this is actually really a thing that people still use today in engineering and are they as well known for being frustrating or hard to use as the other engineers are saying or are they covering for their friend? They tried to show me how it works but I don’t know how to use the advanced functions on normal calculators, I’m not really a math person. Thanks if anyone can give me a little info before I talk to a lawyer. 

Edit: additionally, I wanted to point out that I do not want to fire the engineer, the employee who reported it has reported things in the past that have turned out to be normal engineering terminology that she found offensive so I’m pretty sure it’s her, but just want to make sure because this one wasn’t as easy to understand for me.

I am having a slight problem with understanding the difference between the head produced by a pump and the pressure difference measured by a manometer that is connected across the pump.


1) Is the head of a pump (quoted by manufacturer) equal to the height of the column of a given liquid at zero flow?


2) Under flow, why is the pressure difference measured by a manometer connected across the pump different to the head quoted by the manufacturer? I'm guessing it's because there's a velocity head present but I am not quite sure (my knowledge of fluid mechanics is pretty crap!)?


3) What is the effect of liquid density on the measured pressure difference across the pump and why does this NOT affect the head produced by the pump?

Edit - from what i have understood reading the comments is that, according to the Newton's law of motion, for a mass to increase its speed a force is required. For a constant mass flow rate the speed of the flow in narrower section had to be increased. And this required force is taken from pressure available, hence lower pressure in the narrow section.

11,Getting a civil engineering degree later in life as a first degree?,1512171182,"Hi everyone.  Quick (hopefully) question.

I've been considering going to get my first degree later in life. I'd probably enter school at 35 when I did this, meaning I'd graduate probably at 40 or so if I was able to do full time.

D'you guys think a 40-year-old baby civil engineer would have a chance in hell of being hired?  I'd be about 20 years behind in practical experience from someone starting their career in their teens, which is making me pause to think deeply before deciding on anything.

I try to tell myself the other experience I've had would at least cause me to bring creative/different perspectives to the table, but I could very well just be fluffing my ego or something so I don't feel like a late bloomer.  Unwarranted optimism.

My current work history is a blend of IT support/quality assurance, and technical writing.  So I was thinking as a fallback, even if I wasn't hired into an actual civil engineering position if people found a 40-year-old-newb underwhelming, a degree would at least raise my worth as a technical writer so maybe the school loans wouldn't totally kill me even if I couldn't find civil engineering work. Technical writers with STEM degrees seem to do okay.

I'm not considering becoming a programmer even though it's a hot field because I figured if I had that passion, I'd already have done it, since I was certainly in its lap for many years.

Civil Engineering is on my mind because it seems a close cousin of architecture, which I have an interest in.  (But I'm not sure it's fiscally wise to go for an architecture degree.) It seems I could pursue a master's in Architectural Engineering later if necessary.

I was thinking of starting at a local community college then transferring to IIT (not to be confused with ITT, heh.)

Thoughts?  I'd be especially interested in hearing from anyone who became an engineer later in life and could share their experience.  Even if it's not civil engineering specifically.

20,Why is drag-latency of Touchscreens related to movement speed,1512147054,"I am trying to measure the drag delay of a touchscreen (final goal is system identification of human interaction). I found out that the speed (or frequency) of the movement influences the latency that I measure. High speed movements result in lower latency, low speed movement result in a larger latency. This seems counter intuitive. 

The method I use should be robust: so I expect hardware to cause this issue. Do any of you know what can cause this variability of latency?

*The test setup*


I am using the Walt Latency Measurement device, see: https://github.com/google/walt. This is essentially a mini-arduino board that syncs the hardware clock with the computer. It has a photodiode that detects when a laser is blocked or not.

As I am dragging a stylus over my touchscreen (projected capacitive), the WALT measures the time when my stylus is at a physical position. Linking this with the processed touch inputs results in an estimate of the drag latency.

*Results*


I ran some tests on top of some code I created to give my a target to follow. Frequencies in y direction are 0.2,0.4 0.6 and 0.8 Hz respectively. There is also movement in the x-direction (not shown on the plots provided), here the frequencies are 0.0548, 0.1096, 0.1644 and 0.2192, respectively. As shown, the resulting drag latency is different for the listed test conditions, though I do not know how. The update rate of the touch events is 166 Hz (touch to Linux Kernel).

note: latency is measured by shifting the laser events, such that that they are on roughly the same y-location (since the laser and photo diode do not change position)

29,Planning a setup to control and measure gas flow?,1512125935,"Hi!

I'm planning to build a gas flow control setup. I've got plenty of experience with building electronic test setups. However, I've got a limited knowledge of pneumatics and fluid dynamics. Therefore, I hope you guys can provide some help with planning the setup.
I'm on a tight budget, so i'm looking for DIY solutions instead of industrial grade solutions.




**The goal**

For a pneumatically actuated product, a suitable [**micro gas pump**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UWD_G-Zs6gOnHsJopbAGd3jJYljiFXvD/view?usp=sharing) should be found. 
The gas pump will inflate and deflate a scalable volume (similar to a balloon). The optimal actuation of the balloon cannot be calculated, it needs to be determined by tuning the system. I want to control and measure the parameters which will determine the choice for a micro gas pump. These parameters are air flow and max pressure/vacuum.


**Some Details**

With each inflate/deflate cycle the balloon is alternating between a connection with the vacuum side and the pressure side of the micro air pump. The frequency of the inflation and deflation cycle is variable. The frequency of alternation will probably be too high for the balloon to reach the maximum pressure/vacuum. The switching is achieved by a solenoid ""H-bridge"". 


**My assumptions**

I thought I could control the relevant parameters by taking an overpowered micro air pump and regulate it's speed and torque by respectively limiting voltage and current. 
The maximum pressure and vacuum during a cycle will be the minimum required pressure/vacuum of the motor. To measure the pressure and vacuum I could use electronic pressure sensors, like the [**MPX10**](https://cache.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/data_sheet/MPX10.pdf) series.


**My Questions**

1. Are my assumptions correct? 
2. How would max pressure and airflow be related to the torque and speed of the motor in a micro air pump? 
3. Are there alternative ways of limiting airflow? 3B. Does the diameter of a solenoid or tube limit the airflow? 
4. How do I measure or calculate the Airflow, are there any small electronic airflow sensors? 
Side question, how is inflation time related to air flow and max pressure?

33,Should I stay with my current job at a large corporation or accept an offer at a small consulting firm for a 20% raise?,1512102573,"First, some background: 
I am currently in a software developer role at a large corporation that I got into right out of university. My role involves developing various tools to automate or optimize processes in the production line. I've been with this company for almost 3 years, but with this division for only one and a half. To give you a sense of my work situation, the division has between 200-300 employees and my team has less than 10. When I joined this division, I worked hard and learned new skills in .NET and SQL fairly quickly and soon I was able to handle large projects on my own. But while I have been given a lot of responsibility and a substantial raise for my efforts, I feel like I am stagnating and that there isn't much room for growth because there are less than 40 engineers in this division and most of them work in other areas like project management or hardware rather than in software/automation, which is my main focus. Also, I am currently doing a Masters degree in CE part-time so that I can transition towards machine learning (ML) and this company does not have jobs in that area.

My dilemma:
Recently I was contacted by a recruiter who represents a small consulting company. They specialize in using off-the-shelf process automation software to automate a lot of manual work and data processing tasks that are common in industries like banking. There is some programming involved and you can develop some custom add-ons to enhance it. But mainly, it involves analyzing the client's process, figuring out the best way to automate it, and then implementation. Also, you get to travel to see different clients.

I was initially skeptical because the firm is small, the work felt less technical and more business-focused (not necessarily a bad thing) and it seemed like it also wouldn't have anything to do with ML. But during the interview, the managers and employees were friendly and told me that they had plans to use ML to offer even more value to their customers. Also, at this firm I would be making around 20-30% more (incentives included). To me, it seems like a good opportunity to gain client interfacing skills, travel, and even have the possibility of doing some machine learning work. And the company seems to have a bright future, even receiving awards for their high profit-growth.

However, what I'm worried about is losing the hard-earned relationships I've built with my current coworkers. Also I've heard that consulting companies often overwork their employees, which would be especially bad for me since I am studying part-time. And of course, there's always the risk that I might be pigeon-holed to working in similar companies (small, consulting field) in the future (tell me, is this risk real?). This is an issue because my eventual goal is to get into innovative tech companies like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft.

TLDR; Currently at a comfy, low-risk job at a large company. Got an offer at a small consulting firm with a substantial raise.

Am I allowed to be upset that I got a bonus? I mean, I'm not that mad that I got one, it's just that the company decided that $100 as a year end bonus on a record year for them was quality. But stack that sad bonus on top of the fact that I took a lower offer for this job than I would have in another town and it makes me feel like they don't actually value me as an essential part of their company.

Couple notes, the company is small (there's 10 of us). the industry is architectural engineering and we do Electrical specific only. COL in the area is rising swiftly.

I had originally taken this position on the assumption that this was likely a profit driven pay scale. We do well, you do well kind of deal. However, less than .2% of my salary seems almost insulting. 

This kind of thinking isn't coming from nowhere however. The offer I turned down was 15% higher, if in a 3 point index increase in COL. But i also have seen some of my friend's checks, well, deposit slips, and even some of their bonuses and they are receiving significantly more in both categories ( Fire Protection, Mechanical and another EE all in the A/E industry).

Now my boss calls in to babysit every few hours.  This would be no problem, but he is pretending like the argument never happened and I think he still holds his previous position.  He is also telling me not to pursue or investigate important details of my work - things I know have to happen, like following ASME GD&amp;T on our parts - because he doesn't think they're important.

53,How to humidify/add steam to a very hot air tight chamber?,1512065302,"I'm a scientist and I have a problem. I work with devices at ~800 C that have an air tight chamber around a sample. We then put the sample under any sort of atmosphere we want. The entire ""rig"" is inside of a furnace that JUST fits the device. The volume of the chamber is on the order of a few cubic centimeters. (Pretty small.) (EDIT: Chamber isn't exactly air tight, we have flow in and flow out, but it's sealed against the atmosphere.)

Sometimes, we want to humidify this chamber, but we've run into a few problems. 

If we humidify the gas flow before the furnace (aka run it through a bubbler), then the water will condense before it gets to the furnace. We can heat the lines, but even this doesn't work that well. And this also results in a max humidity of about 3%, which is pretty low. We need to be able to precisely control the humidity of the chamber. 

I would like to design a rig that allows for a ""pre chamber"" where we allow liquid water to vaporize, the deliver that steam to the chamber. But it's not that easy. Obviously steam occupies more volume than liquid water, so as we pump water into this chamber, the steam will rapidly expand and result in a change of pressure for the chamber (bad thing.) The flows for this chamber are pretty low, typically around 100 SCCM (standard cubic centimeters/min or mL/min).

I've been working on this project for a while, and after asking around the office I seem to have come to a tie among my mentors in how they view this issue. I don't have much experience with pumps, so I'm looking to see if anyone else has any input.

I have a vessel that I'm unloading with a 3500 rpm, 150 gpm centrifugal pump. The vessel I'm unloading currently has no vacuum protection and is rated for 0.41 bar external pressure. I've been investigating whether or not this centrifugal pump will apply and external pressure greater than 0.41 bar *or* will the pump cavitate once the level in the tank falls below the 7.5 ft NPSHr.

I'm more a DCS guy than a pump guy, so I'm looking for any experience someone may have with a centrifugal pump. I've already created interlocks to help prevent this scenario from occurring, but apparently the task of running these calculations has also fallen on my desk. In short, I'd love to hear opinions on:

1) Is pulling vacuum a major concern with centrifugal pumps?
2) Is there a metric you prefer for gauging risk posed by vacuum with centrifugal pumps?
3) Do you have a ""Go to"" pump resource so I can better educate myself on them in case I face another pump in the future? Nearly everything I find on the internet is less educational resource and more sales brochure...

and I noticed that the front landing gear is literally just a pad. The bit i'm talking about starts around 1:54. Two wheels in the back and one uhhh...flat pad on a hinge in the front.

Wouldn't it be better to use a wheel (with a brake)?

Also, it looks like the hinge of the pad is in a spot that brings the center of pressure (due to normal force) of the pad down over the front instead of something more stable in that corrects itself to the back.

69,How does a desktop monitor arm work?,1512015279,"Hello everybody, I'm a rookie mechanical design engineer who loves to understand how things work in order to build up my mental toolbox. My friend has recently purchased an Ergotech freedom arm for his monitor, and after watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBaiCyvGWy4) of how it functions, I am frustratingly still unable to understand how it works. 

The following questions are what are currently stumping me. 

1. How does the preload in the middle tension spring affect the weight the arm can carry without drooping? [Relevant Link](https://youtu.be/YBaiCyvGWy4?t=3m39s)

2. How do the bushings in the double U-Joint and the mounting plate have enough friction to remain in their orientation until moved?

I'm choosing between the various subfields of EE for Master's degree apps, but I'm not sure what each of them mean when it comes down to the real work.

I'm interested in energy, electric vehicles, and related climate change topics. I'm also interested in the idea of robotics, but I have no prior experience to show for it. I would also like to add some programming to my skillset because I don't have enough, though I feel hesitant to go into, say, computer engineering because I only have one course in C, one course in VHDL, and odds and ends  in programming from my physics bachelor's degree.

I like the idea of controls, since it seems to tie all the different components of a system together, and it would probably involve a fair bit of programming as well. However, controls are frequently tied in with a ""systems"" major, which I am not sure about; it seems that since I have only a physics degree (and a year of coursework in EE from an exchange year), I ought to go for a ""pure"" discipline to make up for my technical gaps. 

Can you also please tell me about signal processing, informational networks, circuits, nanoscale devices, and photonics concentrations? What do they entail?

Ultimately, I'd love to be part of the energy or electric vehicle engineering efforts. Or do something in the startup sphere.

Thanks for the advice!

81,Need help with wiring a ramp/soak PID controller,1511975462,"I was told to turn to reddit and this subreddit for help with a PID. If this is not the case and if there is a better subreddit could someone point me in the right direction. Thanks! 

I was wondering if someone might be able to help me understand the wiring of a new ramp/soak PID controller I ordered to replace a standard PID controller on one of our small kilns. I've installed numerous PID controllers over the years with no issues, but this the first time trying a ramp/soak controller and so far have been unable to get the elements in the oven to heat up. The controller itself turns on and is reading the correct temperature from the thermocouple, but once this controller's temp is set, the controller clicks to output the signal but the SSR never turns on. Since the controller turns on and triggers I believe it is a wiring issue, but I spoke to the company a few times and was told everything was wired correctly. The advice I was given was mixed and one solution even fried on a SSR. 

Here are the wiring layouts:. 
Original Layout: https://ibb.co/bvPq9b
Companies suggestion (fried the SSR): https://ibb.co/nOyTvG

The controller purchased: http://www.dwyer-inst.com/Product/Temperature/ProcessControllers/Series32B

I did try straight wiring the heating element and a power lead into the nodes 9 and 10 and the controller heated the elements... kind of. The controller was set in PID mode and set to 500F to heat up from 70F (the companies suggestion). The temp in the oven reached about 230 and never got any hotter (still clicks and pulsed on and off, but no increase in temp). 

The SSR and oven work jusr fine with the previous PID controller installed (none ramp/soak one) and the original wiring layout is what I have been using for years. Not sure if this particular style PID calls for a different set up or if maybe the controller itself is defected. Also the SSR is just a standard SSR-40A (24~380VAC / 3~32DC).

If anyone has any advice I would be very appreciative! Would love to get this working, but if not may have to return it an try a different brand/ model.  

Thanks you again!

82,4160 Isolation Transformer,1511973556,"I have a question regarding a 4160 isolation transformer.

The current setup is 13.8kv to 4160 step down transformer feeding a VFD. The VFD is then fed to an isolation transformer, then to a 4160V motor. There is also a bypass for the VFD but i am not sure how it is connected.

The issue is, i looked at the plate of the transformer and it said 4160-2300.... I am 99% sure it is feeding 4160.

Also i believe we are hooked up to BOTH the secondary feeds off this transformer. It has a primary feed delta, then one Delta and one Wye secondary. I believe both are hooked up and then only one feed hits the motor.

Has anyone seen something like this? 

I am replacing the VFD and will be removing the isolation transformer as it is now not needed. I am removing the bypass switch and just going 13.8kv to 4160 to VFD to Motor. I am concerned that i plan on putting 4160 on the motor. The motor is rated for it but could be wired differently.

94,Launching a parachute using pyrotechnics,1511935903,"I want to launch a small (250g) parachute from a tube using pyrotechnics. I need to select a propellant that is reliable and stable over a wide range of temperatures (call it -40C to 80C), nontoxic, insensitive to shock and ideally can be reliably detonated electronically without the use of a primary explosive.

The goal is for everything to be lightweight, so I want a slow enough propellant that it won't damage a lightweight tube or the chute. I assume that the propellant charge should be shaped to achieve the flattest possible pressure profile during the launch. i.e. if it is really fast and the pressure spikes before the parachute moves, it could damage things, but presumably it could be shaped so that the rate of gas production increases quadratically in time, or there could be multiple sequenced charges of quadratically increasing size.

I'd like to mathematically model this, buy or produce the propellant charge, and safely test it. So, my questions are:

- Are there free/open tools available to model this? I am proficient in sympy/scipy/matplotlib (which offer a lot of functionality that is similar to matlab) for scientific computing.

- If a low explosive is selected, how should I model the propagation of deflagration through the propellant? Presumably this won't matter for a high explosive.

9,"Cleaning cloride contaminated steam, what options do I have?",1511892344," I work in an industry were steam contaminated with clorides is comon as a byproduct of the reaction of the components used in the composition of our products. This causes a lot of issues on the plant as condesation, leading to wet and slippery surfaces, and the concentration of clorides in the steam causes corrosion in everything metallic. I am trying to find a solution to this problem by capturing the steam, but it can't be released to the atmosphere, so I need to find a way to treat it. Best Idea so far (maybe not the cheapest in running costs) is bubbling the steam trough a water tank, this way the contaminated water could be reused in the production of the product also. Main concern is to stop the clorides and steam condensation, not any other polutants. At this stage I am only looking for options in tackling this problem.
 Any help is much appreciated.

10,Advice on BS Mechanical Engineering Emphasis,1511892216,"Hi there! So currently, I’m on track to graduate in May 2019 with a BS Mechanical Engineering, a BA German for Business &amp; Professions, and minors in military science (Army ROTC Cadet) and economics.

BA: When I transferred to my school, they had just stopped offering a BA German due to lack of enrollment. The compromise was to get a business minor (Econ for me) and a German minor, and they’ll add up to a bachelors degree.

Since there is no overlap between course requirements of my two degrees and college is also about exploring and taking classes that interest, the following sounds like my plan

+ I’m fluent in German. Drop the BA to a minor and get “proof of competency” elsewhere (e.g. the military language test). Now we’re at a BS with triple minor

+ All the classes I want to take revolve around technical communication—grant writing, intellectual property, etc. My college offers the ability to emphasize (albeit informally simply by taking the classes you want to specialize in [Ex. those interested in biomechanical engineering would take anatomy and physiology]). I’d like to emphasize in technical communication, but I’m worried about selling myself short. I’m currently slated to take Advanced Machine Design, Intro to Robotics, and Mechatronics as my electives. Additionally, those three electives are all areas I’m exploring working in or getting a masters in after graduation

+ My overall career goals are as follows:

 * Undergrad

 * Fly helicopters for the Army in the National Guard while working as a mech. engr. at a defense/aerospace company

 * MBA in Energy Management

 * Some masters in engineering (most heavily considering mechatronics or aerospace)

 * PhD in Energy Economics

+ I’m very entrepreneurial and know that I either want to end up in management in some defense engineering company or start my own.

Questions

1. Does it make sense to ditch the BA German? Does it even help me in the career field? It’s partially bragging rights of double-majoring, but also validation that I know German.

2. Would I be doing myself a disservice trying to emphasize in technical communication when that is a skill much easier learned outside of university than engineering?

Thanks!

13,120V PTC thermistor to raise temp from ~65F to ~82F,1511883997,"Hi all-
Novice here, trying to pursue an idea I've had burning for a couple of years now. Tried to sum it up in the title. I'm trying to come up with a cheap way to bring the temperature of a small (~5 cm diameter, 2 mm thick) heating plate from room temperature (roughly 62 - 72° F) up to about 82° F, +/- 5° F. It is important that the temperature not rise much about ~87° F. It would be strongly preferable for the device to run on 110 VAC.

I was thinking that a PTC thermistor would be the most cost effective way to do this. I've torn apart quite a few coffee-cup warmers, mini-crock-pots, etc., and I seem to see the vast majority of them use a length of resistance wire (~.8 - 1.1 kΩ). I've yet to get my hands on one that uses a PTC thermistor, but ""bigclivedotcom"" did disassemble one in this video. I like that it regulates the current based on the temperature, providing less heat as the temperature rises. I'd really rather not have this heating plate running at full tilt when the desired ΔT is only a few degrees, as it would potentially overheat the plate.

I estimate that about 3 - 10 watts will be the maximum power draw do achieve this ΔT. This is based on a rough approximation, where I used a fixed resistance 17 watt coffee-cup warmer to do a similar task. I had to add several layers of insulation in order to bring the temperature down from ~ 100° F to 80° F.

I'd really appreciate any direction from this community as to possible approaches to this task. I'm happy to do lots of research on my own, but I'm in that nasty situation where, ""I don't know what I don't know"", and I could use a bit of guidance. I might be barking entirely up the wrong tree.

however, when it comes to torque, the equation is Torque x RPM / 5252

what exactly are the units here? doing unit analysis, i get units of (ft x lbf x rad) /min or hp*rad....

67,I need to analyse computer vision data from a retail store. Am thinking it would require a statistical model but am looking for some direction.,1511674648,"First off, sorry if wrong thread. I feel like it could be /r/dataanalysis, but it seems that there is not enough traffic there to really get an answer. My problem is as follows:

   * We have some facial recognition cameras in a few stores in AZ that are collecting data from people who work there.
   * The data appears in the form of *face events*. So if a camera recognises a person, then it sends data in the form of (faceNumber, date). So if it sees person 38 at 12:00 on 9/12 then the data will look like: (38, 9/12 12:00)
   * I need to collate the events and find out how long each employee has worked.

**THE PROBLEM**

Ideally I could just go through each day and use (endTime - startTime) for the total time worked. But this has proven to be ineffective, as there is a ~5% error rate in recognition, and it is also likely that some people are **not in the store the entire time**. ie they are seen once, then leave, then come back to finish their shift.

What I want to do is provide a kind of confidence. ie take the (endTime - startTime) but then provide confidence based on how many times that person was actually seen during that time:

   * So if a person was only seen at 1:00pm then at 6:00pm, it would be low confidence

   * If a person was seen at 1:00pm, 3:30pm, 4:42pm, 6:00pm, then it would be a higher confidence.

I used to use linear rules to find out if a person was in the store. Ie if they're not seen every 1 hour then they are not there. But humans are too chaotic to actually rely on this, and the data came back with huge holes in it.

What kind of statistical methods do I need to employ be resilient against this? I can't really take a ratio because there is **no limit to the amount of times that some people are seen**, ie some people are seen every 1 minute for 8 hours. Other people are seen every 20 minutes. Some people are seen once every 4 hours.

Is there a model that I can use that will be resilient to the varying nature of employee data?",AskEngineers,sucksatmostthings,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7fkyuo/i_need_to_analyse_computer_vision_data_from_a/

70,Technical vs. Management Career Choice Advice,1511664624,"**I am posting this to ask for advice on an age old potential career opportunity, particularly from experienced engineers: to stay technical (at least for now) or become a manager?** I don’t have many senior mentors to ask that worked for more than the company at which I am currently employed. I’ll list what I think may be some relevant details for my particular situation along with some questions I’ve been struggling with. Posting as a throwaway since some co-workers know of my main account.  
&amp;nbsp;

**I am a mechanical engineer (BS) in the US and have been working at my chemical manufacturing plant for 5 years since college.** I moved to a reliability role less than a year ago and was surprised to find how much I enjoy it: I finally have a boss that believes in technical development (i.e. follows up promises with allowing me to spend time and money on it) and a fun, supportive team that is much more experienced than I, meaning I learn something new every day. I am now accountable for almost every type of mechanical equipment I can think of. I think I’ve learned more in the last few months than I have my entire career combined. To me this seems to be a great role as I thought the process and equipment would be more translatable to other companies/industries when I choose to leave my current company (the process equipment in my previous roles were fairly unique to my company’s industry).  
&amp;nbsp;

After a recent company reorganization (insert frustration here), a leadership role managing a large number of people opened up for which I am strongly suited. I have very good rapport with the hiring manager who is extremely personable and trustworthy; while the reorg brings a lot of role ambiguity he said he would give me autonomy and flexibility to shape my team towards our goals as long as we deliver results, something I assume is a rare freedom. There has been a lot of drama tied to this process area through the last year; while the hiring manager promised to try and return it to some sense of normalcy, I still believe this will be a stressful role for some time. I will have no technical mentorship and was told I wouldn’t be able to pursue technical development opportunities (reasonably told I would need to focus on leading my team). I don’t believe this process area has anywhere near the amount of translatable equipment to other industries compared to my current role, but I don't know how much this matters. While I am a very strong believer of being able to make your own technical growth opportunities (especially outside of work), I have been doing that for the last 5 years and know it is much harder to uncover valuable experiences…frankly life, friends, family make the available amount of time quite small if you can’t get it within the 40+ hr/week work portion.  
&amp;nbsp;

Because of the reorg, I do not believe a leadership role would again be available for years, let alone one that properly suits my skillset. I probably would need to move on to another company if I wanted to pursue management in the near future. I don’t exactly have a defined career plan; I enjoy solving problems via new challenges with a fun team, preferably in an industry I believe has some positive societal impact (aka the white whale). That being said, I don’t feel competitive or feel absolutely driven to be a manager. I would like to try it one day because I enjoy helping other people grow and reach their goals, particularly because I struggled so much for my own mentorship. I believe I’d be happy staying an individual contributor and/or influencer as long as I was taking on new challenges. Probably important to note that money is not a core value of mine and doesn’t factor into the decision. Finally, my significant other will be graduating also with a mechanical degree in less than 2 years. While we have no concrete plans, we believe we will eventually move on to a new area/company as we don’t see much long term career growth potential through my company. While we are still researching what is out there, I believe we would pursue another manufacturing industry though not necessarily at a chemical plant.  
&amp;nbsp;


All of the background info on the table, I have few questions I’d greatly appreciate some feedback on my questions below as well as any other advice:

- Have any of you regretting being a manager? Or staying a technical contributor? 

- I worry taking a management role ‘too early’ could hinder me long term, especially if I decide the management track isn’t for me. Is the ‘use it or lose it’ fear valid here in terms of mechanical discipline? 

- How common/difficult is it to be hired externally into a leadership position? Would I have to ‘earn my stripes’ again? I am trying to research job postings on my own to get a feel for this as well 

- Would it be unethical for me to take a leadership role knowing there’s a good chance I will leave the company in 1-3 years? 

- Does anyone have good experience or advice for how to set work/life balance boundaries as a manager at a 24/7 plant?

The design changed thanks to help from some members here. 

What I bought still needed some modifications to accommodate my disability a little better and some of it involves moving joints (just a small hydraulic piston to tilt the table). While I did learn a bit about bearings through shaft design in school I have not used that stuff in a while.

I have kept my textbooks physical and pdf. I was looking at the bearing section on how to figure out the bearings I need. Sure enough I figured it out with my forces and stuff and I have a max force of about 4000lbf.

I looked online and it's pretty hard to find dealers who give specifications. Just dimensions, material and lube type. The ones I did find are not strong enough with a max load of 14kn.

I also looked at bushings which do give specs and far exceed my max load no matter what units they used. Problem is Mott and shigley textbooks don't have bushing analysis like they do for plane surface and roller bearings.

If you bothered to read my old man story/background or not the questions are here.

Can anyone please direct me to bearing dealers who provide all specs?

Are there any resources for bushing analysis you can direct me to?

For a hydraulic piston joints which is better to use bushings or roller bearings or plane surface bearings? Why? I assume plane surface are bad choice due to size and price.

98,Visualizing Fixed/Pin Connections,1511485742,"Please see sketch as reference to my questions: [Shitty paint sketch](https://imgur.com/a/GUV2p)

Here I am illustrating a common connection used in structural steel design, where an angle is bolted to a beam, and that assembly is attached to a column. Per typical design procedure, both would be considered pin connections.

In the case on the left I can conceptually understand how rotation is free to occur at the ends. However, regarding the case on the right: 

- How come a force couple wouldn't develop between the fasteners? Does the fact that holes are slightly larger than bolts mean rotation can still occur, because in this context rotation is very small?


- If my thought on the previous point makes sense, what if the angles were attached to the beam by a weld instead of a bolt?

The primary reason this is bugging is because if I were to take a case where I had a vertical point load (P) applied at the center of the beam, the reactions at the end would be P/2. So now I can design the connection for a shear reaction of P/2. But if in reality there is some resistance to rotation, then wouldn't there be additional shear on the connection?

8,corporate part number conventions,1511453283,"hey all, 

got a question about part number suffix control at _your_ companies.

I've been employed in places that used typically non-significant dash numbering i.e. -001 through -0nn, where nn signifies the major versions of the product. 

also, where inseparable items were identified as 100 series dash numbers (i.e. -101 leg, -102 gussets, -103 work surface, etc)

other places I've been have used -300 series numbers for bought items

other places I've been have had G01 items to identify ""groups/assemblies"", and H01 to identify specific hardware items.

I've heard of places using -500 for end items...

my current cadre of coworkers uses terribly significant numbering systems. tube assemblies of a given length carrying a dash number for overall length and whatnot, rather than simple identification- this makes class I change item number changes difficult because the numbers are already assigned. etc.

14,Career Transition Advice,1511417505,"I graduated with a 3.1 in Mech. Eng. this May 2017 but with no internships due to poor networking &amp; only a handful of class &amp; senior design projects. After job hunting for 3.5 months like a buffoon, I'm currently working at a construction company as a technician doing tedious CAD work that requires little to no critical thinking. I've been working there for almost 3 months.

Don't wanna get into specifics, but lets just say that I no longer see a future working in this company. I feel as if I’m not growing as an engineer &amp; career wise. Lately, I've been feeling a bit sad about my situation. Like...is this all I'm capable of? What did I bust my ass for 5 years for?

I browse job searching websites just for kicks, and I see hundreds of internships/entry-level positions. I feel that with each passing day, more opportunities are slipping by by NOT applying to them.

While I am eternally grateful for this job, I am curious about exploring other engineering fields as well such as manufacturing and quality control. Honestly…I don’t know what to do right now.

So here’s my question:

- Do I continue to stick to this job? And if so, for how long before I can begin job hunting on the side?

- Would you recommend that I use recruiters?

- Do I still include any relevant class projects/courses like my senior design project?

- On the offset that I do get another job, is it wise to leave my full time job &amp; accept an engineering internship (something that would look extremely unusual on my resume)?

Also...lets take 2 basic spur gears. If ALL their characteristics remain the same except for another set with a greater number of teeth, will those gears be more durable?

23,Interpretation of the Bode Plot/LTI systems?,1511366886,"Let me start off this question with my current understanding of the Bode plot:
With an LTI system, input sine waves can only be transformed via an amplification factor and a phase shift. The Bode plot shows the amplification and phase shift for any input sine wave for all frequencies.
Ergo, if I take a simple stable LTI transfer function, e.g. P(s) = 20/(s^2 + 9), the output frequency should match the input frequency, just with a phase shift and amplification based off the value I look up.
If I take the Bode Plot of this system, I see a positive magnitude and a 0 degree phase shift for w = 1 rad/sec. However, if I go into Simulink and input a 1 rad/sec sine wave into this transfer function, the output signal isn't a simple sine wave, but a signal made of the summation of several sine waves operating at different frequencies. This behavior is apparent at several other frequencies as well (.5 rad/s, 2 rad/s, etc) 
What am I missing here? Is this a Simulink issue, or is this a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of Bode plots/LTI systems? ",AskEngineers,xamination,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7es0cj/interpretation_of_the_bode_plotlti_systems/

I understand that when the bullet is fired from the gun, an equal force is applied to the entire firearm and thus on the shooters hand. Since the barrel is off-centre from the grip, this force causes a torque around the shooters grip, causing the gun to be pointing at a different location from before.

32,How to say no to a prospective Engineering job found through a recruiter?,1511293888,"Hello,

I am an Mech.Eng working in the HVAC controls field. I've been with my current company for 3 years. I was approached by a recruiter and asked to come in for an interview with a different company in a similar position to the one I have currently. I went through two interviews with the new company and have since received a job offer from that new company. With the salary and bonus of the new company I would be making a substantial amount more than I am currently. 

The problem, however, is that the new company is looking for someone for at least a three year commitment. I am not very interested in staying in the HVAC industry and I know 3 more years in this field would make it even harder to leave. I am also working on getting enrollment to a masters and am awaiting reply on my application. 

I would like to turn down the new job, however I don't want to burn any bridges with the new company or the recruiter if possible. The recruiter called me after the offer was sent and made it clear that she nor the new company would appreciate me having used this whole thing as a way to gain leverage at my current company for a raise. ""It would be scummy"" were her words. 

I was wondering if my above reasons (wanting to leave the industry, going back for a masters) are likely to cause a similar reaction in the recruiter and the new company or if they are good reasons to give for turning down the new job without burning any bridges.

Edit: Thanks for the responses everyone, given me a lot to think about. Mainly that recruiters should go fuck themselves.

34,MBA or M.Eng. in Renewable Energy Sector,1511290855,"Hi all,

I am a Civil Engineering grad that is working on the construction of Wind Farms for a contractor as a Project Engineer. My experience is on the Project Management side of the business. My short term goal is to work for a renewable energy developer as a analyst and ultimately become a portfolio manager. My long term goal is to own and operate my own development firm for Renewable Energy projects. I want to be sure this is the right path forward as well. I want to be sure I am moving in the right direction within the Renewable Energy industry.  

I am in need of advise on how to have the most positive impact. My definition of success is to have a positive impact on the world. Doing well financially through the completion of this goal is a bonus. I am applying for MBA programs and I am writing the GMAT exam this thursday. 

Recently, I have been listening to a lot of podcasts and reading biographies of many individuals who are successful in the renewable energy field. Founders of SunPower, Tesla, etc. Many of these individuals do not have formal business training during the early stages of their careers and used their techinical background to innovate and advance the technology. Though they are highly technical individuals. They brought in MBA's after starting their business' to help with growth. 

I am starting to doubt my decision of pursuing my MBA. I will recieve no company sponsorship for it. I am now starting to consider a masters in engineering in renewable energy instead. Through the process of working to attain certificates and education in the sector to advance my knowledge, I have stumbled upon a online M.Eng. program offered by the University of Michigan called Master of Engineering in Energy Systems. Battery technologies are definetly the next ""big thing"", and this might help push me in that direction. 

As an additional note, the MBA programs that I am considering are Indiana University Kelley's online MBA and ASU's online MBA. I have also been looking at UNC's Sustainability MBA, however, it is nearly double the cost of the other two MBA programs.

UM MEng: 25k
ASU MBA: 50k
IU MBA: 60k
UNC MBA: 95k

37,MEng the right choice??,1511284282,"I'd like to start by saying that I'm a third year MechSE undergrad thinking about graduate school. I am not set on any path just yet. Part of me wants to get the heck out of school and make some money. Much of what I hear about the workforce is the extensive free time and quality of life increase. Although engineering school has provided many friendships and learning experiences, I'm feeling more than ready for the next step. The bs that goes on throughout my coursework drives me insane. I'm ready to go out and live my life. 

The other half of me feels that it would be a great idea to pursue a graduate degree of some sort. While undergrad was a no-brainer, I understand that everyone has a different opinion on graduate school and it's largely based on personal experiences. Some have told me that an MEng is a ""useless"" degree since an MS with thesis provides more valuable experience. However I have no interest in hanging around for an extra two years and spending countless hours writing a thesis I don't care much about. If I were to get a graduate degree it would likely be an MEng or a non-thesis MS on a long shot. At my school I can theoretically finish an MEng in only one extra year. I should add that I have no interest in academia whatsoever. My goal is to join the workforce and maybe work my way up to a management position or start my own company when I get tired of the engineering work. 

My reasons for getting a Master's are twofold. One is the obvious pay increase both initially and over the course of my career. The other is that I would theoretically start in a higher position and move up the corporate ladder faster. I fear that just a BS would lead me to being ""stuck"" in positions I'm more than ready to move up and out of, just because of my title.

The other option is to get an MEng while working full-time. While this seems like a great compromise from a financial standpoint, I wouldn't want to do this if I have to spend most evenings and weekends over the course of several years to complete the degree. If this is the case with the workload, I would rather just stick it out in school the extra year, but I have no idea if my assumptions about this case are true.

Everything I've read so far says that going for a graduate degree just for the money is a bad idea, however it only makes sense. Investing one year of my life is nothing if I will have 10k extra per year to do whatever I want with. However I've been ready to get out of school since I started. I don't hate it, but I certainly don't love it either. 

I suppose that I could also leave the workforce at any time for an MBA if I'm wanting a change of pace, but I would rather get my degrees while I'm young so that I don't have to make much harder sacrifices throughout my adult life.

The question is how does one start to calculate the max inner diameter I can open up all the bolt holes to before it cannot carry the weight of the inlet any more. I decided to use the methods in the Air Force Stress Analysis manual where I simplified each bolt hole to a simple lug with the same dimensions from the attach ring. Would this be a valid way to approach this kind of problem or is there something I'm not thinking about?

- accuracy 0.1 to 0.2 °C

- range something like 0 to 50 °C

- price as low as possible

- robust mechanical design (so the sensor can reliably sustain little bit of mechanical stress &lt;user installation, a lot of years of service in water tank&gt;)

- It would be nice if the sensor would require as little circuitry and/or sw handling as possible

77,What's the relation between Q=U*A*LMTD and Q=Cp*deltaT*m,1511178044,"I have the current problem:
(All situations are counter flow)
HX situation 1

Water|Air                     
:--|:--                                  
80°C|-10°C     // A row
60°C|22°C
1384kg/h| 3000m³/h
32.3kW | 32.3 kW

There is a HX dimensioned at 80°/60°C 235.7kg/h waterflow (~32.3kW) and that's sufficient to heat air from -10° to 22°C at 3000m³/h. (~32.3kW). (This is information given by the company supplying the HX)

I want the calculate the same information for the following situations:
**At what water temperatures xx°C/xx°C and what flow rate I can heat up 3000m³/h of air from 16.56°C to 22°C.

So in this example what will the flowrate be when I heat with 60/40 and 55/35.** 
HX Situation 2

Water|Air                    
:--|:--                                  
60°C|16.56°C     // A row
40°C|22°C
?(0.235.7kg/h)| 3000m³/h
?(5.5kW) | 5.5kW

HX Situation 3

Water|Air                     
:--|:--                               
55°C|16.56°C     // A row
35°C|22°C
?(0.235.7kg/h)| 3000m³/h
?(5.5kW) | 5.5kW

Now If I simply use Q=  Cp*deltaT*m for both situations and assume the Q for the waterflow is the same as the Q for air flow, I get 0.235.7 kg/h for both water flows.
Which is odd, because LMTD for each situation is different. So shouldn't the flow for situation 2 be lower because it has a higher LMTD?

So I know the method I used is wrong, but what would the correct method be. 
Edit:
(I don't have access to the heat transfer coefficient U of the HX for different flow/T)

91,"When building a band saw mill, there are two major design principles. the majority seems to move the saw and keep the log fixed, minority moves the log and keeps saw fixed. I don't see the benefit of moving the saw and not the log. Can someone help explain this to me?",1511130270,"Hi,

I've been toying with the idea of building a band saw mill to cut up logs into timber. Not because I need one (or because I have logs) but because I like the  challenge and a friend actually has the logs and wants a saw mill, so why not.

I looked around a lot and there are many different DIY band saw mills, as the basic principle is not that difficult to build. There seems to be two distinct principles in building these.

1. The majority seems to be building the ""woodmizer""-type. A set of rails, in between the log is mounted and stays fixed. The band saw is then moved horizontally along these rails and there is a second mechanism to adjust the height of the saw blade.

2. The minority puts the saw on fixed vertical posts, and adds some kind of mechanism to adjust the height of the saw. The log goes on one or two very simple railway-cars with two loosely spinning wheels, no brakes, no mechanism to power the wheels (sorry, english is not my native language, pretty sure these train-things have a special name - could it be ""bogey""?) 

The one major difference is that the first ""woodmizer"" design could be mobile because it could be mounted on a trailer. Just the rails have to stay level and parallel and the rails can be shorter, compared to the maximum log length. 

**Maximum Log length with Type1 and Type2**

* The length of the rails with the Type1 design is only max_log_length + saw_mill_assembly_length
* The length of the rails of the Type2 design is 2 * max_log_length + saw_mill_assembly_length
 
**Assumptions**
if you build a sawmill, you are most likely a home owner and have most likely no need to have a mobile saw mill. If you are a homeowner with a forest (aka Logs) you most likely have the space for much longer rails. 

**Design thoughts on Type2:**
One would be getting rid of a lot of potential sources of wobble, play and calibration, by keeping the delicate saw mill assembly fixed. The rails could be as simple as two (thick-ish) L-Profiles and some pieces of steel welded inbetween them.
Also Type2 does not need ""outriggers"" to stop the sawmill from tipping, it just stays vertical, which makes the variable ""saw_mill_assembly_length"" a lot smaller then a Type1 design.

Fixing the band saw in place is really just the digging of a hole, put a post in, pour concrete around it, done. No movement, no tipping.

If you are having a static saw mill, the longer rails are not really a problem, because that is really cheap to aquire and might even be helpful when moving logs around. You may even extend the rails between your stack of woods.

The railway-cars could be DIYd as well, and they dont really need a lot of precision, and could be rather crudely assembled from scraps, except for the bearing and axle. Also I dont yet have a good source for the train wheels.

This whole thought process started after I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7afdCXvZ0

I really think that the person that made the design in the video is up to something and this could really be the more economical, simpler and robust design for a homemade saw mill. 

**Question**

Could some real engineer please put in some thoughts on this? Is it bullshit? did i forgot something? 

Could it be that the majority of the people who build a woodmizer-style sawmill would actually be better off not building that design, given that they are planning to keep it static and not mobile and that they actually have the space for double the amount of rails for a given maximum log length?",AskEngineers,ijon_cbo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7e41by/when_building_a_band_saw_mill_there_are_two_major/

93,"Pump NPSHA, NPSHR, and Total Verses Static Pressure Head",1511124362,"Hello all,

I have a question regarding ensuring that a selected pump  and piping configuration has sufficient NPSHA that has come up in my studies. From my research people on the internet don't seem to agree on the answer.

First, I noticed that in the NPSHA formula (as I learned it) we add the pressure head and the velocity head at the pressure inlet, and then we subtract the vapour pressure of the fluid being pumped. To me this seems inconsistent with the physical phenomenon as it appears that we are calculating a total head (including velocity head) whereas the phenomenon of cavitation is (as far as I can tell) dependent on the pressure of a fluid, not the total pressure (e.g. cavitation is not affected by the velocity of a fluid). 

I think it is possible that this is explained by the way the NPSHR is calculated by the manufacturer, as the NPSHA is then compared to the NPSHR as per the pump manufacturer, with the NPSHA needing to be larger than the NPSHR. So this may mean that we don't necessarily need to be consistent with the physical situation as long as we are consistent with the manufacturer and they are correlating stagnation pressure with cavitation.

Can anybody help explain why the velocity head is included in the NPSHA calculation even though cavitation is dependent on pressure (excluding velocity head)?

I have hypothesized some possible reasons why:

1. The pump manufacturers are measuring total pressure (e.g. stagnation pressure with a pitot tube) in their experiments. This means that if they don't go to the effort of removing the addition of velocity head to their result (at what pressure the pump will cavitate) we need to add the velocity head to be consistent. This makes sense to me as it makes sense that the velocity head may have an effect on cavitation despite not affecting the actual pressure at the location it is measured. For example, perhaps a pump with a very high inlet velocity head will be less likely to cavitate as more of the velocity head will be converted to pressure head if the fluid slows in the pump.

2. There is some sort of assumption wherein the fluid is assumed to achieve the stagnation/total pressure in the pump. For example, the fluid reaches a point of zero (or close) velocity in the pump impeller (where, I assume, cavitation will occur) and so the velocity head is converted to pressure head, making it appropriate that we add the velocity head when examining cavitation using the total pressure. This doesn't make a ton of sense to me as it does not seem correct to assume the fluid has a low velocity in the pump impeller (mass conservation, and all that).

Can anyone shed some light on this for me?

See http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=186781 for a related discussion.

Please note that I am aware that the magnitude of the velocity head is small and can generally be neglected - I still would like to figure out why it theoretically  impacts the NPSHA when it doesn't directly affect cavitation.",AskEngineers,jwilts26,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7e3cgp/pump_npsha_npshr_and_total_verses_static_pressure/

5,Should I finish my ME bachelor?,1511102386,"I studied ME in Canada for 2 years starting in 2013. I wanted to get involved with some hands on projects, namely the SAE projects, but quickly learned about all the politics and other problems that made it difficult to get involved for students not in their final year. 


After my second year, I started an internship in Germany (one year term) but I felt miserable and things went downhill and by the 3rd month, I left the company but stayed in Germany. I had this strong drive to study in Germany even before I left Canada but funds were tight and I didn't have enough money for a visa.


I moved to Berlin and it was my intention to find a different internship and save money for the visa/residence permit. Fast forward to May 2017, I still didn't have enough money for the visa, didn't find an internship and had overstayed my welcome in Germany. I got my German up to a level where I could study and after applying, I was already invited for an entrance exam at the TU Berlin. I thought it would be safer to apply for the visa from Canada, so I had booked a trip back.


The plans I had for the visa quickly fell through mainly because I still didn't have the financial backing. I re-enrolled at the university where I started but soon dropped out again. I had not seen the material for a long time and it was too sharp of a transition. I impulsively booked a trip back to Germany and thought I would figure things out there. Some of my family was very against that and it started to feel like hell was turning loose.


Now I have applied to see if my credits would transfer to a university where my family lives. My main concern is that I will run into the same dissatisfaction as when I started in the first place. 


Over the past year, I have been learning to code and have taken several courses on Udacity, including Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation and Intro to Self Driving Cars (currently taking). I fear that most of the material that is being taught in ME is not relevant and not preparing me for a career in the automotive industry, and that my time might be better spent learning online. I think the automotive industry will change more in the next 5 years than it has in the last two decades. 


There are many details I have not included, but I don't want to write a novel here so I hope this gives people enough of a picture. The rate of development of AI, particularly with Deep Learning makes me very anxious.  I am also concerned about the additional debt I will have if I keep studying at university.

18,Question about interpretation of Nusselt number (specifically the characteristic length),1511018193,"I'm trying to understand the interpretation of the Nusselt number. Internet search reveals a lot of explanations like ""the ratio of convective heat transfer to conduction through a hypothetical stationary fluid"". They will say something like for convection Q_dot''=h(T_surf-T_infinity) and for conduction though a hypothetical stationary fluid Q_dot''=k/L(T_surf-T_infinity). Then they will ratio those two expressions and show that it is the Nusselt number.

&amp;nbsp;

What I am struggling to understand is the role of the characteristic length. Take a flat plate as an example. The length we use is along the direction of flow. However, the conduction through the hypothetical stationary fluid would not be long that direction. Basically my question is: how can we make sense of the characteristic length we are using for Nusselt in the context of these simple interpretations.

&amp;nbsp;

Wikipedia and several other sources say things like ""Selection of the characteristic length should be in the direction of growth (or thickness) of the boundary layer"" but don't provide any guidance of why this makes sense in the context of the physical interpretation.

I’ve never really even had experience soldering or making anything while he’s an engineering wizard. I think this is a great project for me to learn on but I need help.

The scooter is an [m5](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ecoreco-m5-electric-scooter-black/4780600.p?skuId=4780600&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ksid=e58f6372-7a73-4dff-b724-6007e96916c2&amp;ksprof_id=14&amp;ksaffcode=pg245768&amp;ksdevice=c&amp;lsft=ref:212,loc:2) eco reco. They go for about 1k but with the parts I’ve found it could be fixed for $100. 



The motor is brushless and 300 watts. The battery is fried so we have some 36 volt hoverboard batteries that should work. The motor controller that comes with it won’t work with anything but the battery eco reco sells and they charge almost $400 for it. I found one on [eBay](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rhlqmz5urp4g304/Screenshot%202017-11-17%2015.33.39.png?dl=0)  that comes with a throttle to simplify things. 

Diagram of motor [controller](https://www.dropbox.com/s/786ht9c2l930web/Screenshot%202017-11-17%2015.33.43.png?dl=0) 

 So the battery one would connect to the battery (which is the same connector or does it get changed? My brother says the connectors are arbitrary and can be cut off and the wires can just be soldered together) and the hall lines is the hall sensor by the motor, the throttle plug pictured plugs in there too and the motor connects as well. How does the speed get changed? in the picture of the original motor controller there were some speed plugs but I don’t understand.

The original charger was three pins xlr. I’m looking for a charger thats 36 volts and preferably 4 amps. I’m not sure how these batteries wired together would be converted to work with a charger say [like](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lrmsnt29qryx5nk/Screenshot%202017-11-17%2015.18.02.png?dl=0)

He said I could wire the xt60 connectors to the three pin style. 

I’m wondering if I’m on the right track and if anyone has any guidance on how to complete this. Any advice helps.

35,"Pivoting from my current role, where should I go?",1510962314,"Hey guys,

  I need some career direction advice here. I have a few years under my belt in aerospace. My role now is a hardware integration and test engineer. My job is to design test bed systems(electrical, software) and integrate them with oscilloscopes, power supplies, etc to test with flight hardware. 

Recently I had a talk with my manager on my career path and he encouraged me to explore other fields in the company. My company has a huge array of disciplines of engineering so I really want to take this chance to branch out.

 At one end of the spectrum, I want to make a complete jump into the software world, as I feel I can get the most flexibility there in that I can get jobs anywhere. For my current role I feel a bit locked into aerospace and related fields. As an aside, I have a masters in CS, but no industry experience being a fully fledged programmer.

 At the other end of the spectrum, I don't want to just abandon my current background/experience. I'd like to build on top of what I have. Otherwise, wouldn't I almost start over as a junior engineer?

Here are my current choices:

-become a software test engineer for flight systems, still leverages my hardware test experience. From there I can pivot further if needed

-My master was in machine learning and computer vision, which I have interests in, but it is really a field full of phd's at my company. I can look for opportunities there in robotics. I have experience building prototype robots and integrating the systems, that could be a pull-in to doing more comp-sci work.

-go into systems engineering, I have touched and learned a lot of systems and do plenty of subsystems engineering already

-software developer for non-hardware related roles. All projects have some need for software. Not much relevance to what I do now. I have software development experience, but not at the same level/skill of a fulltime developer. 

I have interests in doing all of the above. But I am also concerned about the marketability of these skills. I do not want to be boxed in. 

What should I consider?

I also posted this in electronics and had some very friendly answers. Was told it would still be better suited in a different sub.

Please go easy on me, not an engineer. A couple years back I built an adjustable desktop standing desk for work. It's simple, but a couple others at work have asked me to build them one. They are smaller women and the task of lifting the top half of the desk several times a day is not feasible for them. I thought adding a dc motor with linkages and an arm would be nice to make it lift. Got the idea from this guy who built an [ultimate useless machine](http://users.rcn.com/ted.johnson/umach.htm). Pics at bottom of the page.

The top half being lifted is probably no more than 25-30 lbs including the wood/keyboard tray/two monitors. I was thinking a dc motor with a load for at least 50 lbs would be safe. But when I started searching around for motors, they don't seem to be rated by max load. There are so many variants, how do I know which motor will work for my application? What kind of Volts/Amps/Rpms should I be looking at? Right now the desk costs about $75 in parts. Would like to keep this price down as much as low as possible. 

Does this all sound feasible to you guys? Please feel free to point out any obvious flaws in the plan. Thanks

What I would like to do with the motor addition:

-Switch operated - up/down lift

-Plug into regular wall outlet

-Relay that stops the motor once desk reaches full height/reaches the bottom

48,Need To Determine How Thick A Metal Plate Must Be To Resist Deflection -- Not Sure How To Start,1510933113,"For a personal project, I'm building a scale of sorts which uses a metal plate for a base.  The plate will be about 15"" x 20"".

One edge of the plate will be supported by a continuous/piano hinge and the opposite edge will land on the tips of two 200kg button load cells -- the plate can be lifted up off the load cells to get access to some mounting bolts and do cleaning, etc.

The maximum weight/pressure expected on the plate is about 700lbs and will largely be centered on the plate and spread over an area at least 6"" x 6"".

My hope is that with some calibration of known weights I'll be able to get reasonable consistent weight readings from 5lbs to 100lbs in excess of the tare when the weight is placed in approximately the same area of the plate for each measurement.  This is not detail work either, so being off by 5-10lbs isn't an issue.  It's mostly to ""bucket out"" things that are ""light"", ""heavy"", ""too heavy"".

The need to support up to 700lbs is during the loading process of the material.  The duration to support anything over 100lbs is likely only going to be a few seconds at a time.

What I'm trying to determine is how thick the plate needs to be to avoid anything other than trivial deflection during the worst case high weights.

I think that the use of the 200kg load cells should be OK in my case because they have a tolerance of up to 120% FS which would be just over 525lbs, because I have two of them, and the continuous hinge, I don't think that my 700lbs maximum load would be a big issue.

**EDIT : Thank you to everyone who helped me with the ideas -- I've come to the conclusion that 4 load cells will be necessary until something more effective (and also cost reduced) can be put together.  To that end, a simple 1/4"" thick steel plate ought to work fine for my needs -- Thank you again!**",AskEngineers,hmbemis,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7dlr82/need_to_determine_how_thick_a_metal_plate_must_be/

Now, the adapter's output is 29W but in reality the phone, after conversion, is probably charging at about 13-16W max, giving it a conversion efficiency somewhere between 45-55%. Through this, Apple says it goes from 0-50% capacity in 30min. This is an impressive charging speed,  which is the same found with the Samsung Galaxy S7, with a 11.55Whr battery this time, using its own ""adaptive"" fast charging adapter with an output of 15W. This is a tiny bit more than half the output of Apple's adapter, but Samsung's phone, who has a bigger battery, fast charges at the same rate as the iPhone X. Why is this?

However, attending this big school would leave me in $100,000-$150,000 in debt.

 I talked to a professor here at the community college I attend recently who is head of the Mechatronics department. He tells me that some of his students leave with just an associates and get jobs paying 70k a year.

I'm still technically a freshman here, just with some transferred credits.

My question is this: how realistic is his snapshot of Mechatronics? Do people really get jobs that well paying just with an associates from a community college?

Say I go through with the four year plan and head into massive debt. Is an extra 20k a year starting pay worth the extra debt?

Or should I instead do two years here at the community college, leave with 10k debt, and hopefully find a job paying 60k-70k with just an associates?

80,Hoping to reverse engineer the jig used in this video. Looking for some info on bearing options.,1510815483,"https://youtu.be/XdMvo0VEQoE?t=2m46s

I’m trying to recreate this jig used for painting guitars. The body of the guitar is bolted to a plate with a tube extending out. (There’s no technical term for this.) That tube stays attached to the guitar during the finishing process. It fastens to the jig, but also is used for storing the bodies before and after paint. 

My question is, other than some kind of flange bearing that I could slip the tube and in and manually tighten, is there any kind of bearing system that would allow me to easily fit that rod in, and either using pressure, or some kind of quick release, allow it to stay firmly in place and not slide out while I’m spinning it?

In my head I’m imagining something with rows of exposed bearings, that with enough pressure could be compressed inward. This would allow the tube to slipped over them, and the bearings would exert enough pressure on the tube to keep it from easily slipping off during work, but allow it spin freely. 

I’m probably imagining something that doesn’t exist. Would love input from anyone more knowledgeable. Or if there is a sub which would be better suited for this kind of thing, I’d love to be pointed in that direction!!

I apologise for the poor quality of the photos, this thing was in a pub and we were about to sit down and eat an ungodly amount of chips. Priorities.

Apparently it was unearthed in a monastery at some point a hundred or so years ago. On the back it appears to have an illustration of the virgin Mary, or similar. On the ""barrel"" end there is what looks for all the world to be a coupling for a pneumatic or fluid line of some kind, but it has a vent hole in the side with no obvious way of closing it, and it doesn't appear to attach to the rest of the mechanism.

On the ""revolver"" end of it is a rotating drum with in the region of 50 thin metal slides. Each slide seems to connect to a brass pin, which extends out the back. The ring that stabilises those brass pins has writing on, in what I assume to be latin (though I didn't inspect it closely), around the circumference. 

The entire ""barrel"" section seems to slide forwards and backwards, and can be pushed by whichever of the slides on the ""revolver"" end is at the top. It doesn't appear to rotate freely as the plate at the top locks up against the slides. The slides also have little protrusions near the rear of the device, which are not all the same length.

I wish I could provide better photos but was in a bit of a rush. I'm mystified, and so were the others I was with. Is it a music box? Some kind of sewing device? A gattling cannon for mice?
