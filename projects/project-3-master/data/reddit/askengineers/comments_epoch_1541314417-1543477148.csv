0,What to expect for an online masters in engineering?,1543476634,"Got accepted to an online MEng in systems engineering starting this January and I'm starting to get a lot more worried as  the start date approaches and as I look through the first class's textbook in advanced mathematics...

&amp;#x200B;

Graduated in 2013 with a industrial distribution degree (logistics/sales in the field of engineering) so never really buried too deep into engineering during my undergraduate years other than the typical engineering calculus I/II or basic engineering classes... I'm already behind the power curve.

&amp;#x200B;

The grad school I'm attending is purely online and classes (3 credit hours) run 7-weeks at a time.  Wanted to know what to expect with a pace of 7 week classes while working full-time, any recommendations to include useful websites (I will be using Chegg Study and Wolfram Alpha for step by step answers), and anything else insightful from anyone in any field of engineering.

I have no idea what I want to do with my life.

6,Senior ME major in need of some entry level career advice,1543462289,"Hey r/askengineers I've come hoping to receive some advice from you guys regarding the best way to handle a situation professionally.

Background information:
I am graduating in May 2019 with a BSME. I have a little over a year and a half's worth of interning experience in the Aerospace Industry, with roughly 7 months with the company I currently work at - we will call it ""company A"". I have a few friends who interned at company A in the summer of 2017 who are now working as full time engineers after graduating. After speaking with them in terms of salary that they were offered, I found that the salary compensation was not as competitive as I had hoped, so I began applying to many companies all over the United States. I landed a position doing what really interests me (FEA, CFD, Design) with a very large Defense contractor - who I will call ""company B"". The position at company B is only 150 miles from where I work currently in a great city, and the salary is nearly 20% more than what I am expecting to be offered at company A. Along with a 20% greater salary, company B also offers twice the amount towards obtaining a masters degree than company A. Overall, the position at company B interests me more than my current position, provides a larger entry level salary in a great living area, and also provides more money towards a masters degree while still providing me with the same basic benefits that company A is offering. When I first learned of the offer from company B, my boss at company A had notified that there were no open req's currently and that he would like to see where the company was in April closer to my graduation.

The Predicament:
I had one month to accept the offer from company B. With a deadline in mid-November and still no word from my boss at company A, I decided to take the job at company B without mentioning anything to my current boss. I am continuing to work at company A and plan to until the end of my current semester in January. Earlier this week, however, my boss at company A gave me a number for an open req. and asked me to apply so that he could give me a job offer for May. Now I am wondering if I should tell him that I have already accepted a job with company B for x amount of money and to give the req to another applicant, or if I should apply to the job to a) see what company A offers and b) to maintain relationships and still act like I gave company A consideration although in reality I did not. I would really prefer not to burn any bridges but I also do not want to waste anyone's time.

I initially considered attempting to have company A match the offer from company B, but considering they are for different positions and the salary difference is 20%, I did not think this was a viable option. I was also told from two friends that currently work at company A that the entry level salary was non-negotiable, which I am hearing is a common theme for entry level salaries (understandable). Lastly, I would be starting at company A as an associate, while I would be starting at company B as a Level 1.

10,When should I ask for a promotion and a raise?,1543452598,"Howdy folks, 25 year old Mechanical Engineer here, I work for a large defense contractor in the U.S. and I have a BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering. I have been working at this company for a little over 2 years now, and I was hired in as an Engineer II with my Masters. 
During my first year, I contributed quite a bit to several programs but not more than any other competent first year engineer should have, ended up getting a 3.6% raise and a small bonus (which is standard for our company). 
During my 2nd year however, I have been thrust into an incredibly large, expensive, and important program that was behind schedule by about a year. I started developing requirements, procedures, etc at first, but within 4 months I ended up the technical lead for the entire program. This was for 2 reasons I believe: short-staffed and I was absolutely killing it. Now I am running 5 million dollars worth of testing for this program essentially by myself and I have upwards of 4-8 engineers and technicians reporting to me. I spend 6 weeks out in the field at any given time, with no break to go home and working between 70-90 hours a week (no, I don't get paid overtime). I have brought the schedule of this program to the left consistently, hence the extreme hours worked. My wife supports me while I'm gone by saying it'll be worth it, but sometimes is feels like I'm putting in all of this effort for nothing.   

Point of all of this is i'm only 2.5 years out of college, and have the title of Engineer II (junior engineer), but I have the responsibilities of a senior engineer/manager. When should I put my foot down and demand a promotion and considerable bump in pay? Or should I just keep killing it and trust that my company will reward me appropriately?

My last internship was with an automation and controls company (PLCs, SCADA and so on). 


My last internship was so boring that it was physically frustrating to be there, despite being given a large degree of freedom in how to approach tasks I was given, and even being given design work that we deployed on a client's site. I spent the vast majority of my time working in SCADA software and reviewing ladder logic.


My current internship has me rebuilding an asset management database backend (I'm technically building a data mart but that's beside the point) for my team, and then once I've finished that it'll be on to developing a smartphone app to assist field techs in determining compliance regs.


I'm lined up to finish my degree and join the Royal Australian Navy as an engineering officer, but... I'm pretty unsure about it now.

19,Question about viability of using an axial compressor for a turbocharger or supercharger in a car.,1543443264,"Typically, turbochargers generate boost with a centrifugal compressor, and superchargers generate boost with either a centrifugal compressor or with positive displacement methods, such as twin screw / roots blowers. I just had the idea of using an axial compressor, and am wondering if any of you could give me some basic info and tell me what you think about the viability. I didn’t see a whole lot online about it. While I’m not the first one to come up with this idea, not much research seems to have been done into it. So first of all, for an axial compressor scaled down for a car engine, how hard would it be to get rotating? Would the exhaust gases traveling through the turbine of a turbocharger have enough force to rotate the axial compressor? Or should it be set up like a supercharger and be belt-driven? Using the exhaust gases makes good use of kinetic energy that would otherwise be wasted, which is why I’d like to spin it with the exhaust gases, and exhaust gases can get turbos in cars spinning up to 160k rpm, which is faster than most belt driven superchargers. But if the exhaust gases don’t provide enough force to rotate an axial compressor, obviously that method of spinning it wouldn’t be viable. Another large factor in how to rotate it would also be the time it takes to spool up an axial compressor. Compared to a centrifugal compressor, how much laggier would it be? Lastly, the main reason I was interested in using an axial compressor is because, from my understanding, and correct me if I’m wrong, the pressure generated by centrifugal compressors increases as the square of the rpm. So if the rpm is doubled, the pressure is quadrupled. This is why they generate less boost at low rpm and much more at high rpm, resulting in a curved power band. What would the boost   curve of an axial compressor look like as rpm increases? Would it be more linear than a centrifugal compressor? That’s the main thing I’m looking for. From what I’ve read, most are made to operate at a constant rpm, but perhaps it is viable to have one operate effectively and efficiently at different rpm. Also, yes, I’m aware of the fact that they’re more costly than centrifugal compressors and they might be difficult to fit in an engine bay, but I read that they can generate more pressure than a centrifugal compressor, and are more efficient, so perhaps the axial compressor could be made relatively small. Anyways, if any of you know a thing or two about axial compressors or forced induction, any input would be much appreciated!

This is the second time its happened. I don't really have any inductive devices that are kicking off feedback or anything, just one relay which wasn't being used at the time when the supply broke. I even called meanwell to troubleshoot and they couldn't come up with anything.

49,What hardness of bolt and washers I need for stainless steel bolt connection A4-100,1543412449,"Hello, I'm facing trouble and confusion in selecting the proper bolt solution for an application. I'm in Europe but working on international projects based on IEC standards. I need to replace a M8 10.9 steel screws by stainless steel because of corrosion issues. The load on that bolt doesn't allow A4-80, I found some suppliers delivering A4-100 screws that accept the same load as 10.9. But as we bolt two painted aluminum parts together we need to use a stack of one spring washer and one flat washer. The spring one will compensate if the aluminum get slightly compressed over time and the flat one spread the force on a larger surface and prevent the spring washer to damage the paint.

My question is: does the bolt and flat washer be as hard as the screw (that would be 300HV) or can a get lower grade stainless steel for the bolt and for the washer? I would guess that at least the washer doesn't need to be as hard, when it's anyway harder than the aluminum. For the bolt I heard that we need only to calculate that the thread will not tear off but for that we don't need the same hardness.

Of course for each assumption I need to confirm it with a standards (IEC, EN, DIN, ISO,...) or possibly with a paper if not standard define this.

63,"I want to quit my PhD, seeking advice.",1543382650,"Long story short:

I finished my MSc in mechanical engineering last year, specifically in product development and materials. Apparently, i did a good job on my thesis, because my supervisor recommended me for this big professor in Germany, who offered me a position to do a PhD in forging processes. At the time, I was in love with all science, and here comes this offer to go to another country and be paid for doing science? It was like science was a big juicy apple which had splattered all over my face, juices running everywhere.

Now, after 6 publications, i’m starting to see the rotten bits in the apple of science. The pressure to publish is immense. The number of publications is much more heavily weighted than the quality of each publication, and its driving me to do some dubious things. Just the other day i finished a big, IMHO good quality paper, that i had been working on for 6 months. As soon as i submitted, my prof came in and basically told me to find some way of restructuring the work and to combine it with other results, so that it could be submitted to another, smaller journal. In a week. Just to get one more publication. Since the deadline is so soon he cant possibly expect anything of quality. So I ask myself, whats the point? Isn’t science supposed to be about the hunt for absolute and indisputable truth? When did it become about the hunt for publications? I cant imagine anyone reading the paper I am making now and actually getting anything useful out of it. I feel more like a journalist than a scientist, getting by only because of my ability to communicate and make bullshit look good, not because of my ability to make truth.

Bottom line is i have somewhat lost my passion for science, and i feel like my life is taking an unwanted direction. This was not what i had in mind for my future, i don’t want to be a journalist. My heart right now is telling me i should go home and get back into the thing that made me want to do my MSc in the first place, which is product development. I never even had a very strong desire for a PhD, and i see it mostly as a circle jerk. All i wanted was to contribute to the betterment of mankind, however corny that may sound.

72,ASU Civil Engineers! Need advice from current or graduated CE's...,1543374517,"All,

I am an aspiring CE and am about to enter into my Junior year at ASU's Tempe campus. I have no more remaining classes to take from my freshman/sophomore years which leaves me the next 2 semesters to select from the following Junior year courses.

Numerical Methods
CE Materials
Structural Analysis
Geotechnical Engineering
Engineering Business Practice
Transportation Engineering
Fluid Mechanics
Environmental Engineering

I would like to take 4 classes in the spring, and 4 in the fall. 

My question: is there anyone out there who would be willing to suggest which classes to take consecutively while also maximizing my potential to actually pass?

In short, I want to avoid taking too many of the really difficult classes at the same time. 

I feel somewhat in the dark and don't want to set my class schedule up for failure as I know nothing of the courses listed above.

For example, I have heard taking Fluids and Structural Analysis is an easy way to find myself struggling to keep up as both have a really difficult curriculum.

Is there anyone who can share their experience with ASU? Anything you wish you knew beforehand that may have 'lightened the load' a bit? Any suggestions for professors (good and bad)? Just really looking for any help at all here as transferring to ASU is feeling more daunting as each day passes and as I hear more horror stories. 

Thanks!

Also, before anyone gives me the ""engineering degrees/classes are ALL difficult"" speach, know that I am completely aware and asking in terms of difficulty relative to other engineering courses. Not difficulty relative to &lt;insert non-engineering related degree here&gt; degrees.

95,"3 years US R&amp;D industry experience, considering going for a PhD in the UK",1543345715,"I posted in the /r/engineering career guidance thread but it seems to be dead, so hopefully I’m not breaking any rules by posting here as well. Copy-paste of my comment from before below:


Currently, I have been working at a startup doing some R&amp;D work for the past 3 years based in the US. I took this job right out of college, so it is my only experience. I truly enjoy the work and the people I work with. I am given a lot of project-critical tasks and responsibilities which feels good as a young engineer.

However, the last year I have definitely felt myself stagnating and not growing at the same pace I did over the first 2 years. I realize that's probably normal because you have more to learn right out of school. What concerns me is that being in a startup, there is a very young pool of other engineers here. One of the biggest concerns I have is the lack of any sort of mentorship or career guidance due to so many people being at the same experience level I am.

I love the R&amp;D aspect of my work, but when I look up job postings for jobs I may be interested in in the future, the requirements almost always state a PhD. I'm not sure how my couple years of R&amp;D experience in a startup compares to that to most companies. As a result, I sent out a few emails to different schools with PhD programs/projects in my field. My main reasonings for considering this option is:

•	⁠To get more research experience that fits the job posting requirements I have seen on jobs I want to be able to move into
•	⁠Have a chance to relocate ideally (grew up, went to school, and now work in the same area I've always been in) for both personal experience and networking

In the next two weeks I have to decide on an offer for a 3-year PhD in the UK at a school globally ranked similarly to Virginia Tech/U of Waterloo for some international comparisons (to reiterate, I'm in the US now). The project they want me to interview for sounds incredibly interesting, and the opportunity would be fully-funded with a living stipend (unsure of how much at the moment, waiting to hear back).

What I'm specifically hoping for feedback on is:

1.	⁠Does getting a PhD to meet the requirements for potential future jobs I'd like make sense if I'm mostly happy with my current job? Would more experience eventually be able to bear the same weight on an application?
2.	⁠In my mind, having a degree and job experience in the US + a PhD from the UK sounds like it would open up a lot of opportunities. Am I wrong in thinking that an international PhD would help improve my prospects for jobs globally? I'm very open/interested in applying for jobs outside the US.
3.	⁠I don't want to stay in academia. My goal with the PhD is to be able to get research-focused jobs in industry. I've heard these can be hard to come by. Does having 3 years of industry experience make a significant difference in my likelihood to get jobs after the PhD is over?

I believe in doing so I'd be able to vary the pressure in the cylinder to change the k value of the ""spring"". I want this variation which is why I don't just use a traditional gas spring anyway. I was thinking about using a double acting cylinder because I don't need the spring return of a single acting cylinder.

7,Filling in a service pit to create warehouse floor space,1543334148,"We are an OEM mfr. for components in the tank truck industry. Our sister company **did** tank truck repairs - keyword ""did"".

The repair part of the business has been sold out to a competing entity - which is a plus for us because we were looking at having a new building built because we are running out of production space and we shared the same building. So, we are now acquiring all of the truck repair bays (14 in total) that we will be grinding the floors, epoxy coating and turning into usable production floor space.

Two of these truck bays have service pits cut into the floor. These pits measure about 32-36"" wide and about 5' deep with concrete stairs leading down on one end. We do not need these pits for production purposes and I have been tasked with, either, covering or filling them in.

After receiving one quote for the fill-in panels and then taking another look at the pits and surrounding structure, I feel it would be more financially feasible to just cut, and remove, the steel ""lip"" on the pits and then fill the pits with concrete - or fill with crusher run and then top off with 12"" of concrete.

My steel plate calculations proved that a 3/8"" thick tread plate with 3/8"" x 4"" steel ribs at 18"" centers was plenty sufficient to carry any load that we would be placed on it. However, my experience with concrete is a little less knowledgeable - I am a mechanical engineer and not a structural engineer.

We are located in Georgia (U.S.). What permits, if any, would be required to fill in these pits and would we be required to obtain structural calculations from a qualified engineer to make this happen?

My plan would be to fill and pack crusher run/gravel to a depth 12"" below finished surface. Then drill (12"" depth), insert and epoxy in #4 rebar every 18-24"" along the length of the pit (along the walls) and then tie in 4x4 WWM before pouring 3000 psi concrete.

After everything is said and done, the entire floor will be ground and epoxy coated for durability.

From my understanding a DC motor would be preferable to an AC motor because the battery would supply a dc current, even though they require more maintenance than an AC motor. I know that the shunt motor is self-regulating so it has good speed control and its biggest disadvantage seems to be that it has a low starting torque, but I can’t seem to find anything online about it being used in boats.

Background: I am 30, northeast, post-military bachelors in M.E. from a decent public school. I did fairly well in the curriculum and volunteered for undergrad research for a P.E. I took classes in software simulation (ANSYS) and Finite Elements Methods (a graduate course, it was tough) and I really enjoyed them.

Post school, I searched for work in the defense industry (Lockheed, BAH, General Dynamics) and had a few interviews and felt like I was very close to getting the job but didn't.

Essentially, I find that my daily role is mostly as a CAD jockey and I do what I consider to be zero engineering. There isn't much engineering done on site, any technical work is sent out.

What I am getting at is that I want to use more of what I learned in curriculum and I want to do simulation and FEA related work. It's a conflict because the salary is good, the commute is less than 30 minutes, the work is really easy, they will pay for my grad school (under contract to stay for 3-4 years), and my co-workers are easy going.

40,PHEV concept with predominantly electric power train and micro diesel engine,1543264367,"Hi fellow engineers..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there is a good reason why this isn't a thing, but I honestly don't know why given the amount of PHEV vehicles where the bias is that the petrol engine provides 80% of the power the vehicle requires.

&amp;#x200B;

So the concept is a micro ultra high efficiency diesel engine (\~300cc / 20HP / 15Kw)  where the entire unit is designed to operate at a fixed RPM for maximum possible thermodynamic efficiency connected directly to a generator to charge the batteries / drive the electric powertrain.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole car obviously can't function with just 20 hp so a 50Kw battery pack is present to supplement the power to accelerate and cruise and provide the power required of a modern car.

&amp;#x200B;

So if the vehicle has a theoretical range of 100 miles pure electric (lets say 180 when running hybrid i.e. electric and diesel running together for the duration of the  70mph highway journey.. it will get you to where most people want to go. But when you park the car at a non electric friendly recharge location (i.e. currently the majority of the world),  the diesel engine can remain running charging your battery at a rate of 15Kw/Hr i.e. it will be full in 3.5 hours, ready to do that 180 mile trip all over.

&amp;#x200B;

Another factor is that when the battery is &lt;5% the vehicle can still operate in an ultra low power mode where it will only ever travel at a speed that the diesel engine can 100% support, whilst leaving that 5% to manage accelerations as required.

&amp;#x200B;

The concept can scale in either direction to the extreme where a 100cc diesel is only enough to push 3/4 Kw but is still enough to put power in your car whilst your at work.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so, sorry for the essay, but what am I missing? my initial thoughts are high efficiency engine technology cost doesn't scale well with reduction in engine size, i.e. a 300cc engine won't be 1/10 the cost of a 3.0 diesel it would more likely be \~40%

41,Calculating Cost Of Solar Installation?,1543262629,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been brainstorming some potential ideas for a business. One of my ideas is to power one of \[these pumpjacks\]([https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/oil-well-pumpjack-red-barn-and-longs-peak-james-bo-insogna.jpg](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/oil-well-pumpjack-red-barn-and-longs-peak-james-bo-insogna.jpg)) with solar panels.

&amp;#x200B;

The goal of these pumpjacks is to simply get oil out of the well when the formation pressure is not great enough to provide boost pressure to the oil.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, they are powered by the electric grid and a large minority of them are powered by diesel generators or waste gas. Brand new pumps are huge and are usually 75 hp+ units utilizing an electric variable frequency drive which then uses a generator or grid for an energy source. Older units are typically anywhere from 10-15hp to 30hp.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I wanted to design for a 100 hp system. This is a very rough estimate, but the costs were so high I was wondering if I did anything wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Assumptions:

* Equipment + installation costs for solar system: $1/Watt
* 18 hours a day of pumping time.
* Battery/inverter/grid tie in cost ignored.
* Assumed 30% ITC.
* Did not account for capacity factor.
* $0.08 $/kWh for West Texas electricity grid retail costs.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusions:

&amp;#x200B;

* Would need about 3,000 solar panels.
* 1350 kWh of energy needed per day.
* Cost of system: $945,000 (probably much more because efficiency of panels is like 25%, not 100% and I obviously need batteries to run 18 hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Do my numbers seem to make sense? This seems way to large of a cost to just replace a 100 hp generator system which costs $30,000.

43,Measure Electric Motor Power During Operation,1543259027,"I need to measure the actual HP being used for a 2HP 3phase 230V electric motor while it is under its various loads. I have a VFD connected and from that I can output a few parameters through the analog out. The relevant ones are 1. inverter output current, 2. inverter output torque 3. inverter input power. The VFD manual does not list the units of these values, nor the full range scale. I tried using current and correlating it to the published motor curve, but the output current value does vary as i would expect based on load. Output torque acts the same way, just with a different value. I tried input power thinking I could use V\*A = Watts to get close, but the numerical value of the data output is different than i expected, and I am having a hard time assigning them to an actual unit of measure. A torque meter would be great but they are a bit expensive for my current budget.

I am a young engineer who has just graduated university. I moved from my home country to the UK where my mother has lived for 10+ years and who was the main reason I moved here. It took me a year to find a job in engineering after several interviews. A small company with 15 people in different departments and at the time a 4 man engineering team. This making me the 5th engineer when joining. I was and am very grateful for the opportunity and I have learnt a lot. My job is very hands on, and can be interesting but in my opinion feels it is more suited for “technician” type rather than engineering. We do solve problems but with a product that is already developed and designed so more troubleshooting than anything. There are little pockets of design and moments where i feel like I put some of my engineering brain to use but rarely. I realized very quickly that this wasn’t something I wanted to do for long, but was just happy to be working and making better money than working in retail. 

Recently: 

After 1.5 years I have really gotten bored of my job, and don’t find myself being stimulated by what I do. I listen to the radio on my phone in the workshop just to help my mind keep busy as what I do doesn’t require much concentration after doing it so many times. Do not be mistaken, there is loads to do. I am just not passionate about what I do. 
I have also come to realize that there is very little room to move up in the company, my only choices really are (potentially in many years) to go into sales or stay down in the workshop build, test and install our product. (I do not doubt my colleagues believe that there is very little upwards movement and or financial gain/growth in what we do for the company). 

The interview:

So I have spent the last couple months looking for a job. With no success until now. A friend who I reached out to when I first moved here who was here and working. He has joined a small but new company in building services consulting. He asked for my CV and passed it on to his employers who are very keen to see me mainly due to my programming ability (which I have been doing in my own free time to just satisfy my need for that “engineer” feeling of having created something from scratch and it works) with mechanical engineer qualifications. It’s a great opportunity to get into a design consulting role I will get my own projects which will challenge me and obviously the growth as an early employee in the company might have me in a position that in a few years if the company grows I’ll be better of. 

Today: 
I am a week away from the interview that I am pretty confident I can land. ( there is always room to be disappointed though) A colleague who has been here a few more years than I just announced he is leaving. We are all a bit shocked but I believe we are not surprised and above all I think we are all jealous and upset with ourselves for not being the first to pull out.

My main worry is that I now feel if I do land the job. I will be leaving the company in a bad spot and the engineers that are remaining with potentially a lot on their hands, I will serve a month notice period, but even though we not stressed about the one gentlemen leaving. That if I leave will really be stabbing them in the back. There is a lot of emotions I am not sure what to do. I know at the end of the day I need to look out for myself and do what’s best for me but I am soaked in guilt in doing it cause I might not get another good opportunity.

The problem is he's making things really hard for us (we are 20-people company). He's a coding dragon, a workaholic who has no problem working from home after regular hour or during weekends, a guy who steps up to every challenge and never stops. The kind of person who not only tells our boss that virtually everything's possible, but also makes it possible...

He's produced a lot for the company, and that's great. Lately, however, he's been offloading maintenance or updates on a lot of his stuff onto us because he's busy on new projects, and it's hell. Bugs come up, design choices are hard to understand, the code base is a mess, and sometimes, when we catch something wasn't done in a clean way, we get answers like ""yeah, it's not the cleanest way to do it but there was no time to do it any other way"".

For example:

- we got an email that a website he wrote was broken, so he forwarded it to us. A coworker of mine spent 2 hours trying to figure out what the issue was, and it was because of a bug on a function this guy wrote. He could have solved it in 15 mins likely. When my coworker pointed out that in the end it was his fault, he looked annoyed and ignored him.

- our boss asked him to estimate a job, which he did. The job was then assigned to another guy but the estimate was kept, and this guy is going crazy trying to  complete the assignment, saying that the first estimate (10 days) was clearly wrong.

- I was asked to estimate something two weeks ago, and I said 2 days. For some reason, the same person also asked him later on, and he said ""I looked at the code and this task takes 1 day"", and they went with 1 day. WTF? Maybe I need more time, maybe I need someone to explain it to me, or maybe I still need to look at the code, etc. If the point is to show it can be done fast, then why doesn't *he* do it in 15 mins at this point???

- When you ask him for help, most of the times his answers are ""google it"", or ""I can't help you, you need to do it yourself"", or ""I can't do your job for you, sorry"".

- 6 months ago we had some issues finishing customizing a wordpress website, so he stepped in and we shifted to other things. The job got done and the client was happy. Last week  a coworker of ours was asked to make some changes to the same website, and holly shit, he spent hours trying to navigate what this guy had done to make it work 6 months prior.

- Finally, a client complained recently that the product was extremely slow. The product was written by him 2 years ago and then he moved on to other things. A coworker and I (we were now both in charge of the project) were trying to figure out the reason and eventually asked him for help. He found out that the problem was a function *he* had written years ago, and when he realized this, he said ""well, guys, this was written 2 years ago, I haven't worked on the project for a year, you should have maintained the codebase"" Unbelievable...

I am working on a project in college under a professor. The professor wants two other students and I to do a proof of concept of a potential jetquad system that utilizes mini jet turbines like the Jet Cat P-180 RXi used frequently in RC planes. He suggested that we ask for help and guidance from various forums and I thought there was no better place than Reddit! Our focus is working with a single jet engine initially. We would study the behaviors in both a stationary and basic linear path to have a better understanding of how the engine functions and its reaction time to input changes including fuel flow rate. Depending on how this pans out, we plan to explore how to do thrust vectoring through exhaust flaps attached to the end. The ultimate goal would be to show that if everything worked out as hoped, then we would be able to place a chain to the single jet engine and control the motion through circles with various radii.

Does anyone have any suggestions, concerns, or ideas for us? We have to start from the ground up so we have not figured out how we are going to communicate with the jet engine via our laptop using a wireless signal and so on for the basics.

70,An overachiever developer is making our lives hell and we don't know what to do... how do you deal with people like this?,1543184770,"This is software engineering, I want to get something out of the way from the start: I know this guy is good, and we all know it.

The problem is he's making things really hard for us (we are 20-people company). He's a coding dragon, a workaholic who has no problem working from home after regular hour or during weekends, a guy who steps up to every challenge and never stops. The kind of person who not only tells our boss that virtually everything's possible, but also makes it possible...

He's produced a lot for the company, and that's great. Lately, however, he's been offloading maintenance or updates on a lot of his stuff onto us because he's busy on new projects, and it's hell. Bugs come up, design choices are hard to understand, the code base is a mess, and sometimes, when we catch something wasn't done in a clean way, we get answers like ""yeah, it's not the cleanest way to do it but there was no time to do it any other way"".

For example:

- we got an email that a website he wrote was broken, so he forwarded it to us. A coworker of mine spent 2 hours trying to figure out what the issue was, and it was because of a bug on a function this guy wrote. He could have solved it in 15 mins likely. When my coworker pointed out that in the end it was his fault, he looked annoyed and ignored him.

- our boss asked him to estimate a job, which he did. The job was then assigned to another guy but the estimate was kept, and this guy is going crazy trying to  complete the assignment, saying that the first estimate (10 days) was clearly wrong.

- I was asked to estimate something two weeks ago, and I said 2 days. For some reason, the same person also asked him later on, and he said ""I looked at the code and this task takes 1 day"", and they went with 1 day. WTF? Maybe I need more time, maybe I need someone to explain it to me, or maybe I still need to look at the code, etc. If the point is to show it can be done fast, then why doesn't *he* do it in 15 mins at this point???

- When you ask him for help, most of the times his answers are ""google it"", or ""I can't help you, you need to do it yourself"", or ""I can't do your job for you, sorry"".

- 6 months ago we had some issues finishing customizing a wordpress website, so he stepped in and we shifted to other things. The job got done and the client was happy. Last week  a coworker of ours was asked to make some changes to the same website, and holly shit, he spent hours trying to navigate what this guy had done to make it work 6 months prior.

- Finally, a client complained recently that the product was extremely slow. The product was written by him 2 years ago and then he moved on to other things. A coworker and I (we were now both in charge of the project) were trying to figure out the reason and eventually asked him for help. He found out that the problem was a function *he* had written years ago, and when he realized this, he said ""well, guys, this was written 2 years ago, I haven't worked on the project for a year, you should have maintained the codebase"" Unbelievable...

75,How to express normalization of efficiency?,1543168339,"In engineering, when efficiency is measured, the formula is simply useful output divided by total output (eta). But is there another symbol that I can use to show whether the reported efficiency is either within range or outside of acceptable range? For example, to an untrained person, telling them that a combustion engine's efficiency is only 50%, they might think it's broken or totally out of spec because half efficiency sounds like half-cooked, half-effort, halfway there. But if 50% efficiency happens to be the best achievable with current engineering methods, what other metric can be used next to efficiency to express that this number is ""okay""?

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking maybe using normal distribution because it quantifies variation. So in my example, if I studied several engines and the majority have an efficiency in the range of 40-60%, then the sigma would reveal that 50% is the average performance. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now, instead of the layman freaking out when I tell them ""this engine has 50% efficiency"", I can say something like ""it has 50% efficiency at one sigma"", and they would go, ""Oh, 50% is the expected average performance? M-kay. Got it. I was about to lose my hair over how inefficient that sounds.""

&amp;#x200B;

I could report the number as '50% efficiency, 1-sigma', or with symbols η=50%@1σ.

Nothing is technical in my job right now. A Project Engineer role is available to me for my next rotation the following year, but this is essentially the only engineering role available. The job is an “engineering” role, but it doesn’t seem very technical at all – mostly project management and some very minor analysis. I’m worried about how this might me down the road.

Often engineers start out technical and move toward project or people management later in their career. I feel it will be difficult to get into a technical engineering position at this point, partly because my previous work experience will have been non-technical, and partly because I am an IE (different topic, I love the IE field, but often companies don’t know what to do with IE’s so they end up doing work that is only marginally “engineering”) Lately, I have been considering grad school (MS Engineering) as a way to make the switch. At this point, I really don’t care if I’m working as a MechE, IE, EE, etc. I have my preferences, sure, but mostly, I just want to work in a technical capacity in some form.

78,Another career question! Majoring in both Mechanical and Materials Engineering. Torn between too many things.,1543167401,"Hi folks 

Im currently doing a dual major in Mechanical and Materials Engineering and pretty well enjoying both. So far I’ve complemented the theory by tinkering a lot in the past 12 months to get some hands on experience. Manual machining (lathe and mill), pulling things apart and trying to rebuild them, as well as CAD’ing things in Solidworks and drawings with GD&amp;T and trying to make my own parts. No doubt I completely suck, but I’m definitely learning a lot in the process. I also have an interest in composite materials and will start on a basic Carbon Fiber project when I get the time. 

I’m struggling to think how I can tie all this together for any specific path though, I think my brain switches between too many things. One minute I think I should do product design, then I move to something in composites, then something in manufacturing, then something in analysis, then I come back down to earth and think maybe I should just get a job first. 

I suppose I’m looking for something that is oriented towards machine/product design (that may include composites) and interfaces with manufacturing. I do know that those are the areas I want to head in. What sort of thing is this, and whats the current trends in these kinds of skills? The first though is just design Engineer, but that seems to be such a massively broad and ambiguous term. 

I’m in Australia, but as we don’t make anything here anymore I’m looking at the US, Europe and Asia (ie, most of planet earth) if that’s where I have to go.

I am making a stationary chainsaw mill for slabbing up urban reclaimed logs in the Okanagan valley in British Columbia Canada. I am modelling loosely after the Logosol E8.

I am thinking of welding the drum to a gear or pulley that is proportional to the size I need for 50 km/h. The way I've seen chain tensioned is to have the motor sit on an adjustable plate while the bar is mounted directly to the frame, that you move in and out as necessary, then re-tighten bolts to the frame. Would having 2 of these working independently to tighten the belt and tighten the chain be a problem? You'd mount the chain and then slide the rim sprocket out to tension the chain; then you'd slip on the v-belt onto the pulleys and then slide the motor out to tension the belt.

0,"Based on these 3 charts (air permeability, moisture management, thermal resistance), which material would be best for a hot sleeper (so material that would facilitate the most heat transfer) for a pillow cover, sheets, and blanket (separate answers for each one). No calculations, just rough guesses.",1543099335,"https://i.imgur.com/cIrhZd5.png

Say the sleeper gets hot flashes during the night, and needs material with a very high heat transfer to transfer this heat away so the sleeper doesn't wake up. Which material should the sleeper use for: the blanket, the sheets, and the pillow case ?

I would think the moisture management is irrelevant but I'm not exactly sure. I think the average person loses a pound of water each night, mostly through breathing but also through some sweat as well. For this question we can assume that this isn't a particularly sweaty sleeper (no night sweats). OR we could get a prediction for each case. 

Details on the testing:

&gt; Testing. Before testing, all samples were conditioned. For each type of test, three replications were performed. The different standard methods American society for testing of materials (ASTM) and American association of textile chemists and colorists (AATCC) were followed to perform different tests. ASTMD2256/D2256M—10e1 was followed to test the tenacity and elongation percentage of yarns by using Yarn Tensile Tester (Tensojet, 2000). For the tensile strength of fabrics (150  50 mm2 ), ASTM D5035—11 was followed by using tensile strength tester. Similarly, for tear strength of fabrics (100  63 mm2), ASTM D1424—09, 2013 was followed. Likewise, ASTM D737—04, 2012 was followed to analyze air permeability of fabrics (20  20 cm2) by using air permeability tester M-021A SDL Atlas, UK. Similarly, AATCC test method TM (195) was followed to know the liquid moisture management properties of fabrics (8  8 cm2 ). In the same way, ASTM D1518—14 was followed for measuring the thermal resistance of fabrics (30  30 cm2 ) by using thermal resistance tester M-259B SDL Atlas, UK.

My predictions:

For Blanket: Tencel. Though Viscose has a lower thermal resistance, a very large surface area of Tencel will be exposed to air, which can facilitate a lot of heat transfer. 

For sheets: Viscose. The sheets are mainly not in contact with any air, so the thermal resistance would dominate the heat transfer properties of the sheets. 

For pillow case:  Maybe viscose? Some of the pillow is exposed to the air, but most of it is not. Lets say that the pillow has some air permeability as well. I would imagine that the thermal resistance is still the more significant factor, since in the graph, the difference between the thermal resistance is much more significant than the difference in air permeability (as far as I can tell).

1,Best Modeling Software for Construction / Civil Engineers,1543096651,"Hello community.

I was hoping if anyone with experience in the civil / mechanical engineering / architectural design (specific fields in which I'd just imagine modeling software would come in handy) could lend their opinion on what they think is the most superior modeling software, or combination of programs to create their models. I was hoping to get some insight as to what I can start learning for construction use for what I do.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as what I'm looking for, id like to create shapes / models for construction formwork (forms / rebar / concrete) and gradingwork (excavation / backfill / Embankment / Slopes). I have only been in the industry a year and a half now, and I have already seen the repetitive need for someone to be able to illustrate (very accurately) a vision that can be easily understood. I majored in Civil Engineering, so i am familiar with the basic design software like CAD, solidworks, and other autodesk products, but I'm inquiring about other options should they exist. I've seen some engineers use google sketchup for building purposes, and that's kind of what I am leaning toward because it seems like a good program for making simple drawings to build work. Making 3D models to show a construction process is really all I am trying to accomplish, as efficiently as possible of course. If I could convert a set of contract drawings to 3D scaled models that made sense, and could present specific viewpoints, I would feel confident in my ability as a field engineer to at least know all the tangible aspects of what I am building. 

So boiling it down to making 3D lift drawings, what modeling program or combination of programs (like ACAD for 2D design and Sketchup for the 3D model) do you guys think would best suite a field engineer in the construction industry?

3,Why can exhaust velocity and equivalent exhaust velocity be interchanged in the Rocket Equation?,1543076898,"I have been trying for some time now to satisfy myself with the derivations for the rocket equation. I am happy with the derivation that neglects external forces, leading to `vmax = ve*ln(r) - v0` with `vmax` being the rocket's maximum velocity, `ve` being the (absolute) exhaust velocity, `r` being the propellant mass ratio (`Full Mass/(Full Mass - Prop Mass)`), and `v0` being the initial velocity. 

However, I am not understanding the result of the derivation when pressure forces are included. The equivalent exhaust velocity is given as `veq = ve + Ae*[pe - p0]/mdot` with `Ae` being exhaust area, `pe` being exhaust pressure, `p0` being atmospheric pressure, and `mdot` being rate of change of mass. 

After this, the derivation eventually leads to `vmax = veq*ln(r) - v0`. This makes no sense to me because it implies either that the exhaust velocity is the same as the equivalent exhaust velocity, or that the maximum speed of the rocket changes depending on which velocity you use... It's definitely possible that I'm misunderstanding something quite obvious here, but I have seen both versions of the equation at numerous points using `ve` and `veq` interchangeably.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my old man are trying to calculate the feasibility of a hydroelectric scheme and I am having some issues around dynamic head loss.

I am using the Darcy–Weisbach equation in head form and using 0.055 as the Darcy Friction Factor (Steel pipe with Re = 1.45 x10^(8)).  From here I simply do:

Head Loss = **\[Darcy Friction Factor\]** x **(1 / 2g)** x **(v****^(2)****/D)** x **L**

Where g = gravitational acceleration; v = velocity of the water; D = hydraulic diameter of the pipe; and L = length of the pipe.

From an manufacturers standpoint, wouldn't having an asymmetrical part like this would increase manufacturing cost+complexity, decrease efficiency of the rotor, and the like?  Yet, it was specifically engineered to be this way, and I don't think I understand why.

The plaque states that the rear rotor isn't used in it's traditional sense, and is only there to provide directional control.

An issue arose where the spacer was shifting around and when the assembly was compressed it would cause compression in the center which caused a problem (no need to get too complex here)

Long story short, the remedy is a larger OD spacer that uses the OD to limit movement of the spacer so that the hollow center stays in the center and doesn't have this issue.  

The problem comes from GD&amp;T.  I have never before seen a washer/spacer that called out concentric tolerancing between ID and OD but this is important for this appliation.  I wasn't sure if I am overthinking this and some industry standard would take care of this or if I should make sure the new drawing specifically calls out the deviation from concentric either by defining the OD and then defining a distance from OD to ID instead of directly calling out ID, or going full datum scheme seems overkill as I have never seen datum callouts used on a part as simple as a washer.  

This part is approximately 2±.01""OD, and 0.3"" Thickness, and when in place there is always a .5"" empty spot in the center after any stackup.  for force distribution and p, the spacer should be as large as possible so I can't just make the ID 1.8"" and call it good.

52,Need help with Pectus Carinatun bracing. Need less pressure and more constriction.,1542951203,"[Here is a photo of the brace](https://trulife.com/wp-content/uploads/Pectus-Carinatum-Orthosis-1024x680.jpg)  
  
For those who dont know, pectus carinatum is a chest deformity where the sternum protrudes. It can be cured, more or less, by using a compression brace. T Joe pectus services is a company that specializes in these braces and would love to get one but I don't have the thousands of dollars for travel and medical expenses. So I bought my own brace from a medical retailer for $300 a few years ago and simply couldn't handle the pain. Most of these braces are designed for children who's chest wall is soft and flexible, however I am an adult. You would think the pain would come from the bending of the bones, but nope. I have to tighten the brace tightly in order to compress my sternum, where the skin in between the bone and foam padding on the brace becomes excruciatingly painful.  
  
  
It is said on that certain companies won't brace their patients if the patient's chest won't bend under 7.5 PSI, due to skin irritation. This leads me on a quest. Is it possible for me to mitigate some of the pressure some how, allowing the same amount of compression on the chest? If you take a look at the aforementioned photo, the device is very simple. I'm thinking that maybe there's a BETTER foam that I could replace the current foam with? Any ideas are heavily appreciated. Help me end the physical deformity that has plagued me ever since my teens. 

PS. I'm fully aware of the consequences of what I am doing. I'm desperate to fix this, and the likelyhood of actually fucking up my chest is incredibly low. So please dont chime in with ""go to a professional""

I am a graduating senior in California. I have not invested much time into applying for jobs at large companies because I was planning on taking some time off at the end of school. However, a small consulting company has reached out to me and after a very rigorous interview process they have extended an offer with about a month to respond (80k salary, good stock options) I feel that the experience that I would gain from this company would be very useful because they work on a large variety of projects from consumer to aerospace hardware. This company is also staffed by very experienced engineers who have left big companies to work here. From my limited point of view I feel that this company will be an environment in which I would learn a lot more than I would in a bigger company with more resources, more security, and potentially higher salary offerings.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if anyone has epertise with PRV's but I have a question regarding the strategy to use to evaluate three different options for PRV'S on a secondary crude column which currently has 5 PRV's on the OH line to a condenser. The issue to resolve is that the inlet pressure drop for the current arrangement does not meet th 3 % rule.

&amp;#x200B;

the options are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Replace all existing (i.e. smaller) 5 PRV's with three 8T10 PRV's one on the existing 18"" nozzle on the top of the column, one on a side stripper coloumn (Part of the protected system) and one on a 14""

line off the main secondary column crude OH line.

2) Relocate one of the existing PRV's to the the 18"" nozzle on the top of the main column along with the existing PRV, and relocate one of the existing PRV's to the top of the side stripper column, and upsize the existing 14"" line off the main OH line to 18"" so that it contains the remaining 2 PRV's.

3.) Same as two above except that that three of the PSV's on the main secondary crude column OH line are pilot operated PRV's.

TL/DR: I like this first degree. Do feel the claims of graduate job prospects as automation engineers are realistic?


I’m a student working on general education classes at a local community college currently, and having a tough time making a B.S. program decision. Truthfully the below degree is the one I like most because it is hybridized with a lot of lab and project work.


http://www.ccsu.edu/mcm/RoboticsMechEngrTechBS.html

It is an ABET ETAC accredited 4 year BS. I’m drawn to the more applied nature and find myself more excited by the curriculum, mostly because I feel it would let me start utilizing my new knowledge in personal projects rather quickly. I also believe I would remain more enthusiastic about school if I regularly improved abilities I know I would use shortly after gaining them. I AM fairly familiar with the engineering vs engineering technology discussion/debate (if you consider there to be one)

1. Are the stated career prospects for graduates reasonable? 
Robotics / Automation Engineer
Robotics / Automation Application Engineer
Robotics / Automation Equipment Sales
Automation and Controls Engineer
Manufacturing or Industrial Engineer
Robotics or PLC Programmer

2. Could a graduate from the program expect to be taken seriously in the intended field of robotics/automation/electromechanical engineering?

3. Are you having a good day? I hope you are. I appreciate you reading through all this to help :)

4. Any other thoughts?

Alternatively I’m also interested in uconn’s BSEE http://www.ee.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/EE-Curriculum-2017.pdf

I don’t think there’s any doubt regarding the quality of this program, and the broader foundation would allow pursuit of many fields. My concern is missing out on the mechanical and manufacturing knowledge imparted by the first program, and it is a bit farther from me, and it is less certain that I will be accepted. 

For what it matters my interests are largely electromechanical in nature. Wind turbines, power generation in general, 3d printers, and honestly, e waste repurposing are really high up there. I also blacksmith a little (I’m awful still) and am into manufacturing processes.

Although i never get to as many projects as I’d like, I recently built an electrical resistance, well, kiln I suppose. It runs off a 120v/15a to use right about 1650 watts and was primarily intended for aluminum casting. So far I’ve cast a tiny aluminum anvil haha. I’m currently working on an enclosure for my CR10 3d printer, and am also very interested in developing 3d CAD skills.

Thank you so much for even reading, I appreciate any professional input on the matter.

Doing an outdoor ecology experiment where I need to provide a small amount of heat to some insect eggs, and a small amount of cooling to others. The treatments are ambient (fluctuating with natural outdoor exposed temps), but the pelt units will create a little extra cooling in some treatments, or a little extra heat in others. 

Right now the idea is to link the treamtnets so that the wast heat from one side of the plate heats a treament, and the other cools it. 

I purchased a 12v 0-5 amp table variable top power supply to do this. 

My question to you engineers... will passive (just a heat sink on each side of the pelt unit, no fan) conduction/convection of heat from the pelt plate be enough to add about +/- 1-2*C to these outdoor treatments, or will I need a fan on each heat-sink to reach that efficiency on the plates? 

The idea is that the pelt will sit between two Styrofoam containers with a heat sink sticking into each container. The containers won't be sealed so that heat or cool air doesn't build up. 

If I do need to use fans, what is the best way to wire and power a bunch of computer fans? Should they be in series or parallel?

I am trying do understand a derivation, but am missing one important link.

In system Identification, your transfer function approximator (H with the hat) can be thought of as a sum of the true value and and error (H with a tilde). This error is a function can be a nonlinear function of the true PSDs (Suy, Suu) and also of the offsets (\~Suy and \~Suy). See the equation nicely formatted here: [https://imgur.com/a/1LWPuC7](https://imgur.com/a/1LWPuC7)

&amp;#x200B;

Now I need to obtain a first order approximation of the offset (H with a tilde). Assuming H-tilde is small in relation to the true value of H, we can make a 1st order linearization around that specific point. I am assuming the original author did a Taylor series expansion,  where (because we linearize around the true value) the offsets \~Suy and \~Suu are 0. However, for a Taylor series expansion I need  to know the original non-linear equation (because I need to take the derivative of it). That is where I get stuck, hope someone can help me there.

19,A specific question about the collapse of WTC 7 (911 related),1542804728,"Hi there, new here. Currently in a debate surrounding WTC 7 (47 story building that fell during 911) and have one question. It's related to [this article](https://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2016/04/epn2016-47-4.pdf) ""On the physics of high rise buildings"" submitted to Europhysics magazine by several authors who believe WTC 7 may not have fallen due to fire. 

The question is specifically about the below highlighted part taken from the article (NIST refers to the official investigation and findings on the WTC 7 collapse)

&gt;NIST acknowledge
a 2.25-second period of free fall in its final report. Yet
NIST’s computer model shows no such period of free fall,
nor did NIST attempt to explain how WTC 7 could have
had “no structural components below it” for eight stories.
Instead, NIST’s final report provides an elaborate scenario
involving an unprecedented failure mechanism: the
thermal expansion of floor beams pushing an adjoining
girder off its seat. The alleged walk-off of this girder
then supposedly caused an eight-floor cascade of floor
failures, which, combined with the failure of two other
girder connections—also due to thermal expansion—left
a key column unsupported over nine stories, causing it to
buckle. This single column failure allegedly precipitated
the collapse of the entire interior structure, leaving the
exterior unsupported as a hollow shell. The exterior columns
then allegedly buckled over a two-second period
and the entire exterior fell simultaneously as a unit [3].
**NIST was able to arrive at this scenario only by omitting
or misrepresenting critical structural features in its
computer modelling.[4] Correcting just one of these
errors renders NIST’s collapse initiation indisputably
impossible**

Question to engineers here. Is the bolded part a correct assertion or not. If yes/no, please explain why

Thanks very much (I understand this may be a touchy subject, but this is meant in good faith as part of a discussion surrounding WTC 7)

36,When your boss behaves irrationally in order to protect employees that he likes... can it get bad for you eventually?,1542756697,"I know this isn't about sexual strategy but I'm trying to understand if it's time to leave this job or if it's worth staying.

I'm spying on a few computers in the office (an ex coworker bugged them) which gives me full access to company's restricted information (numbers, contracts, etc) as well as the flow of information among coworkers (chit chat, who's doing what, who's offloading, etc). We are small and not in the US, so it's pretty much the wild west on certain things here.

I have two bosses, both owners of the company (50-50). Partner A is a work-horse, responsible for 80% of the income, while Partner B is.. enjoying the money, the decision making, but doesn't work.

One of the computers I'm monitoring belongs to a woman coworker of mine who Partner A is in love with. He has a wife, children, etc, but of course, he would like to nail her. This guy talks to her every fucking day like if he was a woman: before meetings, after meetings, they send each other vocal messages while driving, etc.

He tried to fuck her 2 years ago and she shut him down quick, so the only thing he gets out of this is trying to seduce her by being her “protector”. He also complains about his business partner all the time to her, as well as certain employees, and of course, the woman is hell bent on fucking over those she doesn't like..

Now here's the kick: Partner A passive as shit, so I don't really understand if the true ""him"" is the one who vents to this woman in private or the one who's actually afraid of pissing anyone off, employees included.

Today I told one of the slacker-women I work with to talk to Partner B (the guy that cannot be manipulated) because she was needed somewhere else just for today. She was terrified of talking to him because she was doing a job for him, but I didn't give two shits about her, all she had to do was ask.

1) first, she talked to him and asked him if she could pause his activity.

2) at the same time, she talked to the woman Partner A is in love with and told her how unfair she found that I told her to, you know, be an adult. The other woman proceeded to insult me for pushing my coworker to the front line (all this in private, of course) and told my coworker to talk to the other partner and warn him about the situation.

3) Partner B told my coworker everything was ok, she could stop his tasks for one day, and she still went ahead and told the other guy what ""she had to do"", and Partner A (who was already informed by the other bitch) assured her ""she was safe"" and that ""Kacey (me) was wrong and had to talk to the other partner himself..."". Fyi, I'm not management here, just an employee.

Essentially, Partner A and his muse didn't like that I put her in a position of talking to Partner B, as they try to shield her from the guy. You know, adults...

8 hours later, Parnter A comes into my office and ""casually"" asks me (the girl was gone for the day) how the assignment my coworker did went. He never, ever fucking asks stuff like that. He came in because he needed to know the girl was safe. I told him she finished the tasks so everything was cool. I also added, casually, that I'd asked Partner B if she could do this, as well as told her to do the same, and Partner A's reply was shaking his head, dismissing what I was saying, and saying ""I'm not interested in that"".

Everything's like this. Every little shit gets blown out of proportion behind our backs by either one or the other female, and my boss listens to them. And the one he's in love with is totally out of control, fucking trying to interfere on shit she has nothing to do with. However, when it's time to drop the hammer, Partner A doesn't do it.

I´m a documentary filmmaker based in Spain, and I recently came across a very interesting character who claims to have designed a flying craft that works using gyroscopes as propellers.

He also claims that the whole motor could run on clean energies, such as solar, energy it draws from sound or hydrogen separation.

I don´t have a scientific, nor engineering background, but of course I suspect this is not a possibility or even if it is, it´s definitely not a very efficient one.

But then again he is a great documentary character and his ideas are very well intentioned and in line with the current times we live in, so there’s definitely a lot to talk about, even if his craft is completely bogus.

What I am trying to ask of this community is: is it possible to attempt any kind of somewhat doable / meaningful experiments around the technology this guy talks about, so that I can base the film around the process of these experiments and its outcomes or is this absolutely impossible?

Just want to test the waters as I am now set to develop the film and need expert opinions.

Also, any engineers that would like to take part in the project feel free to DM me.

56,Software engineering is a waste of time,1542726254,"Hi,

I’m in my first term of software engineering in University (Canada), and I can’t shake the impression that I’m wasting my time there.

When I am at home, I work on my side projects with Laravel + VueJS and it is a joy. I feel like I learn new things everyday, and my confidence goes up because I am actually creating something and building my skills.

But, as soon as I get to school, it’s back to command line Java programs and.... (shiver) graphical Java programs. On the other hand it’s interesting to do more advanced math and such, but, I just feel like university is impairing my ability to become the best programmer I can be.

Why is that? Because most of my time is being wasted by commuting, and deadlines for boring programs.

I have done 2 internships so far, the first one I was promised C# with modern infrastructure, but spent most of my 3-months doing VBA. (Gunshot to the head). The second one lasted 6 months and I was promised to use Python and do data science, but again, it was business intelligence analyzing Excel spreadsheets with no code being written.

When I imagined software engineering, I was thinking that I could work remotely and build unique products, and be creative. So far it’s just been cubicle work...

If anyone would like to comment on this and maybe change my view, I’d be glad to read it. Thanks!",AskEngineers,False,TopDawgTRP,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9ysxe5/software_engineering_is_a_waste_of_time/

58,Does anybody have any experiences with piercing wires for connectivity?,1542717768," **Tl; Dr**  
The strap can be adjusted freely until pierced with the pins, to provide connectivity with the sensor in the strap itself. Is it possible and virtually stable enough? Any ideas to alternatives?

**The reason:** I have to design a product, along with my group, which would be a solution for seizure detection for \[mainly\] epileptics. The sensors we are going to use are a photo sensor on the device itself and a pressure sensor.

Now, the pressure sensor has to be placed on an artery above a bone or any other place hard enough to be able to measure the blood pressure and heart rate.

**Why this sensor?**  
This sensor can potentially measure the exact curve of the systolic and diastolic pressure, also the dicrotic notch to a level of accuracy which resembles the measurement of an in-arterial measurement, but without being invasive - meaning it is outside of the body. This sensor can also provide continous measurement, meaning it can collect tremendous amounts of data.  
The data can then be analysed for research and gathering more knowledge about epilepsy.

**Why not only this sensor?**  
Provided this sensor is so accurate, it is also very sensitive, so virtually, even moving your hand 5 cm in the air would trigger it. Therefore it is possible to use for example during sleep, but during the daily activities it would produce technically unusable data.

**Placement of sensor**  
The placement of the pressure sensor would be optimal to be embedded in the strap. Although people have different wrist sizes, therefore we are to make some kind of a mechanism that allows some modularity. Having the strap slide through the watcch itself before being pierced through could allow a higher level of precision, plus having the pins on the opposite side (Not where I actually drew them) would allow the whole watch being strapped on, and placed before actually locking it in.

**The question**  
Is it possible to have a conductor embedded in the strap, which then can be pierced through after setting up the placement according to the person's wrist size?

**PS - I know my sketch sucks, but I hope it's somewhat possible to see what I mean.**

61,Choice between two jobs,1542700974,"A bit of background info. I graduated 4 years ago with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Based in the UK.

I have been laid off due to company collapsing a grand total of 3 times. So i am currently looking for my 4th job. Fortunately i have 2 offers - however im very conflicted which to take.

Distance and salary are at the forefront of my mind.

Ideally i want to be a design engineer. This has been the title of my last two roles and its what i want to do.


Job A. 
Commute time 30 minute drive each way. Salary £30k.
25 days holiday.
Role title “Mechanical Designer”
The role is quite CAD intensive for a niche industry. Very small company. Theres opportunity to develop some FEA skills but ultimately its CAD based design. My concern is this is a step back from “engineering”. 


Job B.
Commute time 1 hour drive each way (total 2hours + commute per day!). Salary £28.5k.
Only 20 days holiday. 
Title: Project Engineer
Role is also CAD intensive but involved prototyping, hands-on work  of products, work instructions, working with production line etc.
Its much closer to my previous role and is a natural continuation of my current skills.


So my main worry is whether its “worth” taking more money and a shorter commute for a job that seems much more pigeonholed. 
Would this be a bad idea; even if only for a year or two at this stage of my career? 
Id learn a decent amount of mechanical design as both companies have a lot of engineering capability with Job A manufacturing EVERYTHING in house. But id be the only Engineer by qualification. Everyone else is a PhD scientist of somesort or has a manufacturing shopfloor background. 

Job B has my colleagues and manager with a much more similar history.

When I lay my head down on the pillow with my ear facing the pillow, I can hear a faint vibration/humming sound that affects my sleep. 

Since it's a low frequency vibration, it's really hard to tell the source of this. I don't think it's a ventilation vent because I've already verified with the building on what vents there are (and it's not the vent that causes this issue). 

I am ***SUSPECTING*** that it's a neighbor's fridge that may be standing right next to the wall where my bed is (we have relatively thin walls), which would explain how the vibration is sometimes there, and sometimes isn't. If I lay my head down on the floor with my ears pressed onto the floor, I can hear and feel the vibration. But I cannot detect *where* it's coming from. 

Of course, I am not 100% sure, and I think it would be weird if I literally went to my neighbor and asked to go inside to see if it's her fridge causing a sound..

So my question is -- is there a type of engineer/worksman whose job is to figure out the source of a sound/vibration?

For example, earlier today I asked how we applied auto-scaling policies to one of our server groups, and whether or not the auto-scaling policy was based on a network load balancer that we set-up.

I will be graduating in June and received a job offer at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Sunnyvale, CA. Although my current major is aerospace engineering, the position is as an Associate Materials Engineer. There was no official written job description but I was given many examples of what people in my position have worked on.

Scott Morrison has caught himself bang in the middle of escalating tensions between the United States and China.

The US and Australia will share a naval base in the north end of Papua New Guinea on Manus Island, creating another key staging point close to the contested South China Sea.

“The United States will partner with Papua New Guinea and Australia on their joint initiative at Lombrum Naval Base,” US Vice President Mike Pence said.

“We will work with these two nations to protect sovereignty and maritime rights in the Pacific Islands. ”

 

At an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Port Moresby on Saturday, Mr Morrison urged nations to embrace free trade and avoid “unsustainable debt”.

He confirmed the US and Australia will share an expanded naval base on Manus Island, as the US ramped up rhetoric against China.

Mr Pence quoted President Donald Trump in his speech following Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“We have great respect for President Xi and respect for China. But in the president’s words, China’s taken advantage of the United States for many, many years,” he said.

“And those days are over.”

His speech was met with stony silence from the Chinese delegation, after President Xi had reassured leaders his Belt and Road Initiative was not a debt trap.

China has also been at loggerheads with the United States over its territorial ambitions in the Pacific, encapsulated by Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Unveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road initiative aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

China’s efforts to win friends in the resource-rich Pacific have been watched warily by the traditionally influential powers in the region — Australia and the United States.

After 8 hours on Tinkercad in one sitting, and a couple more in another - I finally finished my first project, and boy was I proud. This is really a viable solution, I said to myself - I'm going to invest in a higher quality program. 

I was suggested to use Selfcad, and got familiar through watching all of their tutorial videos. I said alright, let's do it, and bought a subscription: only to open up a program ENTIRELY foreign in every way possible from the one in THEIR OWN tutorial videos that for some reason they have left active!?

So that actually would mean that 188 red value, to our relative perception, is exactly half the brightness (luminance) compared to 255 red value, right? Then why does it says [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction) that:

""The human perception of brightness, under common illumination conditions, follows an approximate power function with greater sensitivity to relative differences between darker tones than between lighter ones. If images are not gamma-encoded, they allocate too many bits or too much bandwidth to highlights that humans cannot differentiate, and too few bits or too little bandwidth to shadow values that humans are sensitive to and would require more bits/bandwidth to maintain the same visual quality"".

So I am not clear with this. If 188 is exactly in the middle (relative brightness-wise) between 0 and 255, how come human eye distinguishes (by gamma encoding function) more steps between 0-188 compared to 188-255? *Because I see 0 vs 188 and 188 vs 255 to have equal brightness difference (of course if I look at perfectly calibrated 2.2 gamma screen)* So by that logic, there should be an equal number of steps between them?",AskEngineers,False,akisa91,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9yab9o/rgb_default_gamma_question/

20000calories/3minutes = 6667calories/minute=111cal/sec.

 

300watts = 1254Joules [300W*4.18J/sec]

1Joule = 0.239calories

 

For nichrome heating element in water the maximum Watt Density = 50-75W/Sq inch depending on the size of the unit.

Total element length is 6 inches (15cm) for a power output of 84J [1254J/15cm=84J/cm] which = 20cal/cm [84J*0.239cal]

 

For reference: a candle consumes 2mg of oil or wax/sec = 80W.  Temp of candle flame is 800c at the wick to 1400c at the tip.  Assume 2sq cm flame the average is 1100c/2sq cm or 550c/sq cm.

Compare to 6inches of element in an immersion heater producing 50W/sq inch=50W/6.5sq cm = 7.7W/sq cm (round to 8W/sq cm).

Candle is 40W/sq cm to produce visible light. Nichrome is at 8W/sq cm. 

 

40W/sq cm/8W/sq cm = 5. [candle is 5 times hotter than nichrome]. 

 

550c/sq cm [heat of candle]/5 = 110c for nichrome.

 

The 110c seems to hold up against the nichrome values used by the manufacturers (diameter of nichrome for different size heating units etc.).

 I ran the calculations against nichrome of different gauges and built it backwards to get a 300w unit and it comes out to about the same 110c, definitely not 500c“
————————————————

110c seems awfully low to me but I am not familiar with the subject. Are there any obvious flaws in the calculation? Is he running the numbers for the sheath rather than the element? If the watt density of the element is only capable of generating a temp of 110c why would these immersers overheat and self destruct when removed from water (dry fired). Any help with this would be appreciated l. Thanks.

28,"Is my job as a drafting engineer really worth it, career-wise?",1542559991,"Is my job really worth it?

I recently got a job as a contractor at a smaller company as a ""drafting engineer""... I make the engineering drawings that are used on the shop floors. It's a very technical job, but it doesn't feel like what I pictured engineering to be, I don't design anything, I don't use any math. I simply have 3d models sent to me and I create engineering drawings for them using NX. 

I get paid ~30k a year to do this (I live in Ohio for reference), been there for 4 months now. I am an undergrad, so I split this job with my schooling, which means I will graduate later than I normally would.

The thing that really drew me into it though, is that upon hiring me they opened an application for a government security clearance, which I successfully obtained a couple months ago. My company's main customer is a pretty big aviation company, who gets government funding to do secret R&amp;D on jet engines. Said aviation company has a secure site that I'll start working in very soon, since my clearance came through. It will be a very cool thing to be a part of, but again, I'll just be creating engineering drawings. I don't have any actual input on the designs. I'm doing a fairly important job but I don't know if it will lead to the job I want to actually have (design engineering). 

I will say that since I've started working there I have learned quite a bit, I can give a rough explanation on how jet engines operate, and I've been learning how GD&amp;T works. And I don't dislike my job at all, I get along with all my coworkers very well, my bosses like me, and overall I've been doing very well at the job itself. I've received compliments from several higher ups and from some of the customers themselves. 

I just don't know if this is the right place for me, career-wise. And this sort of doubt has been eating away at me for awhile now, because I don't really know who to ask about it. I found this sub today, and I knew I had to ask.

What would you do in my position?",1542540012,"I was the senior dev and de-facto lead on my company. The guy who takes charge and makes sure the team does the job, freeing up management from having to deal with the bad hiring decisions they made.

Eventually, when I figured out that my peers were earning the same amount of money in spite of me doing way more work and taking responsibility for a lot of tasks, I asked for a promotion and a raise.

The two company owners gave me both and put me in charge of a small team. From that moment on, I stopped one of my coworkers from ""offloading work onto others"" and started holding team members accountable for their work. Until that moment, they were acting like people who weren't responsible for anything and the company wasn't supposed to expect anything from them because ""they didn't like the job"".

One team member didn't take this well and started wreaking havoc behind my back, which included regularly talking to my boss and throwing shit on me without my knowledge. I had to either do the job for her or let her ask others to do the same. I didn't go for any of these so I became a target.

When owner A asked for feedback on her, I told him the truth, and owner B intervened in private with me and told me not to do anything about her ranting (especially talking to the other guy) otherwise she risked getting fired, and then proceeded to accommodate her requests. Eventually, he disbanded my team without saying a word. I was accused of not being able to deal correctly with a team member because I brought evidence of her wrongdoing and her irresponsibility to owner B's attention, as well as being told that ""I needed to learn how to deal with women, which are not the same as men"", cit.

A year went by. I told owner B (the one who disbanded my team) to put me back on the dev rotation or tell me my career was over so I would move out. He accommodated my request.

My request, however, forced others to start acting without a ""lead"", and several lack of skills and professionalism from my coworkers arose. What was owner B solution to this? After he run out of patience, he gathered everyone incriminated and told them the exact same thing I had a year before: ""each dev has to do their own job, *even if they don't like working for this company*. And if that means learning new skills, they better get down to it or leave"".

In addition, he's now trying to find a new lead/PM to put in charge of these people, completely and totally ignoring me. And you have no idea how humiliating is being in the same room with the people who triggered my demotion (my coworker + owner B) and being told that ""the company needs a lead""...

**EDIT:** extra note, the troublesome's coworker lack of skills at one point threaten a project. I had to do 50% of it, and she had to do the other 50% (roles were assigned by my boss, not by myself). We had to add a third person to help her out, so she got relegated to 25% of the project. Because I was a lead, I was not only doing my 50% but was also coordinating other tasks on other projects, so I had to do tons of overtime.

I didn't complain, mind you, but I was openly accused during one scrum meeting by this woman of ""doing too much OT, producing too much, and thus letting her behind and unable to finish her tasks in time"". After this, I suggested to my boss she be re-assigned to Team X after that project, as Team X had other rhythms and things couldn't go on like this.

My team got disbanded, I got demoted, etc. When I asked to be put back into the rotation, I was put on Team X. After the owner gave his speech to the troublesome employees about pulling their weight, you know where that woman got assigned? Team X.

59,Automating a gate (retrofit) problem,1542480335,"Heads up: Lots of questions, but any ideas are appreciated

Need to close and lock this already existing heavy gate.

Original thought was to have it roll across a motor, chain and sprocket. 

However, the moving side is facing outward, and building it outside of the gate means it could be stolen(not sure if people would steal a 100 dollar motor, chain and sprocket). 

The static side is inside, they don't need the gate to be 100% open, more like 60%. This means I could start with some of the moving side sticking out from the inside. I am currently at a loss with how to mechanically close it, there seems to be little to no room/packaging space for new additions when its in open position(and the gate is retracted).

Would like to treat this as a 'must solve' problem. I would like to cost it out.

Is there any point in your career were it's start to get easier?

What I mean by that is, is there a point in your career were you don't have to worry about job security al the times, and can just get a new (good) job with ease? Or were people just come to you and offer you jobs?

I've been working as an engineer for 3.5 - 4 yrs now (~1 yr at every job), in various industries (I don't care about the industry really, just that the job is in R&amp;D and that it pays well) and countries (my birth place is in the south, and it pays shit to engineers and work them to the bone, so I've been moving north, I'm on country 3 right now).

Until now getting a good job has been nigh impossible, it seems the only companies hiring young engineers (and really, the only growth market in Europe) is shitty outsourcing companies, were you get paid shit and are get treated like shit.

I wan't to think that I'm fairly competent, I've publications, 3 patents from previous jobs and always stellar reviews. That however never materializes in good conditions (up until now), and as my experience is all over the place I fear that I'm always looked down as an inexperienced hire.

Now I have a good job that pays (+/-) well and where I like what I'm doing, this was the 1st time that the company contacted me, I didn't apply to work there. The problem is, my company buys 2 other competitors... This could mean new opportunities, but when I hear the word ""Synergies"" being thrown around, I also think of layoffs in business units that intersect each other. I've been in the company for 6 months, and I fear that they'll chop off the new guys from all 3 companies and only keep the experienced engineers.

If that happens, I'll be back to doing endless interviews, IQ tests, personality tests, group dynamic test, tests testes tests, only to probably end up in a new shitty outsourcing company, because not having 7-8 yrs experience in engineering is almost a capital crime... Even my current position hired me with, with little experience in the things they do, only when they could not find an engineer with 5 yrs of experience (I've seen the original job postings).

68,Why must we compress refrigerants in a refrigeration cycle?,1542435518,"Consider the common vapor compression refrigeration cycle, which I'll outline below.

&amp;#x200B;

Liquid refrigerant flows through a throttling valve, thus lowering its pressure and causing evaporation. The evaporation absorbs heat from the remaining liquid, thus lowering its temperature. This cooled liquid-vapor mixture is then passed through the refrigerator interior, where it absorbs heat from the warmer inner contents (and becomes fully vaporized in the process). Next, we compress the resulting vapor to temperatures much higher than room temperature, resulting in a superheated vapor. The superheated vapor then passes through a condenser, where heat is released to the ambient and the refrigerant returns to the original liquid state.

&amp;#x200B;

Why must we spend so much energy in compressing and heating the vapor? Why not just let it run through an insulated warm pipe, where it will condense into a liquid again?

69,I just received a job offer for $10k to $15k under what I am worth. I need help with best way to negotiate.,1542429647,"tl;dr - Large company has 3 groups interested in me, one made an offer, but it is low and feels rushed.  Also, departments cannot compete with each other on pay, but I don't think the departments are communicating with each other.  If I decline the one offer, does another group get to select their salary without limitations of the previous declined offer?  I need negotiation advice.

Sorry in advance for the wall of text, but I needed to explain my situation.  I have been out of work for 5 weeks.  My last contract ended early.  I believe this company is low-balling me, and it has a reputation for not paying well.

I interviewed for position #1 and was told it would be 1 to 2 weeks before I heard back.  It went well and I would be surprised if I did not get an offer.  A few days later, I interviewed at the same site for position #2, which was a different department for a grade higher than position #1.  I mentioned that I interviewed for #1 to the people at #2 and I am told that if both managers are interested, they would determine a base salary that both were willing to pay and offer both positions at that one salary, so as to not compete against each other.

 #2 went well, but the HR representative wanted to know what I needed for pay.  I told her between $130k and $140k, which is slightly on the high side, but still near the median for my experience, location, and industry.  She scoffed at it and told me it was too high (which I expected).  She asked about PTO and I told her my last two positions gave me 4 weeks, and 5 weeks.  Her company starts even new grads at 3 weeks, but still she scoffed.

I was told it would be 1 to 2 weeks again.  But they sent me an offer less than 48 hours later and want a response in 3 days.  They offered me $110k, $10k signing, and 3 weeks PTO.  I know they never discussed their interest in me to position #1.  My last 2 jobs paid more than this, the signings were higher, and the PTO was higher.  I know I am worth $120k to $130k, but these guys are known to be cheap.  Through both interviews, they complained about how they cannot find people to fill their positions (we need to have security clearances as well).  I feel like they are high pressuring me with all of the things the HR person did (not all were mentioned), and a 3 day window to respond.

An hour after I received the offer, a recruiter from their company for another site and department called me to set up an interview for position #3.  I told him my dilemma, and he agreed that $110k was pretty low for my experience.  I want to see what that job has to offer, but nothing can happen until Monday, and #2 wants an answer on Monday.  Recruiter #3 is going to call recruiter #2 about getting me to interview, but he says he cannot compete with the offer of another group.

So, I plan to counter #2, but what do I ask for?  If I decline their offer, and #3 happens to make an offer a week after, are they no longer bound by the prior salary that I declined?  I need advice badly.  I am about out of money, but I don't want to accept a crappy offer.

I'm asking /r/AskEngineers because I would love some professional opinion on this matter.

I have tried to counteract the issue by getting some rubber dampeners. Two of them, in fact, stacked on each other, with a few layers of cardboard underneath so it's easier for me to move my bed around when I lay it down. 

It works in that it counteracts like 70-80% of the vibrations, but I still notice it, likely because I am a very light sleeper. Here's an [album](https://imgur.com/a/xlZgfDJ) of what it looks like.

2'x2'x.75"" AL plate. This plate sits flat on a large ice surface (so, *bottom* of the plate is in constant contact with ice).  Purpose of the plate is to melt said ice. The plate is pushed around on the ice, melting the ice as it goes.   

Challenge is to increase speed at which ice melts--IOW, how to get the highest heat transfer possible into plate?

There's unlimited access to the top of plate.  currently, there are propane torches blasting the plate's *top* surface.  there are also some fins on the top surface (machined narrow/shallow slots, and welded fins in-place).  I suspect most of the heat from the torches is simply lost to the atmosphere instead of being transferred into the AL.

* Heat source should be (1) 20# propane tank.
* prefer to re-use AL plate (Cu plate is $$$)
* high-efficiency is not critical.  most important is increasing heat transfer rate.  that said, want to improve the efficiency over the current design.
* Heat is lost thru bottom surface (in contact with ice).
* Can add things to top surface--fins, covers etc.
* Operated by a person, so can't be too dangerous.  but a little dangerous is fun.
* Yes this is a real, one-off device. so any design-solution will need to be fabricatable in our moderately equipped shop (welders, mills, cnc).  So no custom hyrdroformed heat exchangers...  :)

87,Need Advice on Selecting a Project Management Systems and Resources to Quickly Learn Some Basic Project Manager Skills,1542405973," 

I'm  an EE student working on a project that will require coordination  between many club members -- including CS, EE, ME, Chem, Physics, and  Math majors. I've never used a proper project management system before,  but I firmly believe that the only way that our club will be able to  reliably complete our project is with proper organization and  communication. The project is large enough that there are portions of it  that can be broken down into their own projects, but the teams working  on each portion will absolutely have to coordinate as design decisions  and progress from one team will affect the other team's decisions and  time frames.

Tentatively  we are using Discord for informal communication, and official  communications from club officers will be through email. Naturally,  being STEM students, we are all starved for time, including myself.

Does  anyone know of any resources, or software solutions, that could help me  organize our project. Some of the things I need to be able to do  effectively:

* Manage Inventory -- Our project will have a lot of individual parts, consumables, and equipment
* Create a chain of tasks, milestones, and goals.
* Ability to organize smaller teams and individuals.
* Ability to track team progress in the context of the above mentioned tasks, milestones, and goals
* The  means to help people figure out who they need to communicate with to  coordinate for related tasks, and the ability for teams to post  stickies, or private wikis, to provide status information and technical  specifications project components completed -- including designs,  testing of fabricated parts, and other specifications.
* Accounting  and record keeping to meet the requirements of our institution and the  organizer of the competitions we will be competing in.

My  goal is to create a system so that, as much as is possible, people can  ""plug-in"" when they have time, and other people are able to pick up  where someone else left off when appropriate. Like I said, I'm  unfamiliar with formal project management systems and software services  offered to assist. I have seen a tiny bit about Agile project  management, which seems to fit with my need for the system to be based  on iterations rather than firm dates (being a club project exact  completion dates are too uncertain).

We  need to keep costs down because initially our budget will be extremely  constrained. We need to make enough progress before we can attract money  required to make it to the project's completion.

96,How can I reduce the vibrations in my apartment when they are caused by washing machines/dryers outside of my apartment?,1542398096,"Hello!

My apartment complex has laundry units spread throughout the building. One of these laundry units is next to my apartment, sharing a wall. Whenever the washing machines are being used, my apartment vibrates and shakes a lot. I live in a studio and moved my bed closer to the kitchen area because the vibrations wake me up and I can't sleep. If I stand close to the source of vibrations, I start getting intense migraines as well. I don't like sleeping near the kitchen area because the stove/oven is only a few feet away from me and I'm scared something can happen at night but this is the only place that I can place my bed in that has the least vibrations (it still vibrates, just not as much).

I'm a college student and I still have a year and a half before I graduate and can move out, and the lack of sleep has been affecting my performance at school and affecting my moodiness. Is there anything I can do to my apartment to reduce these vibrations? I've tried adding anti-vibration pads to the four corners of the washing machines but they still vibrate too much and they're not mine to tinker with much. I got the anti-vibration pads from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GUYZWK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8)

Is there such a thing as an anti-vibration carpet/rug that I can just place all over my apartment? Otherwise, are there anti-vibration pads that are better than the ones I purchased that will definitely remove the vibrations from the laundry machines that I can buy?

I've complained to the apartment staff and the maintenance staff but I keep getting told that there isn't much they can do about the vibrations because they can't stop other residents from using the machines and they don't see anything wrong with the machines. All I want is to be able to sleep and relax in my apartment after a long school day without having to be afraid of the vibrations. 

I'll appreciate any suggestions you can give me on how to eliminate the vibrations.

1,"Got fired in a month due to ""not meeting expectations""",1542390421,"Hello Reddit,

I was just fired yesterday from a small company in an engineering field yesterday just after 6 weeks.

Long story short, the timeline from application to offer was just under 3 days. The HR person hyped the company up like no other and couldn't stop about how good the owner of the company was. Later the owner interviews me and they extend a offer right away on a very very low salary (disgustingly low for the state I live in)

During the entire month, I was extensively micromanaged by the owner delegating me the most menial tasks like shipping stuff or driving to pick up material or things which were in no way related to the post I was hired for.

I also got yelled at in front of the entire staff in the 3rd week for not picking up the things other departments were supposed to do as he got rid of the people in those departments as well.

And finally he called me in his office and let me go due to 'not meeting expectations' which is weird as I did anything and everything I was told to and always completed whatever I was told to. The weird part is the guy would compliment people one day and let them go the next day. I was routinely thanked for whatever I did from him and the next day he would just be in a pissy mood.

One of my coworkers called me the day after and said I'm better off away from the toxic environment which lays beneath the surface and he's looking for a way out as well.

This was my first position after almost 2 years of being out from the workforce due to immigration issues and not having employment documents. I worked in a very niche field before that and it is very hard to find something in the state I'm currently in. I was laid off from that job after 2.5 yrs as well.

Should I put this position on my resume or should I leave it out? I feel like 6 weeks is a very very short period of time to gauge someone.

Just feel totally hopeless as the 2 yr gap completely screwed me up and I'm back to square one now and this was my only core engineering experience

What mechanical properties of heat treated alloy steel (AISI-4140HT, AISI-4340HT) might be most closely associated with longevity of part against compressive failure?**

Dumbed down posit: We make a really giant fat screw. The screw end connects to the press, the head end is pushing a platen, a very large plastic drum is being made. For other customer's applications, failure happens in tension, but for this customer's application the failure occurs during compression. For tension failures, higher yield typically means less brittle parts, which generally mean better results. For tension failures we generally recommend UT testing to look for micro-cracks that will develop into larger breaks. Compression-failure customer is asking how we'd recommend predicting failure for their part. They have 10 screws that have been going more than 15 years; 2 have failed. My knee jerk response was to simply say that if 2 have now failed, the rest are probably soon to follow, but that answer isn't science-y enough for them, they are requesting a more formal way to predict failure. Going to call a metallurgist next, but I figured mighty reddit might actually be even more insightful and worth a shot for input! :)

**These are the assumptions that would need to be established in order to use any predictive methods - are there any I'm missing?**

1. Screws are all being used the same amount - same number of shifts working on each machine, etc. (establishing same amount of wear on all)
2. Screws are all being used for the same purpose (same compressive force being applied)

For threads that are designed to be used for lifting with eye-bolt on a circular component, these normally are spot-faced (counterbore) to provide a flat, smooth surface for the eye bolt to sit against.

My question is, is this an actual requirement or is there a standard that dictates that the sport-face is a required (and if yes, which standard is it?) or is it just something that is done as a best practice design choice?

13,Vacuum heating of fused silica,1542372451,"So we want to heat a fused silica substrate to temperatures of around half Tg, \~600C, &lt;800C, in a vacuum chamber.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that most heating elements have a an emissivity near to 1, thus radiate near to a black body. The peak irradiance at this temperature is \~&lt;3um, where silica does not absorb particularly, and the cavity which the silica substrate is held in is a steel with relatively high reflectance in this region. This means that the thermostat which is in the substrate holding cavity receives a large proportion of the emitted energy from the heating element and subsequent reflections and does not read a real temperature of the silica. Attaching an thermostat to the silica substrate surface offers the same problems, silver DAG does not do well in these temperatures and pressures but would be quite reflective to the radiation from the heating element. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I suppose this boils down to two questions:

 \- Has anyone any experience/success with heating silica in these conditions? (we are also considering using a CO2 laser as a heat source)

Fast forward to my crash course training and I realize my company is training me to be a full stack dev in 8 weeks after all I had talked about in my interview was how I wanted to learn about data analytics, AI, machine learning, etc. I have no interest in being a Java dev and I express this to my manager, who decides my best course of action is to teach myself how to be a data analyst but states that it'll be hard for me to transition because the company invested in me to be a Java dev. He then travels across the country to work on his project for 2 months. Someone who's opinion I trust and is established in the data science industry suggested I look for a new job in engineering as the experience and skills would be more valuable than staying at my current job. He also says I would need a Master's in some related field if I wanted to have a career in analytics or data science.

Problem:

Since then I've been applying to jobs in my interests (pharmaceutical manufacturing, material sciences, energy storage), but haven't been able to land an interview, despite a very good GPA and working my network. I'm assuming it's because my only experience is with an HVAC company, pretty much as the field technician's assistant. I swear I wasn't lazy in college, just needed to work a part-time job and as we all know an engineering degree takes up a lot of time. Because of that I never had time to do research with a professor or do an unpaid internship and I think that's killed my ability to get hired.

My Solution:

Quit my job, move home with my parents, work with a professor at a local college doing unpaid research in something I'm interested while I prepare for the GRE, look into graduate programs, search for TA positions where I could do graduate research while I get my Master's paid for. I have enough money saved up where this is possible and I've always loved learning so grad school has always been something that interests me.

I absolutely hate this job because I have no meaning here and I hate being stagnant/not making progress towards my own goals.

I'm just looking for some thoughts/opinions on my situation and would be more than willing to answer any questions! 

Thank you and I appreciate any feedback :)

32,Arduino/Launchpad project measuring 6 pH/Temps/Turbidities and transmitting over wifi,1542317837," Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on a project to cultivate microalgae in 6 vertical column photobioreactors (PBRs). I need to monitor the pH and Temperature of each PBR to maintain optimal growth conditions. Once algae is very concentrated harvesting can be done and this can be detected using a turbidity sensor, again 6 of them - one for each PBR. I have a £1000 budget for the project that needs to cover everything - pipes, growth medium, C02 etc. and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how best to do this.

My initial thoughts were to use an arduino with a shield to take care of all sensor interface, [like this one](https://www.whiteboxes.ch/shop/tentacle/?v=79cba1185463), but since we are going with six PBRs I can't afford to multiply this cost by 6. I have experience in analogue electronics and can handle signals if breadboard/PCB based interface electronics are required, but I'd ideally like to have this solution be as simple and prebuilt as possible. It would be an advantage to have the data transmitted over wifi and I already own a TI cc3200 launchpad xl and have the Energia IDE to program it like an arduino, I know that this can connect to wifi but I've never really done that before in C, I have only a little experience with communications and only UART.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to go about this project I'd appreciate it.",AskEngineers,False,Robinsinho,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9xfkae/arduinolaunchpad_project_measuring_6/

41,Seeking advice for measuring frost depth,1542313541,"I would like to build a device to measure ground temperature daily at five 30cm depth increments.  
  
For context, the driving purpose is to be able to predict whether the underground water and sceptic pipes on my acreage are at risk of freezing by monitoring frost depth. However, I love collecting and graphing data so I don't just want to bury a single sensor at 5' depth and alarm when it approaches 0 C (the depth of my shallowest water pipe). I'd like to use several sensors at varying depths so I can estimate the actual frost depth and have some fun correlating that to groundwater and weather data I'm already collecting with another device.  
  
I had planned to make 5 sealed capsules made of steel pipe and each containing a submersible temperature sensor and filled with automotive antifreeze. Then drive a piece of pipe of the same size and 6' long into the ground and then remove it, then push a capsule to the bottom, some styrospan insulation, the next capsule, more insulation, etc until I have all 5 capsules burried where I can pull them back out (by a nylon cord or steel cable attached to the capsule probably) to replace if a sensor fails. Then a raspberry pi in a box with a battery on the surface a few feet away will read the sensors periodically.

77,"New engineer, I need a reality check. Are these experiences at work abnormal, or am I in the wrong?",1542256546,"**Long version:**

I posted here a few months ago, and I've done my best to stick it out, but things really haven't gotten any better. A bit of background, I started this job back in June, and I really had no idea what I was doing. I still have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, but I guess I've become more comfortable with that feeling. The problem is everything about my job just feels very off*.* If you're curious, I originally posted here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/8up5tr/new\_engineer\_i\_have\_no\_idea\_whats\_going\_on\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/8up5tr/new_engineer_i_have_no_idea_whats_going_on_and_i/)

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've started, I've kind of been thrown around at different projects, never really doing anything. I was supposed to build an annotations database, but that got scrapped like halfway into development. I was also supposed to develop and manage a LIMS system, but that has been scrapped/put on hold. Some of this could be my fault for not moving fast enough, but I've been pretty overwhelmed. To give you an idea, these past 6 months I've learned R, Shiny, Flask, MATLAB, React/Node, AWS, VMWare, general devops stuff like nginx etc., deployed/managed the Atlassian stack, built my first full-stack web applications, developed/managed dev/app servers in VMWare and AWS, and built a bunch of tools for web scrapping, data curation and data analysis.  In addition I've had to learn a lot of neuroscience and I've also started building liquid-handling protocols using a Hamilton robot. I want to mention that I had virtually no experience with any of this prior to coming here.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the last 2 months or so, I was supposed to be working on building a machine learning pipeline for processing signals from neuronal cells. My boss has point blank said ""I want you to be the signal processing guy here"". I didn't know any signal processing or machine learning coming into this job and to be honest, I still don't. I had to learn wavelets, FT, FFT on my own, and I've been doing my best to learn as much ML as I can... but to not only learn all this in 1-2 months, but to also apply this knowledge in such a way that I can actually build some crazy ML model?  I don't know man, this just seems ridiculous to me. I'm not even mentioning the amount of neuroscience I've had to learn. Beyond that, I've been having to navigate the data acquisition from outside sources and integrating this into the ""pipeline"" through AWS and   
 having figure out how to decompile binarized signal traces in C (which I don't know). 

&amp;#x200B;

I get this is lengthy, but I just wanted to show how much I feel like I've had to learn and do these past few months. Maybe this isn't a lot and maybe my actual output has sucked, but it *feels* like a lot to me. Unfortunately, I am the only other engineer here (besides my boss), and I don't really have a good frame of reference to judge my output. It really seems like both my boss and everyone around me just thinks I'm completely useless. What they want/need is an electrophysiologist who is an expert in machine learning and can sling data science on the side for ongoing studies. I feel totally shafted, like my contribution has been meaningless because I haven't been doing sophisticated data science. on top of that, they really aren't paying me jack (especially for the Bay)*,* so overall I'm pretty bitter about the whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried communicating some of my concerns to my boss, but it really hasn't done much.  I've pretty much had to force my boss to have weekly 1-on-1s with me because I was hoping he would provide more direction, but he has cancelled them on multiple occasions. As of right now, we are supposed to meet 'ad hoc', but it really just feels like he doesn't want to deal with me.  If I don't swing by his desk I can go literally *weeks* without talking to him. I get he's very busy, but I could definitely benefit from some more direction. I have also been very upfront with him about my concerns, but I haven't had much success. Overall, I definitely feel like I'm working on an island. I have tried taking the initiative on projects, but most of the people here are Stanford PhDs in neuroscience and I have neither the experience nor authority to lead them in anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, all of this is culminating in a presentation my boss wants me to give the first week of December, showcasing my ""Neuronal Signal Machine Learning Pipeline"" and there's absolutely no way I pull this off. I really don't know how to convey this to my boss and if I come up empty handed coming this December, I don't think it will be very good for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr**

I feel like I've done and learned a lot, most other people around me feel differently

I'm supposed to build a machine learning pipeline that processes the signals from neuronal cells, no experience in any of this (and I'd probably be making like 300k a year if I could am I right?)

Don't have any support network or guidance from pretty much anyone.

94,Energy Usage of humidifiers,1542236754,"Quick question about the energy usage of different types of humidifiers.

There's a lot of articles saying some types of humidifiers are more efficient than others. The comparison is made by looking at how much energy is pulled from the plug vs how much water is evaporated.

I feel like this is not a fair comparison, though - bypass humidifiers are getting the energy to evaporate from the air that runs through them (thus lowering air temperature, requiring more heating from the HVAC system), so it can show 0 coming from the plug, or ""free"" humidification, whereas steam humidifiers are effectively helping the HVAC system by providing their own energy, but looking incredibly inefficient if you look at the power they pull.

This of course assumes that HVAC heat vs Humidifier heat cost the same (same energy source / no heat pump - though heat pumps may not have the heat necessary to use a bypass humidifier in the first place).

I am also ignoring the fact that you need to heat a whole canister of water before steam comes out, so if you just need a little bit of humidity and then let the canister cool down, it'll look less efficient as well.

5,How to compare dynamic data sets,1542224900,"Hey all,  
  
I'm working with flight data from a simulator. I have two data sets. One from the baseline of my system (which I know is correct,) and one from an updated version of the system. I am trying to compare the two versions and make sure that my changes (basically, the simulator was rewritten. Not entirely, but a lot of it was.) were all valid and produce a similar output.  
  
For example, for an aircraft on the ground being put through a test (a wiggle.) The control surfaces are tested. We are looking at the rudder deflection.  
In the baseline, a rudder deflection of 5 degrees is commanded at t = 5 seconds.  
In the new version, a rudder defelection of 5 degrees is commanded at t = 6.2 seconds.  
  
In this case, I can shift the data by 1.2seconds and compare. No problem, the difference between the responses is under some (arbitrarily defined) threshold, I'm happy with this. But there's a problem-- I can't do this for every test point, I'll be testing for the rest of my life.  
  
So my initial solutions were going to be related to standard deviation or averages. I implemented a quick solution by computing a moving average and finding out when that initial change actually occured. But there's another problem. This methodology only worked for static conditions. What happens when I'm flying this aircraft at 10k ft, and I perform a maneuver that causes a change in altitude of ~5000 feet in 10 seconds? Standard deviations or averages would be screwed up then.  
  
So I'm trying to find a way to programatically look at this (often dynamic) data and decide whether or not this new version is producing data similar to the old version.  
  
I'd be happy to try and clarify anything I was unclear about if that will help.

11,The biggest size possible for a mechanical spring?,1542221442," 

Hello r/AskEngineers!

I am studying technical engineering in Århus, Denmark so please bear with me if my written english isn't perfect.  
I'm currently investigating mechanical springs and it's different abillities, and was wondering about the ""Spring Constant \[N/m\]"". My question is, if there is a limit for how big and how tough you can make a spring? Just for info i'm picturing a spring with the size of a 10 story building. I know it can be a problem with the gravity pulling the weight of a tall spring, but i guess you can make a casing for it så it can lie horisontally.

Thanks in advance, hope you ""get"" what i mean and have the experience to answer my question.",AskEngineers,False,TheMumbler78,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9x2wdr/the_biggest_size_possible_for_a_mechanical_spring/

14,Mechanical Engineers working with circuitry?,1542216539,"Hi all,

So I'm a second year Mechanical Engineering student. I'm currently taking an circuits class in the EE department, because I really like the portion of my freshman general engineering course where we tinkered with circuitry and Arduino (think Sumo Robots) so I wanted to pursue it further. 

I've largely been disappointed, as the class has pretty much been an extension of the circuits portion of Physics II (i.e. all theory and calculation) combined with signal analysis, whereas I was hoping for some more of the hands on electrical work I was exposed to last year.

My question is -- is it possible for a mechanical engineer to have a job that combines mechanical design with circuit design and programming? Does anyone have experience with a job like this? Would I need to go to grad school? I've heard of the Mechatronics field, but I'd like to avoid grad school unless it's absolutely necessary.

Thank you",AskEngineers,False,T_D707,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9x25fr/mechanical_engineers_working_with_circuitry/
15,"Yeah, more career advice",1542216095,"I'm hoping for some useful opinions or analysis.

I've been in my present job for a little over ten years.  It's a small engineering firm with a bit of global reach.  I'm probably third in line to running the place but don't play management most of the time.  I'm currently training the bosses son on my side of the work (process).

Everyone here works well together.  The boss is a good person who puts up with what I want out of my time damned well.  I *like* him besides.  He's a better business man than me but...he's cheap.  It's a near critical failing but it does keep our doors open when things are really interesting out there like the last two years were.

I don't ""want"" to leave however the situation is a bit unstable.  I have split custody with my daughter and her mom is likely moving to the city down the way in the next two years (I see her getting that promotion unless something crazy happens, she's damned good at what she does).  If that happens I either move there with her or we end up back in court to determine who gets residential custody.  It'll be messy and a serious tossup with nasty ramifications for our getting along and my kid isn't going to like anything that splits us so far apart that they don't get to see either mom or dad regularly.

So.  My pay isn't great, but it's pretty good for the rural area I'm in, but I have job security in spades.  This summer I got an offer from a firm in the above city for about $30k more than I'm making right now.  That's pretty significant, but I'd lose all that job security and move to a firm famous for purges.  I'm middle aged so I can make one more change like that and have it work out but it also may be shooting myself in the ass if things didn't work out well.

I told my boss about the offer, he said we were getting raises in October and ""I don't know how I'd run this place without you"".  He's also right that it'd be a terrible burden on them if I left abruptly.  In the past this place has engendered enough loyalty that people who leave will put in six months or up to two years transitioning.  I'm not sure he wouldn't be so pissed about me leaving that it would be uncomfortable but...he's taken damn good care of me for the last decade.

The raise he gave me was $10k.  It's not a pittance but compared to $30k and the issue with keeping my kid close and happy makes it just shy of insulting.  We've got literally our best year ever going right now.  He tends to make up via bonuses on good years, and that means I'm looking at 15-25% instead of 5-10% as a bonus (the bonuses are a big deal here).

It's also entirely likely that when he retires in about ten years or so that I'm going to be running this place with his son working under me.  Or vice versa but the only reason I'm not wearing a ""VP"" tag right now is the lack of necessity since I only have one direct subordinate and the draftsmen only come to me when the guy down the hall is out.  Etc.

I feel like I should push him for more money and leave it at that, but I'm also concerned that it might introduce excessive volatility in my work place.  The boss is also quitting tobacco right now and...well...that makes it a bad time for almost anything.  I love the guy but when he blows up about something I'd rather not be in the room.  I'm practically the designated ""tell the president he's wrong"" guy who gets to smile at him when he's yelling and tell him that yes, this has been messed up for decades and conservative calculations are the only thing that has saved our asses on it up until now etc.  

____________________________________________

So.  I want more money and it's close to ""need"" level to make things work out vs taking the job down the way...unless I'm being an idiot abandoning my position here.  I just don't see a way to bring up the pay issue without introducing excessive stress into the working relationship for a significant amount of time and I may not get anything out of it either.  That said, it'd keep me here and he'd want to know.  If it weren't something that really needs brought up before much more time passes (due to the recent raise and the other company's position not being filled yet) I'd just let it go for a month until Christmas rolls around and everyone is in a better mood.

17,What specific engineering roles or industries provide the least amount of stress and the most fulfillment?,1542214582,"I've been working as a process engineer in bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing. Our organization divides Engineering into ""Frontline"" and ""Backline"". Frontline focuses on emergent needs (ex. equipment failures, like for like replacements, deviations, etc) and Backline focuses on project work. The lines have become increasingly blurred, and largely in favor of Backline, resulting in added expectations from Frontline to support Backline work, but not vice versa. 

After 2 years in Frontline I'm completely burnt out. The combination of 24x7 on-call support, undefined work flows, and the endless red tape in this industry keeps me constantly stressed. The burnout has reduced my personal life to rubble and my only motive force at work appear to be stress and fear of getting fired. 

This is my first Engineering role and I can't imagine this is the norm. I want to leave but have no clue what else is out there or what to expect. I want a healthy work-life balance (i.e. 50hr/week) and my work to be fulfilling.

I've worked two internships, and am personally unhappy with the job prospects of Biomedical Engineering.

Before the *inevitable* flurry of ""quit complaining, it isn't all about the money,"" I do ardently believe in being paid what I am worth as an employee.

My coworker claims you can estimate greater than half of the indicated scale so the above example would have a resolution of 0.1 units, therefore a measurement between a 1 or 2 could be 1.4 or 1. 6 units. This seems much too subjective and non-reproducible to me.

you can see the area has enough meat to drill to the next size up of 8mm. my question is

-do I just use an 8mm thread tap to enlarge the hole?
-do I need to use a 7mm to clean up minor bits in there before tapping?

im not considering helicoils because the exhaust bolt needs to come out every so often for maintenance (brakes/tires)

-also...best way to keep the tap straight while going in?

In soccer (association football), the biggest stadiums in the world like [Wembley](https://www.muralswallpaper.com/app/uploads/wembley-stadium-football-sports-plain-820x532.jpg) in London (capacity of  90,000), the [Camp Nou](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rpZ2K8Y3HYhJcGw4KLrz8g.jpeg) in Barcelona ( 99,354), or the [Azteca](http://www.stadiumguide.com/wp-content/uploads/azteca_top.jpg) in Mexico City (87,000) go all the way around (i.e. no horseshoe design), and the top-level seats (aka nose-bleeds) seem to be nauseatingly high in the sky. There does not appear any way to cram extra seats into these already massive stadiums.

Meanwhile, NCAA college football stadiums in America have consistently much higher capacity, and still seem to have ""leftover space"".

61,How difficult/expensive would it be to increase a car's useful lifetime?,1542140958,"Or more specifically the engine/transmission. If you replace the parts, the car will obviously continue going. But most cars seem to be doomed to the scrap heap after about 150,000 - 200,000 miles. My transmission blew out today (looks like the clutches in the planetary gearset), so with me being a mechanical engineering student, I started wondering on why these things fail at this mileage range and not 400,000 miles or something, especially since this typically means end of life for the entire car.

I know parts wear. So a significant amount of mechanical components are doomed to fail at some point anyway (like brakes, tires, etc). But not every part wears at the same rate or has the same amount of maximum wear before failure. Besides, there is industrial equipment that keeps chugging on and on and on and on like the energizer bunny for multiple decades, so SOME stuff is capable of it at least. Is it a matter of the limits of current materials science and technology in that particular part? Is it because so many people don't care about repairing perfectly good used equipment that is otherwise fine that makes it hard to justify any extra cost for increasing lifetime? Is it just a matter of the price point of manufacturing coming to a good ratio of life expectancy per dollar spent at that point (similar to how tighter tolerances get ridiculously more expensive the tighter it gets)? I know my car was 10 years old and drove 155,000 miles, but I was satisfied enough with a paid off car that got me from point A to point B even if it wasn't the newest and shiniest thing available. Scrapping thousands of pounds of metal because one part hits end of life feels extremely wasteful if the friction material in a gearset clutch/band could just simply be made thicker to wear longer or something. But I feel it's not that simple or it would have already been done. There's always a tradeoff.

Or is the simple answer to keep sales going? A scrapped car requires a replacement, meaning a car must be manufacturered at some point to replace it. If another brand doesn't significantly outlast your brand at the same price point, there's nothing to stop the company from purposefully keeping the lifetime low.

94,[Structural] Can parking cars next to a modern building cause vibration damage?,1542063131,"I work at a 3-story school in a developing country.  The school was built  in 2009 as a development aid project by the government of China.  I don't know what, if any, specific building standards they adhered to.  To my untrained eye, it seems to just be a normal modern building made with concrete, rebar, etc.  

We have been asked recently by the local government (none of whom are trained construction or engineering professionals) to stop parking near the building because vibration from our cars could cause structural damage to the building (cracks in the concrete, etc.). 

We're talking like 15 or so ordinary cars parked in a paved lot around 10 m from the school building.

At the same time, at any given moment during the school day there is around 300-400 high school students walking around inside the building. 

My question is, wouldn't hundreds of students walking around cause more vibration then a dozen or so cars parked in a parking lot around 10 m from the building?

And if the building was so fragile that cars cannot safely park near it, doesn't that mean it is fundamentally unsound and should not be holding hundreds of kids?

It is true that there are cracks all over the place despite the building being relatively new, but nobody here has any expertise to determine whether they amount to serious structural damage or just cosmetic damage.  Also, nobody knows the cause of the cracks.

I realize that this question is rather vague, but I hope it makes sense.  The reason that I am asking is that I want to be able to make a case that the cars aren't an issue, and if they are an issue, then the building may be unsafe and we should pay to bring in some pros to evaluate the structural integrity of the building.",AskEngineers,False,oryxmath,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9wj4c4/structural_can_parking_cars_next_to_a_modern/

96,Why do my ode45 solutions differ so much based on my tspan? [xpost /r/MATLAB],1542061277,"I asked this in /r/MATLAB but I figure you guys might have come across such a situation as well. As a background, I am running a 2nd order ODE with 8 state variables and using ode45. The system parameters and solver options were given in a journal article that I am trying to reproduce results from.

However, what I've noticed is that the zeros of my solutions differ a lot depending on my initial time input t0 in tspan (as given [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html) in the doc under *tspan*). The four t0s i've tried are t0 = 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, and chose a timestep of 0.001 to report values i.e. tspan = t0:0.001:45.

With the understanding that by changing the t0, ode45 is adaptive and therefore chooses its own timesteps, I also forced the following ode45 options:

* AbsTol = 1e-6
* RelTol = 1e-6
* InitialStep = 1e-9 
* MaxStep = 1e-3
* NormControl = 'on'

Further background: the equations tend to a singularity at t0 = 0 and the initial trend shows high frequency oscillations, therefore I chose a small timestep after 0 and chose an extremely small InitialStep.

The plots are given below (I apologise if they're not formatted the same, I forgot to resize my window before saving the plot):

[t0 = 2.0](https://i.imgur.com/hxMj1H8.png)

[t0 = 1.0](https://i.imgur.com/iEaja0t.png)

[t0 = 0.5](https://i.imgur.com/XEUXkgb.png)

[t0 = 0.25](https://i.imgur.com/V5UfeyV.png)

Note how the zero of the solution between 30-40 changes with t0. I suspect the high frequency oscillations are resulting in some errors due to some numerical schemes that propagate downstream, so using different t0 values result in whether or not the high frequency oscillations get integrated properly.

98,Which of these three described compositions will successfully bond with polystyrene in an anaerobic environment without dissolving the material?,1542059068,"I am redoing a bath surround, and the walls underneath. I'm not asking for advice on how to put up walls or do plumbing, etc.

I am specifically asking about the relationships between certain construction adhesives which I will describe and list, and the surfaces that they need to successfully bond together.


First, the surfaces to mated are dissimilar, although they are both non-porous. 

One surface is made from polystyrene. The other is a glass-fiber cementatious product.

I am not concerned with the bonding potential of the cementatious product, so much as I am concerned with the polystyrene product.

The problem arises because of the majority of tub surround specific adhesives do not bond well between two non-porous surfaces, I think because of the need for air curing and release of the solvents they use that is limited when dealing with two non-porous surfaces.

I have found other adhesives that can handle two non-porous surfaces, but they mention a limitation in that they should not be used with polypropylene, polyethylene, bitumen, or similar products. I know that polystyrene has a different chemical structure, but I don't know if it is different enough, or too similar.

The adhesives I have assembled with potential compatibility and specific use viability and what I have learned of them:

1,How can I put lenses in a waterproof camera enclosure and ensure that they won't leak?,1542055220,"Hi guys, I am currently in the (very) early stages of designing and building a waterproof camera case. I'm kind of stuck on how to design the body of the case in a way that will let me insert the lenses once it is 3-d printed. There will most likely be an o-ring around each lens.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering building the case in two parts (bottom and top) so that the lenses can be inserted on  one half and then the entire thing can be sealed. I'm concerned though about the integrity of the waterproofing seal at the point where the o ring around the lenses would connect with the gaskets that would seal the case. I attached a pretty basic picture showing the bottom part of the case. The ridges around the case are where the gasket will go, and there will probably be grooves in the cylindrical lens cutout that will also fit an o-ring

I want to calculate the force applied to a hose clamp around a tube, when a given force is pulling on it from one side.
To elaborate: a hose clamp sits on a tube. The housing of this clamp is obviously the weakest part. The housing is at 0°. The force is pulling perpendicularly to the tube at 180°. If the force is 1000N, can I just take a clamp, cut it in half and apply 1000N on it to see if it holds? Are there other factors at play, because of the tube, that is absorbing some of it?

30,Relay for shifting solenoid,1541992647," I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit because I do not use reddit that often but here's the problem:

I'm currently working on a senior design project where I'm in charge of the all things relating power distribution on a car at my university. We use a 12V battery that is continuously being charged by the stator. The solenoid that is being used for electronic shifting draws about 100-120A for about 5-10ms when the upshift/downshift takes place. The 35A relays that we used in the past have burned up the contacts so then we used 60A relays and they worked just fine.

The manufacturer gives us a 40A slow blow fuse which also works fine for the solenoid but I am confused as to why the 60A rated relays (one for the upshift and the other for the downshift) do not burn up despite the current being extremely large for a very short amount of time.

Is there any kind of analysis that I can do to prove that the 60A relays work when a current higher than its rating flows through the relays' coils? If so, how can i justify that these relays will work?

Here is the datasheet for the relays that burned up [https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/378/301-2555.pdf](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/378/301-2555.pdf) and here is the link to the relays that worked just fine [https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/378/301-2555.pdf](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/378/301-2555.pdf)

34,How to calculate air speed required to make convective heat transfer as fast as conductive heat transfer?,1541971596,"I'm working on a project to recycle plastic into useful items in the developing world and am curious about how methods of heat transfer affect the rate of heat transfer.

Yesterday I melted a couple trays of shredded Polypropylene by putting them in the oven at about 200 on the middle rack. It took maybe a couple hours to melt (the process has been more tinkering than science at this point).

Today I set the temp to about 130C and placed the trays on the floor of the gas oven, which (with the flame underneath it) is obviously much hotter than the oven air temp. These, as expected, melted considerably faster than yesterday and therefore probably saved a non-negligible amount of gas. 

When I eventually build a much larger-scale oven, it will end up being a large convection oven with horizontal airflow between the flat racks/moulds which will recirculate through a heating chamber, as this will allow for a much higher production rate. The concern, now, is that it will be very slow and lots of fuel compared to metal-to-metal conduction. 

So, my question is, how would I figure out what air speed is necessary in order to make the convective heat transfer from air to solid similar to (or even faster than?) from fired-solid to solid? This would help me to choose the fans that I use, as well as the ultimate size of the oven. 

p.s. I'm aware that its actually still conductive heat transfer from air to solid, but the convection is necessary to make this happen at any appreciable rate.

I am a Pakistani female. This coworker is a white male. We are among the few young people at my work (in our 20s). Anyways, this guy basically always ignores me in group convos, and isnt very inclusive (like he will ask invite other people to walk around the campus with him right in front of me without inviting me). The only time he will talk to me is when he wants to tell me about his South Asian friends...

So the other day at work, he was ignoring me once again while only talking to the girl who sits by me, when the topic of his Indian Sikh friend came up. NOW he began including me. He then proceeded to say things like, ""All my Indian guy friends tell me that they do not wanna marry Indian girls, and that they wanna get with white girls because that is seen as 'making it', since white girls are seen as higher social status. They said South Asian girls have low status and only get with them as a last resort...""

Idk why, but that whole exchange made me feel kind of upset. First of all, I have never heard the South Asian guys I know say this sort of thing, nor have their actions ever indicated such an opinion (and when I told him this, he seemed kind of...unpleasantly surprised?).

Most importantly, I felt kind of weird that this random white dude who NEVER includes me is all of sudden ""informing"" me that girls of my race are essentially seen as...undesirable.

My past 5 or so years of work were for an operator where I did little engineering and more small project management and operations program implementation. I am not a fan of this work and so I made my mistake.

Recently, I moved to an engineering firm working exclusively on oil and gas projects but where I am performing engineering work for customers and can actually see my skills as marketable and transferable outside the industry. 

My SO and I don't want to stay in Houston much longer and are trying to position ourselves in new industries and locations with as little impact to our careers as possible. I'm wanting to scale back my workload within 10 years to travel the country, which is very challenging with a desk job.

1. If I have between 2 and 4 years experience working for an engineering firm in O&amp;G (with another 6 years of experience prior), will I be able to get a job working for an HVAC firm?

To be brief, I had originally planned to attend medical school after graduating but I’ve realized that I am not happy working in the healthcare field and would like to change my career path. I want to study electrical/computer engineering and hopefully pursue a career in robotics/AI or software design after graduating. 

Ideally, I want to apply to graduate school for master’s in electrical engineering but am not entirely sure how to go about it since I did not study engineering in undergrad.

I know some schools allow you to make up prerequisite work prior to starting the master’s program. But how can I make myself a more competitive applicant – what skills/languages should I be learning right now such as Python/basic machine learning courses?

The color is green but that could mean anything these days, I read a story about a guy that took his car to a dealer and they topped his radiator off with a different coolant and the two mixed together to form a solid in his radiator thus cutting capacity down by 50%

I looked up a bottle of coolant test strips and they appear to be just like the Soil ph strips which I have tons of. On the side of the bottle online it has what looks like 7 as OK which is a light green and dark green as Ok as well. Yellowy green and yellow are both in the Unsatisfactory range.

I know there are newer, longer lasting coolants but since it is an old car (Honda Civic Sixth generation) I am unsure as to what I should do.

No, it's not as a professor or a teacher, as many seem to assume, but it's more of a staff member role. Think of it like Howard's job in The Big Bang Theory. During my graduate school work, I've applied for some jobs and got some interviews (though not a whole lot), and I figured I'd try applying for a position at my alma mater. To be honest, they were really the first ones that responded to my searching, so rather than take a risk and wait for a job out of state, I just got a local job here at home (my school is in my hometown, and it's also the same as my undergraduate). Take what you can get and all that. In some ways, I thought that this was an unusual choice. People (me included) seem to have the idea of getting a job outside of your hometown and making lots of money. Obviously, that didn't happen here. I mean, I like my job, especially all the benefits that come with it, and while the pay is alright (I really don't like to compare myself to my peers, so I'm not so sure what is the appropriate amount), sometimes I think that due to my choices, I might be limiting myself and my 'potential'. I had ideas of a dream job once, but after working in the role for a while, the drive feels...no longer there. I was wondering if there were other people that could share their experience here about having their first job be in academia, if there are any.

I get paid more than the majority of junior engineers (but less than mid-level), but the majority of people that I graduated with are more successful than I am, even within the same company - without moving around, getting graduate education, or working as many hours.

My name is Daniel, I'm 27 years old and I was born complete deaf in both ears. I've had a cochlear implant fitted on my right ear which helps me hear everything. Great piece of technology.

 I like playing computer games a lot, especially shooting games such as PUBG, COD Black OPS, Counter Strike etc. So I use one audio cable that connects from my laptop to my implant so I can hear everything within these games I've mentioned.

Unfortunately most of the time I get incredibly frustrated when I play these games because whenever I get shot at, I can't determine where the gunshots are coming from. I end up running in circle or running away hoping I could escape/determine where they are by looking at where the bullets land. (Sometimes when I run away, I actually run towards enemies shooting at me.... they probably think I'm stupid.)

Also I hear footsteps, but cannot hear where they're coming from, whether if it's upstairs or outside etc.

So having highlighted my problem above, I was wondering if it's possible to build something like, I don't know how to describe it or what to call it, a visual speakers - maybe a circular which lights up where the sound is coming from.

Would this stress the battery too much over time or could it work fine with the right IG chip?
How would the circuit look to make it most efficient?
A thing I've also considered is having a physical switch that can turn of the connection with the battery so that the unit might charge faster or get more efficient power. Maybe let it charge via another route on the circuit board that is then switched on by doing this.

I am an employed young software developer and I think that I am somehow struggling with my current workplace, and a career in general.The main problem is that every time I need to start with a programming task, I get some kind of repulsive feeling in my stomach.  It feels so hard and unnecessary to perform such tasks. Often I am postponing and dodging my programming activities and do something else under pretension that it's important. As a result my productivity is bad. I dodge interaction with my coworkers, but when I have to communicate with them, I strive not to talk about work-related topics. During team meetings I am not interested in topics of discussion and most of the time I am mentally absent. My mind either goes blank or I think about something completely irrelevant. I feel that I am going to work only so that I can go back home. During the work, one of the most horrible things is watching on time, as it feels a whole eternity until the shift ends. Then, every time when I see an envelope on my work desk, I start to feel somewhat happy and anticipated because I think it's an employer's notice for contract termination. However, when I  open it and realize that is not the case, I become somewhat disappointed.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have to admit that my attitude on workplace isn't always bad, or equally bad at least. In fact, sometimes it may be OK, but I believe that it really depends on the mood, which I think it can change a lot, even on a daily or hourly basis. But in general it can help if I drink coffee or energy drinks. This way I somehow manage to force myself working in a more productive mode. Still, my disinterest, or low feeling, or bad mood or tiredness or low energy or whatever mood I am experiencing  won't really go away, but maybe it gets damped a bit. It may also become easier to handle these mentally intensive tasks and also decision making, which I believe  that I in general struggle at.

Now the tricky part. I went trough few development jobs so far - in either software or hardware engineering - and the situation was pretty much the same as described above. Finally I quit a job or I got fired. In any case, I felt a lot of relief when those struggling house-to-work routines finally ended. The only job that I was successful at it as a whole, was

Now the even more tricky part. One of my hobbies should be development of computer games, and you know what - here I may have some similar problems to those in my career as well.

83,Any tips or advice for a Electric GoKart project for a high school engineering club?,1541828946,"\*Not sure if this is is the right place to ask this question, if it's not please direct me towards the right spot.\*

**A Bit of Background**

I'm a high school student and I founded and run the Automotive Engineering club at my school, I have been trying to provide the kids at my school who are passionate about the AE industry with oppourtunites to learn as there is no auto shop course or actual shop on our campus.

My biggest struggle is trying to find projects for my students to work on, so far I've had them work on lawnmower engines (taking apart, etc). We have fundraised enough money and are planning on purchasing a transmission for us to study off and reverse engineer to see what we can learn. But my ultimate goal is to get these kids to work on a entire engine, or work on a miniture Formula 1 style car, such as those seen in events such as FSAE. But, those plans/dreams are a long ways away in terms of funds, organization, etc.

**My Idea**

So after trying to find something for us to work on as a project, I thought it would be a interesting and unique challange to try to build a electric gokart.

Essentially I want to be able to build an electric gokart thats rather speedy for a relatively low price because our group is tight on funds but are in the process of fundraising, looking for grants, etc.

I've done some research on my own and found the basics on how to get started; get an electric motor, some batteries, etc but my reasoning for creating this post is to ask for some tips and advice for this project. Such as, but not limited to

* Where I could find parts for cheap or free?
* Resources to study to get educated on the process?
* Any funding oppourtunites for a project like this?
* Where to start?
* What to stay away from?

... etc, you get the idea.

88,Potentual Job at Northrop Grumman in Arizona,1541813958,"I have been trying to find opportunities at Northrop Grumman in Chandler, and in Gilbert, Arizona.  Northrop Grumman recently purchased what was Orbital ATK (which was Orbital Sciences a few years before merging with ATK Thiokol).  I interviewed with NG this week for a position in one department, and I have another interview next week for another department.  I may be getting interviews at the Gilbert facility soon as well (according to the corporate recruiter I spoke to).  I would be super surprised if I did not get an offer.  I have questions for people who may know how things as run there at the moment, especially since the Orbital ATK ways are still prevalent until the NG ways become adopted over time.

First, OATK has engineering positions defined that do not line up with most aerospace companies I am familiar with.  That might change as NG makes changes going forward, but for example, their Principal Engineering position, or maybe even their Senior Principal Engineering position, kind of lines up more with a Senior Engineer at other places.  Their Senior Engineer lines up more with an Engineer II or III at other companies.  I believe, with my experience and my prior positions (12 years out of school) that Principal or Sr. Principal would line up with me better than Sr. Engineer.  The requisition I interviewed for was a Sr. position, but they said that the level could change based on my experience and salary requirements (they also opened the exact same requisition for a Principal just before I completed a phone screening, which I also applied to right after it opened).

What I need to know is what a realistic pay range I can expect for either the Sr., Principal, or Sr. Principal positions.  I heard they do not pay as well as at some other companies currently.  Are they offering signing bonuses for candidates currently?  The last company I worked at in the region with similar products gave me a pretty decent salary and $15k signing bonus, plus another $5k or more for relocation.

Is there anything I should know about them to help me leverage a better salary, and what the ranges are?  With my last positions, and all of the research I have done online and talking to 3rd party headhunters, I think my value in this area, industry, etc. is $130k to $140k.

97,Problems working for professors?,1541793501,"What has been your experience working for companies led by professors? I'm considering implementing a No Professors rule for my own career. In the past few years, during and immediately following grad school, I worked for several companies. The two that were led by professors were in a (lower) class all their own.

In the first company, the professor was very easily distracted. The company had a core team of a few graduates from the professor's lab, and all other employees would last a few months on average. The grad students had developed methods for circumventing the professor's chaotic instructions and in general everyone tried to avoid the professor/CEO as much as possible. This professor also liked to see what they could get away with. They would literally stop paying people, students and employees, and see how long it took them to complain.

The second company had a different professor as CEO and one of their graduates as CTO. I was actually much more optimistic about working for them, but then I got their offer. They have about twenty employees, and every single one has a PhD. They hired a friend of mine as their first hardware engineer, and they offered me a job as their second hardware engineer. We were supposed to be a two-person team doing the same job. My friend has a PhD and no work experience, I have a MS and eight years of completely relevant work experience. They actually explained ""we want you because you have the practical experience that the other person doesn't have"", and then they offered me literally less than half of what they offered my PhD friend. The CEO was offended when I told them their offer was unrealistic and after I declined their offer the CEO emailed me to inform me that they were retracting their offer. This is someone who has Forbes and WSJ articles written about them.

I like startups and I love robotics, but I'm considering a No Professors rule, just in the interest of saving time in the future.

I graduated with a Manufacturing and Mechanical Engineering Technology degree. Not that many people know exactly what this is so here's a brief summary: This is an ABET accredited degree. I am eligible to become a PE in my state and currently am an EIT (I am aware my desired career path doesn't require this). My degree is a hybrid of a manufacturing and mechanical degree. Curriculum includes thermo, fluid dynamics, statics and dynamics, power transfer as well as manufacturing info sys, manufacturing robotics. The technology comes into play as labs. Most of my upper level courses had a lab associated with it to get hands-on experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in an engineering role at a metal buildings company. I got the job out of desperation as a recent grad. Now looking back at it I wish I didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would want to get into the chemical processing field. The ultimate goal is to become a manager of projects for improvement of rotating/static equipment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my question is what steps can I take to improve my chances of getting there? 

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone in a related position, how did you get there? 

&amp;#x200B;

One path I'm looking at now is starting as a maintenance tech to familiarize with the plant then move to an engineering role, what are your thoughts on that? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been steadily applying for about 2-3 months now. It's gotten to the point where I'm reaching out everywhere for an opportunity (ex.: reddit).  I've signed up for networking happy hours, researched companies, you name it. All responses are greatly appreciated. Thank you.

23,Game of thrones ship-mounted siege engine with similar principals to a trebuchet.,1541721873,"The one I'm talking about is put in use in [this](https://youtu.be/Kv1TKpEOK2I?t=376) time-stamped video. I'm interested in its engineering design.

None of my searches on the internet came up with anything. If the design has a name, couldn't find it, and all my searching was GoT centric, not engineering.

I've been a bit nerd-sniped on trebuchet design. The mathematics, physics, engineering, etc. of it looks like a technical mind-field. This design has piqued my interest but can't find anything in it.

To me, the things that stick out is that it has a _very_ aggressive stall point (the mass wants to reverse its momentum entirely, something that is hard to achieve in a classic trebuchet) and the engine itself serves as the counter-weight.

Where can I go to learn how to do a mathematical analysis of such a design? What techniques might I need to use?

Does anyone know if there's any real-life history to this engine?

29,What would be the best sensor/combo for measuring distance in a crowded and/or very dark area?,1541714614,"So I've looked up a lot of sensors already, but I'm struggling to find ""the best one"" that suits all the specifications. 
What I've narrowed in on is PIR, Ultrasonic, TOF, LIDAR and Area Reflective sensors. I could obviously just order 3-5 different ones of each and test them, or go by the numerous ""opinions"" floating the internet, oooor I could just ask some professionals for their opinion and knowledge (you lot). 

Requirements: 

* Not sensitive to small movements like mice, grass, leaves etc. 
* Has to be able to operate in areas where there are **extreme** amounts of interference. Downtown NY like. 
* Needs to be able to operate within extremely dark areas, which already rules out PIR's by themselves? 
* Has to operate while LED/car lights are shined directly on it. I can't simply raise it up 5 meters.
* Measuring distance as close as 1m and as far as 30m. (TOF, LIDAR?) 
* Low power consumption (it's powered by a deep cycle battery charged by solar). 
* Has to be able to differentiate between a human and a cat, **but still able to detect children.** (thermal sensor?)
* Has to at least measure the distances every 1 meter, preferably each 50cm.
* FOV should be adjustable, *but it's not terribly important as the lense could probably be covered to suit the FOV.*
* Huge bonus points if it can detect movement through walls. (microwave sensors?)


Size doesn't matter as long as it isn't the size of a truck. 

Now this is probably out of the human realm of possibilities to be filled by one sensor, but companies like Tesla and Volvo have made combinations of different sensors which all work by themselves to fulfill each requirement, and that is something I'm looking at as well.

55,Empirically Tuning Engine Model,1541686323,"Hi all,  
  
I've got some flight data for this aircraft (turbojet), and I'm trying to tune our sim to more accurately represent the true flight conditions. When we got the model from the engine manufacturer, it was marked as being under worst-case conditions. So now I've been tasked with adjusting the engine model (in sim) such that it more accurately represents the actual engine.  
  
I have access to engine RPM, airspeed, altitude, EGT, fuel flow rate, attitude information, etc. For the sim, thrust is also recorded. The thrust, EGT, and fuel flow rate are determined via a table lookup + interpolation (the table is what was provided by the manufacturer.)  
  
Would flying the aircraft in sim in the same configuration and flight conditions (altitude, weight, airspeed, etc.) as an actual flight and comparing the engine RPM at those conditions be an adequate way to accomplish this? Since thrust is only recorded in sim, I'm not sure how else to compare this.  
  
For example:  
Actual flight: 10k ft, 380 kts, 0 deg. pitch, 0 deg. roll  -&gt; 75% RPM  
Sim flight: 10k ft, 380 kts, 0 deg. pitch, 0 deg. roll -&gt; 82% RPM

I did a 
Mechanical Bachelor's and a 
Masters in Materials Science and Engineering 
from the best Eng school I could find in my country at the time I applied (Rep. of Ireland).
  
I got exposed to CAD relatively young, and had done a Solidworks project and 6 years of technical drawing before starting uni. My whole motivation there was to gain the technical skills to become a product/industrial designer and apply some creativity. Unfortunately I now realise that there actually existed plenty of good Product Design Bachelor's and Masters. 
  
I don't really have the sketching or really stringent Solidworks experience or portfolio to get a job in Product Design, and it seems very competitive, as you might think. Should I go back to college? Master's? Bachelor's? 
Is it worth taking out a postgraduate student loan? Should I just try take a job that's design or CAD-related?
  
I spent the last 2 years since uni in 2 drastically different jobs.
The first was as a ""design engineer"", (basically stress analysis of telecom towers for wind load. Very procedural, very high-flow).
The second was as a ""Data Scientist"", (database management and programming, then 9 months in automating software QA for financial trading software).
So as you can see, straight out of uni, I have 2, completely different, 1-year jobs under my belt. 
Not looking good. That's why I'm worried about taking another job that I might leave to try to get into product design. I'm highly adaptable job-wise, in that I can do a job I don't love as best I can. I got an offer for a pretty good Project Leader position in Fire Testing Materials at a college facility. The money seems okay I'm just worried about taking it if I'm not going to be there for more than 2 years

I got my MSME mostly while working full time (I finished by going full time for a semester after I got laid off during the recession) I graduated in 2009 The main reason I didn’t go for my PhD was that I had two young kids in school and I couldn’t afford to not work. 

Now, my kids are both in high school, the oldest will be off to engineering school next fall and the younger one will follow in two years. The local university has a PhD program that’s suitable for working engineers with evening classes and so on. My employer will pay for it as long as my research is related to what the company does (automotive NVH). I’m not currently in a hardcore research type role, but just downstream in product development. 

I also don’t see myself branching off into a traditional management role or getting an MBA. I don’t think a traditional retirement will suit me either. When I’ve been off work for longer stretches, after about two weeks I start going bananas and tend to get into trouble.

74,Should I do grad school for an MSEE?,1541632145,"Hey engineers,

I'm a senior doing a BS in CS. I've always really liked wireless and mobile networks so I've been thinking about doing an MSEE.

The problem is, I struggle with math. Getting through Calc 1 and 2 for undergrad has been and continues to be rough. I made the minimum required Calc 1 grade to go onto Calc 2 after retaking it once. Now, I'm likely going to have to retake Calc 2 as well. Other than math though, I'm doing well. My CS GPA is a 3.67 and overall I'm at a 3.58. Outside of academics, I have done three internships at wireless carriers (one at a small carrier and two at a national carrier) doing RF engineering. 

I talked with engineers at my internships who recommended I do grad school right out of undergrad because getting higher degrees while working was a pain for them. I've also talked with some of my CS professors who think I'd have a shot at getting in somewhere good for grad school.

My concern is the jump from CS to EE. I'll have to take some undergrad courses first to properly understand EE. Those courses will be math-intensive as I understand it. Not to mention the grad ones if I somehow manage to pass. I'm worried that I'll struggle and end up failing out of it, wasting time and money.

1,New engineer looking for opinions on work environment.,1541556772,"Hello. I recently graduated and have been working at my first job for about 6 months. I have very much disliked this job and want to know if the company is an outlier or if this is what I always have to look forward to. We get assigned a few projects at once. Usually with infamously short due dates so that the expectation is that every employee works overtime. We are salaried (under market pay) and there is no comp time so overtime is rough. We work alone on every project no matter how big they are and the due dates are always the same length. The information we receive about our projects is 60 to 70 percent accurate and reviews practically don’t exist. We do a peer review and design review but they are more focused on spelling errors than anything else. 

Now the worst part is our design goes to production where the machinists work more hours than we do and usually are the guys catching the mistakes. Every mistake is a big deal because it’s more hours that everyone has to work and more delays on projects. No matter how small. Even a spelling error will get you a short lecture. Seeing a manager gives me anxiety because you never know what they might start scrutinizing. 

That being said, each employee is a nice person but with these conditions the environment is toxic, stressed, and very often angry. I hope this is an extreme outlier because I really can’t imagine doing this much longer at all. I did really well in school so it’s not like I’m stuck here I just want to know how everyone else rates the stress levels and enjoyment of their jobs.

6,What type of spring is this?,1541548506,"I'm not an engineer and don't frequent this board, so forgive me if this isn't the right place to post. I'm working on an invention and part of it has what I can best describe as a really simple spring. It is so simple that I don't think the inventor could possibly be the first to invent it, so I'm wondering if it has a specific name.

Here is a simplified schematic drawing that took me about 1000 hours in MS paint to do: https://imgur.com/a/Pw25p84

The black pieces are moveable parts in a larger apparatus. The blue piece is completely attached along the body of one black piece and the orange piece only at one end of the other.

In position 1 the blue piece is under the orange. As force is applied from the direction of the red arrow, in position 2, the blue piece forces the orange one up storing a small amount of energy represented by the green arrow (which is why I think it's a spring). At some point around position 3, the pieces shouldn't move to either open or closed, but there is an inflection point moving toward position 4 where the energy is released and the orange piece is able to force itself down flat.

The process can then, obviously, be reversed and as force is applied to straighten the black pieces back together the orange piece after storing energy will force the blue piece under it.

The closest I could think of is some sort of modified leaf spring, but I don't think that's right. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

In private industry, you also have to worry about budgets and finishing work in a timely manner, which creates a lot of stress. This is my main displeasure with working for a private firm.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a bachelor's in mechanical engineering and I am 2 years into my career.  I was caught up in a layoff in August (work went off to Mexico haha) for a manufacturing engineer position in Wichita, Kansas and I am now sitting with two job offers I have to decide between.

&amp;#x200B;

The first job is for a 6 month contract to hire near Oklahoma City where my family is residing.  I love my family and have missed them while in Wichita.  I would be doing supply chain engineering type work for a military airplane sustainment project at a higher rate than I was making in Wichita.  I would need to get a secret clearance and I am unsure how to valuate this.  I am assuming that if I receive a clearance that many doors will open down the line but I don't know and would like advice from mid-late career aerospace or other engineers on this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

The second job is for a 3 month contract for a Tukwila, WA air-framer at a rate that is $15$/hour higher than job 1.    I am a bit excited about this position because they have very large testing cells to test gigantic loads on airframe assemblies.  One of my summer internships was working with engineers who were testing turbofans to find the stall line, and I have to say that the test work was the most exciting thing I've done in my career.  The hiring manager says he can make no guarantees beyond 3 months, but if I do well I should have a position with his testing group or nearby.  He talked a bit about the need to transfer knowledge to early career engineers due to a lot of recent retirements which seems promising.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to proceed about deciding between these two positions.  There is a lot of factors to consider.  I hope this is on-topic, and I am seeking advice from fellow engineers.  Especially on how to evaluate the worth of a secret security clearance and how I go about determining the amount of risk in job 2.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of where my head is right now... when I jot my thoughts down I get something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Job 1:

Family is close by, longer contract, cheaper cost of living, security clearance, less interesting work.

Job 2:

More exciting work, higher pay, but also higher cost of living, riskier contract.

&amp;#x200B;

Completely screwed off in H.S, graduated in 2004. Went into the Marines from 2005-2009 as a grunt, transitioned out and moved back home.

From 2009 until the last few years I have marbled my life with less than ideal decision making. Had an extremely rough time transitioning out of the Marines and actually cultivating a career path. 

Fast forward to the present. As I stated before last year I began to put my feet on the ground. Couple years back I had the right networking and was able to land a position in Testing &amp; Evaluation for a major firearms manufacturer. I worked predominatly with prototypes and the aches and pains they go through. I was pretty much an engineers bitch and I was ok with that because I was able to see, do, and learn the stuff most need a degree for.

  I became almost monomaniac about my job and work. I would not be able to ""turn it off"" when I went home. I began reading about the ideal gas law as I worked around suppressors for firearms and wanted to understand more behind how they exactly functioned.

Then, last year, I became bottlenecked without a degree and I decided to pursue my BSME......despite the fact I was starting it at 31 years of age.

Today, I am now 32 and a year into my curriculum. I am usually fine, however some days I can not stop thinking about the fact I am 32 and I will graduate and be competing in the workforce with 24 year olds with the same knowledge and degree.

I fear not being able to ""catch back up"" due to my age and pursuing this field so late.

At the end of the day, I will be fine, and I am very driven. However, it was eating me alive not to share this and perhaps get some insight from others on this.

The replacement of this control valve is out of the question, are there modifications to the line (upstream/downstream) which may be made to stop the fluctuations from persisting at low SP values?

If any of you can share any methods of reducing fluctuations due to flow through control valves, you are most welcome to as well.",AskEngineers,False,AlfredCSM,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9ucjuw/help_with_control_valve_issue/
75,What should I do having run into trouble with the law in connection to marijuana/paraphernalia as a third year chemical engineering student?,1541411551,"PREFACE: I searched google for ""engineering and marijuana"" and found a link to this subreddit from a few years ago on the topic of simply being drug tested for jobs, but that didn't answer the questions I need answered. I searched r/AskEngineers for ""marijuana"" and ""paraphernalia"" after writing most of this post, and actually got some pretty optimistic answers about security clearance, hiring, etc. There was even talk of instances when the charges were dropped, however I have no reason to believe that will happen. 

BACKGROUND (marijuana): A really good friend introduced me to marijuana in high school, and we continued to smoke together for years before he finally decided to quit solely for the sake of it not being worth it to his career. Obviously I should have followed in his lead, but for me marijuana became a way of life. I've never been fond of myself or my life and can remember thinking I've wanted to die going back to the 8th grade. Weed helps me not feel this way. In addition, when I find myself hitting a dead end in my school work from mental fatigue or otherwise, as well as when I can't understand something in my studies, going out and smoking a small amount of weed often \*helps\* me focus and continue my work. I'm 23 now.

This didn't need it's own column but I want to stress that I really enjoy the field of chemical engineering. Right now I'm in ChemE thermo, transport phenomena, and ChemE methods, and though I want to pull my hair out at times, I like to learn about it all.

BACKGROUND (my situation):  Last night I got stopped on the road by some police who must've smelled me smoking walking down the road. They caught me with a small container of marijuana and a little bowl and wrote me two tickets for possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. I have an associate who is a sheriff elsewhere, and as far as she can tell it's a pretty run of the mill situation. Therefore I wish to operate with the assumption that I have these charges on my record.

LEGAL: The weed is a minor misdemeanor but the paraphernalia is a third or fourth degree misdemeanor in my state where I live and take classes. These will go on my public record and will be accessible to any firm with which I will ever want to work for, co-op with, intern, etc. I feel like my career is over before it's started, despite my parents trying to reassure me this is just a setback, and I need to keep and even strengthen my tunnel vision on school. 

So real questions: I guess a generalized ""how will this affect me?"" Specifically, should I just drop out of engineering and try to make better use of my time? Will getting a ChemE degree help me even if I can't get a ChemE job? Do you think it's practical to rely on attempting to find employment in Colorado or Cali, or similarly ""marijuana friendly"" states? Do you think there's a chance I'm overreacting and I'll be fine, since after all ""it's just weed,"" as many would say. Any advice on anything on or related to any of these questions will be appreciated.

Thank you if you even took the time to read my dilemma after noting on the nature of the situation from the title. Thank you endlessly if you offer even a minimal amount of information or advice. Thank you in advance for not criticizing or belittling me based on my circumstances, b/c I'm only human.

84,Civil interested in Construction,1541371099,"For the past year I have been interning at my DOT in the Transportation department and have recently switched to the Construction management side. While I enjoyed my time in Transportation and learned a lot, I see myself wanting a future in Construction. 

The one thing I have noticed so far while interning in the Construction department though is that it seems as if there are limited roles that an Engineer can have to fully utilize their degree, such as being an Inspector or Project Manager. In addition to this, most of the construction internships I see are either Estimating and Scheduling or Project Management.

I guess my main questions are, if I want a future in construction that includes the potential to obtain my PE and utilize my future Civil Degree, what are my potential job options and how to go about giving myself the best shot for those positions?

85,CO2 and Indoor Air Quality,1541369113,"I am an HVAC controls specialist in Wyoming and a facility manager (school district) recently challenged me by observing the normal CO2 PPM concentrations will be lower as altitude increases.

The CO2 sensors installed have a self-calibrating routine that tries to reset the low PPM reading to sea-level (400ish), but the altitude of the facility is above 7,000'.

From a controls stand point, I clearly measure a rise in CO2 during occupancy and ventilation sequences appear to control the readings.

The managers questions were: 1) is CO2's toxicity derived from the raw concentration, or is it based on a ratio of the other ambient gases? 2) is a set point of 600 PPMs still adequate/appropriate with the self-recalibration routine at the sensors?

I believe the facility manager's goal is to reduce the amount of ventilation when it is sub-zero to save energy, but he sincerely doesn't want to jeopardize his student's and faculty's health.

I shot from the hip and explained that the mechanical engineer's design would be in accordance with ASHRE, but I wonder a little myself.

96,I am missing a calculation step in my pressure sensor calibration. Could you please tell me what I am missing?,1541322366,"Hello folks,

I was hoping someone of you might be able to help me with this issue, there's actually only one step of calculation left to do. I want to calibrate pressure sensors measuring pressure difference with a Voltage output of 0,5 to 4,5 Volt and a pressure range of -1 bar to 12,8 bar (pressure difference). The values have been viewed on an Ecograph. The Voltage range has been set to 0 to 5 Volt (no other option did fit better) and the pressure range has been set to -1 to 12,8 bar.

I did the calibration by setting the sensor under defined pressures and compared those to the pressures shown by the Ecograph. These are the values I measured:

p theoretical p measured

1 1,28998462

2 2,00308889

3 2,87799

4 3,77128571

5 4,63634286

6 5,52046923

7 6,398375

8 7,1308

I calculated the actual pressure that stands for the voltage put out by the pressure sensor by this calculation:

y = ax + b, a = (12,8-(-1))/(4,5-0,5) = 3,45 b = -1-(0,5a) = -1-(0,5*3,45) = -2,725

According to this linear function, the actual pressure measured by the sensor corresponding to a defined voltage can be calculated like this:

p = (U*3,45)-2,725

With this, you get the following values:

U p

0,0 -2,725

0,5 -1,000

1,0 0,725

1,5 2,450

2,0 4,175

2,5 5,900

3,0 7,625

3,5 9,350

4,0 11,075

4,5 12,800

5,0 14,525

So I saw that the Ecograph would show the right pressure values if i changed the pressure range to -2,725 to 14,525.

But I would like to recalculate the existing values to match the theoretical pressure values.

For this, I would first need the voltage put out by the sensor when they measure the pressures I got out of them.

Since I chose different settings on the Ecograph than the pressure sensor delivers, I did the same what I did about the sensor:

y = a*x + b,

a = (12,8-(-1))/(5-0) = 2,76

b = -1-(0a) = -1-(02,76) = -1

With this, I also got a set of values for the Ecograph:

U p

0,0 -1,00

0,5 0,38

1,0 1,76

1,5 3,14

2,0 4,52

2,5 5,90

3,0 7,28

3,5 8,66

4,0 10,04

4,5 11,42

5,0 12,80

Now I am not sure how to go on from now. I tried to calculate the voltage standing for the measured pressure values with this formula:

U = (p (measured)+1)/2,76

How can I recalculate my off values to match the theoretical pressures?

p theoretical p measured
