5,Help with Brushless DC Motor Model,1389552679,"Hello. I want to build a [reaction wheel pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wW5Rb0M-ek) using a brushless DC motor. I'd like to use a [model car brushless motor](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__21866__Turnigy_TrackStar_17_5T_Sensored_Brushless_Motor_2270KV.html) and electronic speed controller (ESC) because they're cheap, powerful, and have built-in angular velocity sensors.

The equations of motion for the reaction wheel pendulum are:

    [; J_p \ddot{\theta} = m g \ell \sin \theta + T_{motor} = m g \ell \sin \theta - J_w \alpha;],

where [; J_p ;] is the inertia of the pendulum, [;\theta;] is the pendulum angle, [;m;] is the mass, [;g;] is gravity, [;\ell;] is the length of the pendulum, [;J_w;] is the intertia of the reaction wheel, and [;\alpha;] is the angular acceleration of the reaction wheel.

With a regular brushed DC motor, there is a simple expression for [;T_{motor};]. However, I'm not sure how to model a brushless DC motor. The ESC is fed a PWM signal from the microcontroller, which converts it to a proportional motor angular velocity.

To summarize, is there a model I can use to describe the response of an ESC controlled brushless motor? If not, I guess I'll experimentally measure the response and derive a model from that. Thanks!

At the moment I'm a Junior Engineer, which means in practice all I do is fill in paperwork for non-junior Engineers, so I haven't really had any industry design experience. 

I noticed in one of our products that a really inefficient design decision has been made, and I'm certain that if it was changed, upwards of Â£1000 could be saved per item. We make around 50-60 of these systems a year so the savings could be substantial. The only problem with this is that the change relies on changing a PCB on the IS side of the system, by adding a single IC chip.

12,What type of pump do I need (or can you suggest a better solution to stop siphoning)?,1389492607,"[System Diagram: http://i.imgur.com/JxJpFa2.png](http://i.imgur.com/JxJpFa2.png) 

I'm having issues with siphoning in a project I'm working on. Basic constraints:

* I don't have any control over where the container to be filled is located, so I can't just move it above the reservoir.
* I'm trying to avoid having any valves on the liquid side of this system for several reasons (contamination, and consumer useability to name a few)
* We're dealing with really low pressures here, in the ball park of 5 psi.

------------
The only (elegant) solution I could come up with was to pull a mild vacuum on the container once I'm done filling to pull the remaining fluid out of the line. This can be done one of two ways:

 1) Having solenoid valves switch between the inlet and outlet of the pump. [Example http://i.imgur.com/yGbplNy.png ](http://i.imgur.com/yGbplNy.png) 
  
&gt; Pros:
&gt;
&gt;  * Allows for quick switching from positive to negative pressure. 
&gt;  * Can use a cheap (and easy to find) diagram pmp
&gt; 
&gt; Cons:
&gt; 
&gt;  * Requires 4 solenoid valves. This get's expensive and heavy very quickly.
&gt;  * Takes quite a bit of space if I'm trying to keep the system very small.
&gt; 


-
 2) Having a pump that is capable of reversing direction
 
&gt; Pros: 
&gt;
&gt;  * Much more simple mechanically.
&gt; 
&gt; Cons:
&gt;
&gt;  * Does such a pump exist, and at a reasonable price?

16,35 y/o AF pilot wants to be an engineer. Smart?,1389463196,"2 years out from expiration of my 10 year pilot training commitment. Want to separate, not interested in doing 20 years in this political/fiscal climate. Flying can be challenging (training students) but it just doesn't scratch the itch i have to design/create stuff. Being a pilot favors quick thinking and reflexes much more than careful planning and design. I'm better at the latter as an INTP personality type.

I love physics and chemistry as well as computers, have been studying them on my own, on and off, as i have free time. I guess my question is how realistic is it to be successful in the general field coming from an unrelated specialty vs the kids coming straight out of college?

Tuition would be no problem as I'd use the new GI Bill to pay for it. Im guessing being 12 years out of school that i'd need to get a second bachelors degree. Any advice?

22,Field GPS tracker help,1389405034,"Hi, I'm trying to design a GPS tracking unit for biological field research. The problem is, I know nothing about GPS units! I'm doing a bunch of research ATM, but I'd love to have some of my more specific questions answered:

For context: The tracking unit is going to have to be mounted on the shell of a desert tortoise. These tortoises live in dens that are a very tight fit around them, so the tracker has to have a very low profile. There's a lot of shell to spread the device around on, it just can't be very tall.

Also, the unit can use passive tracking, so it won't need a constant uplink to the satellites. Active tracking would be ideal, but I'm assuming that less complexity means less physical hardware, which is better for the project. Also, we're on a budget.\


SO, here are my questions!

-What exactly are the core components of a GPS tracking unit? I keep hearing about a GPS module, but nothing more specific than that. Is it a component that can't be broken down or recreated? Is it something that I just have to buy as a package?

-How difficult would it be to build my own GPS unit? Assuming I had basic circuitry parts, and (a seemingly inimitable) GPS module?

-How reasonable would it be to dismantle a working GPS unit and spread it out across a tortoise shell? The components could be secured with adhesive to the shell, and probably covered with some kind of liquid protective layer (still researching that). I'm not interested in dismantling just for the fun of it, but rather in an effort to reduce the vertical profile of the device.

41,Looking for help solving an issue at work,1389335619,"Hi. I'm trying to come up with a relatively simple system to pull a row of wheeled pallets of material along a track to the end of a row where a forklift driver picks up each pallet. Currently I use two staff members to push each pallet individually out to the end of the row where the forklift can get at them. I want to get that down to one forklift driver and a winch.

What I want to do it use a remote controlled winch system. A clamp of some sort is attached to the pallet at the front of the row - furthest away from the end and forklift - with a cable running under the entire row out to a winch braced on the ground at the ""forklift"" end. The forklift driver drives up, presses a button and the next pallet is pulled out to his forks (he can't drive in any further to get at it). Maybe the pallet hits a kill switch so the winch doesn't keep pulling - that seems like minor details to work out.

The winch also can't be connected to the forklift itself as I don't really want the driver to have to get off his lift and attach a cable to something and have down time between each pallet.

So what I can't sort out is:

What size winch would I need. Each pallet weight roughly 700lbs and there are a max of 17 of them in a row. They are being pulled horizontally along a metal track. The pallets have casters on the bottom of them that ride along in a channel that site on top of wooden 4x4's 3ft off the ground. They would not need to move very fast - a forklift picks on up then drives away to put it away and comes back and grabs the next one. They are 5 ft long and there is at minimum of a minute between each trip. So the row would need to move 5ft/min. Newton is in the back of my head here whispering something about F=MA but I can't quite make out what he's saying. Help?

From what I can see most 120V AC powered winches do not lift this kind of weight so it would have to be 12V DC. That poses another problem. The winch can't be run from the forklift as the winch is stationary. So what kind of battery would that need? I guess I would need to know how many amp the unit pulls when its trying to pull its heaviest load? Is that even feasible? We're talking a use of moving one pallet, then a break of a minute or two (or 10), and then pulling the next pallet. The entire load getting lighter and lighter as the row gets more empty. Would a battery be able to handle that? Maybe if its permanently attached to a charger all day? I have AC power there and available.

I'm starting to ramble now but I have this picture in my head. I'm trying to get it out into reality. Thought maybe you guys could help or at least have a discussion. Thanks in advance :)",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/1uv69c/looking_for_help_solving_an_issue_at_work/

These are custom built machines, to our designs that follow standards to some degree, but nothing too rigorous, since we're never actually checked for compliance.  We have hundreds of machines in the field, but today, a local government electrical inspector (I'm not sure if city/town/county) made us halt an installation that was underway, and said we must have a UL sticker, indicating that we are ""UL Listed"" (which i understand is a little easier than ""UL Rated"" to achieve).  My boss just came into my office, and asked me and the programmer I work with to look into the regulations regarding UL listing, both in terms of just how ""required"" this can be by a government inspector, and if it truly is required, what we will need to do to get our stuff UL Listed. 

So while I'm sure this will spark all kinds of tangents about the benefits, need, the CYA, etc. value of UL Listing, my goal here is to get whatever info possible about the actual legal necessity (not how good or bad of an idea it is to be or not be listed) and process of becoming UL listed.  According to what we know so far, we're told we need to follow the standards set out by UL 508A to be in compliance with National Electrical Code Article 409.110.

At a former job, I built machines that were UL Listed, but I was the ME, and the EEs took care of that part (since UL was primarily focused on the electrical control enclosure, not the rest of the machine). 
As of right now, me and a programmer are tasked with determining what needs to happen.  From what I understand, to be UL listed, in general, you need to show that all of the relevant components in your machine are UL listed, that you follow whatever relevant wiring standards, and so on.  Then typically, you would arrange for a UL inspector to check out your equipment, and fix the few things he has to spot (they never seem to rest until they find something...and in the past, we've changed it one way for one inspector, and changed it back for another), and then you get to put the UL stickers on your controls. 

So again, I'm not looking for a debate on the merits of UL Listing, just any advice you have to offer about the actual requirement that it be achieved, and a how one might go about achieving it.

63,Thermodynamics Question,1389245416,"Hello,

I'm trying to analyze thermal energy going into the high temperature side of a Stirling engine. To simplify my analysis, it can be looked at as a 1-D plane wall with a convective boundary layer on both sides. One side is exposed to an open flame, and the other is an enclosed cylinder. Moreover, if I take the engine at steady state I can use resistive modeling to figure out the amount of heat transfer from one side of the wall to the other. This, however, is where I get stuck since I end up with too many unknowns.

I know the ambient temperature on one side (from a flame), the material properties of the wall (k), and the cross sectional area that I'll be analyzing. That leaves the convective heat transfer coefficient (h) and the heat transfer (q). I'm trying to solve for my heat transfer so that means the issue is the convective heat transfer coefficient. Unfortunately, there is also more than one ""h"" value since one side of the wall is open and the other enclosed. Does anyone have any ideas on how to calculate or determine these two ""h's""?


In short: I'm having difficulty calculating two convective heat transfer coefficients for a 1-D plane wall. One that is open to the environment, and another that is in an enclosed cylinder. Any ideas on how to start to quantify these terms?

I don't really understand how pumps work.

We just got a brand new safety engineer, and they are stirring up quite a lot of shit. They are saying that we need 3 feet of completely empty space in front of enclosed electrical panels, which seems to be the case when i look at osha standards. However, all of our assembly lines have been designed with the idea that if something is on wheels (small tables, wip baskets, small conveyers), that the three feet rule does not apply since they can be easily rolled out of the way. These mobile objects being where they are are pretty crucial for our product flows.

We have 51 assembly lines that would have to be redesigned and we would have to change all standard cycle times and product costs to reflect all of the additional walking time that would be required with the new layouts.

My managers are asking me to basically second guess the new guy and decide if a full plant redesign is worth it. my first reaction is of course to just say safety first and bite the bullet, but we are taking about a few million dollars when we take the price increases in to consideration.

I will have around 8 months or so before I start my Masters in Economics. I was planning to do a diploma or some other non-degree courses that would help me with my innovations. Any suggestions?

12,How to calculate (or simulate) the heat transfer. Images inside.,1388988671,"Hi, so I recently had an idea to use a tungsten or nichrome coil in a ceramic core surrounding a small steel rod to use for the sintering of aluminum powder. See this image for a diagram: http://imgur.com/2gkDheP

It would take roughly 20 watts to heat nichrome to 1800 degrees farenheit, which using the correct geometry/insulation I could heat the steel rod to above 1220 degrees farenheit, the melting temperature of aluminum. The steel rod would come to a sharp point like this: http://imgur.com/dOEdwRk , and would sit around 0.001"" above the aluminum powder bed. 

How can I calculate or simulate how hot the steel rod would need to get to melt the aluminum? How do I calculate how deep the melted zone would be? How big the melted area would be? Assuming this is all in a CO2 or Argon atmosphere. What software/equations are available for this kind of thing? Do you have any personal insights or speculations?

13,Can (are?) heat pumps used to extract extra usable heat energy from the condensate of a steam turbine?,1388971345,"Say that I want to build a natural gas Combined Heat &amp; Power or Combined Cooling, Heat &amp; Power plant, and say I also want to convert as high a proportion of my fuel as is practical into electricity since grid electricity sells for a much higher price than the same amount of heat energy.

According to the efficiency statistics I've been able to find online, the most efficient gas turbines can extract 35% to 40% of the chemical energy as electricity. A ""Combined Cycle"" plant which uses the exhaust of the gas turbine to generate steam and run a steam turbine can extract a total of up to 60% of the chemical energy as electricity.

According to the product brochure PDFs I've found, it appears that the water used in a steam turbine is in a closed loop held at lower than atmospheric pressure so that H2O remains a gas at lower temperatures, allowing more energy to be extracted by the turbine for electricity generation. That makes sense, but it also means that supposedly the condensate released at the end of a steam turbine is only about 150*F to 180*F.

That doesn't seem hot enough to be used efficiently either for district heating, which is distributed close to or above boiling, or to power absorption chillers, which supposedly don't pump heat efficiently at less than ~190*F input temperature. However, the steam turbine is probably releasing huge volumes of this low-temperature heat. After all, the hypothetical combined cycle plant has only captured 60% of the chemical energy of the gas, there is a large amount of energy left.

So my question is, is it practical to use compressor heat pumps to concentrate the heat from the high volume of condensate into a lower volume of something could be used for district heating or absorption chilling?

Especially for the absorption chilling part, I can't wrap my head about whether that would be practical or not. On the one hand, you could just directly drive compressor heat pumps to chill the water, instead of using heat pumps to concentrate heat enough where absorption chilling is possible. On the other hand, the condensate contains a huge volume of heat that would otherwise be wasted and it is close enough to the temperatures required for district heating and absorption chilling that it could be achieved relatively efficiently (according to what I've read, you should be able to pump 4 or 5 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of equivalent electricity used to drive the pump).

Would this be practical? Is it already done? If not, how do CCHP plants work? Do they not use a steam turbine and instead reserve all their steam for heating? Do they use a less aggressive steam turbine that exhausts hotter condensate?

This is a pretty specific question but I think that the basic principles around the efficiency of converting a higher volume of lower quality heat into a lower volume of higher quality heat would apply in a range of situations. For example, I understand that in some warmer parts of the US, especially where there isn't district natural gas distribution, some people use compressor heat pumps to concentrate heat from outdoor air or underground reservoirs into into higher quality heat for their home.

17,Question for Space / Military Aeronautical Engineers.,1388952340,"Recent Aerospace Grad here, always wanted to become a launch vehicle designer or satellite engineer, and my plan up till now has been to go on and do Postgrad in this area and hope to land an internship or career with a relevant company afterwards.

Recently though I've been tempted to join the Navy for a few years as an Aeronautical Engineer working on helicopter maintenance (hands on), airworthiness, and maybe some design work. Also get to do a lot of teamwork / leadership studies, and all the military training that goes with it. Get to travel, pay is pretty crap, but sounds like something that would be fun. 

However, I'm slightly afraid that I'll be wasting time in the Navy and won't get my any closer to my goal of becoming a space engineer, considering that helicopters and rockets are quite different. So my question is:

Is it better for me to pursue Postgrad straight away in a related field, and then try to get a job or internship afterwards, or better to get some work experience in the Navy for a few years and then try to get a job in the space sector?

Now I ask you for good ideas for our project.
It can be a machine, a device or just a part of a bigger machine. It should be innovative and interesting. It should cover several subjects like manufacturing, material, automation, physics and so on. Our team will be accompanied by a teacher of this topic.
We'll plan, develop and manufacture it. So in the end it has to work. This will happen in ca. 200 hours over nine months. We can  buy several components of it but we still have to create some ourselves. 
It should not be too expensive (less than 1500 Swiss francs =1657 USD). None of us can program stuff like for example an arduino-device, but I think we can use a simple Programmable Logic Controller. We have all basic skills to work with those.
developing: We can create a 3D-model of it and calculate everything.
manufacturing: we have a lot of possibilities to the fact, that we can manufacture it in our companies' workshop. There are all the basic manufacturing possibilities, like milling and turning (both also CNC) and all sorts of sheet manufacturing.

â¢	a hexapedal robot
â¢	a solar panel, which adjusts its orientation
â¢	a driven wheel, whose rotation axis can be adjusted around almost 90Â° in both directions.

If I pass a bar magnet that is shorter in length than the conducting coil it would be passed through, and somewhere in the middle of the coil I reverse the direction of movement of the magnet (so, instead of running it from A to B, I start and end at point A), would that negatively affect generation and if so could that be remedied?  If this would mess with the system, would using weaker or stronger magnets reduce the negative effect?

In a similar setup, if I pass multiple small bar magnets through a coil, but in a ""two steps forward, one step back"" kind of movement from A to B, would that negatively affect generation and if so could that be remedied?

56,Indirect methods of calculating fluid flow rate,1388608704,"I'm building up a system where a fluid flows across the blades of a bearing mounted impeller (note: non-powered).  The impeller rotates at some angular velocity that's relatable to the velocity of the fluid passing by.

What I'm trying to find is the velocity of the fluid, though I cannot interface directly with the system.  My initial thought was to use a series of pressure taps, but then I'm both modifying the system and exposing the ports to the fluid which will require cleaning/maintenance over time.

My current thought is to have a magnet installed on the tip of one of the impeller blades.  Place an inductor at some location and let the magnet induce a current in the inductor as it spins.  Voltage should increase with velocity, though that may require very fast sampling which would be battery intensive.  Rather, I think I'll just look for any voltage spike above some noise floor and then measure the delta between spikes via software.  That rotation rate can then be correlated to fluid velocity, or more likely I'll just re-write my equations to use rotation rate rather than velocity.

So my question is two part:

* Is there a better/cheaper/easier method of measuring velocity indirectly?
* If I choose the inductor method, how would I calculate what the voltage should be based on distance to magnet, number of turns (or just uH rating), velocity, magnet field strength, etc.  I.e. if I want to generate spikes between 2.5-5V, how do I build this thing?",AskEngineers,SwellsInMoisture,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1u6f0j/indirect_methods_of_calculating_fluid_flow_rate/

I used the formulas from Roark's manual (http://imgur.com/8qKJutw,b8bRnkH#0) to calculate the stress at the center, but I wasn't confident in my results.

Width of the simply supported beam was also equal to the diameter.  

I thought that the simply supported scenario would have a higher stress, but keep coming up with less stress with this method. This is counter intuitive to me.  If I had to build a support platform, I would just have assumed that the circular support would be much better than simply supporting the platform on either side.  Can anyone provide some insight?  I think it has to do with the fact that the circular support results in the stress reducing down to a single point in the center, while the simply supported load is spread out over the width of the beam.

I'm a Mech E about a year into my career and looking to make a move soon. My friends who are involved in computer science, marketing, etc. are all able to live and work in active areas in their cities. I've come to find through my internships and my current job that in most cases I have to work an hour or so out into the suburbs (losing 2 hours of my day to a commute, if I wanted to live in a city). This is usually because engineering facilities need larger/cheaper space for storage, manufacturing, inspection, etc.


Which jobs might allow for working within the actual city, while still utilizing my Mech E degree?


So far, I've been thinking:

* Sales Engineering
* Consulting
* ... any other ideas?

96,Need some Advice...,1388209375,"About 3 months after graduating from college with a degree in Aerospace Engineering i was able to land a Job with a small but growing company. I was happy to get thrown straight into an engineer Role. It was for a small Composites company, making composite parts for many major aerospace companies. My biggest problem early on was simply adjusting to Engineer life. Before this all I knew was school and hourly work. The next major hurdle was understanding Composites, since i had never taken a class or studied it in any depth in school. It didnt help that i was never really a hands on type of guy. I just wanted to sit in the office and do my work. Because it was a small company, every engineer had to take part in a bit of every role. It was challenging but I felt I was doing well. Then came the annual reviews....

I've been there for three years. The first two annual reviews from my boss were not good. On the 2nd review he gave me 30 days to show him ""significant"" improvement. I don't know what I did for those next 30 days, honestly i kind of went along as I had been, but he seemed to think i had improved enough to keep around. The 3rd yearly review was positive, surprisingly. As it's the beginning of the new year, reviews will be coming around again soon, am i very worried about the outcome. As i see it, things have improved and could hardly be better. The theme of this years review however, i feel will be about my ability to take a more leading role in my programs. I'm still learning how to do that, and i feel my shortcomings will mask my achievements &amp; progress i've made over the year.

I'll probably survive this year's review, but thats not the problem i need help with. Those first 2 years really scared the hell out of me. After those, ive never really had a sense of job security, no matter how much I improve or how well my programs do. My boss is hard to read, I know he slowly expects more and more out of each of us, I just dont know how much longer I can keep pace with his expectations. When i first got the Job i was still living at home without a care in the world. I could survive being fired/laid-off/whatever. Today Im married with a mortgage payment due each month, i cannot afford to be without this job. It's a horrible feeling to have. I feel as though i should be looking for a fresh start elsewhere, but then theres a fear that wherever i end up won't be any better than what i'm leaving.

Masters as in the one tailored towards a career in research.

I have co-op experience in different industries and all my employers from the very first one have told me that I am more than welcome to come back after graduation.

I also enjoy learning and discovering new things, if anything, I think that my grades are not even higher because of the way that I study.

The problem is that both paths appear equally appealing and I've enjoyed both ""fields"" equally. I really have no preference.

I can see that working after graduation would provide me with an income while academia will provide me with being broke for the rest of my early 20's.

Hi everyone, I'm in my second year of community college and am about to take differential equations and some other physics classes. I plan to transfer to University of Washington, which my brother goes to, once this year is over and I've been worried about the classes. It seems that the material in my CC is easier than what they are covering in my brother's classes and I feel I won't have as strong of a foundation when I really need it. I plan to double major in electrical engineering and computer science engineering so a lot of the prerequisite classes are the same, which makes me even more worried.

The catch is that since I'm doing this through Running Start, the credits I earn here don't count against the set credit allotment that UW gives to complete your degree. So my options are to either: retake some of the math and science courses, or continue and keep the credits. Neither has any penalties school wise but the prior means I'll be in school longer, which kind of goes against why I went with the RS program. I'm also wondering if honors credit or UGR at a CC is really worth anything either, considering the course curriculum seems a little underwhelming compared to university. It definitely was tough compared to high school classes but I don't have enough experience to know how it stacks against university level research.

The big thing that would make this all moot is, how much math and science do I really need to use in the field? Is a general understanding enough or will I need to know how to solve extremely complex problems in the field as well? Because I feel like CC is still teaching me enough to understand the concepts and practice the material, but if I really need to be able to solve the hardest problems with ease I don't know how well I'll fare.

Sorry if this seems like a stupid question, but I am very worried about my future career options and am starting to regret taking RS. Just need some input from engineers in the field to let me know what to do to recover or if I can just keep doing what I've been doing.

[Side question] I didn't want to make a second post and this is completely on the side, but does anyone have any experience with RS and transferring to a school like Stanford or caltech? I have already talked with a counselor and I *know* the degree is what matters, but if someone who has been through the process could elaborate on how it went that'd really help.

26,Question on supersonic mixing using a bullet.,1387919165,"Probably a stupid question but who knows...I'm no Chemical Engineer.
 
I have two powders that once mixed are highly flammable and shock/friction sensitive.  It's dangerous to mix these chemicals by hand but I want to detonate them.  Would it be possible to shoot them with a rifle such that the shock wave mixes them into a homogeneous mixture and subsequently detonates?   It's important that it makes a relatively homogeneous mixture...Otherwise nothing happens.

Adam Savage is using, from what I can tell, an [Aluminum woodworking saw](http://knewconcepts.com/5-inch.php). Now the design itself is quite interesting since I'm used to the old hollow tube models. 

However, the man from Knew Concepts introduces his state of the art [Titanium woodworking saw](http://knewconcepts.com/titaniumSaws.php) and talks about production difficulty but the extreme rigidity of the finished product.

Now I'm a Mechanical Engineering student so this raises a few questions. Titanium is very strong for it's weight but as far as I know not particularly stiff. It's Young's modulus according to the wiki is 116GPa. Steel is around the 210GPa mark. This means that any object made out of steel is much stiffer given the same surface area.

Outside of the obvious weight difference between a steel and titanium woodworking saw what am I missing that makes this a good design choice? Specific stiffness? An Ashby plot I haven't thought of?

36,Would other methods of energy production have the same capital costs as nuclear if they were to have similar safety requirements?,1387832310,"I hope this is the correct subreddit?
I recollect resting somewhere (but I can't find the source) that nuclear power generation is one of the safest forms of electricity generation in terms of associated human deaths over the life of the power plant (s). For example the Chernobyl disaster has a total of 30 deaths (http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Safety-and-Security/Safety-of-Plants/Chernobyl-Accident/).

In contrast how many associated trio coal and gas as power sources? AFAIR even wind has more deaths per MW (falling from height etc). 

If other sources of  electricity generation had the same level of  engineering/safety procedures as nuclear to reduce the human death toll to similar levels (per MW), what would happen to the capital cost of those plants (or cost per MW) relative to nuclear.

To clarify. Not to demonize any particular energy source, just to put all on an equal safety footing. Let's say 1 death per 100 GW is the mandated maximum.

My research and exploration into home networking and home automation brought up a very important point - devices need to be distinguished from each other so a system can identify where readings or instructions are coming from.

I started looking into how IP cameras work, since that's a logical starting point for trying to understand how many identical items can otherwise be differentiated. That works well and good for cameras, but if I were to have a series of devices that function as generic probes (humidity, temperature, ambient light levels) they'd face the same problem as the cameras - a device connected to the network would need to be able to tell them apart.

So I want to focus on the generic probe device. Once I got a design down I'd want to make several identical copies and spread them throughout my dream home - what special components would I need to allow for IP-based communications? Are there any good references or guides for doing something like this?

I want to learn, and I'm not afraid to do lots of reading - but I do want to know some general terms for what I'm describing so I can better search for relevant information. I'd also love to hear about your experiences in setting up networked IP devices and what I should/shouldn't do.

43,"Structural engineers, how is fatigue life of a wind turbine tower calculated",1387799248,"I am working on a small wind turbine simulation, and the stresses are close to:

Compressive loads at the base of the tower : ~200kN; Compressive Stress ~150MPa

Shear loads at the base: ~2-4kN; Shear stress ~1.5-3 MPa

Shear loads (due to rotor thrust) are cyclic in nature, whereas the compressive loads are largely constant. Fatigue occurs only due to cyclic loads, which in this case are very low amplitude cycels (1-3MPa). At these stresses, the theoretical life of the material is infinite. My concern is, how are these loads used to calculate fatigue life of a turbine tower, which is roughly 20 years. (The stresses match with the figures given in [NREL's Definition of a 5 MW Reference Wind Turbine for Offshore System Development](http://mhk.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Definition_of_a_5_MW_Reference_Wind_Turbine_for_Offshore_System_Development) )

Edit: Figured out the flaw in my calculations after talking to a wind turbine expert - I was using Shear Loads for cyclic loads; the fatigue is supposed to be calculated with Bending Moments. The stresses involved with Bending Moments are two orders of magnitude higher than those with Shear Loads. Now, i can put these stresses on S-N curve and use the Miner's rule to find 'Damage Equivalent' after a reference number of cycles. Conversly, i can find fatigue life, though the standard practice is to calculate damage equivalent.

I work at a tech company and I report directly to the top guy. He's one of the only guys with a non-technical background in the company, but he runs the show. He's very smart but likes to assert his dominance/opinion.

Here's the issue, he likes to run projects and unfortunately has little to no grasp of the technical concepts. To illustrate the problem, it's as if he wants to present to the customer the median rather than the mean of a distribution (I made this example up). So it's not like he's miles away from the solution, it's just not correct from a scientific standpoint. To elaborate a bit more on the source of the problem, it's that he wants to boil down the problem as much as possible and mix everything together to present the client with a single, elegant solution, whereas the problem requires much more complex methods which can't just be boiled down to a single number no matter how bad you want it.

Has anyone had experience with this? Should I bother to try to make my point or should I just do my best to present the solution the way he wants it?

Watch this video please:

http://youtu.be/fFjovsZokcc

As you can see, there are 2 drums that turn at the same time, one outer, one inner. The inner drum's movement is what I cant figure out. In my opinion it turns at the same rate and direction as the outer drum, but not only does that, also there is another movement, a ""circular"" movement around the longest axis, that moves the dough pieces around the edges of the outer drum.

My question is what type of bearing is used to produce that circular movement of the inner drum?

69,Distributing a failure rate,1387567580,"I'm a few years out of engineering school and could swear I learned this at some point, but I just can't seem to get it. I need to figure out the failure distribution of a consumable part. I have a part which, given average use, fails in 10 years and then needs to be replaced -- so for an average user, a part bought today will fail in 2023. For lighter users it will be later, and for heavier users earlier.

I'm assuming usage is normally distributed, and 95% of users will see their part fail between 6 and 14 years. (in other words, std dev of 2). 

I dropped this in a spreadsheet and put a normal distribution on it, with mean of 10 years and std dev of 2, with ""X"" equal to the year... but the sum of the probabilities comes out to 1.414 (so I'm probably doing something clearly wrong). Given that I'm using whole years as the X and the mean is expressed as a whole year, I would have thought the area under the curve would be 1.000000. 

Can anybody help a brother out? 

Formula I'm using looks like this...

72,How do you calculate the True Cross-Sectional Area of Steel Wire Rope? (X-Post from r/AskEngineers),1387545704,"Hey /r/AskEngineers,

I'm currently working on a suspended pedestrian trail bridge project in Mozambique, and am in the process of trying to determine the characteristics of cable I'll need to use.  Thus far, I've been following design guidelines provided by a bridge building organization that's supporting me along the way. Recently, I hit a snag though.  

Determination of the bridge cable configuration (ie. how many decking cables will be used and what the diameter will be) depends on the calculated breaking strength (in pounds) of the available options.  All of the options that I've found thus far (for example: http://www.anchors.co.za/images/liftingandrigging/AnchorIndustries_LR_Ch2.pdf) provide a tensile strength (in the provided example, it's listed as Grade and is 1770 N/mm...I think this is an error though and it is supposed to read N/mm^2). 

I believe that I can use this value in N/mm^2 to calculate the breaking strength by multiply it by the wire's cross-sectional area (mm^2) and then converting the resultant product from Newtons into pounds.  Problem is, finding the exact cross-sectional area is proving difficult.

The fact that steel wire is composed of various strands means that there is void space within the cable and therefore I cannot just use the basic formula for area (=pi*r^2). I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to best estimate or calculate this area.  Perhaps there is a proven method for finding the True Cross-Sectional Area of a steel wire rope in the industry? 

Thank you in advanced!

   I'd love to get some input from those of you out there with experience.  Three years ago I graduated with an undergraduate business degree, and immediately began working in an office environment for a retail company.  After three years there, I realized that if I didn't go after a truly rewarding career, I would regret everything.  So, I quit my job and am now pursuing an undergraduate engineering degree.

33,Transportation idea for flight - trying to figure out a circular path's diameter given the following scenario:,1387149905,"I was thinking of a system that would allow airplanes to slow down rather than land/stop and takeoff, while considering the energy efficiency for stopping vs slowing down. So I imagined a large multistage carousel of sorts. (links below to quick simplified doodles~!)

I imagined a tall spire coming up from the ground. Passengers would enter at the base and would enter the 1st set of cars (think subway cars). They would begin to go around like a carnival ride on cables. They would speed up and the cables might extend a bit to travel a larger diameter. They would match up with the next ring of cars and would exit ring one and enter ring 2. Each ring would speed up and slow down a bit to synchronize with it's neighboring ring. Only the 1st ring would ever come to a full stop.The 2nd ring of cars would accelerate and the process would repeat with ever increasing ring sizes. The goal is to bring the speed up fast enough that a jet could essentially fly by and swap out it's body that would be enter into a capture system while passengers, fuel and cargo would be swapped into the plane. The questions I have been asking myself are:

 - how big is the final diameter/circumference for passengers to not feel any discomfort wile traveling around a ring that is moving at let's say 300mph?
 - If traveling at 300mph in a circumference large enough to not be too uncomfortable, how severe would the transition be if they leave the path? I imagine the jet flying by in more of an arced path rather than a straight line.

Edit: I did a quick search on jet speed fuel efficiency, so let's say 500-600mph rather than the 300mph I guessed as a decent speed to remain fuel efficient. Perhaps the ratio of the diameter vs the speed is really what I'm driving at. The faster the swap is done, the more efficient it is for fuel, but the ring would have to be much larger. So, I think it would be ideal to discover the slow medium and fast speed answer to this question. 

I am no engineer and I'm not strong at all with math, and the formula's I have found and charts that might offer a way to calculate it are essentially Greek to me. Here is a handy G-Force chart I found that might be useful: http://www.aerobatics.org.uk/repeats/physiological_effects.htm

Here are two very simple doodles to get the general idea across:

   - http://imgur.com/ULj4yqt
   - http://imgur.com/Xwa2voB

a few side notes: 

The planes would have to be designed to have most of their body be swappable, which is a huge problem in itself. I'm sure any savings in time and fuel would be irrelevant looking at the cost of building/modifying  planes that this might work with. So, please consider this more of a curiosity rather than a practical idea.

I imagined the plane entering a very controlled physical system somehow so that there was no free flight during the transfer. More like a plane clipping into a track that would control it's path and speed precisely. All while the jet keeps flying at a pretty fast speed to minimize any energy loss from slowing down and speeding up. 

I thought of this years ago (around 2006) and have always been curious what this system would look like in scale were it built. How big IS that final ring?

http://www.offgridworld.com/bladeless-wind-generator-produces-200-more-energy-at-45-less-cost/

The device was created by a company called Saphon Energy and after navigating their website (save yourself the trouble, it's *masses* of motivational poster-esq one-liners crammed with enviro-buzzwords) I was only able to shake loose one clip of the actual technology behind it:

""Beyond Betz Limit: For the same swept area (by a wind turbine), the wind energy captured by the sail shaped body of the Saphonian is twice as higher as that of conventional wind turbine. By replacing the 3-blade rotor by a compact sail-shaped body (curved) that enjoys high aerodynamic coefficients (Cl and Cd), the Saphonian has set itself free from the insurmountable Betz limit.

High Efficiency: Due to its different technical approach and specific design, the Saphonian offers an efficiency level about 3 times as high as current technology. The latest tests have shown a 2.3 range of efficiency enhancement (still under improvement).

No Gyroscopic Effect: The rotational motion of rotor is the source of the gyroscopic effect and has an adverse impact on the Yaw System (used to maintain the upwind orientation of turbines). The Saphonian, as a non rotational system, doesnât suffer from this effect.

Hydro-Aerodynamic Braking: Unlike current bladed technology, the Saphonian braking system, is entirely intrinsic and is activated by the synchronization of its motion.""

Now...I'm not an engineer, but this sounds an awful lot like [technobabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technobabble). But, as I mentioned, I'm not an engineer so I'm curious as to the input of actual pros.

* *This is a hand-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you         how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. Each student will purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state of the art ARM Cortex M4 processor. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem-solving building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will be able to build your own arcade-style game.*

So my question is, what should I do?  Is it worth going into BME?  At what degree would it be worth it?  How does this compare to other engineering areas?

I guess I'm just a little scared about future job option if I go into BME and I figure that actual engineers would have some insight as to what how I should inform my decision.

Well other than that, are there really any benefits of taking AP courses when you are already in college. Does it make a difference in employers, scholarship etc?

54,Heating water by Induction currents,1386983018,"Background: From my understanding and experience, Induction currents can be used to heat anything that is conductive and has some resistance. Ceramics and glass are not conductive really at all, therefor no heating. Steel is conductive and relatively high resistance (and ferromagnetic at ambient temperatures) therefor heats easily and fast. Copper and associated alloys are high resistance when cold and therefor hard to heat until they reach a few hundred degrees. The hotter it gets, the higher the resistance, the faster it heats. (I have been using an induction heating system at work lately to heat copper rings that weigh about 20 or 30 lb. I can heat from ambient to 1300F in under 3 minutes.) 

What my brain thought up is: Would it technically be possible to heat water (in a glass container) by using an induction coil? (assuming not distilled water) Technically wouldn't adding a couple of dashes of salt to the water change the resistance and make the heating more controlled as well?

For example, I know that when loaded, (or when starting up, which is a load since the RPMs are increasing), a motor ""draws"" more amps.

What are the mechanics behind this?  I know things don't actually ""suck"" power....there's a voltage source, (lets assume one with infinite current - that shows no voltage drop under load - unlimited capacity), and that voltage source is pushing against the resistance of whatever's connected to it.  When the motor is running at a set speed, it has a defined resistance, which means with our constant voltage source there is a defined amp draw.  

As we load up the motor, RPMs will drop and amps will increase.  V=IR, so this means resistance is dropping as we load up the motor.  Why?  We have the same number of wire turnings, same resistivity per foot....nothing physically has changed with the motor, but I know that amp draw WILL go up, which means (since voltage is constant), resistance in the motor must drop.

I have a bit of a dilemma.  I'm not an electrical engineer by trade and have only limited E/M experience.  I've done a little research on my own and have come to the conclusion that I should use a diode to do what I'm trying to do.

What I want is for my case fan LEDs to only be on when the fans are on high, which i think is at 12 volts.  They have 3 speeds, and the lowest speed halves the mass flow rate of the fan, so it's a good assumption that the RPM and hence voltage are also halved.  I know where the wires are that carry the power to the LEDs where it splits off the fan, so the only issue now is what ""switch"" to use to do this.  Probably a 10 volt cut-in voltage would be sufficient.  I need help making sure I get the right thing, though.

The fittings we have apparently are straight threaded push to connects, so they can fit in either metric or SAE threads (to the best of my knowledge).

The guys who have been helping us at our local Parker distributor found that it fits #5-SAE very well, while the metric equivalent feels a little sloppy in the ports. The problem is that our tool is tubed for 6mm, and obviously SAE threaded fittings will fit SAE tubing (1/4"" ~ 6.3 mm). Additionally, the ports are not chamfered for the SAE O-Ring, so it is clear it is not made expressly for SAE fittings.

The work is becoming devoid of challenges, and the company I'm with has noticed this and is beginning to use me to fill more of an engineer's role now rather than designer, they even hired two drafters that I supervise.

Naturally the next step is to get a bachelor's in engineering, I weighed the two options of going back to my old school and getting a bachelor's in ""Industrial Engineering _Technology_"" or transferring some of my credits from PSEO (college courses completed during high school) to a university in my city that offers a theoretical bachelor's - I'm thinking I'm probably going to choose the theoretical degree.

First question, how much more valuable (for employment) is someone who double majors in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering rather than just one or the other?  They don't badge the degree at my school as ""Mechatronics"" like elsewhere, but I'm interested in it.  I'm looking at 3 years to complete the degree if I choose one, about 4 if I choose the dual degree.  Obviously I would be a viable candidate for more positions, but is it really worth it?  I know electrical engineers who have degrees in biomedical engineering... I'm wondering if I should save my time/money and just go for a Mechanical degree and try for an Electrical position if I ever felt drawn to one.

Second question, what would be the most likely outcome as far as job and responsibilities/duties or job title if I opted for the Industrial Engineering Technology degree?

Every night, presumably due to boilers, heating pipes in the building, or perhaps a die-hard Dune fan somewhere trying to summon a sandworm, my floor vibrates. I live in a block of flats. There's no accompanying noise, but the vibrations are enough to travel up through my bed, through my mattress and prevent me from sleeping. It lasts for hours sometimes, and other times wakes me up in the early hours of the morning. It's also happening right now.

My bed is about 2 metres long, 1 metre wide, and about 60 cms high if you include the two pieces - the main block which is about 40 cms high and made of what appears to be light wood and plastic, and the mattress, which lies on top of that block and is about 20cm high (picture something like [this](http://www.chestofdrawers.co.uk/media/catalog/product/1/5/15050_15051_teak-fj-block-bedroom-bedhead_c.jpg)). The main block of the bed is positioned on 6 small wheels, one at each corner and one between the two corners lengthwise. I estimate that the whole thing weighs about 20kg in total.

My question is this: would it be possible to dampen the vibrating effects using a commonly available material, so that the vibrations no longer come through the floor and disrupt my sleep? Would I be better off trying to place something under each wheel, or between the block of the bed and the mattress? I've considered various options, and I've tried putting a folded up towel under each wheel, but this doesn't seem to have helped at all.

Nowadays hard drives are pretty much self-contained computers, and they themselves do the communication with their heads, only requiring a comparatively simple *ATA controller in the host computer. Some even have USB ports built on their own circuit boards.

This makes me wonder: assuming every consumer system needs a hard drive (and leaving momentarily aside SSDs), would it not be more efficient to standardize the communication system of the head/disk assembly and have it be entirely controlled by hardware on the host system? You'd only need one or two complex controllers on the motherboard, as opposed as one or two simple ones paired to as many complex ones as you have hard drives.

You could build and ship drives consisting only of the actual disk/head hardware and straight connectors, requiring no additional active electronics. Surely this would lower prices, and potentially failure rates.

I've designed, built and tested nearly everything from the physical apparatus and experimental methods to the equipment control, digital DAQ and data processing codes.

This project has allowed me an amazing amount of creative freedom, and I've gained a wide range of multidisciplinary skills I certainly did not have at the end of my undergraduate experience. While there is still a lot more testing, refining, and writing to be done, I realistically have 18-24 months left until graduation. I'm starting to explore potential career paths upon my departure, and was wondering if anyone in this community had some insight into my options, both within and outside of the fields of nuclear engineering and experimental physics. 

My most significant constraint is that family considerations will limit me geographically to the Greater Boston area for at least a few years. While this obviously knocks most major government labs out of the running for now, I'm not wholly convinced that that type of working environment is right for me in the first place, given the sometimes heavy restrictions on publications and communications, budget uncertainties, etc. As far as academia goes, I don't mind it, but the competition for jobs and funding is fierce these days, and I've been in school so long at this point that I could honestly use a new perspective.

That leaves the private sector, which I'm actually the most open to considering. I feel that I have a lot of skills I could leverage, but I'm not certain where I should be looking or who I should be networking with. Does anybody here have some insight into up-and-coming fields out there (nuclear-related or otherwise) that have a high impact potential and that would be a good fit for my skill set?",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/1sq6lw/potential_private_sector_career_paths_for_a/

90,Does positioning a space heater below/in front of a wall unit fan actually blow the hot air around?,1386791279,"Hi all, not an engineer, but I rigged up a silly, simple little thing in my apartment and thought I'd ask about it here, just to see if I'm kidding myself or if I'm actually onto something.

My apartment has a dual air-conditioning/heater wall unit, and turns out its heating function barely heats at all. It's supposed to basically blow out hot air with a fan, but when you put your hand up to it, it's lukewarm at best. I actually feel a bit colder with all that air blowing around. (You could say I should just repair the wall unit, but I'm in a rental and my landlord is a bitch about repairing things. I tried to figure out online if that's just how the unit is or if something's wrong with it, and wasn't able to find anything on it at all.) 

So I've been using my space heater (which has 2 400kw elements), but since you basically have to be sitting right in front of it to feel the heat, it occurred to me that I could place the heater under/in front of the fan, which would then blow the hot air around. 

This seems to work (i.e. when I put my hand in the air stream, it feels warmer than the fan without the space heater), but am I imagining things? If not, might there be an optimum distance the heater should be from the fan, i.e. so the air stream is the least diffused and hits most of the rising heat? (The heater is a few inches shorter than the air vents, although I could prop it up on something if necessary.) I guess I'd have to know the speed of the air from the fan though, and have no idea how to go about that. Is it just the sort of situation where you just play around with it and at some point go, eh, good enough?

I guess I could buy a fan to put in front of the space heater, but that seems kind of silly (I'd just buy a heater with a built-in fan at that point, and I think I'd rather bug my landlord about the heating unit than buy something new.)

94,Difference in deflection from FEA and Experimental beam model [Why?],1386765039,"We're a group of students analysing a beam as a semester project. The problem we are really struggling to explain is why the stress in the numerical and experimental beam models match very well, while the deflection in the numerical model is 10% less compared to the readings from the experimental model. Can anyone here help us figure this out? The software we are using is Abaqus CAE, if that info is of any use.

We'd be grateful for any help! Thank you in advance!

In the experimental model, the beam is on top of two rolling supports.
In the numerical model the beam is only restrained in the vertical direction.

edit: It should be noted that the analysis is done within the elastic domain!


The elastic modulus and poisson's ratio were measured with a sample from the same beam, so they shouldn't be the reason we are getting such a big difference in the deflection.
And the numerical model's cross-section is marginally off compared to the experimental model. The top flange is in reality 8.498mm thick, the web is 5.48mm and the bottom flange is 8.502mm. We just rounded the numbers for simplicity's sake. Is it possible that it actually makes a big difference in the results?

The result is basically the same with CST, Q4 and Q8 elements with 19k nodes in our 2D model(MATLAB), and it is the same for the 3D model in Abaqus with 8 node and 20 node elements with 19k elements in a full-scale, half- and quarter beam model(symmetrical load case and profile).

2,"I want to work with smart, passionate people that do good work.",1386723852,"TLDR; See title.

Long version:

I graduated in May with a BS in MechE, and continued at a job that I'd been working part-time (and 2 semesters of co-op). I enjoy most aspects of the work that I do, and I'm learning a LOT, and getting some ridiculously good experience that I think most of my peers won't be getting for several years.

BUT. The work has picked up in the last 6-12 months for the company. We got 2 projects: one easy one, which is very similar to existing equipment in the field, moderately small quantities, pretty straightforward; and one MONSTER, which is totally new equipment, larger quantities than we've ever done before of a larger variety of equipment, and the qualification testing requirements are INSANE (compared to what we usually do). The easy project starts delivering in the next couple months, and the monstrosity starts delivering late next year.

That said, we almost flopped in front of the customer when they came to see first delivery equipment. We literally built the first production units before we had built prototypes of 90% of the equipment. The three preceding weeks were 7 days a week, 12-14 hour days just to get what little equipment we had built. I and my coworkers agree that most of the mistakes were preventable given ANY amount of foresight on my manager's part. For a big example, the hydraulic fluid needed to run the system was not ordered until less than a month beforehand, when I asked ""Hey, did you notice the spec calls for a non-standard fluid?"" This is not to mention we're pushing units out the door so accounting can fluff their numbers, and we haven't even started ANY qualification testing.

Now that we've survived the blast, we sat down for the wrap-up meeting to decide how to handle open items. In typical fashion, the meeting goes as follows: ""So, here's this quick list that I made up"" It included maybe 50% of the customer's comments. Of those 50%, we may have talked about maybe 25% of those. The rest he said were ""his responsibility"". As of yet, not a single open item has been completed, and every man-hour is going towards the monstrosity project. Looking at the big picture, we are at the point with the easy project NOW, where we should already be with the monstrosity. In other words, we are behind as FUCK.

There's one guy here that is super passionate about his work, and is super unhappy with most of the work we put out. In an employee review recently, he was told ""A B today is better than an A tomorrow"". We disagree, and on top of that, most of the work the company puts out is really more like a solid D-. As we like to say, we don't have time to do it right, but we have time to do it twice.

My question is, where do I find more people like this guy? The majority of the people at this company that could make a difference just... don't. In the wrap-up meeting I mentioned above, I tried to bring up how we can fix the problems we saw this time around. The answer, I kid you not, from both managers above me, was ""This is just how it goes, man.""

This is just plain unacceptable to me, as I've never done sub-par work, but now I'm forced to on a daily basis to meet deadlines. On top of this, the mistakes I make as a new engineer almost NEVER get caught. I've had a couple good fuck-ups, and now work more slowly than I should since I know no-one so much as takes a second glance at what I do.

Ok, wow this got long-winded really fast. Real question:

**Where can I find people that care about their work, so I can be a part of a team that can be proud of their product?**

I've always enjoyed engineering, probably should have went to school for it (Did CS instead). I enjoy working on my vehicles, specifically improving reliability\durability\performance\efficiency. When I take on a project, I tend to over do it, to the point where I re-engineer certain aspects of it. That is where I find myself today.

I have a late 80s, air\oil cooled, 4-stroke motorcycle engine that is my current focus. I am increasing the displacement from 600 to about 650cc. The motor has 4 cylinders, 2 valves per cylinder and I am worried about getting rid of the excess heat created from the increased displacement.

In increasing the bore, I have determined that it makes the most sense to replace the iron cylinder sleeves as opposed to boring the originals. These new iron sleeves will be interference fit into an aluminum block.

I am looking to improve the heat transfer between these iron cylinder sleeves and the aluminum cylinder block. I know thermal compounds like arctic silver improve heat transfer by filling in the microscopic peaks and valleys between the two materials. Arctic silver would not be appropriate in this case due to the interference fit &amp; the temperatures involved.

Besides attempting to achieve a mirror finish on both the exterior of the iron cylinder sleeve and the interior of the aluminum bore, is there anything else that can be done to improve the heat transfer?

Thanks in advance!

58,Solar Thermal Panel Corrosion Help,1386378299,"I currently install and partly own a solar installation company in the north part of Florida. I currently use a brand of solar thermal panels that use copper. These are flat-plate solar panel panels. After 2 years, I am noticing massive corrosion in this particular brand of copper solar panels. I am worried that after another few years the corrosion will cause the copper tubing to burst open due to the corrosion. I am getting some water samples completed to determine what metals or elements are in the water in high amounts. 

What could be an explanation of the heavy corrosion? I am looking at about 10+ solar thermal panels, all installed in rural and urban areas with this corrosion issue. What can be done to fix this problem? I am thinking a sacrificial anode of some type, to help stop the corrosion. 

Any input/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

59,"Really simple ""will this work"" question regarding Air Cylinders.",1386377524,"First off, I hope I'm not using the wrong terminology here, but I'm sure you'll get the idea right away.

So I'm working on a little project, and I'm trying to figure out the easiest way to turn a manual movement into an automatic movement. It's for a big costume, and I want to make it so that when I bend my elbows, the elbows of the costume bend in unison. Trick is I don't want any of the parts I use to show outside of the costume, so I need to try and feed it up through a 12""d hole and into the arm of the costume down to the elbow area, so really the only ideas I can think of are using cables. Only problem I see with using cables is that it wouldn't be precise enough.

Then I got the idea of using air cylinders, but I know next to nothing about how air works. In my head, I see a small air cylinder on my arm with a tube going from the end of it to another air cylinder hooked up to the elbow section of the costume. There'd be one on my inner elbow that leads to the outer elbow of the costume, and one on my outer elbow that leads to the inner elbow of the costume. Here's my question (use my masterpiece of art as a reference):

http://i.imgur.com/eJ1cmSZ.png

When I retract my elbow and push all the air out of my inner cylinder (1), will that air be pushed into the costume's outer elbow (2) and extend that cylinder (3), and pulling the air out of the costume's inner cylinder by extending my outer cylinder, ultimately retracting the costume's arm? Will it be as simple as that, transferring air pressure from one cylinder to another?

The costume's arm isn't heavy, only 15lbs., so it's not like I need something really strong. I was thinking I'd need two cylinders for my inner arm (costume's outer arm), and two for my outer arm (costume's inner arm).

If you know this won't work and have any other ideas, I'd love to hear them. I'm afraid my knowledge of these kinds of mechanics are very limited :c",AskEngineers,infection212,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1sa8rr/really_simple_will_this_work_question_regarding/

I've been playing with Matlab for awhile and have stumbled upon a problem which I can't wrap my head around.

Let's say I have: 
signal1= sin(2*pi*f1*t)
and
signal2=sin(2*pi*f2*t+w);

Now I want to subtract these two signals to get a new signal, y. The problem is they are out of phase and the subtraction wouldn't yield the result that I am looking for which is in the case where they are in phase with each other.

So what I have tried is that I did a FFT of signal one to find the imaginary part of the signal which dictates the phase; did FFT on the second signal as well to get real and imaginary components. Then I replaced the seconds signal imaginary component with the first so that they have the same imaginary components, hence staying in phase with each other. Lastly, I made a new complex vector with real and imaginary components. Plotted the results and the amplitude is reduced to 0.6 compared to the original, fixed(ish) the phase problem but now the amplitude is off. 
Anyone have an idea what I'm doing wrong or what should I do instead?

Recently, i have been getting into an argument with some co-workers about the durability of tubing. I just got home from a two-day tubing and fitting course and i am ready to prove my co-workers wrong. I guess that i should mention that i work at a workshop related to the Norwegian oil industry.

As i came to work, i got into a discussion about where a tubing will crack if it where to be put under pressure that exceeds its limits. In the argument, we chose [this](http://imgur.com/wFrKSk0) bend as an example for our discussion.

Even though the wall thickness of the tube is reduced from the 90Â° bend, it is hardened in the bending process, therefore making them the strongest part of the tube. Since we can eliminate the 90Â° bend, we are left with the the horizontal and vertical parts of the tube.  If we where to run any pressurized gas or liquid through the tube until its limits are reached, which part of the tube would crack?

I would appreciate an explanation to the answer as well so that we can finish this discussion once and for all.

My guess would be that the tubing will burst closer to the middle of the longest stretch, but i have no idea why my brain makes me think this. Maybe it has to do with the elasticity of the longest stretch.

I must apologize if my English is a bit off, as it is not my native language.

10,Why did these titanium welds fail in the middle of the face and root bends? Weld engineering/Materials science question,1386134415,"I recently conducted a weld test with 1/4"" titanium, grade 5 for a WPS. When we did the face and root bends they snapped without much bend at all, smack dab in the middle of the welds. It was very brittle and about a 42 on the rockwell C scale, 155,000psi tensile. We did 6 passes on one side, backgouged, then did 2 passes on the other side. There material remained a silver or gold color, didn't get oxygen contamination in the hot metal.

I'm thinking that [this](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a241566.pdf) paper points to precipitate hardening during elevated temps while we were completing the welding. The paper uses grade 23, we used grade 5; but it says those temps are significantly higher than what it takes to age harden other titanium alloys; and it's very possible that we held our test plates at over 300F for a few hours. 

If they are age hardened by this process, would it be possible to bring them back up to above 1000F or so and solution treat them back to a more ductile condition? If not we're kind of fucked...

My system is a loop.  Some air gets exhausted out (people like fresh air apparently) but some air keeps looping through the system. 

Say I have air coming in from the outside, with the state fixed, called state 0.  This is mixing with some air that returning through the system (also fixed state i think), called state 5.  Then they recombine and pass over the cooling coil, called state 1.   I know the total mass flow and entering mass flow.  

Then the prof drops this on me : Because we know states 0 &amp; 5, we can plot them on the psychometric chart and see that state 1 lies halfway between states 0 &amp; 5, so that state is fixed.  

This I did not get.  Anyone know why it lies halfway between?  Or what else I'm missing?

32,Tips for reducing clerical errors?,1386034454,"Hi there /r/AskEngineers,

Something that I have always struggled with ever since grade school is making very small clerical errors. A simple example of this is saying that 2+3=6. Now, I KNOW that 2+3 is actually 5; no one needs to remind me how to do basic arithmetic. These small errors, however, are causing me some enormous trouble.

For example, I had a Fluid Mechanics test the week before thanksgiving break. I started studying a week ahead of time for an average of about 2 hours a day. I went over all the homework problems covering the topics that were to be presented on the exam, and met with a study group the night before the exam for 3 hours to discuss any difficulties we might have had.

Unfortunately, things didn't pan out so well. I got a 76%, which is just barely good enough for a B. Had it not been for a clerical error I made on one of the problems, I would have gotten an 84%, and my professor is unwilling to negotiate on his grading methods. 

Student services set me up with a tutor for this class. The tutor told me what I already knew: I know the material just fine, it's just the tiny clerical errors that are the problem.

This is a big deal for me because I need a 3.0 in order to be eligible for the internship I want this summer. Right now, I have a 2.99. The fact that I am also considering grad school makes it even worse.

Are there any exercises that I can do so that I may get better at catching these mistakes? I'm convinced that I can get at least a 3.5 cumulative GPA if I can reduce the frequency of these mistakes. Any help is appreciated.

35,Techniques for measuring radial expansion of a rotor.,1386023492,"Hi guys, I'm currently trying to brainstorm ways of effectively measuring radial expansion of a rotor, would be great if anybody could contribute.

You can see a simplified diagram [here](http://imgur.com/9fB1n7z)

The application is actually for a seal around a rotor. Obviously when designing a seal, you aim for a tight fit but you don't want excess friction on the rotor as it turns by making the clearance too small. 

In this instance I need to account for both centrifugal and thermal expansion of the rotor as it speeds up. In order to get an understanding of the radial expansion of my rotor, I'm looking to carry-out a test and attempt to measure it as accurately as possible.

I've come up with 3 solutions:

1. Measure the change in clearance between stator and rotor using a capacitance probe installed in the stator that measures to the rotor surface as it expands towards it.

2. Measure the change in clearance between stator and rotor using an optical probe installed in the stator that measures to the rotor surface as it expands towards it.

3. (And this is the one I'd like some advice on because its a bit fuzzy in my mind how it would work) To install an accelerometer on or close to the outside surface of the rotor with the aim of collecting instantaneous velocity data and using simultaneous accurate rotor rotational velocity data to calculate an instantaneous radius.

I am pretty well versed in electricity -- how it works and its different measurements. I understand volts, amps, watts, ohms, phases, and all that stuff. My understanding starts to get shaky when talking solar simply because I have no experience with it.

My scenario: I have some security equipment that I would like to put out on a pole in a remote location without power but receives plenty of sunlight. This equipment is expected to draw 4 to 6 amps at 12 volts DC. We'll say 6, just to be safe.

So, assuming a 24 hour cycle, at 6 amps an hour, I figure I will need a (6x24) 144Ah battery to support the equipment for a day. At this point, a 200 Ah battery would be fine.

Note: I know that the longest this location will reasonably go without sunlight is 16 hours during the winter months. Of course, plan for clouds and whatnot for a week at a time.

Moving on...I would need an array capable of powering the equipment AND charging the batteries a sufficient amount during the day for use at night. Here's what I got, purely assumptions:

6a at 12v is 72w so I would need at LEAST 72w just to support the equipment. Now, how much extra would I need to charge the batteries too? What determines the charge rate? Would 90w do it? 120w? I have no idea how this work.

I'm wondering what the minimum allowable resistance between differential lines is for SATA. The numbers are big, but if it was due to the differential recievers on the SATA to USB converter I would expect them to be identical.

77,Freshman engineering project help needed!,1385785979,"Hello, r/AskEngineers. I would like to start by saying I'm a freshman engineering student at a public university on the east coast (US). During Thanksgiving break, our class was assigned a project to work on. The goal is to sort 100 mixed nuts in 60 seconds. The nuts used are 1/4"" , 3/8"" and 1/2"". There are also restrictions that state we must dump all nuts at the same time, any shaking must be done blindly to simulate a machine shaker, hands may not be used to sort them in any way, and a success ratio of 95% must be achieved for full points to be rewarded. My group and I have been working on this project for a few days and we've hit a road block. Before I go into specific problems, I would like to layout and explain our design.

I find that there is no better way to explain something to engineers than visually, so I used my elite photo editing to present you these: 


* [POV](http://imgur.com/czHX8rz)
* [Top](http://imgur.com/061JmBC)


As you can see, the nuts are forced to do one of two things. They either 1) roll across the board into a separate moat or 2) go under the cross piece. Repeat this one more time with a different height for the cross section and the nuts will be sorted, right?? Wrong.


We have run a few tests and we never have reached the needed 95% success ratio. By watching carefully, we have found *many* roots to the problem. I will list them below and give a brief description/my thoughts.

**Bouncing Nuts**
No matter how we feed the nuts, they tend to tumble down instead of slide. This causes some of the 3/8"" and even 1/4"" to either bounce over the cross section or **bounce** off the cross section and into the 1/2"" nut chute. This leads to majority of the nuts ending up in the 1/2"" bucket. To stop the nuts from bouncing over the cross pieces we plan on placing plexiglass over them. 

**Nuts standing upright**
Similar to the last problem, the nuts standing upright causes them to clog the board and not allow for further passage. Since the 3/8"" standing upright is taller than the 1/2"" lying down, they could also slide across and into the 1/2"" chute. 

**Method of delivery**
The solution to these problems seem to be within how we pour them. I would like to mention that it works perfectly when a single nut, no matter the size, slides down horizontally. However, since there is a time limit, and since we have to pour them all at once, I have no idea on what to do. What I do know is this: the nuts need to be spaced out enough so that they do not clog, and that they need to be horizontal so that they do not go down the wrong chute.

That is where I need your help. I was going to explain more problems, but its getting late, I have homework that isn't going to do itself, and I'm getting tired of typing. Anyway, those are the major problems. The others (method of collection, etc.) are easy enough.

Here is an album if you need to see more of what it looks like:

TL;DR I need a method of making different sized nuts flow one-by-one while lying flat.

87,automotive suspension geometry and what ackerman angle 'does',1385723755,"good morning engineers, this is gonna come across kind of windy and I apologize.

I have a 2004 honda s2000 that I have been driving and improving for the past 2 years.  It now has 173,000 miles on it and I want to start making some more power.  Rebuilding this motor is very expensive, and  it should continue to run forever if i do not start pumping boost from a turbo or supercharger or spraying it with nitrous.  

so,  Im considering purchasing this kit- http://www.importmuscle.com/- and installing a 5.3l l33 gm v-8 engine into the car(just so happen to have one in my garage).  after selling my running motor and transmission for 3ish thousand dollars,  ill need maybe another 2 grand to get the car back on the road.  the power, reliability, fuel efficiency, and inexpensive parts for the gm v8's make this swap very very appealing  and the drawbacks seem to be limited.  

one drawback brought up by a forum user, is that moving the steering rack forward(to clear this massive engine) changes the cars 'ackerman angle.'    Ive got a wikipedia level of understanding on what ackerman angle is, but no math and no clue of what changing it will do to my car's handling.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYMMdjbmQXc&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
also tries to explain it, but fails to give me usable info.

so, how will changing my ackerman angle affect my handling?
how can I measure it? since i cant move the rack, how do i move my ackerman  back?

the company that sells the kit says that 'the affects are imperceivable'  but they are trying to make money and Id expect them to say that no matter what the reality is.  

this is a one time deal,  once I cut the body- theres  no going  back.  thanks for your time



edit:   i just talked to the guys that own the company, and they said that in very low speed high lock turning, it drags the inside tire.  they gave me the contact info of several people who all race the v8 setup, and another person who has put over 25000 miles on the kit.   they told me that not a single person has contacted them about 'regretting' swapping the v8 in, and that it is unanimously loved.

0,Motors for a lift that travels up two stilts carrying 300kg?,1385632414,"Hello,

I have to buid an automatic platform that lifts itself up on two vertical stilts that have been screw fixed into the floor and ceiling. 

The platform weight is around 150kg and it has to carry an additional 150kg of variable load. **Total 300kg**

I can choose the stilt types and basically everything about the mechanism. The only requirement is that it travels 3 meters in less than 30 seconds (so **faster than 0.1m/s**)

Now I have plenty of experience with small motors and I've built a CNC and a 3dprinter as well as a couple of robots so if it wasn't for the payload I'd just slap a 12V DC motor on it and call it a day... but that payload at that speed... I'm at a loss.

*  **Climb Mechanism**: How do I make it climb? 

The speed requirement takes screws out of the equation. They're too slow

I would imagine a *bobbin* that winds up a steel wire on attached to the top of each stilt/pole would also work but won't that give me a variable speed? (because the bobbin gets thicker as it winds) 

Another thing I've imagined is using a *rack and pinion* but in a vertical system I'm worried about those teeth. Rack and pinion is also expensive.


I like the solution of using two bobbins but I don't know how I could fix the variable speed issue. 


*  **Motors**: What beast of a motor do I have to use?

The biggest motors I've used are small 12V DC gearmotors. They are certainly not enough for this application. I have thought of using *windshield wiper motors* but I suspect those are also not enough to carry the payload at the required speed. **This is my biggest issue. I have no idea what to do about the motors and I would appreciate any help!**


*  **Gearing**: As far as I can figure this project is big enough to use a *bicycle chain and gear* system. I hope I'm not wrong about this.




The time I have been allocated for this project is 6 months.

4,Can you use input power to control centrifugal pumps?,1385623133,"**Background:** During a research project I plugged in a centrifugal pump I'm using into a power socket that was already in-use, and the output flow rate was significantly lower.  I immediately unplugged the pump in case this was damaging, and have since found been using the pump while it is connected to a dedicated power source.

**Pump Information:** 
Pump data sheet link: http://www.iwakiamerica.com/Literature/MD_WMD/MD1520.pdf

**Problem 1:** The flow system I'm using the pump for is a little susceptible to leaks upstream of the post-pump control valve.  To be clear, the leaks are in between the pump outlet and the post-pump control valve.  Thus, closing the control valve increases leakage.

**Problem 2:** I cannot replace the pump, nor can I alter the flow system, much as I'd like to.

**Problem 3:** The flow rate I'd like to use is significantly less than the pump capacity, requiring me to keep the control valve nearly fully closed.

**Problem 4:** The application for fluid the pump is delivering is temperature sensitive.

**Question:** I have the equipment required to control and vary the power applied to the pump.  Even if I could solve **problem 1** (leaks), I imagine that closing off the valve as much as I need to for **problem 3** would result in a steady temperature increase which would contribute to **problem 4**.  Is it safe to lower the power input to the pump so the flow rate is such that I don't need to close off the control valve too much, thus solving **problem 1, problem 3 and possibly problem 4**?

18,Help me save my mother's back,1385539142,"My mother has had back problems for decades, resulting from being in two car accidents - both as a passenger in a taxi.  Consequently, among the many other issues, she has real trouble sitting in most chairs, which means going out to a movie or dinner is very challenging.

When we go to dinner, for example, she has to try sitting in the proposed chair for half a minute, after which (2/3 of the time) she finds the chair not suitable and we move around the restaurant looking for other candidates.  Again, the majority of the time, that particular restaurant won't have a chair that works for her, and we're off to the next place.  Luckily we both live in major cities, or we'd be limited to a single place to eat based only on their chairs.

What she typically needs is something hard both at the back and bottom, with light curvature in both areas, that supports both the upper and lower back.  This is usually wood, but can be plastic just as well.

I had the idea that perhaps we could create a portable chair for her - something that a person with back problems can actually carry (i.e. must be light).  I remembered these portable stools that fold up into a 'cane', [something like this](http://feeds.yourstorewizards.com/3014/images/250x1000/gci-quik-e-seat.gif), but one that could be molded to fit her perfectly.

We've spent an entire day looking for just the right chair for her to sit when she visits my place, so it needs to be pretty specific.  She can't carry much weight (she has a tough time with a purse that an average woman would carry) so the apparatus can't be too big or heavy.

I thought perhaps someone could design a 3D model that could be 3D-printed, that would be durable enough for long life.

In this album the top picture shows triangular track. This is a high speed portion of the ride with a gently banked turn to the left.

The second shot is of a turn around after the lift hill. This is also a very high speed section, probably where the ride is at it's fastest. You come off the hill at 92mph, hit a huge 185' banked turn and speed through doing roughly 70mph.

The hill has the boxed track you see on the turn in picture 2. At the bottom it becomes triangular like in picture 1. As you pull out of the hill it goes back to boxed for the turn and then triangular as you hit the bottom of the turn. 

Also, which is stronger. The boxed track or the triangular track? 

Are either of those inferior to spined track like on this coaster by a different manufacturer?

55,Looking for explanation to an argument I had about torque,1385344726,"I work in a factory in an assembly role; this question concerns a debate I got into with a coworker about torque.  

**TL;DR:** does having a 3 foot wrench allow one to torque a bolt to 500 lb. feet with 167 lbs of force?

Here is the background: we were assembling a piece of equipment, when it was discovered that a bolt had not been torqued.  The bolt has its own torque arm that torques to 500 lb-ft., but when assembled it is impossible to get the arm to this bolt.  

I have a 36 inch wrench that fit the bolt, and my reasoning is that at 3 feet, I would only have to apply 500/3 pounds of force to torque this bolt, which was feasible considering the position of the bolt and the wrench was such that I could bear my bodyweight on the wrench easily.  A coworker disagreed and said something to the effect that just because I had a long wrench that torque didn't scale to the length of the wrench like that.  

As I understand it, torque is measured in lb.-feet, so if 1 pound foot is force of 1 lb. at a distance of 1 foot, 1 pound at two feet should be 2 pound feet.  Is this correct?

59,Why is so little pressure lost in a steam piston? (See full text for details),1385309653,"I am reading *The Most Powerful Idea In the World* which is a history of the development of the steam locomotive.  (Actually, most of the book is actually tracing how the notions of patent protection allowed the steam engine to come about, I'm approaching page 300 and they are just now getting around to the first self-propelled land steam vehicle which showed up in 1801 and the first rail-mounted steam vehicle in 1804 which was really an engine designed for a steam hammer that was kludged into a steam powered locomotive for a bet.)  Up until this time the engines used a condenser to rapidly cool the steam as part of the articulation, but a guy by the name of Richard Trevithick wasn't satisfied with the 10psi or so that was generated by the old style engines and wanted to start building high pressure steam engines.  He was considering venting the steam out of the engine rather than injecting cold water to condense it: this passage of the book threw me:

&gt; In 1797, Trevithick asked [Davies Gilbert, future president of the Royal Society] to calculate how much power would be lost if instead of capturing the steam in a separate condenser, the engine simply exhausted it into the air.  The answer was Threvithick's real eureka moment.  Gilbert explained that with each stroke, the cylinder would lose exactly as much pressure *inside* as the pressure *outside*: 14.7 pounds per square inch at sea level.  This would obviously be disastrous for a Boulton &amp; Watt separate-condensing engine, which generated only a little more than ten pounds per square inch inside the cylinder; exhausting the condensation would leave it with no pressure at all.

&gt; In 1800, five years after Joseph Stacey Sampson had brought Oliver Evans's drawings to Britain, and three years after Davies Gilbert had shown that an engine operating at 60 psi would lose only a quarter of its pressure at each stroke, Richard Trevithick introduced his first high-pressure steam engine at the Wheal Hope copper mine.

So this is my question: what causes the loss of pressure to equal atmospheric pressure?  It seems logical that the pressure would drop until it was equal to the exterior pressure so there has to be something that prevents this from happening.  Is it because the valve opens and closes too quickly for more pressure to escape?  If this is the case then why not open/close the valve more quickly instead of allowing the full 14.7 psi to be lost?

I want to be able to test a wide range of wind speeds from approximately 0 to 30m/s but I'm not sure how to design the wind generator. 

I figured I'd set up a 1x1m tunnel with a fan inside in an effort to create a jet of air at the outlet. Then calibrate the wind speed at the test surface against fan power using an anemometer. However, I have no idea what type of fan to use and was wondering if someone could help me out. 

I found [this retailer](http://www.ebmpapst.com.au/en/) which seems to offer a wide range of fans but I really have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking for (other than it has to be smaller than 1x1m). They list a property Qv (m3/hr) which I'm assuming is how much air it 'pumps' out.. Can I just take that value and divide it by the cross sectional area (1x1m) to get wind speed or does it not work like that?

63,"Final draft design specifications for a car I've been working on for a long time. I've posted here before and received a lot of advice, this is the final result of all the work I've done and advice I've gotten. I hope it was worthwhile.",1385260298,"For the record, I have no formal background in engineering, so I can only really call myself a designer here, not an engineer.

I'm not sure how to present the design as anything except a list of details, so here it is:

* The body is in a somewhat teardrop-like shape, with the front end being very aerodynamically rounded and the rear end tapering down to a circle the size of the spare tire that hangs off the back. The front end's aerodynamics are improved by the fact that the engine is placed underneath the rear row of seats, a few feet in front of the rear wheels.
* The drivetrain is an all-wheel-drive turbodiesel hybrid vastly different from any all-wheel drive, turbodiesel, or hybrid systems already being used in automotives. The front and rear wheels have completely separate drivetrains; the rear wheels are powered by a redundant chain-driven CVT: essentially several copies of a more heavy-duty version of [this](http://cvt.com.sapo.pt/ratcheting/PAT-US-0724449.gif), with synchronized pneumatic pistons changing the gear ratios whenever needed. The front wheels would be driven by a sequential hydraulic hybrid system, with the hydraulically-powered motors mounted directly onto the wheels. These drivetrains would allow the engine to run at its most efficient RPMs at virtually all times, and would be very adaptable with manual controls.
* Extra exhaust heat that radiates through the exhaust pipes is captured, as well as extra heat from the engine cooling system, to power a closed-loop steam engine.
* There is not an alternator anywhere directly connected to the engine or the rear-wheel drivetrain. The hydraulic pump in the front-wheel drivetrain does have an alternator, which also serves as a motor that can be used to build up some extra hydraulic pressure when necessary. The steam engine also produces electricity to charge the battery. When the steam engine runs over capacity, and has spare power the battery doesn't need, it uses it to boost the hydraulic drivetrain. I refer to this as a thermocharger setting.
* There isn't a traditional muffler. There are a small number of turbines collecting a small amount of exhaust pressure outside of the turbocharger system, and powering an additional set of turbines all the way at the end of the exhaust pipe, which suck the air out of the pipe. This should hypothetically improve the turbocharger's efficiency a little bit, but more importantly it should help quiet the sound if the turbines are placed at the right distances and tuned properly.
* The front wheels are mounted underneath the front storage compartment. They're cambered towards each other at a 45 degree angle, with the edges angled to lay flat against the ground. I believe part of the reason excessive cambering isn't usually done is because of the force it puts on the axle or wheel bearings, but in this case the wheels can be connected to the steering geometry very strongly, due to the sequential hybrid drivetrain.
* All suspension in the car can change its height with hydraulics by about 20"". The front wheels can expand to the width of the rear wheels (moving to the outside of the car, as the aerodynamic form factor makes the front end narrower than the rear end) and then tilt into a vertical orientation while adjusting their air pressure to handle the change in force. (The air pressure can also be released from the tires to enable quick stopping in the case of an emergency.) This provides a huge amount of versatility for switching between economic road driving and cross-country or driving in snowy terrain.
* There's a fin on each side of the roof. This sacrifices a little bit of aerodynamic efficiency, which is unfortunate, but it provides great places for antennas, e.g. you could put up 4 different GPS antennas, one on each side of each fin, and get more accurate GPS readings by averaging them out, right?

There are a lot of other details of the design, but most of them aren't very important or unique, so I won't waste any more space here.

It looked like the takeoff was directly into the wind (which means that less groundspeed is necessary to reach takeoff airspeed) and in cool air, which increases air density. It was also raining.

The rain displaces oxygen in a given volume of air taken into the engine. In the combustion chamber (or during compression stages?), it should also absorb heat (from combustion) and evaporate, reducing exhaust temperatures.

In a large commercial airplane (such as a modified high-volume 747) taking off, what would be the bigger issue?

Now what im trying to understand is why spinning/swirling the cooling air acts to improve the cooling.

80,Soundproofing an audio recording studio,1385145425,"BACKGROUND:

I am the IT Manager for my office. I have a project that I will be assigned in less than a year. We haven't even selected the building yet or hired an architect. The technical design of the project will be my responsibility. I will have to oversee the architect's work and that of the MEPs.

MY PROBLEM:

I would like to not be arbitrarily hampered by old ways of thinking. Sometimes the traditional building methods are the best and the newer ones are simply cheaper. But now that I have the time to think about it, I would like to ""think outside the box"" (sorry) and plan ahead. I have plenty of time to do research and talk to people before I have to actually talk to the architects. My experience from managing previous construction projects is that by the time it  gets rolling and you are speaking to an architect, you no longer have time to do theoretical conceptual design.

MY QUESTION:

**If you had total leeway to build out a new audio recording studio, what material or method would you use to insulate for sound?** 

For example, image a large warehouse size space where you need to build two adjacent rooms for audio recording. The two rooms will share a wall and have a large window between. The rest of the building is typical office space with staff and cubicles. The recording studios will be at most 20' by 20' each.

As an IT guy, I hate drywall/sheetrock. I realize it is typically one of the go to materials for walls that need ""sound proofing"". But any cuts and changes creates lots of dust. Then there is the spackling and painting etc... Is there some other and better way to build interior sound proof walls. The rooms need both sound ""deadening"" and to block sound transfer through the walls.

None of the walls would be load bearing and there is no requirement that they support the weight of any equipment mounted on them (other than the window and doors).

***Just point me in the right direction so I can go do the research !!!***

I have read about melamine foam and have been trying to come up with a basic design, but I'm stuck. Can a wall be build just out of various types of foam and some minimal structure just to hold up the foam? Or, how would you do this if you were given this project?


EDIT: 

Also, I've also read that there are different types of fiberglass insulation and they act differently on sound. For example, there is a studio that I visited and the engineer there made a big deal about the fiberglass he used. He had it wrapped in cloth and in thin wood frames (2"" by 4' by 8') which he mounted on all the walls in his studios. He said that because he used ""6 pound"" fiberglass that it blocked sound transfer well.

Does anyone know anything about the different types of fiberglass and their different effects on sound propagation?

Some of the big advanteges he brought up were an unlimited supply of water for the notoriously water hungry plants, and low environmental contamination risks as water is of the most effective shields against radiation. 

The only glaring issues I could see was the cost to build the extensive infrastructure required to support a nuclear power plant, in the ocean. The way he thought radiation worked was also wrong but I didn't eaclty know why. He thought that if there was an incident, the contamination would be contained to the immediate area, considering how much water ""insulates"" against radiation. How does radiation spread through water if water stops it so well?

IT HAS TO EXIST!!!,1384904266,"Hey guys, so I'm planning on using a high load electric [linear actuator](http://www.thomsonlinear.com/downloads/actuators/Linear_Actuators_bruk.pdf) in an application. It's going to be holding quite a bit of load over people, however, so I need some redundancy. In parallel with that actuator, (and with the same clevis-to-clevis interface) I'd like to put a support rod that can extend/retract when the actuator is driven.

Essentially, what would be perfect is a damper/dashpot style rod that is only allowed to move when the linear actuator is driven... Thus if the actuator catastrophically fails, the damper-rod-support catches the load and saves lives.

Rules of the Game (Requirements):

* It can't be pneumatic (otherwise something like [this](http://www.cowandynamics.com/include/get.php?nodeid=1726)  would be a good choice.

* Telescoping (kind of like a damper) would be ideal but not necessary.

* Must have a stroke length of at least 18""

* Must be able to support 2000 lbs...

* Must be electronically controlled...

* It doesn't need to lock in compression, only in tension...

* It needs to be rigid!!! Not seat-belt type catchers...

18,Eliminating components of a specific frequency range from an acoustic signal.,1384901415,"Hello Engineers,

I've been stuck with this problem for a few weeks now. Let me start off by explaining what I want to achieve (using Matlab to work) .

I have an audio clip (.wav) of approximately 2 seconds.
I load the clip to Matlab with the audioread function.
I attain the array of data x and sampling frequency Fs ([x,Fs]=audioread('file path');)
I do an FFT of x to get X.
From the FFT I can see that it goes up to around 4 kHz.
The big spikes are all located under the 2 kHz point (so I assume that the major components are all in the sub 2 kHz area).

Now, let's say that I want to remove all the components that are in the frequency range from 0 to 1 kHz from the original data while leaving everything else intact.

I proceeded this way:
Made a low-pass filter of 1 kHz cut-off.
Filtered x through the FIR filter and called it y.
Made a FFT of y called Y to double check; the spikes only went up to 1 kHz. Filter worked.
Subtracted filtered data (y) from the original data (x) and called it z.
Plotted z against time -&gt; Waveform looks messed up than before.
Made FFT of z called Z and plotted it -&gt; Looked more messed up than before as well.

Now I expected to see the components that ranges from 0 Hz to 1 kHz removed from the original. The results attained were the opposite: they looked even more messed up.

Any ideas guys/girls?

19,Advice on building an experiment to measure low frequency sound transmission loss of various materials,1384897643,"I'm doing a final year project looking at the sound transmission loss of materials at specifically low frequencies ( 20 Hz to 250 Hz). I'm trying to come up with an experiment to do this but have yet to find a good experiment that will not cost too much to set up. The standard measurements to measure the sound transmission loss either require a double reverberation chamber (which I don't have access to) or an adapted impedance tube ( described in ASTM E2611-09).

I've looked into building such an impedance tube and am reluctant to take this route since it would take a lot of effort, can only measure foam/fibre materials and is not ideal for measuring at very low frequencies. 

I am considering just aiming frequency impulses from a speaker at a sample with two microphones either side of the material and just measuring the change in sound levels but am unsure if this would work due to the effects of background noise at low frequencies. I've also considered placing accelerometers either side of a material to measure the difference in vibrations, however am unsure if this is possible / would be advantageous over using microphones.

Ideally, I would like to measure things like the effect of having a gap between two materials whilst varying materials used and gap size between materials.

I've since figured out that the culprit is not my 11month old sump pump, but the backup power supply (inverter with marine battery).  Anyways, I found the manual for this thing and it tells me under failure mode #5 that if the battery doesn't have adequate voltage that it will charge it and the sump pump will have no power.  What I experience was the battery go dead, then despite no interruption in power, this thing stole the power from the sump pump to try and keep its own battery alive.  Is this common?  I expected it to pass thru power to my pump even if the battery were dead or removed...not the case.  Now I make a bit of research, that sump pulls up to 450Watts of power and when I look at most UPS devices they can provide that kind of power for like 3 minutes.  Is a battery backup for a sump even a good idea when it can (without alarm or anything) have its own battery die then introduce a new failure mode?  Or is this thing I inherited with my house just a crazy design that most wouldn't use and the battery should be able to die without interruption in service?

49,Career change to ChemE,1384727709,"Hi, /r/askengineers! I have many questions. 

**Background**: I graduated about three years ago with a B.A. in Bio (liberal arts, only offered B.A.s) with a strong emphasis in molecular and biochem (and a minor in English just because). My favorite course series as an undergrad, and the one I did the absolute best in during my four years, was the o-chem sequence. I took it at the end of my junior year though and didn't want to spend another year or two in college to change my major, even though I loved o-chem and just had a sixth sense intuition of how it worked. 

After graduating I received a fellowship to study in Asia that shifted my career basically from biochem research to video games/entertainment industry, and I've worked in the video game and book publishing industries since. (My first major book was published just a couple months ago!) It's been fun, but I don't know that I want to be doing this stuff when I'm forty (video games), or that either industry allows me the kind of lifestyle I'll want in a few years. (Book publishing is steadily shrinking and the games industry often requires lots of relocation, neither of which is great for starting a family.) 

As a note, when I got back from my fellowship I did look for positions as a research associate/technician in biochem in the Seattle area, and I couldn't even get calls for interviews, and I partly continued in video games/publishing because that's the kind of jobs my contacts/network could provide.

**Currently**: I'm really debating grad school for chemical engineering, but I'm not sure if that's really feasible for me anymore. My grades were only so-so (3.3--I had a lot of growing up to do Freshman year) but I always do extremely well on standardized tests, so I'm not worried about the GRE. I had a research internship for a year during college, and of course the fellowship that ended my schooling, plus my current work experience (outside the sciences for the most part, unfortunately. I do tutor at a local center for math and science because I like to teach.) If I were to pursue grad school, it would either be for chemical engineering, programming, or back to bio, although I would probably prefer chemical engineering just because I loved o-chem so much, and the security and pay I've heard so much about, or programming, just because there are so many opportunities where I live in Seattle.

**Questions**: 

1. How big of a hurdle would a three year gap in involvement with science be? I have developed other great skills in project management and effective communication, but those may not be skills someone at the admissions board cares about.

2. I'm assuming I'd want a master's, seeing as I have work experience and an undergrad, but what does that enable for me that's different from an undergrad? Would I need an undergrad specifically in chemical engineering to begin a master's program?

3. What's the job environment like in chem e? I'm leaving book publishing/video games specifically looking for greater security, and I don't want to invest in a career that's about equivalent. Where are the major hubs of chemical engineering? I currently live in Seattle which is a major hub for software development and would prefer to to stay here if possible.

4. What would you say are the things you enjoy most about chemical engineering? I'm assuming that I would like chem e because I love building things, knowing how things work and where the materials I use to make things come from, and loved o-chem, and I'm assuming that's chemical engineering, but I don't know that for a fact.

I am on my universities FSAE team, in charge of intake/exhaust systems at the moment, (I am also considering being Powertrain team lead for next year).

58,Changing career direction from medicine to engineering,1384682393,"Hello AskEngineers. This is a fairly long and self absorbed post, but if you have the patience and are interested in giving a little career advice please read on. 

I am 24 years old and nearing the end of my second year of a four year graduate medicine course. The course content last year was entirely theoretical -- physiology, anatomy etc. which was new to me and, despite being a heavy load (around 400 lectures), I enjoyed it overall. 

This year, however, is the first clinical year of the course (i.e. most of my time is spent in a hospital with patients applying the knowledge learned last year). It has been much more difficult psychologically. I found myself progressively feeling less and less fulfilled to the point where I could no longer find the drive to study and I developed symptoms of depression. I ended up submitting myself to a psychiatrist who told me that I am indeed depressed. 

Depression is not uncommon among medical students and it has led me to do some soul searching. Looking back, I have not wanted to be a doctor for my whole life, rather I chose to take medicine midway through my undergraduate degree (chemistry major) for fairly pragmatic reasons: I wanted a job that combined technical knowledge and skills with working with people, I am good at analytical thinking and have a decent factual memory (diagnosis), I like working with my hands (surgery), and it has almost guaranteed job prospects and a comfortable salary. Admittedly the idea of the letters MD after my name didn't hurt either. 

However, the only thought that has given me any relief in the past few months has been realising that medicine may not be the only career that matches these attributes and that it may not actually be the best fit for me. 

Some things in particular have prompted me to reconsider my direction: firstly, my family background. I am the only one in my family to attempt a medical degree. In fact, my family is made up almost entirely of mechanics, designers, pilots, and jewelers so these fields are what I have been brought up with and seem to come naturally. My childhood hero was Nikola Tesla, not a doctor. I am not especially creative artistically, but I do have the urge to do a job which involves designing and creating something functional -- this is one crucial need that medicine really does not seem to provide. I also dabbled in electronics and programming growing up, although I did not develop these skills so my knowledge of them is now rather primitive. 

If I was asked what I consider my best strength it would be that I can often intuitively understand how dynamic physical systems function by visualising them e.g. imagining a beating heart in my head helps me predict the physiological changes that occur when pharmaceuticals change the behavior of the heart. It applies to equally well to anything physical, from molecular interactions to internal combustion engines. This seems a useful talent for design and was extremely helpful for chemistry, but I find the technical rigor of engineering fields more alluring than something like industrial design. Could this talent help me become a good engineer or is analytical and numerical aptitude more important?

On the other hand, I've always been intimidated by engineering because of its reputation of being math heavy. While I'm not bad at maths and passed calculus 1 and 2 early in my undergrad it just doesn't seem to come as easily as other subjects for me because it's more abstract and hence often harder to visualise. Should this give me pause?

Finally, I am extremely lucky and grateful that, thanks to a supportive country and family I have zero debt, so I do not have a financial burden hanging over me. Given all this, what do you think I should do? My current plan is to take a leave of absence for a year to give me time to recover and decide but that only defers the ultimate decision. 

I am seriously considering dropping out of medicine. With a year off I won't finish the degree for another 3 years which would become 4 in the likely event that I have to repeat this year. If I stick it out, finish the hated degree, then take an engineering course which is itself 3 - 4 years then I would be very well qualified but also over 30 years old and still a student. This worst-case scenario of another 8 years at university really does seem unacceptable. Maybe I would be better to cut my losses and drop out now, the basic medical knowledge I've gained might even be transferable to something like biomed engineering? Ultimately I'm starting to think a job that involves creating things might make me happier than one that involves healing people. 

One last thing, a pipe dream that I have is to start and run a business and the problem solving skills gained from engineering seems more applicable to this end than a medical degree. Is this reasonable? Is there a certain field of engineering that you would recommend me, or even a job outside of engineering?

Except just this one monument, because it was only designed to last. That's it.

* How would you make that monument?
* Where would you put it?
* What would it be made out of primarily?
* How large would it be? What shape?

This isn't a homework problem or anything. It's just an idea i've had for a project that keeps popping back up in my head. I guess it's because after all is said and done and all the people are gone or they've left earth and have come back eons later, if the only thing left is this thing, then whoever built it basically wins the real version of Civilization V.

A 5k pot came with the controller, I figured the simplest solution would be to replace it with a 5k digital pot.

We just got an overview but it seems to have had a profound effect on engineering at a very fundamental level, however it's easy to imagine that this effect has been exaggerated somewhat in the interests of creating an historical narrative. This seems like the perfect place to ask just how revolutionary the Model T was. How different to previous factories was Henry Ford's? How much lower were the tolerances for the components compared to previous or contemporary cars? Many of the innovations seem to have been in the factory processes rather than mechanical design (versus something like steam power), is that the case?

I'd be really interested to hear what anyone has to say on the matter from any perspective as it seems to have had huge knock on effects in many other areas and sped up the rate of progress of the human race in general.

I didn't want to further clutter his thread with my questions, but it has me really curious.

Imagine I set a leaf spring ""curved side up"" on my frictionless garage floor and a 200lb man stands in the center of the spring.  If the spring rate is 200lbs/inch, then my understanding is that the spring will deflect 2"" towards the floor.  This will obviously cause the two ends of the spring to spread apart from each other. 

Now imagine that with that 200lbs still applied to the top of the spring, I clamp one end of the spring down to the floor and to the other end I attach a pull type scale fastened to the wall to measure any lateral ""pulling"" force in the spring.  Then I have my 200lb guy step off the top of the spring.

Does the scale measure 200lbs of lateral pull as the two ends of the spring pull towards each other and it tries to return to it's happy place?  

In my mind it seems like it has to, but reading the original thread, it appears to be a more complex problem.

Picture a sphere that is fixed on a pivot at the base, i.e. it can rotate around the pivot with limited extents. If we measure acceleration at a point on the outside of the sphere, can we infer the acceleration at the center of the sphere? Let's say for the sake of reducing complexity that Point A (outside) sits in the same vertical plane as point B (center). Thus if I apply a force to the back of the sphere, the disc will rotate forward about the pivot. If I apply a force to the side of the sphere, the disc will tilt about the pivot. The sphere could also be rotated with ""up"" as the normal, in which case point B is fixed with an angular component, but point A would be rotating on the outside of the sphere.

I was hoping there was a way to automatically calculate the costs per sub-assembly when dealing with a higher level assembly--currently the only way i can total prices is by listing the BOM in parts-only mode and adding an extra row with a ""TOTAL"" equation, then putting that value in as the sub-assembly's ""Cost"" property. I'd like to be able to dynamically sum the costs of each sub-assembly's child components as a property of that assembly, ideally in the same custom property as the top-level parts (even if I have to qualify the ""Cost"" property manually for each sub assembly as an equation) so the higher-level BOM's can display costs more clearly.

* Producing electricity from engine heat. The engine produces excess heat which cars usually just release into the air, why is this? What's the challenge preventing us from using that energy for something useful (other than HVAC)?
* Spring-loaded pistons in the boxer engine configuration. The power each spring saps from its piston, it adds to the opposite piston, effectively canceling itself out. Hopefully this is more efficient than letting the pistons fight each other's momentum every time they change direction. Am I entirely wrong on this? I completely see how I could be.
* How much light is produced in a running engine? Could this light energy be harvested in any way? Maybe carried by fiber optic cables to interior lights (or headlights)? Would it be impossible/prohibitively expensive to expose the cables to the light without destroying them? I can see how it would be annoying that the amount of light fluctuates constantly, but this seems trivial to solve.
* Take out the muffler. Put turbines in the exhaust pipe, use them to power turbines in the air/fuel intake. Idiotic? Shitty version of a turbo?

42,Looking for Power Engineers to offer some career advice!,1384227283,"Hi AskEngineers, first time poster here. Before I ask my questions here's some background:

I Graduated with a BSEE in May. In June I started an internship at a T&amp;D Co-op which will last for just over 6 months (currently employed). I really like the company and my co-workers, however I have a desire to move *towards* the generation side of power. Ideally working on managing energy sources and tying them into the grid, although the job description is not *as* important to me as working for a company that actually produces power (provided the job is still in the power engineering area). It may sound naive, but philosophically I just want to work at the beginning of the supply chain. 


Anyways, the Coop I work for has offered me a full-time power engineering position. Here are some things I need to consider:

* They will pay for continuing education, but only the cost of in-state tuition. I live over 2.5 hours away from the nearest school which would offer an MS in Power, and that school may not even be offering it next year. 

* If I choose this, I need to work at the company a year after completing the degree.

* If I choose distance learning, it will still cost me a lot- at least the amount **over** an in-state tuition and maybe no reimbursement at all.

* I have not taken my FE, and have not signed up yet (hesitant in case I will be moving)

* I am doing well financially (no debt and a few thousand bucks)

* I am willing to move pretty much anywhere to work.

* I have applications ready for a few rural coops (with generation) and large utilities, sending out over the next few days.


SO...
I would like some of you (power engineers or similar) to share your opinions, and answer any questions that you can.


1. What do you do at your job (or past job)?

2. Co-op or normal utility?  Generation or just T&amp;D?  Big or small (in your opinion)?

3. How long have you been working there?

4. What do you like about it?

5. If I were to accept a position at the company, and then get an offer elsewhere in the next 6 months/year, do you think the company would see it as sleazy or disrespectful for me to quit so soon?

6. Do you know of good distance learning MS programs for Power engineering, or something else that might suit my situation?

In the setup I have, the wheel is connected through a linkage that has a significant amount of backlash. On top of that, I have a heavily geared down motor and an encoder connected to the motor output shaft (before being geared down).

My PID control is:
control = (error x Kp + sigmaError x Ki + Kd (velocity-velocityOld)/(timestep))/gain

the gain was determined experimentally based on the relation between duty cycle and velocity (velocity units are encoder ticks per timestep)

I know the proper procedure is to start with 0 Ki and Kd, bring Kp up until the system oscillates, drop it down a little, then bring in Kd to reduce settling time and finally Ki to minimize steady state error.

My problem is the step response of the system looks like [this](http://imgur.com/tXMpRKf). When I start with Kp between 0-10 the system does not reach the desired velocity. Above 10 the system response stays the same. I haven't tried over 1000, but I don't think I'm going to be able to tune Kp to get oscillation (any more than I already have).

52,Considering a career change. Advice needed.,1384194579,"Hello engineers!

A bit of background (not too specific, just in case someone from work is reading this):  I studied Physics, and for the last year or so I've been working as a patent attorney.  Frankly, I'm at the point where I'd much prefer to be doing something with at least shades of practicality, rather than engaging in word games to try and get claims past examiners.  A couple of quick questions (and I'll probably edit in more as I think of them). I'm in the UK if it matters.

Would my degree + experience generally be enough to get a job? Would employers be OK with a (2:1 from a good university) physics degree, rather than something with real-world design elements?  Another degree isn't really an option due to money, but a shorter course might be.  

Are there any hobby projects/online tutorials/whatever that I could use to get a feel for the job (and something to show off at interviews) before actually taking the leap? Moving away from the dark side would probably be a bit of an initial pay cut, and slower initial pay progress, so I want to be a bit more sure that I'm not just moving into another job I dislike.... There's a hackerspace near me, so access to tools shouldn't be too much of a problem.  I have some coding knowledge, so dusting that off and polishing it up a bit shouldn't be too much of a problem.

At the moment I'm leaning towards electrical engineering (since it seems like the one where I have the most practical knowledge), but open to suggestions relevant to all fields.

Sorry about the grammar/readability, I've been writing claims for the last couple weeks, so I've forgotten how English is used by real people.

Really... it might be a ""cultural"" or rather cult-ish thing (V8 being a kind of trademark). I can't think of any advantage. Ok, its balanced, but the inline six is even smoother. You need power? Take an inline six with more displacement. Some say the inline six is long, but this shouldn't be a problem. It fits in a M3, it fits in a 1er BMW and I don't know of any V&gt;6 powered car that is too small for a straight six cylinder engine. Unlike the boxer engine, the V engine doesn't offer a much better center of gravity. There are a lot of disadvantages of V engines on the other hand: 2 cylinder heads means double of the amount of work for mechanics, more cost, more wearing parts (camshafts, valves etc). You want turbo charging? That'll cost you twice. Overhaul an engine? 2 more holes to hone and more valves, cams, hydr. lifters etc etc. as compared to an inline six.

75,"Injection molding design questions - incorporating runners/sprues into the part, split lines, mold layout, and some others.",1384033213,"So I'm designing the case for something I want to put on Kickstarter (I want to get a rough idea of how much the injection molding will be before I take the plunge). The part referenced is roughly 4 inches (100mm) wide, 1.3 (35mm) inches tall, and 1.3 (35mm) inches deep. Here's some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/nLYJe). 

Anyway - I have been using Protolabs to get a rough idea of how much this will cost (I know they're expensive, but they have some nice design analysis and interactive free quotes so I can quote without being sold something or wasting someone's time). Anyway - they don't allow assemblies. This seems kind of weird - it seems like you'd put your sprues and runners in as an assembly component and mate them, but they only allow `.prt` files. Is this something specific to protolabs, or are the mold features always incorporated into the part?

Currently, I'm designing the case as a shelled part, getting the rough outline, putting the PCB in an assembly with the case and getting the distances set. Then when all the design is done, use a split line to create a separate top and bottom part for the mold, making an assembly from those parts, aligning them how they would sit in the mold, then putting the sprues and runners and gas vents in. But, the last part doesn't sound like what should be happening in the design (by Protolabs not accepting assemblies). What would the 'typical' design flow for designing something with a top and bottom be?

How do you align the injection molding features to the machine it's on? Do you put a hole going off into the distance, and they match it up with the machine, or does your 'extra' design change depending on what injection molding machine the mold is being used on? 

I know I missed a few fillets, don't have intentional drafts, and fastening features (I'm thinking screws securing the top and the bottom and a groove), but is there anything glaringly terrible about this design? 

[ch00f](http://ch00ftech.com/2013/04/16/making-55-of-something-without-lifting-a-soldering-iron/) had a great description of contracting out making 55 PCBs, has anyone found anything similar for injection molding - starting with a design or idea and seeing it through to completion?

23,Help on polishing?,1383797333,"I am totally confused about terminology and applications when it comes to polishing.  A brief overview of how to do it would be great.  In my lab, we are making  tin discs (~ 1 cm diam, 2-3 cm height) in a hydraulic press, then would like to polish them (by hand) to a mirror finish.  I know that former lab members have done this  but they're gone now and I haven't been able to reach them.

I've been using 1 um alumina slurry, .3 um alumina slurry, and .1 um diamond paste, all applied to a Buehler polishing cloth (the cloth itself is black, not sure which model...).  After applying the 1 um slurry and working the disc for a few minutes, the metal actually looks not bad, fairly specular reflection with some scratches.  The .3 um slurry seems to improve it, but it's tough to say.  Scratches still remain.  The diamond paste actually makes it worse, even after applying with a good amount of pressure for a long time.  The paste is consumed pretty quickly, so I would be surprised if I have to keep going with it, I would use up the tube in no time.

I guess I'm not clear on what I should be doing or if I'm doing this correctly.  I know the polishing pads are made for machines but unfortunately that's not in the budget.  Shouldn't the fine-particled diamond paste improve the specularity of the reflection, not be generating more roughness?  Am I just not doing it long enough?  Is diamond paste the wrong abrasive?

If anybody can give me a general idea on how to select a polishing pad (or other substrate), a slurry, a paste, which should be used when, how you know you're making progress, etc., I would be most grateful.

Today while going through a 174 span section I began thinking about the possibility of placing the deck so the joints will lie mid-span, allowing for debris and water to simply fall below, away from the substructure.

Could a 12v 10AH generate enough current for 5, 10, 20 seconds to start it? It's a 1990 Honda Accord LS, stock engine, if someone has resources to find minimum current.

2) Is there a better way to isolate this battery from accidental drain than by using a diode to allow it to charge, and a relay w/ switch to connect it to the main power line? (Alt current through the diode into battery, storing emergency power there until the relay closes in emergencies.) 

Would it be better to just have the relay also automatically close (and allow for charging) when the car is running, rather than using 2 lines and a diode? (Either with a voltage sensor, or splicing into existing wiring).

75,How do I find a vacuum setup for this type of project?,1383590560,"Hey, I'm really inexperienced with some of this stuff and have two questions for you guys.


First, I'm working on a project with a granular jamming component. It runs on battery (more to the order of a VEX battery than a car battery) and needs to suck air out of a coffee-filled balloon. The volume of the balloon is about 183 cm^3, I've determined that the volume of air inside the balloon should be about 146.4 cm^3 (between grains of coffee). I want to drop the pressure inside the balloon by 85 KPa, sucking out 0.145 grams of air. Ideally I should be able to run this setup backwards and puff a little air back in, bringing the balloon to slightly above atmospheric pressure, but this is not totally necessary.


My first question is, how do I create a setup that can do this? (i.e. something that can suck air out of my balloon, is lightweight and cost-effective, and runs on a small battery) I considered just repurposing a set of vacuum tweezers, but that seemed like a bad idea, I could make a small pneumatic setup, but isn't that overkill? What would be the best way to approach this?


My second question is, how long will my vacuum setup take to suck out air? I know the balloon is shrinking as I suck more air out but for simplicity I'd like to say it stays the same size. If I find a vacuum setup I like, how can I calculate how long it needs to run?

Problem:  At both of these jobs I have to admit to myself I am doing a lot more project management than engineering.  In the first one, a lot of documentation, and now more worrying about inventory, parts and testing.

In undergrad I didn't specialize but took courses in many areas of EE including DSP, analog, computer architecture, fiber and wireless.

If this is not the right place to ask this question please let me know. Thanks.*

I'm currently planning on purchasing a condo in California. It is a 20 story building. I learned that there is a pending litigation there, in which the HOA is suing developer (and I believe the investor from which the building was purchased from).

I'm being told that it is minor issue, also lenders are aware of it and are willing to finance as long as I'll have minimum of 20% down payment on it. A friend of mine is already owning condo there and she is in finance committee and I'm being told that the lawyer fees are already included in HOA (the litigation seems to be already lasting 2 years) so I don't expect HOA fees jumping up because of that.

What I'm worried is how serious it is and how hard would be for them to fix it? It seems like there are multiple issues listed (all seem minor) in the suit, but the most serious one is that on 3rd floor at one place the floor is not even. As you walk in the hall you feel going down and then up. When you kneel on the floor and look at it you can see it is uneven. The unevenness is also limited to one side of the path (i.e. depending from which direction you are walking it is on left (or right) the other side looks ok. Lastly there is a visible crack on the wall next to that area.

The condo that I'm interested in is not in the area where the fault is, so it should not affect me directly. I'm more concerned about the structural integrity of the building. Is this something to be worry about? What are chances that the building might be deemed not livable in the future?

Please note this complex is located in California, so there is a possibility of Earthquake (the HOA fee includes earthquake insurance). There was not any major earthquake since the building was built.

I answered these very well, and they were happy and impressed. Both asked me why I wanted to work for them.  I said I am looking for a change of pace and more advanced work, and I saw their ad and felt I had the right experience.  This they accepted.  

Then both asked me a question I didn't know.  One interviewer asked me a technical question, and I gave the honest answer, saying that I didn't know.  They seemed disappointed.

Each piston is a flywheel, I'm picturing around a foot in diameter and 4"" thick. A tooth (or possibly multiple) sticks out of the flywheel, but curved smoothly rather than having corners or a square shape. Outside is a piece that presses against the outside edge of the flywheel, forming a seal for a cavity inside of itself, which is the combustion chamber. As the tooth moves past this piece, they come closer and closer to connecting, making the chamber smaller and compressing the fuel/air mixture before combustion. The explosion pushes against the tooth and sends the flywheel spinning, eventually pulling the tooth away from the chamber-piece and allowing exhaust to escape. Obviously walls are necessary around the outside to keep the seal.~~

[Stage 2](http://i.imgur.com/nLEqQLZ.png) - The tooth rotates forward and the space between itself and the injector block thing on top gets smaller, compressing the fuel/air mixture.

[Stage 3](http://i.imgur.com/a2UGsvN.png) - Combustion launches the tooth forward, spinning the engine.

[Stage 4](http://i.imgur.com/bbraCNT.png) - A gap opens in the chamber, allowing exhaust to escape. The engine spins back to stage 1.

The movement of the top piece which injects fuel and makes up one wall of the chamber would be timed by threads rather than being hit into place. ~~In the actual to-scale geometry, it shouldn't have to raise and lower, simply rotate. Probably the front side of the tooth will be a smooth taper down to the flywheel rather than a cornered edge.~~

Would this be viable? I'm planning to use it with a CVT, so you can keep it spinning at a high RPM where the flywheels will store as much energy as they can without becoming dangerous, and just change gear ratios constantly as you change speed. The CVT will be chain-driven and have redundancy splitting the load across as many chains as necessary, so it should be able to handle the power. As I understand it, this will produce a very fuel-efficient engine, since very little power is wasted with each cycle, and it should be capable of very rapid acceleration, as you can get the flywheels spinning quickly and have them storing a lot of excess energy before you let up the clutch. Am I wrong on this? Would it in fact perform poorly or waste energy in a way I'm not aware of?

Feel free to steal this idea, patent it, and make money off of it, but if it's worth all that, you should probably hire me and take all my future ideas too.",AskEngineers,HStark,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ps5fe/im_trying_to_design_a_car_and_i_want_to_know_if/
