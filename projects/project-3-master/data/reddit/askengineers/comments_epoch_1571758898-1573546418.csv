3,Math major and Biomedical Engineering minor. Is there hope for a career in industry?,1573537273,"I'm a senior undergrad and majoring in Math because I originally wanted to be a teacher.  After countless internships in public schools I realized it wasn't for me. I added a minor in Biomedical Engineering because I found this field to be very interesting. I thought it would be a great idea to add this minor to have a greater chance of finding a job. That is my main concern, NOT FINDING A JOB. I know it is difficult enough to find a job with a degree in engineering, but I would have a math degree. Should I pursue graduate school for biomedical engineering since I do not have internship experience in engineering? Or any other engineering field that you would recommend me looking into?

The only research experience I have is a summer Statistics REU on survival analysis where we determined the best method of estimating the survival of patients with cancer. We also worked with data of patients with pacemakers.

4,[Need Advice] Feeling not good enough,1573536314,"TLDR: tend to compare w classmates who can understand and do better than me, feel like not good enough to continue this path, need advice to get through this.

as a title suggest, I'm a sophomore in university studying bioengineering.
this term I finally got to touch upon more engineering subjects and most of the concept are new to me so I try my best to ask for help whenever I don't understand a certain concept, to seek for classmates and TAs help with homework etc.
but lately as the concepts get harder, I tend to get more frustrated easily esp with homework and started to feel like I'm not doing good enough, I'm not as good as my classmate whom can understand the concept within a lesser time than I did, and manage to get a full/high score in homework and exams
when I ask one of my classmates for help, telling them this problem is hard for me, asking them if they could do it and let me know what they think. once they finished the problem, they got w full score in first try, and turn to me and said ""it's not hard, what do you mean it's hard?"" and that threw me off 
I know I shouldn't compare but it's been hard not to esp I'm studying w ppl who are far better than I am, I feel like I've reached the limit. idk if I should keep on going, I mean I know I should! because I have an ambition to help others w this degree, it's my value to do so, but it's so hard not to feel I'm good enough

6,"When solving a thermodynamics or a heat transfer problem, when do you neglect radiation?",1573527647,"So I am taking modeling and simulations class, and our current unit is heat transfer. I was looking through my heat transfer textbook to find the answer, but what are the conditions, if you had to determine it mathematically, to neglect radiation from a problem. the problem I am working on is just a piece of copper heated in air. I am also asking from a more general standpoint, not specifically for this problem, as I know how to solve it, this is more of a conceptual question, hopefully that's allowed here.

Could you compare the convection and radiation heat coefficients, and say if the convection coefficient was much larger than the radiation coefficient, you could say that considering radiation wouldn't change the final result too much? Or is it dependent on the temperature difference between an object and the surroundings? I read in my textbook, that the radiation heat transfer coefficient is much more dependent on the temperature difference than the convection coefficient, which might be because the temperatures in the radiation coefficient are to the power of 4.

13,I got an offer in a related industry. What factors must I consider before going Contractor? [UK],1573512226,"Hi, I am currently on £42,000 (about £2,300 monthly take-home) as an aerospace design engineer and have been with my current employer just two years. I was with my previous employer just two years, and the one before that just two years and four months.

My current job does not offer me advancement opportunities, doesn't have good work-life balance, has an overbearing (micro)manager, and there isn't a salary raise in sight. With that in mind I've just received a contractor offer in nuclear submarine propulsion for £52 ph. At `£52/hr x 38hr/wk x 45 wk/yr = £88,920` this is a significant increase in income. It's an absolute sell-out move as I've not been at all interested in marine engineering and it doesn't fit in with my background or aspirations. Using [a calculator](https://www.contractorcalculator.co.uk/) and the default expenses of £11,000 results in a profit of £74,800. Total taxes are £22,915, my net annual income is £59,884, and net monthly income is £4,990. 

Amongst my goals are achieving financial independence. However my career aspiration is to work in the space sector on chemical and electric propulsion. I am not sure whether changing jobs and becoming a contractor will weigh heavily against me when it comes to future job applications. On the plus side I can make some more cash, spend it on a 2nd masters degree in September 2020 or 2021, and some additional training to help break into the sector. 

With regards to contracting, the way I read it, an 'umbrella' company is simpler but reduces your net income. However, I'm not averse to finances and bookkeeping so should register with companies house. I will probably need an accountant and to set up a limited company and get insurance before starting.

16,Is my experience common? I feel like I am in between a rock and a hard place at work.,1573508040,"I've posted to this subreddit a few times in the last 6 months or so about my work situation. The basic overview is I was working as part of a project team supporting a project manager on a major technology expansion, a business-critical project. Basically scaling up a pilot operation to full production. This is an expansion of an existing unit, so it's not a totally greenfield construction, but it is still a very complex project. The previous PM quit, and my boss and the PM's boss decided I would take over as PM, despite being still relatively inexperienced in project management. I have managed very small, simple projects before. This project is about 50 times the budget and complexity of anything else I have managed. The previous manager had about 15-20 years of experience, I am sitting at about 3.5. Additionally, my request for a raise was denied. I have a wife in school and we plan on moving when she graduates anyway, so I felt I had no option but to just suck it up and take on the responsibility. 

Project management is not what I want to do, and I feel like I am ill-equipped to continue to perform in my role. Nothing has been catastrophic so far, but every week I come home feeling like I want less and less to do with this project or this company. I don't feel like I can be honest with my boss about my feelings. Considering how I got to this point in the first place, which feels like a drastic oversight on the part of my boss and the other leader, I can't envision a scenario where I tell them anything honestly and am met with anything but ""either you continue to do the job or you leave"". Considering I have 6 months till my wife graduates, I don't really feel like I have the option of leaving yet.

Is this experience normal? I really feel like if this project were as critical as everyone claims, they would have done better to ensure that it ended up in the hands of an experienced manager. I know that throughout my career I am going to have to accept more responsibility as I progress, but I can't help but feel like I was thrown into the fire with little training or support.

21,Design Engineer (Substation) Considering Move to Estimator,1573497947," 

Hello, All.

I'm a substation design engineer (BSEE, 2.5 years experience). Although I understand the importance of design work early in my career to establish a foundation knowledge of the industry, I've known even while in school that I wanted to be on the business side rather than technical (PM, sales engineering, proposals, etc). My company offers a rotation program to new engineers, and they allowed me to be a construction PM/Estimator for about 6 months to get a taste of it. I loved it. I did not stay in the role because (1) I felt that I did not have enough technical experience and would be behind the curve, (2) pay was not as good as design engineer salary, and (3) the role does not require an engineering degree (construction management) and I could not justify taking on a role that did not require a BSEE after all the hard work I put in.

A recruiter reached out to me, and I'm currently in the running for an estimator role for a new company in the same field (substation/T&amp;D EPC). The pay is great, and it would allow me to get away from design (which I'm becoming very disinterested in after only 2.5 years). I think I would accept the job if offered. It also does not require a BSEE, but they find having one a big plus.

If there are any current/past estimators with an engineering background, advice would be highly appreciated.

1. First, are there any reasons I shouldn't consider this?
2. Am I able to use estimating experience toward PE experience (4 years required)?
3. Is a PE pointless in this realm? I'd be pursuing it for financial gain, not personal pride.
4. Am I pigeon-holing myself into this line of work?
5. Does this career have great earning and promotion potential over the course of one's professional years?

For Background: I am a 3rd year Aerospace Engineering major. I have an internship lined up for the summer of 2020 with Rolls Royce. Last summer I interned at NASA. I interviewed with Northrop Grumman at a conference for a full time position (mostly to practice interviewing). I wound up receiving a job offer for their Redondo Beach location at ""Space Park.""

Additional information for the curious ones of you:  
A local CNC-machining company asked my school if my class could come up with a way to chamfer their hydraulic hose clampings using their Cobot (Universal robots UR5). It's not that the company actually needs help to do this, but our teacher asked the company for a task we could be given, and the company will grade us on how we do. The company isn't that large, so I assume simplicity, budget, and reliability are factors they value highly. Therefore I was thinking just having a pallet for un-chamfered parts with a laser-cut sheet to center the parts at given coordinates. Then the table-mounted drill mounted on the side of the table on which the Cobot sits. Then a pallet for the finished parts. Easy and simple. (The motor will be activated by the output from the Cobot's PLC, and will obviously not be running continuously).   
IF (and that's a big if) the company did implement my dirt-cheap solution, I wouldn't want it to fail after a couple of weeks due to poor quality of the parts-list I supplied, which is why I would prefer a motor that isn't sold for 20 bucks on Ali express, eBay or whatever.",AskEngineers,False,FetchTheGuillotine,/r/AskEngineers/comments/duvd2q/anyone_know_a_reputable_source_to_get_something/

Their reasoning is engineers tend to put in more hours, so they want them to have the ability to take time off when they want to. After doing some digging, it is all manager-approved, so not really 'take it when you want' type of PTO. I have never worked at a place with unlimited PTO, but I've read enough articles to know that many employers are switching because they noticed most employees are too afraid to use it as freely as they use their earned PTO. I wouldn't fit into the category of people afraid to use benefits offered by the company, but if others are, I could see myself being labeled as lazy.

Another weird one I noticed is paid holidays. Different company than previous paragraph. Engineering gets 10 paid holidays, everyone else gets 12. The reasoning behind this is they need the engineers on the job more and they get the ability to work from home more often. Another employer offered 7 holidays total, all during an Xmas break. You could float them around to other holidays if you want, but besides that, no other federal holidays are observed. Their sales and management was exempt from this, because they don't think they will get any work done those days. 

Is this normal? Have I just been able to work at places who do not operate like this? The first two are weird, but not totally out of the ballpark. The last one is just straight up bad for anyone who is not sales/management, because it means they get way more company paid holidays than you do.",AskEngineers,False,dreadknot65,/r/AskEngineers/comments/duuwly/different_benefits_for_engineering_vs_other/

This question is directed at environmental engineers. Apologies in advanced if this question appears to be somewhat trivial or stupid. I was curious as to whether climate change genuinely be declared to having a direct cause of increased bushfires?


A bit of context:

As of recently, across the east coast of Australia there are currently more than 60 bushfires, 200+ homes lost etc. The media has constantly been bringing up climate change/global warming and roasting politicians (no pun intended) about the need for climate action. 
As much of an environmentalist I am, I can only wonder if this is really true. (However I am a huge advocate for environmental conservation etc just to make that clear). 

Can a temperature increasing of [0.2 degrees Celsius per decade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming) really be causing a drastic change leading to widespread bushfires? 

I'd appreciate any response, all engineers welcome. And I do apologise in advanced knowing that this question is probably more suited towards scientists but I'm interested to hear what is thought from you guys. Thanks.

91,Help for a non engineer on what fixture or motion to use.,1573391095," 

Hi there just looking for help making something currently stuck on, not sure if this is the right place to ask so sorry if it is not.

I dont have much experience in anything engineering so have no idea about technical terms or components. I have just been using Tinkercad to try get it from an idea to a working item.

I am trying to make a set of folding rulers that can be folding/expanding/sliding or any action really that works, but am getting stuck on the folding/expanding part. So if anyone can help that would be amazing. I am using an FDM 3D printer to make this and would like it to be completely printable using parts or filaments as a pin to a hinge, the exception is magnets I wouldn't mind using them but the simpler design the better as I am a beginner and would like to finish them myself.

I am making them for tabletop gaming and want a set that ranges from 4-8 inches that will be doubled when folded/flipped/slides out. Something like this: [https://art-of-war-studios-ltd.myshopify.com/products/copy-of-guild-ball-measuring-stick-complete-set](https://art-of-war-studios-ltd.myshopify.com/products/copy-of-guild-ball-measuring-stick-complete-set), but able to fold/slide/pivot down so I dont have to bring a big tube to transport them and so I only need to bring half the amount. They are used to measure distances from one model to another etc

I have tried parametric or snapping hinges but the hinge gets in the way of measurement when using it folded, or it wont lay flat when flipped down. I am probably using the wrong kind of method or part in the fixture but I just dont know anything technical.

Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated I have no problem designing or making it but just cant work out what to use to reduce their size or still functional when folded.

This is the first version I used but the hinge kept failing to print: https://imgur.com/S1m1D2L 

 This is the second but I could not get this to print in place either: https://imgur.com/SRHfjVR 

This version prints but I cant get it to lay flat when closed and the hinge part gets in the way of the measuring it uses filament for the hinge pin:  [https://imgur.com/CVKNqtC](https://imgur.com/CVKNqtC)

I was going to try a magnetised sliding or pivot approach today but had no idea what part to use for a pivot so thought I would ask the experts.

99,"Can I get more air flow through a panel if I poke lots of little holes in it or a few big holes, holding the total area of holes fixed?",1573363068,"Suppose I have a rigid panel of fixed uniform thickness, air on one side is (lightly) pressurized, I want to drill enough (regular circular) holes in the panel to vent a certain volume of air flow across it, without weakening the panel by removing too much material. (\*)  The potential size of the holes could vary from ""about as wide as the panel is thick"" to ""much wider than the panel is thick"", but whichever size hole is chosen, enough of those holes will be drilled to remove the same amount of material from the panel -- so if I'd drill n holes if I'd chosen a 10 mm bit, then I'd drill 4n holes if I'd chosen a 5mm bit.

My uninformed intuition tells me that fewer larger holes should promote more total flow, because \[waves hands\] edge friction effects are less -- you have less total perimeter to enclose your fixed holes area, and perimeters seem like they'd be bad for flow.

But various references tell me that the ""coefficient of discharge"" for a hole (""orifice"") that's large relative to the thickness of the panel it's drilled in is substantially less than unity, meaning (I think) that the flow through it gets shrunk a lot relative to what you'd otherwise expect (""expect"" based solely on area and pressure difference?).  Conversely, the coefficient of discharge for a hole that's small relative to the thickness of the panel it's drilled in is higher, closer to unity, meaning the flow through it gets discounted less.  Since then, for a fixed panel thickness, the way to keep the hole-diameter/thickness ratio down and the coefficient of discharge up is to drill smaller holes, that suggests spreading my hole-area-budget across many small holes to get the most total flow.

But this just seems weird -- the discharge-coefficient being bigger for relatively thicker panels makes it sound like I'd get a flow boost through a generic hole if I extruded some ""pipe"" out around it on the outlet side -- but is that really true?   
 Would sticking a pipe onto an exhaust ""port"" make it pass more exhaust?  This sounds nutty, but maybe it's still true because \[fluid dynamics\]?

(\*) Is this concern about limiting the total area removed from the panel in order to keep from weakening the panel bogus as such?  Again, uninformed intuition suggests maybe the ""few large holes"" setup messes up the structural integrity of a panel more than the ""many small holes"" setup, ceteris paribus, and ""total area removed"" is a pretty bad way to gauge loss of strength -- I only need to remove negligible material to cut the panel clean in half, and that pretty obviously weakens it a lot.  So maybe ""many small holes"" has other advantages, like letting me drill away more total material for the same strength loss, that outweigh the considerations about coefficients of discharge altogether?",AskEngineers,False,Unreasonable_Energy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/du7bwm/can_i_get_more_air_flow_through_a_panel_if_i_poke/

The arm is going to be constantly accelerating or decelerating in a sweeping motion with either a sinusoidal or triangular position pattern over time (TBD), with a period of about 3-4 seconds.

My concern is that while the motor has ample torque, the system has an inertia mismatch of 100:1 of load:motor.  I'm trying to voice my concerns about controllability because 30:1 seems to be a commonly-held rule of thumb for a rigid system and (which I don't think this will be because of the long arm so it would require closer to 1:1).

I work in product development at a major (at least in our niche) consumer products company. I get it. As engineers, we're just cogs in a well oiled machine and nobody thinks of us twice until they need something fixed or something goes wrong.

I've been working at this place for 4 years now. I've worked on R&amp;D'ing countless projects since (some were complex products with mechanical and electrical parts, some were simple). 

Our engineering department is basically me, a CAD drafter and the VP of engineering. I basically handle all R&amp;D with some project management thrown in.

Time and again, I've seen people in other departments get praise for what they do (achievement awards, special perks, shout outs etc.) while our entire department basically gets ignored. I had to beg and throw a fit for a raise after almost 3 years of working here, and they threw in a 10% raise just to keep me from quitting. I did ask for COL raises every year, but the ""company didn't have any money"". I know this is BS because I found out that people in other departments were getting COL raises every year.

At the risk of sounding like a baby - I can't help but feel a pang of jealousy/feeling underappreciated considering all that I do around here. I get that every department pulls their weight and are important but is it normal for engineering to be completely ignored?

As a company we're completely sales focused. The salesman is king, we have to bend over backwards to accomodate sales requests. Be that disappearing off to China for 2 weeks in a moment's notice, staying up at odd hours to interact with suppliers in China, the list goes on.

I thought I was getting fairly compensated for all this, but it turns out my salary is now below the median wage for people in my position and experience.

The list just keeps growing and I'm amazed that I internalized the way I was treated at this company.

My only questions are: should I just expect more of the same in consumer product development? Does it get better? Is it too much to ask for some basic respect and acknowledgement of the work I do? Is the problem really that nobody else understands what we do?

I have been attempting to learn the basic of the CCD over the past couple days. If quantum efficiency is a function of wavelength, how do we correct for the difference to obtain an accurate representation of a “scene”? From my understanding, in astronomy the shutter time can be varied as they utilize long exposures and very narrow bands (via filtering). These images can be overlaid in post processing. In a “standard “ CCD, is there a ‘compensation” calculation utilized for each unique CCD sensor?

18,Need help finding a type of load indicator.,1573324273,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

So I had an idea, which means much like all of my other ideas it must already exist. I just have no idea how to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this came about a few days ago when I was on a slinging course. One of the points brought up was that once lifting accessories (slings, shackles, etc) had been used for pulling something (think towing a vehicle) rather than lifting, they could no longer be used for lifting since you wouldn't have any way of knowing exactly how much load had been placed on them, so wouldn't know if the load had exceeded what the accessory was designed to take, so wouldn't be able to tell (excluding any obvious visible signs which would be picked up on inspection) if and how much they had been damaged.

&amp;#x200B;

This, while perhaps a little on the cautious side as a universal rule without exception, makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

What I thought of then, was a type of ""boolean load indicator"". What I'm imagining is a small device which, though a colour change or some similar indicator, tells the user if the load experienced had exceeded a set value. This would be designed to be placed in ""series"" with your slings/chains/other lifting accessories. I'm imagining the device's ""load"" would be pre-set and not changeable.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this would best be explained with a scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine you have two vehicles. One which needs to be towed, and one which you plan to tow it with (henceforth referred to as the ""tow-ee"" and ""tow-er""). To connect the two, you plan to use a 1t sling, and two 2t shackles. This would make your setup;

&amp;#x200B;

tow-er -&gt; shackle -&gt; sling -&gt; shackle -&gt; tow-ee

&amp;#x200B;

with the device (henceforth known as ""device"") added in, your new setup would be

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tow-er -&gt; shackle -&gt; 2t device -&gt; 1t device -&gt; sling -&gt; shackle -&gt; tow-ee

&amp;#x200B;

Your 2t device would tell you if the lifting accessories had experienced &gt; 2t of force, the 1t device would tell you if the lifting accessories had experienced &gt; 1t of force, so telling you if the slings and shackles had operated within their designed limits, and so would still be usable for lifting.

&amp;#x200B;

21,Using decibels to measure a sound's intensity/volume: How do sound wave dynamics compare to electromagnetic waves?,1573322399,"Hi :)

This is something I've been wondering and haven't found a conclusive answer on google. I have an electrical engineering background and am very familiar with the decibel system as it pertains to electronics.

I understand that 10 decibels correspond to a factor of 10 increase in the intensity/power of the sound. 

But I'm wondering, does this scale take the frequency of the sound into account? A 50dB sound at 200Hz surely can't be equivalent to a 50dB sound at 15kHz. 

Furthermore, at what point does a sound wave simply mean a shockwave? For example, I understand ultrasonic waves are used for measuring distance, SONAR, etc. But what would a 140dB ultrasonic wave look like?

In short, what are the similarities between sound and electromagnetic waves in the ultrasonic+ spectrum? Do sound waves in the gigahertz-realm exist?

48,Fixing my hometowns canalization infrastructure,1573259976," Hi fellow redditors,

I recently encountered a problem during my studies and am still unsure If I solved it in the most efficient way.

Therefore I brought you a little riddle today:  
   
Imagine you have a city with a new separated canalization system: Each house has one pipe for clean rainwater and one pipe for dirty wastewater. The pipe with the rainwater is being led into the sea in which all neighbor's children are usually going for a swim and the pipe with the wastewater is being led into a treatment plant.

Now, unfortunately, the installation of these new separated pipes have fallen onto the first of April at some houses and now we’ve got the dilemma: Some funny or drunk (or both) craftsman wrongly connected the pipes at some of the homes. If they connected both the wastewater and the clean rainwater from the house into the rainwater pipe the toxic wastewater is being led into the next sea which is a disaster. But also the other combination is not any better, because if all the rainwater comes on top of the wastewater in the treatment plant the treatment plant is at its maximal capability of water that it can clean each hour and will give up at some point.

Here you can see a sketch of this disaster: https://imgur.com/N3esS0y

Now since I can’t dig out every single pipe to check if it is connected properly I was looking for a more efficient way of solving this mess. I already thought about looking into the pipes for indicators (such as leaves for rainwater or toilet paper for wastewater) and also wanted to try using color tracers that might indicate where the water is coming from. 

I am sure that some of you big brains will come with an even smarter solution, everything is allowed!!

51,"Facial Scanning monitor that can detect drivers emotions, alertness, and distractions that could lead to an accident.",1573258395,"Greetings Engineers,

I have a group project that entails making a theoretical product to help truck companies lower their accident rates.

&amp;#x200B;

Our product is described as follows...

 The Drowsy Driving Detector is a facial recognition device that uses biometrics to map congruences and contrasts in the facial features and environments of drivers that correlate with heightened risk behaviors. The detector provides real time feedback of high risk driving behaviors, identifying factors such as sleep deprivation, increased driver distraction, and driver alertness. The internal technology of the detector has set algorithms that helps define the correlation of a driver's habits with the likelihood that the behavior can be attributed to a higher probability of an accident. The Drowsy Driving Detector provides real-time feedback through auditory and visual warnings according to a hierarchy of risks developed in the underwriting software within the device. Poor driver performance risks are itemized with low to high scale that entails feedback that becomes more emphatic and rapid if a behavior is repeated within a short window of time or the risk size of the behavior is very high. For example, the detector will provide a low frequency sound and or minor glare when a driver commits an observable lower tiered risk behavior such as gazing at their radio channel for too long. For higher tiered risks such as a driver beginning to nod off, results in a more strident sound at an accelerated pace. The internal hierarchy of risks monitored by the device (facial/environmental scanning and risk underwriting software) and external feedback given (auditory &amp; visual) by the device are in sync to benefit the driver of his/her present state of probable peril, resulting in better prevention of accidents, furthering the company's bottom line. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I need help doing is placing all the theoretical components to create this product. Below is the list I have so far. Please help me identify all theorectical components that need to be in this design. Below is what we have so far...

\-camera : facial recognition + USB Port

\- alarm : speaker

\-lights : led light+ conducter

\-charger: 12 volt charger port

\-Casing: mount+ plastic casing

\- circuit board

I am using a SanDisk microsd (16 gb) and installed raspbian lite.

I am adding fields to the wpa\_supplicant.conf file to make sure that the rpi connected to my mobile hotspot. My wpa\_supplicant file looks like:

    country=us update_config=1 ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant network={  ssid=""Samsung Galaxy J2 Core 2619""  psk=""mypassword""  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  } 

I also make an empty ssh file. Note both the ssh files and wpa\_supplicant.conf file are written into the boot directory. There is another root-fps partition (where the etc folder lays) but I can only look at that partition on linux. I only add files to the boot directory from my mac and assumed that those files were automatically copied into the etc/ folder when the rpi starts up, as I was able to connect to the rpi at least once.

Does anyone have any idea why I can connect sometimes and other times, I can't?

I am also having trouble installing packages with apt-get and I am wondering if that has something to do with the connection issues. It also has frozen when almost done updating apt-get. Thanks

92,"What materials should I use for a flexible, air-permiable heat exchanger?",1573192548,"Good morning all,

As a hobbyist, I'm attempting to develop a short-term heat-exchanger to heat up air flowing through it. This will take the form of a ""sock"" that sits on the dash of my car to heat the air from the fans after start-up but before the engine has heated sufficiently to do this itself. As a bonus, it would be good if it dehumidifies the air as well.

The reason for this is to clear the condensation from the windscreen. Often the car is sat running for a few minutes before I can move, and I'm struck by the thought that this is wasteful.

Usually the projects are in the same state, and the engineers are licensed in this state. This project however, is in a different state which is where my concern arises. After completing the drawings for this project, I was told to put someone else’s signature on it. This other engineer is the brother of one of our engineers, and is licensed in the state the project is in. My concern is that this brother does NOT work for my company, and has not even seen the drawings. When I asked about it, I was told they have a “mutual agreement” to use each others seals/signatures when needed. So essential, I’m putting on the seal of someone that hasn’t worked on the project at all.

On the other hand I see other kids (engineers/ students) who can barely scrape by for a job and have to settle with a boring job they don’t want and eventually it becomes their career.

* Initially it started with Hz: why are Hz measured with s\^-1 units instead of just multiplying by seconds if it is ""cycles per second""? And why is it ""cycles"" instead of including a measurement of length(like wavelength) as in velocity?
* That leads into: what is a second per second(s\^2)within Newtons? I get that a Newton is the force to move 1 kg unit 1 meter per second, so what is that other 'per second' mean in space/time?
* Then, as the meters are squared to form a Joule, what does that extra meter dimension doing in space/time that alters force into energy?
* (May seem like a contrived question but) Does each dimension in an SI unit express how many dimensions they exist in within reality? I.e. A Newton exists in 4 dimensions because it has 4 dimensional units(kg, m, s, and another s).

I'm a fourth year non-engineering major university student at the University of Washington. I'm your typical example of someone who did really well in high school without trying, and was too slow to adapt to the pressure of university. I wanted to be an engineer all my life but in my second year my advisers told me that with my grades (\~2.70 with retaken classes) no engineering program at UW would accept me, and I would need to look into transferring to a smaller state school. But, instead of transferring I decided to join an open non-engineering major in something that I found interesting (Earth and Space Science) just so I could UW on my resume. Turns out I don't like ESS as much as I thought I would, and I just have this nagging feeling that I'm going to regret not pursuing a career in engineering for the rest of my life.

My parents are always bragging about how they have a ""UW student son"" and put a lot of pressure on me to get into a prestigious school, so I always thought it must be really valuable, but now I'm starting to think otherwise. Back then I thought it would be a better idea to get a degree in something I don't care about from a big school than to get a degree I want from a small school. Every single one of my friends that came to UW for engineering ended up joining an open major (like I did) and getting a degree they never wanted *just* so they could say they are UW alumni. Now they're all  unemployed living at home. That sounds awful to me, and after a year of ESS I decided it wasn't what I wanted to do. When I told my mom I wanted to transfer, she told me that I should finish my degree at UW and then maybe look into getting into engineering, but frankly that doesn't make any sense. 

I have 43 credits left in my ESS degree, and conversely 43 credits left in an ME degree if I transferred. Regardless of which path I take I would have a year left to graduate, but I don't see how spending an extra year and accruing another \~$30k in student loans to get a degree in something I don't plan on using is worth it. I have no plans of working for some ""cutting-edge start-up"" or anything, I just want something stable, but the way some people act makes me feel as if transferring would make me unemployable. I feel lost. Am I going to regret not having a piece of paper that says UW on my wall?

TL;DR: I'm going to a fairly prestigious university currently for a degree in something I don't care for, but people in my life seem to believe the prestige of your university is more important than your degree and that I should pursue engineering after I graduate.

76,Struggling to stop pump leakage. Please advise if you have hydraulic/pneumatic experience / expertise.,1573063419,"We have a reciprocating pump that feeds off 2 gear pumps with highly viscous sealer. There is one line coming off of the main reciprocating pump, tees off at the front gear pump and goes another 20ft to the rear gear pump. The reciprocating pump works at the same frequency throughout the cycle of 30 seconds from start to finish. The problem is, the rear gear pump finishes its job 5 seconds earlier than the front gear pump. Looks like, as soon as the rear gear pump closes, all the flow is directed to the front gear pump which increases the internal pressure and causes the sealer to leak out of the shaft seals. We have had sealer leakage out of front gear pump since we installed it. We can't reduce the rate/pressure of the reciprocating pump as it would starve the system. If I put pressure regulators just before each gear pump, would that prevent pressure surge at the front pump after rear is done ahead of time? Or do I need to put flow control valves to limit amount of sealer going into both gear pumps? If I put flow control valves, and reciprocating sealer pump is working at the same rate, how do I protect the system from destroying itself?

The design attempts to push as much as I can out of a purely battery powered engine using ducted fans. The idea, as I have it, is a 3 layer system where the first layer at the front of the fuselage is a low compression ducted fan. Directly behind it would sit a re-enforced higher compression ducted fan with more blades. Beyond that is a low bypass re-enforced high compression ducted fan. To begin with, I'm not sure if this 3 compartment system would actually do much good, but my focus for this question is what comes afterwards.  


So is the effect that we see with rocket motors where air compresses down to the choke, traveling at mach 1 and then decompresses after the choke, trading compression for speed and leaving the nozzle at mach 2+, possible in this environment? With the above mentioned series of fans, could I potentially compress air enough to increase the output by choking and then expanding the outlet of my RC plane?

After searches that entailed hundreds of applications, nothing popped up. This is pretty universally agreed upon as the most forefront and important factor in getting engineering jobs, far more important than grades/ knowing what is going on in classes. I know I will hear this in every thread regarding internships and jobs and it still kills me inside every time to hear it. 

2. Research/Project Experience

None, I will be graduating with about five quarters of various senior design project stuff. But no real leadership experience on these roles.  I should have done more personal projects though, have a few plans to finish school regarding embedded systems....         

   3. Social Skills &amp; Connections           

I have Aspergers and my personality doesn't stray that far from this. This makes the most important element of being competitive professionally down the shitter. I think If I picked CS, this would be a lot dampered in effect in comparison to my current major (ME), to reasonable speculation. I have a few very faint connections from school projects / capstone projects at best.  

4.  Motivation 

This has died, attempting to find an internship played a role in this certainly. In retrospect I would have applied to 0, because I still would have gotten 0 and this category wouldn't have taken quite a blow. It was already taking a hit before this though. That spark is really dying at this point and it feeds back on the rest of the points

5. Direction

Everything that interests me seems unfeasible, which kind of steers me away from committing to anything. I wish I could at least have this so I could stick to what interests me, but that is kind of a pipedream on top of the above categories. There is some extent that this just seems natural (like when you are studying propulsion and you realize everyone who does the research on this is top notch academic faculty), but at this point anything is hard to commit to

If someone offered me an LA minimum wage engineering gig for after graduation I'd be immensely contempt getting through the end of school and having something.

15,Looking for advice for a new engineer from manufacturing or quality engineers,1572997909,"Hello everyone, I'm looking for some career advice and I'm in a bit of a weird position.

I'm a recent graduate (May 2019) from college and I have a BSMET degree as well as a certificate in Corrosion Technology. One week after I graduated I started my job, my title is Manufacturing Quality Engineer, and I work for a small (50 ish people) and we make medical equipment for very large names in the industry. 

My thing is my current position is kind of strange in that I have responsibilities in two different departments, manufacturing and quality. 

My manufacturing responsibilities are to write and revise work instructions for different processes, assist in training new employees on manufacturing processes, make and design fixtures for assembly processes, work station layout and design, and process improvement. 

My quality responsibilities are to aid in corrective actions from customers, perform on site inspection for certain parts from suppliers, talk to suppliers about quality issues with parts we get in and parts we send to customers, root cause analysis, perform inspections with a portable CMM on a certain critical part, fill in for the regular inspector on the CMM arm for other critical parts, and I'm also receiving training on how to do FMEA and internal audits for ISO from ASQ (American Society for Quality) that the company is paying for my membership and also the classes. 

I'm probably forgetting some smaller things but that's the gist of it. 

I guess my question is this, will what I'm doing at work now help me down the road? I've never heard of Manufacturing Quality Engineer as a job title and I feel like that will look weird on my resume when I eventually decide to switch jobs, whenever that might be. I'm starting to think about if I want to eventually go into a solely manufacturing role or solely a quality role and I'm not sure which would be a better fit for me. 

I can't do this joint role forever. I'm looking for input from other manufacturing engineers and other quality engineers about what they think about my situation. I know I don't want to be a desk jockey because if I had to sit at a computer all day looking at CAD models and drawings and documents all day I would probably last 6 weeks before I started bashing my head into a wall.",AskEngineers,False,SirDeep,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ds7tj3/looking_for_advice_for_a_new_engineer_from/

I began thinking then, what was it that drew me to wanting to be a PA, then it struck me, it was the problem solving.

Or, I could continue at my current company with another internship, this time more focused on mechanical engineering or design. The problem is, I have no idea if another internship will help me find a full time position or lead to anything, and financing grad school would be much more difficult.

46,How do I clean up a smokers smell In a home?,1572958728,"I'm looking at renting a condo... the owner/landlord used to live in it and they are smokers. There's a decently strong smell of smoke in the place.

So far.. they've repainted the whole place, replaced the carpet, replaced all of the light fixtures, and all of the kitchen cabinets, and appliances. Even the bathroom showers are redone. But the place had been closed up for 3-4 days, and the whiff of smoke hit me pretty good when I walked in.

My guess is that they haven't done a duct cleaning.. do you all think ozone, baking soda, and vinegar would be sufficient to get the smell out? I've read that smoke smell gets into the drywall..

We aren't smokers, and don't like the smell.. just overall it's a really good looking condo, and we've had a hard time finding something this past month... getting a little desperate.

47,Manufacturing Labor Cost with and without Overhead,1572956056,"Hey gang - I'm fairly active on this group, but this is a throwaway account. 

I'm a manufacturing engineer in the States, and I ran into an argument from a supply-chain person I'm surprised I haven't run into before.

When calculating the cost to manufacture a product, we typically use a labor rate that includes overhead. I.e. the direct cost to have an employee do a task is $30/hour (not what they get paid, their rate is typically half that or less, and the rest is benefits and insurance.) And the Overhead cost (keeping the lights on, doors open, phones answered, accounting done, etc.) is $120/hr., for a total labor rate of $150/hr.

Traditionally, we use a lot of custom tools and machines to reduce the labor cost of a product, and the labor rate versus labor saved versus the cost of new technology is a big part of the job.

But, I had someone on the supply side ask me why we include overhead in the labor cost when we evaluate equipment. Because even if we take employees away from a process, we still have to pay the overhead. Which is a fair and mostly correct observation. 

The way I see it is that it's more of an 'ease of accounting' issue. The difference in overhead of the company from having one more or one less person is very hard to quantify, but the difference in overhead between a 100 person company and a 1000 person company is obvious. And the overhead of the 1000 person company is going to be much larger in almost every case. So rather than readjust the overhead rate every time we add or subtract an employee, we use our yearly calculated labor rates.

This all makes sense to me, but is it the correct view? Is there a better or stronger argument? Or am I missing things completely?

The flipped position of the argument they're using is that any new process would have no overhead labor cost - since we're paying the overhead either way, why would we charge it to a process that's just one new employee?

It is obviously very tough to justify spending money on new equipment versus manual labor if you 'charge' overhead to machines, or don't charge it to employees.

So obviously, there is a speed at which the crumple zone is just fully used up and the vehicle halts completely. The designers can easily make such speed higher or lower by adjusting the crumple tubes, and therefore can select a speed to design for.

What is typically this design speed - 50, 100, 150 km/h? Does it differ between small city cars with short crumple zones (maybe 70 km/h?) and very large sedans (maybe 150 km/h?)?

- Jump straight into a master's program full-time at a higher ranked university (if I can with my GPA) and concentrate in EM waves

- Go into industry with a job in power (or whatever job I can get) and work on my master's part-time then job hopping once I get it (I would probably get my master's at the university I'm already at)

- Attempt to get a job at a company that does work with EM, even if my job isn't necessarily related, and try to transition into that field over time

Any input would be appreciated as to how I should proceed, and recommendations as to what industries/companies have interesting work in the field, as well as universities that have good EM programs and are recruited for those positions.

76,Automatic Blood pressure cuff with specific settings,1572899561,"
Hi everyone! 

Total amateur here in my second year of med school, any my current research would really benefit from a device similar to an automatic blood pressure cuff: with the sole purpose of inflating to 200mmhg and staying inflated for consecutive cycles of 5 minutes. 

Ideally how hard would it be to build a device like this?  I.e. maintaining a pressure over specific periods of time?

Could an existing automatic cuff be modified to meet these parameters?

I currently work as a QE lvl. 2 in Aerospace and am working on my MS Mech Engr. as a part time student. As many of you know and in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/dqicr0/why_is_quality_engineering_so_awful/) that Quality Engineering is not so technical oriented as much as it is more or less paper pushing. Part of my responsibilities include making sure that the parts we ship are conforming to customer requirements ( making sure paper work aligns), issuing Corrective Actions as part of the MRB team, planning jobs ( plan the router/traveler), reviewing specifications etc. Every day, I crave to do something more technical but I am always told that what I do is what QA consists of. I have applied internally to positions such as process engineering or manufacturing engineer however I am told that QA is strapped for resources that I won't be able to move. This leads me to seek out options else where. The trouble is since my background is in Quality ( for about 1.5 years ) and Applications/Technical Support Engr ( for 3 years), I feel trapped in the QA role. Whenever I apply for a Process/Product Dev/Continuous Impr./Mechanical Engineering position, I don't get a call back or get rejected where as I am called/email ( Inmail from linkedin) daily regarding QA roles.

79,EMI in MCC bucket,1572889891,"Hi all I'm a reliability engineer at a steel mill and during some MCE testing in an MCC bucket the contractor discovered a ""ghost"" voltage when they tested the leads after LOTO on the bucket. Now this voltage is relatively small &lt;20V and the current running through the leads is &lt;10mA but as per our safety engineer this has to be addressed and fixed. The cabling is unshielded and the cable tray is packed TIGHT. 

With limited budget and workforce and time there's no chance of running a separate tray to reduce the amount of cabling within them or replace leads etc. So I've been trying to find some emi filters that would work for this application. Most filters I've found seem like they are overkill or the module itself is too large to fit in the small bucket.

80,"Natural Gas Regulators - In a non-working upstream monitor and downstream control regulator configuration, how much pressure differential do you actually see across the ""wide-open"" monitor?",1572889064,"To help think critically about this, here's a few assumptions to apply: 

* We're utilizing boot-style pilot-operated regulators (Mooney Flowgrid)
* To make it simple, we'll say the inlet pressure to the monitor regulator = 400 PSIG, set point for the monitor regulator = 210 PSIG, and set point for the control regulator = 200 PSIG

Ok, so in theory, the downstream system is relieved of some amount of pressure naturally due to residential customers using appliances, commercial customers using burners or compressors, etc. All of that contributes to the downstream system decreasing in pressure from it's operating pressure of let's say, again, 200 PSIG (so maybe the downstream system is now seeing a gauge pressure of 195 PSI, for sake of example. I understand that the system is dynamic, not static, but to simplify things, I'm trying to think about it statically)

So now gas is flowing through the regulators - the downstream pilot (on the control regulator) spring throttles the pilot valve stem according to this demand or decrease in pressure, which in turn bleeds pressure off of the main body diaphragm boot, allowing gas to lift the boot and flow through the main body orifice to the downstream system. This continues until the system demand is met; as customers shut off their gas-using equipment, the system will continue to build pressure until the 200 PSIG set point is met and the pilot spring and the downstream pressure will be in equilibrium, closing the pilot orifice, and in turn allowing inlet pressure to build back on top of the boot.

Now when it comes to the monitor regulator, assuming it is set to be ""wide-open"" (i.e., the control line is downstream of the control regulator), the pilot for it will be set at some pressure higher than the downstream control regulator - assume 210 PSIG. While the pilot will sit open since the spring is always higher than the downstream pressure, how much will it sit open? I assume it modulates some depending on what the downstream pressure actually is, but does this not matter because pressure cannot build on top of the boot (depending on the restrictor setting)?  In turn does, this lead to an additional pressure drop across the monitor aside from the natural deltaP from the orifice cross-sectional area? So, if your inlet pressure is 400 PSIG, will you see 400 PSIG - deltaP due to cross-sectional area of orifice? Or will you see 400 PSIG - deltaP due to cross-sectional area of orifice - additional deltaP due to minor throttling of the pilot spring? To open up another can of worms, what sort of interstage pressure would you see if you were using self-operated regulators?

To summarize all of the above, I'm really just trying to figure out what pressure you would see if you set a gauge on the spool between the two regulators - either full inlet P minus some delta P due to orifice's cross-sectional area, OR an additional pressure loss due to some minor pilot throttling in the monitor.",AskEngineers,False,newredditor_728,/r/AskEngineers/comments/drl1k3/natural_gas_regulators_in_a_nonworking_upstream/

87,Any good things about being a Quality Engineer?,1572882577,"I have very little experience as a QE and would like to hear some good things in contrast with that other thread.

I worked as quality engineer at a high volume automotive supplier for two years. Now, I am almost a year into my new job as a supplier quality engineer for a low volume packaging tool manufacturer.

Here are the two good things I notice about being in QE so far:


1) Not a lot of technical knowledge is required to be successful. Regardless of what company and industry you are in, the core principles of quality will always be the same: containment, root cause, corrective action, standardization, calibration, etc. If you have a good grasp of this, everything should be straightforward.

2) The scope of what you get to learn and gain experience in is bigger. In quality you get to dip your toes in a lot of different areas. Design, production, purchasing, and external  customers/suppliers. You are constantly working with experienced and talented individuals from all areas, this is great for learning.


The thing about quality engineering is that it's very dependent on support from other departments, which can make or break you. For quality to be successful, the entire company has to buy in.

I interviewed with NAVAIR at my career expo, and got an email a week or so later asking to see my transcripts because they had a tentative offer for me. I made sure to tell the recruiter that my cumulative GPA is low (I said 2.6 or 2.7), but my engineering GPA is a 2.9. Long story short, I had my adviser also give me a document confirming the calculation of my engineering GPA, and I made a spreadsheet with the engineering GPA calculated, and sent it all to them. Afterwards, I found out my cumulative is actually a 2.5 (I havent looked at it recently apparently) and I am worried that they might consider that lying on my resume. its been 2 weeks since I got the email asking for my transcripts, and I sent them 2 days after. Can anyone working in a government position give me some feedback on if I am losing my marbles over nothing, or if I should consider it a loss?

I'm mostly a peon, but am senior enough to lead junior engineers for technical stuff.  I have a Bachelors, and enough industry experience to render a Masters moot at this point. 

Throughout my career, I'm constantly told I have an extreme attention to detail (to the point of being anal retentive) and also have an uncommon ability to break down highly technical concepts for others to understand.  There are people way smarter than me... PHds who work as architects and are more scientists than engineers grounded in reality, but they're not usually great at communicating and drawing out their ideas.  I'm usually used as a resource to come in and do it in a way that a lot of people can understand and then we can all execute in the vision.

I'm not seeking validation here, *but I want to know what paths forward in engineering would make maximum use of these traits and allow me to advance faster?*  Would I have the best path forward staying purely technical, or jump into more managerial (project management) type roles?  Technical assistants to senior execs?  Maybe I should study more to ""become"" more scientific in terms of developing algorithms and architectures?  I already dabble in architecture/micro-architecture when coming up with solutions to problems, but  I feel wasted sometimes.  My talents are good for the team as a whole, but I feel like I'm being held back in terms of technical development *because* I'm good at it.  

I hate politics and bureaucracy.  I can work with people but being in a middle manager position and trying to deal with different big personalities looks exhausting.  As much as I don't want to admit it sometimes, I'm in blood a true engineer grunt who likes to solve problems and get stuff working.

Skoolie builders commonly place 1.5"" XPS foam in the gaps between the ribs and flush with the roof (or they spray-foam in these gaps) and then attach a new wooden ceiling (usually T&amp;G or plywood) to the ribs. Discounting the thermal break provided by the wood ceiling itself, it seems that this method would still bring the metal of the ribs very close to the interior living space, and although the ribs are only maybe 5% of the ceiling's total area (they're spaced 27"" on center), the fact that they conduct heat perhaps 100 times faster than the insulation means that most of the heat loss will be through the ribs.

So, in my city we used to have a with alot of crime. Terrorism.

So to prevent it, we installed these 'checkposts' on several roads. They were like blocks to make cars go through, slowly, so the police could examine them closely and stop anyone if they seemed suspicious.

The checkposts looked like this: [https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/digital\_news/2011-12-20/police-night-check-posts-in-islamabad-9739.jpg](https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/digital_news/2011-12-20/police-night-check-posts-in-islamabad-9739.jpg)

We also did major cleanup operations against terror organizations and gangs and terrorism dropped so much. There's barely any terrorism here anymore.

So, we don't feel the need for extensive checkposts anymore.

And the we are getting rid of the checkposts and we want to replace it with technology.

So if any of you have any good ideas as to how that could be done, then that would be much appreciated.

If you could engineer a solution, own an AI company or know someone who knows an AI company or know anyone that could help, we'd love to work with you.

Remember: We need a replacement for checkposts so keep that in mind. The checkposts had a few policemen. They were there at night as well. So we need, through technology, pairs of eyes that can look at night. We also need some way to distinguish between suspicious cars. So it should have a way to check for explosives. Perhaps, radiation?

I was thinking a whole network of cameras equipped with Artifiical Intelligence and Machine Learning, that can also monitor all the spectra of light coming out of cars, to see what was in the car and check for explosives, and all the cameras across the region communicate with each other and log in every face through facial recognition and every car and number plate they see.

But, I'm still unsure about my idea.

Also all of my time is taken up by studying, homework, hanging out with other engineering friends and roommates, and a little bit of""me-time"".

Pursuing that route I have been on LinkedIn activity searching for alternatives to my current employment. Today I have found out that my employer has gone upon my LinkedIn and saw that my LinkedIn was open to possibilities, and I suspect that come Monday I will have to deal with this and may lose my job (makes decisions on emotions and little fore thought, fired a coworker because he was 10 minutes late, fucked us over because he was the only laser soldering/video editing guy/resource manager in the company).

I don't want to be fired, and even if I was hired I wanted a month of notice so that I didn't screw over my coworkers and document all my work regarding robotics/vision/integration/documenting and so on. But now that I know that my boss has scoped out my LinkedIn and saw that my profile was open to inquires I'm afraid that I'll be fired on the spot, and I'm not in a place in my life that there's a back up plan (no family, I won't go into detail).

It saddens me because at this employment I've worked weekends, holidays, late nights and early mornings and have been not only denied a reasonable pay raise for an engineer, but that I'm not closer to my dream goal of working in exoskeleton robotics development and I have no idea how to approach it still.

I guess I'm asking how I can deal with the situation, potential lay off and unsuitable work employment, and how can I finally progress towards practical engineering similar to my goals of exoskeleton robotics and humanoid robotics in the field. I have no hesitations toward relocating or life changing, hell I'd join the military and do the deadliest and toughest training if it could allow me to pursue my dreams, but I only hesitate towards that as I don't want to lose a year of my life towards bmt and such that would leave me lacking if I pursued an alternative route.

I am a good student (top 5%), but I am afraid not to be good enough to be accepted in Japan. I imagine the amount of competion that it might exist for foreigners to get in there.

I mean, I am from Portugal, not a huge or very powerful country. I am competing against people from germany, USA (MIT), etc.

Realistically what chances do I have?

I have been starting to think about many plans:
1 - work really hard at data science to become highly skilled.

2 - Learn Japanese and become fluent

3 - Since I am getting close to fluency in german, I could start working there and improve my CV and then increase chances to get in Japan. (beasically I will use German :D sorrynotsorry) 

4 - after 1 year of working in Data science start to apply almost everyday, for years, if necessary.

5 - after around 2/3 years of experience in data science (or whichever time that it makes me feel competent with it) do an internship in Japan. The longer the better (6 months would be nice). It doesn't matter if it is unpaid. There I will start applying like a mad-lad, and since I am in the country I will have a better chance to get accepted. Or if my company likes me, stay with them.

Anyways, these are some ideas that I have in order to get in. What do you guys think?
I am unawere about how though I can be. But I remember that only the best student of my university got the opportunity to do an exchange program in there. Thats why I am so stressed and trying so hard.

58,Regulate Coilgun Capacitor Current,1572732776,"I am designing a multiple state coilgun that uses 3 2.7V 100F supercapacitors from Aliexpress. The coils are using very thin wire (anywhere from 0.2 to 0.8 millimeters), and the sum of resistances of each coil (32 loops, 4 layers) is in a range of 0.0001 to 0.001 ohms. Since the current output by the capacitor is given by V / R, I'm getting a stupidly high number of amps running through the coil, which is cool but not safe.

I do need a good amount of current to run through each coil since it's proportional to the magnetic force on the projectile (which weighs a few grams). But I need to be able to shut it off with a relay or MOSFET (I will be using a microcontroller) in order for the coilgun to function. In my calculations, adding something with even 0.01 ohms of resistance would reduce the maximum current to something under 30 A, so would using that and a heatsink work?

92,I’ve suddenly found myself in a Revolutionary Road-esque dilemma early in my career...,1572647476,"Back in June, I made this [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/c2b466/achieved_my_childhood_dream_of_working_in/) regarding my feelings about my first job out of school. In a nutshell, I described my dissatisfaction with my ""dream"" job in the aerospace industry, and my plans to pursue my masters degree in Europe starting Fall 2020. Since that post, things have gotten marginally better at work, but my sentiment remains the same. 

Now, in all this time, I've been working a side project for a high-up engineer on another team which, up through now, has been the only thing I've felt a genuine interest for. Every now and then, we met one-on-one to discuss progress updates and what to do going forward, during which we often ended up talking about career trajectory and life in general. In these conversations, I let it be known that my medium-term plan is to pursue a masters abroad, that I'd become disillusioned in my current role and would much rather work in his area. He was very supportive of my graduate school plans, as he has a masters himself (and said he would've pursued a PhD if he were to do it all over again), and also said he would speak to my manager sometime about ""stealing"" me away a little more in the future.

The caveat is that most of the work his team does is classified - I told him that I didn't want to waste company time and money by having them sponsor a security clearance for me if I was planning to leave in around a year. I only wanted to be delegated unclassified tasks, to which he completely agreed was in everyone's best interest.

Unfortunately, it's been a few months since the last time we properly talked, as he's been so swamped with his own work we haven't been able to meet up at all. I've continued working on the project as best as I can, and have a lot of new results to present, but the conversation he was supposed to have with my manager never happened.

Which brings me to the beginning of this week, when I learned from a third person that he'd announced his retirement at the end of the year. I was floored, and my impression is that it caught everyone else by surprise too. However, I should mention that in our one-on-one discussions during the summer, he hinted that he was wanting to ""get out of the rat race"" and advised that I need to do ""what makes me happy"".

Yesterday morning, my manager filled me in on more of the details of this engineer's retirement, including who had already been approached to backfill some of his duties. In that conversation, I perhaps jumped the gun by saying that I was ""very interested"" in taking on some of those duties as well, and my manager said he would let that be known to higher-ups. Later that afternoon, to my surprise, he brought in the retiring engineer's manager for a chat, and the latter gave me the rundown of the situation - how they almost desperately need to find someone to replace him, that they've been unsuccessful for years in recruiting another engineer of his caliber, and that I'd nonetheless be an excellent asset as a young member of his team given my RF background. I asked about the necessity of a security clearance, and as I feared, it was matter-of-factly stated that I would need to acquire one and thus make a certain commitment to the company. All I responded with was that I would need to speak one-on-one to the retiring engineer.

Thus, my dilemma: in the short term, perhaps even in the long term if I stay in aerospace, I *know* this line of work will be far more interesting than what I've been doing. However, it is the medium term that's the issue here. Since the beginning of this summer I have been consolidating my research on European masters programs, and I'm not simply going to throw all that effort away - my plan to go abroad is non-negotiable, no matter the circumstances. Two professors have already agreed to write letters of recommendation for me from in-person meetings where I drove back to my alma mater, and in these trips I've also picked up and/or notarized every document necessary for my applications. In fact, one of my programs of interest asks for a third, non-academic letter of rec, and I was planning to ask the retiring engineer for just that.

I will probably have the private conversation with him early next week. If it's 100% certain that I need a security clearance to work for his team in any capacity, then I will decline his manager's offer. I do expect him to back me up, but I really don't know how forthcoming I should/need to be to his manager with my masters plans, knowing that I'll more than likely have to explain why I'm declining... which also makes me worried with my own manager, since it'll come across as doing a complete 180 and imply that I perhaps don't plan on staying at the company for much longer. I'm now realizing the irony of this situation, where in expressing a genuine interest, I inadvertently reveal my non-committal. 

Regarding the title, during the conversation with the other manager, the first thing that came to mind was the scene in the middle of *Revolutionary Road*, where Frank Wheeler is approached for a promotion at work and chooses that against moving to Paris to start fresh, ultimately suffering greatly for it. Long before this past week, the book already meant a lot to me as an example of how I don't want my life to end up, and it's just my luck to suddenly find myself at the equivalent crossroads... it's important to mention that outside of work, I'm already fairly jaded by the city I'm in, and don't see a future for myself here.

So r/AskEngineers, how would you approach the situation I'm in?

99,[Mechanical] How to do weight measurement on a Moving Platform?,1572639626,"Hello Engineers, 

I am looking for ideas or solution on how to measure measure the weight of material in a tank or silo that is mounted on a truck. 

Back story: 
I am trying to make a weight measurement system with load cells that measure the weight of a tank mounted on a truck while the truck is moving. When the truck is moving there is system that dispenses the stuff in the tank outside (no longer on the truck). The stuff that is in the truck are grains of something (I don't know what they are but they about the size of a bean). Because of this I need to measure the weight of the tank to know the dispensing rate. Flow measurement of the dispensing system is not an option as the dispensing system is using compressed air to suck and shoot out the stuff in the tank. Volumetric measurement of the tank is also not possible, since the material surface of the stuff in the tank is not even. 
If this system was stationary, then it would be a piece of cake. But the fact that the ""Ground"" under the load cell will be moving, it makes it so much harder. 
When the truck is moving on uneven ground, if the truck goes into a ditch or hits a pothole, the force or shock that is exerted on the load cell will be high enough to cause permanent damage and deformation. I have wasted a lot of load cells this way. 

Solution I have tried that did not work: 
I have tried installing load cells with much higher capacity rating than what I am actually measuring. For example, if the tank is 5 ton I have used 4 load cells that each have a 10 ton capacity. When the truck goes into a ditch, with all the help from the suspension system of the truck, the shock is simply too much for the load cells to bear. 

I have design a platform with shock absorbers (air spring dampers) to take some of the shocks, but the cost of such a system just became too much.

1,Help controlling a rotary stage via stepper motor and python; parts list needed!,1572637228,"Hello! As of today, I have no equipment. What I do have is above-average python programming experience, and the need to rotate an object with a reasonably high degree of precision. I'd like to keep my equipment budget under $1500, if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Needs:

I'll need some sort of rotary stage with a stepper motor. I need the diameter of the rotary tray to be bigger than 5cm, but less than 10. (The base would also need to be less than 10cm on one axis- it can be longer in the other, but I need to fit it in a space that's not a lot wider than 10cm.)

I'll need some sort of controller and power supply. (From maybe Gecko drive?)

I'll need some sort of easily-readable way to interface with the motor controller from Python. (I find hobbyist code all over the place, and frankly I'm a bit overwhelmed by the amount of it all. 

It would be easiest if I could interface with the controller via USB (happy to use an adapter.) 

My goal is to be able to create a class that behaves like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; motor_control_instance = rotation_stage(*some_parameters)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; motor_control_instance.rotate(theta = 0.01)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; motor_control_instance.get_position()
    0.01 Degrees
    &gt;&gt;&gt; motor_control_instance.rotate(theta = 0.50)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; motor_control_instance.get_position()
    0.51 Degrees

..and so on. The result ""get\_position"" would initialize to zero whenever the connection to the controller is created. I can (obviously) just keep track of the position by arithmetic. No need for the motor to provide feedback (if that's a prohibitively expensive feature.) 

This seems like a simple problem, but there are so many places to go wrong. There are also so many companies with  boutique equipment for thousands of dollars-- all of which seems like overkill, for my needs.

Or what if ozone was used as an additive to the air intake for possible better fuel mileage on gas vehicles? (Those electric arc lighters produce ozone and are marketed as being wind proof so I wonder if an arc were safely maintained within the air intake if that would provide any boost?)


Ozone will combust in certain concentrations and even when in a solution of water if temperature is raised to the combustion temperature (which is quite low.)


As for the use of ozone as an energy source I believe the safest way to do so would be to make it on the fly and not store any amount that is not immediately used because it is a strong oxidizer and unstable.
Years ago I remember using a small van der graaf generator and recall that particular smell of ozone that is emitted while it runs. It doesn’t take long — maybe just a few seconds before I could smell the ozone in the air after turning on the machine. Also, with those electric arc lighters you can smell ozone being generated when you use. 


So ultimately I’m asking: would it be possible to use a mix of ozone and air as the source of combustion inside an internal combustion engine? Or what about an ozone and water solution plus air for use as combustion source for combustion engines? What would be the byproduct of this?


Ozone as energy source for electric automobiles, jets, air planes etc?

25,Bachelors in Mechanical or Mechatronics?,1572579099,"I am currently in a dilemma as to what type of Engineering I should specialize into in my university.

For some context I am a freshman currently taking an engineering course which takes 4 years to complete, with the first year focusing on the fundamentals of all the types of engineering specializations my university offers (e.g. programming, mechanics, design, electricity, mathematics, material science etc), whereas the 2nd year is where we decide to choose what type of engineering to specialize into for the rest of our degree.

My university offers Mechatronics engineering, along with Mechanical Engineering as their own specializations. I have always wanted to go through the Mechatronics route as it seems more appealing to me, but I have been told many conflicting answers with choosing Mechatronics being either beneficial or detrimental to my job opportunities once I head out of university. 

Another thing which has made me unsure of what to choose out of the 2 specializations are the courses they teach in the 2nd-4th years. Mechanical teaches the usual in-depth courses in the Mechanical Engineering Field, whereas Mechatronics  sacrifices *some* subjects in Design and Manufacturing, Thermofluids and thermal Engineering for software design, analog/digital circuit design and sensors &amp; actuators in the 3rd year.  The overall feel I am getting from this is that getting a Bachelors in Mechatronics gears me up to become more of a generalist, rather than becoming a true specialist in an engineering field like mechanical engineering. Does this truly affect me in the long run?

28,Going back to uni and doing a Master's as an Electronics Engineer - need opinions/advice,1572576513,"tl;dr - Have a BEng in Electrical &amp; Electronics. Worked for 6 years mostly in small company doing interesting but low paying work. Currently in well-paying but boring job so considering doing a Master's in order to get more skills for more interesting and well-paying opportunities.

After coming to terms with the reality that most well-paying engineering jobs involve mostly paper-pushing and work not really that technical, I'm strongly considering returning to uni to study a Master's degree. 

Previously I've worked at small companies that did ""real"" technical engineering that I found very interesting but were low paying and in niche industries which didn't allow for much career growth. Recently I've joined a large organization in a field with high salary opportunities and job security (clinical biomedical engineering/technology) but the work is nearly entirely documentation and very shallow technically (and therefore low skill required). My goal is to return my career back to the industry of my previous job. However, it's a competitive field as it's mostly in government research and science organizations and it seems most people getting these jobs are higher educated and have more diverse skill sets than what I was able to get through my experience.

My problem is I am unsure what is the best field to study in. I want to stick to engineering and I love electronics and digital systems so I'd like to do something that compliments my Bachelor. So far I've considered either;

* Software Engineering/Computer Systems - because I want to improve my programming and technical IT skills and have no experience with software development (which has cost me a job in a previous application). Looking back this is probably the major I should have done for my Bachelor. Or,
* Data Science/Engineering - with the high demand and growing importance of data it appears to be a good long-term career. I find myself more interested in the actual ""engineering"" part of the field (i.e. machine learning, databases etc) and I would probably aim to be a Data Engineer as opposed to a Scientist/Analyst.

38,When did you get your MBA degree?,1572568038,"Hello all,

I have a few questions:

* How many years of experience did you have when you started &amp; acquired your MBA degree?
* After getting your MBA (congratulations btw), roughly when did you start seeing the benefits?
* Did you get the chance to become a project manager and/or upper management after only being able to work as an engineer?
* Did the degree offer a higher base salary at another company or industry?

I want to pursue an MBA degree but don't know when would be the best time in my career to get one. I currently have 2.5 years of full-time experience as an entry-level mechanical engineer but will switch to another industry in 1.5 years (as another entry-level engineer, most likely). I have a sneaking suspicion that getting an MBA now will be basically useless for the following reasons:

1. Since I'll switch industries vs. going to the current company's competition and keeping the relevant work experience, I'll probably have to start all over in my career. Maybe having an MBA would give me more of an edge over other people applying for those entry-level positions, but I feel like my work experience would matter more.
2. When I switch industries, I probably can't start working as a project manager. If that's the case, what's the point of having my MBA at that given time? Maybe it'll give me a 5-10% increase in base salary (compared to the average salary of that position in that specific area), but is that worth spending tens of thousands of dollars &amp; at least two years of my time getting what would effectively be a paperweight? 
3. Because of reason #2 above, I would probably have to re-study on all the concepts discussed in my MBA if I start going down the path of project manager and/or upper management roles. This seems like time just being wasted now (and in the future).
4. Assuming any company worth it's salt would have some kind of internal leadership training program, how beneficial would my MBA be if that internal leadership program gets me to my end goal anyways?

I’m looking for some sort of material that reflects vastly different amounts of light in UV, IR, and visible. Sunscreen is a good example: dark in UV, white in visible. 

Sunscreen won’t work because it has to be safe for museum objects to touch the material without being damaged in any way. The goal is to make multispectral images of texts on papyrus against a background that behaves very strangely. If, say, the background were white in one color channel but black in another, it would be easy to digitally extract the background. This would be valuable, because the background is often visible through the papyrus and can easily interfere with the identification of glyphs. 

You might think that a specific color would work. For instance, green fabric is white in the green channel and black elsewhere. The problem is that the objects themselves often have a lot of color in them. Natural materials and inks tend to vary a lot, so you can’t guarantee that any color in the visible spectrum won’t be in the object somewhere.

51,Need Help with Sliding/Locking Mechanism,1572548945,"Hey there, engineers.  I'm building a product which will be used to hold lightweight objects at different angles and I just can't figure out how to design the movements. The product will constitute of a base, a movable lid/holder and a hinge to hold the lid/holder at different angles. 

I have created some basic visual models to explain the basic functionality I need in my product: 

1. When not being used, the the lid/holder will rest on the base to form a block-like shape [like this](https://ibb.co/8zqzymp)
2. To use it, we begin by sliding it parallel to the base [as shown](https://ibb.co/bK53fcx) 
3. Once we slide it as shown above, we raise the holder to a particular angle via the hinge (located underneath) [as shown](https://ibb.co/8sssvZD)

I've spent some time trying to work with [this movement design](https://ibb.co/7yvV9Jv) as this will allow for movement along the X-axis and the X-Z plane for setting the angle of the lid/holder. However, I don't think that design will be compatible with [this feature](https://ibb.co/JH9Mg8v) which is necessary for holding the object.  I know I can just make [that position](https://ibb.co/WHNDM1h) of the lid to its pivot point but I don't like it aesthetically. 

I'd define my requirements to be:

1. The product needs to take a simple block shape when not being used 
2. I don't want [the hook](https://ibb.co/JH9Mg8v) to stick out when not being used

The simpler the movement/locking mechanism, the better. As I said before, these are basic visual models I've created to explain what I'm looking for, and the design might not seem feasible in some/most cases. I will modify the design accordingly later to fit the mechanism and that's not a problem at all.

61,How to handle a situation at work where you feel your professional development is being hindered by lack of training,1572540990,"I'm writing in on my phone over lunch because I had a kind of frustrating morning. 

I graduated last May with an environmental engineering degree and got the exact job I wanted as a water/wastewater design EIT at a civil engineering and architecture consulting firm.  I started working in late May and will hit my 6 month mark in 3 weeks. 

My job search was limited to the big Midwestern city I'm in because my boyfriend of a few years wants to stay here and it was difficult locking down a job. I had an internship, above a 3.0, and FE but the university here is so large most new grads have to move away for entry level positions.   I felt very lucky though to end up getting an offer in March that was contingent on me being a part time intern up until my graduation.

The first issue was my project manager was on vacation the week the VP interviewed me and was not part of the hiring decision. My first intern day he drove me to a project and complained about this to the clients right in front of me, which is understandable, but made me feel bad at the time. Then after I graduated, noone said anything about finalizing my hiring. I set up a meeting with PM and then called VP and they hired me.

I have a co-worker who was hired two years previous to me, and she is the only other EIT in my group. She is a very valued employee. Since my hiring I'm supposed to work for my PM on the treatment plant side, and she is working for the other PM on collection/distribution side, but in her first two years she got to work for both and get trained on both sides of the business. My PM still gives her a number of projects that should be going to me, and she does 10 projects at a time while I'm given usually 2 at a time. Our contracted hydraulic modeler also taught her GIS and SWMM modeling which are very valuable skills. 

When I first began working they didn't have tasks planned for me and sent me to my coworker to ask to help her. She repeatedly had me scan documents and organize binders. There was an incident a few weeks ago where the hydraulic modeler wanted me to complete part of their project by doing design calculations to size sewer and then make figures in ArcGIS. My coworker was supposed to send me the files I needed. She basically just did the sewer design herself, then sent me the file and told me to see if I understood how it was done. I found this pretty insulting considering I had wanted to do it myself. Then she made a big deal about how I'm not as experienced with GIS and we're on a time crunch (deadline was whole week away) went in the other room and made a phone call. I then am Ccd on an email from the hydraulic modeler saying that making simple ArcGIS figures is ""not that hard"" and requires minimal training to teach me to do it. He was sending the email to my PM in response to I assume being told to just let my coworker do it.

Another thing - I took an AutoCAD class on my last semester of school so I could draft at work. But upon starting I was told I am not allowed to use AutoCAD due to how it would be much slower than having out CAD tech do all of it. When I lay out plants I have to repeatedly draw them by hand.

A few weeks ago the VP of my group was saying we are getting so much work we need a new hire. He said the new hire would work for the other PM and for himself. I went home and told my boyfriend that I really hope the new hire does not take work from me and my PM, because while there are weeks I work overtime writing design reports, most weeks I do not have enough to do and am waiting on further developments to complete work. 

Sure enough, the new hire was gushed over by my PM. He is starting Friday and has 3 more years of work experience than I do. Yesterday my PM told me that he's divvying work up and giving the new hire two upcoming projects (one is a 50M dollar project I had wanted to do, the other a few hundred thousand) but I will be doing a 50k project. This morning my PM was at my coworker's desk (she is more talkative than me and he has made comments before that he should have married a girl like her) saying they should have a happy hour, gossiping about a client, telling her she can be a PM in a few years, and organizing a big lunch out to celebrate the new hire's first day of work. 

From this post I probably sound like a bad engineer but I have gotten great feedback on all of my work. I am going back and forth between starting to apply elsewhere, waiting to get to a year, or working through it here by talking to other PMs and trying to work with them more.  I originally had planned to only work here up to two years due to being a bad fit, but my group is expecting to get some huge huge 50 year contract that would mean good job security for me.",AskEngineers,False,alpaca-friend,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dpqdxa/how_to_handle_a_situation_at_work_where_you_feel/

I'm in an extracurricular project with two other people and the task is to create a system that mimics flow through a heart valve. It's not an entire model of a heart, just a reservoir that liquid will exit from a 3/4 inch tube at a speed set by a motor (that we already have), enter and exit a valve powered by another motor (that we do not have), and re-enter the reservoir. I'm told the point of this is to create an apparatus that would test the reliability of a heart valve to work at different blood (fluid) speeds, make sure the fluid doesn't kick back, and to test pressure at different points along the tube. We've arrived at the conclusion that a butterfly valve seems like the best way to do this, and I am told the fluid being used to mimic blood is glycerol. This is the valve we are considering:

[https://www.grainger.com/product/MILWAUKEE-VALVE-Butterfly-Disc-Valve-1JPL3](https://www.grainger.com/product/MILWAUKEE-VALVE-Butterfly-Disc-Valve-1JPL3)

These are the specs for it:

[https://www.milwaukeevalve.com/data/files/BB2Series.pdf](https://www.milwaukeevalve.com/data/files/BB2Series.pdf)

The problem is that we do not know what motor would be best to power this valve. We have considered a stepper motor and a servo motor, and we seem more comfortable with a stepper motor.. the motor must power the butterfly valve to open and close in 1 second (?) (however long it would take a heart valve to open and close). We are all pretty much in the dark when it comes to the required torque, voltage rating, motor driver etc.. We know that stepper motors aren't good for ""high torque"" but we don't even really know what constitutes as high torque. I was wondering if any of you could recommend a motor to use for this, and maybe even a driver for the motor, because eventually it will be programmed in something like MATLAB to run as such.

70,Update: I have left my toxic workplace.. stories from the trenches?,1572534307,"On my last 2 posts, some people wanted to know more specifics of what I went through at my last job. A lot of the workflow processes would break down because of bad procedure, or bad people.

I deleted my 1st account so that post was gone - from when I was asking how to cope with it.  I left the 2nd post up.


#1 - We were designing a plant out of state.  The plant was 3 hours away from 2 of our operations people.  I spent a lot of time at the plant during procurement to prepare the plant crew, and during construction.  When we reached a checkout/commissioning stage...the operations manage would let the 2 guys drive to the plant daily and go home. The rest of us stayed in hotels.  We were at the plant 8am-6pm most days. So they'd put down 16 hour days. On the 3rd day, the 2 guys would leave after a few hours and go home because they weren't getting paid overtime. The ops manager refused to have them stay in hotels.  So wednesday forward, I was climbing vessels and piping to label instruments, and check wiring, and program certain process devices. Because for some fucking reason we didn't buy intelligent on/off valve heads.. so the open/close limits had to be set once it was installed and powered. We went through this crap at multiple sites. Once we'd start test running the facility, they'd do the same thing. The last half of the week, I'd be there starting up systems on my own, running the equipment, and then dragging hoses/draining things alone.  One the plants, it was wintertime, and they were all gone. Things weren't going well do everything had to be super well drained..it was -8F outside.  I had to put a heat gun on a 2"" ball valve because it had ice in it to get it to drain.

I'd asked the ops manager, 2 directors, and my boss for support... to fix that. And it never changed. They wouldn't force the ops manager to correct that bullshit.


#2 We have an R&amp;D facility. I used to spend a lot of time working next to it. One day I heard, then saw, a small high pressure pump shaking/bouncing.  It was circulating a foamy fluid and just going nuts from the air in the feed.  I saw the return line going to the tank was above the liquid level.  They didn't a dip tube.  I explained that to the guys working with it. They were complaining about the cavitation and the noise. They looked at me.. ""Yeah, you might be right. But you're not my boss. I'm not changing that line.""

#3 2 years ago we sold a large system. I had to design a work platform.  I drew it, and discussed it with the fabricator to use 1"" square tubing.  The operator was up 5 feet, and I didn't see an issue with that tubing on a 2' x 3' platform for intermittent cleaning of the tank. Especially because I designed the system such that it wouldn't NEED the cleaning.  2 days later, I see the work, and the fabricator decided he could to it all out of 3/4"" threaded pipe. He's got it all welded, and it looks like ass, and ruined... but the shop manager argues it's good enough, and I let it go.  The customer laughed at it and rejected it.
I drew a new ladder for them. It goes out, doesn't match the dimensions, so they reject it.  The platform wasn't installed at the height in my drawings. I drew the ladder to match my drawing. Shame on me for not catching that original platform in the as-builts.

Finally.. dear god. I draw a 3rd platform. With OSHA research.  Platform and ladder.  Fabricator argues that I'm an idiot and that it doesn't need to be 1.5"" pipe. He says OSHA says it can be 1"".  I tell him to go get the paperwork, and if it says 1""...we'll do that. But I need a reference..unless if he wants to tell the customer that.  I have the OSHA guidance that shows 1.5"" sch40.  I know it's overkill, but it's like $250 in materials, it doesn't matter that much.  The paper says it, so we follow it, and we can all move on.  He builds the platform, but won't install the safety chain. Thursday evening, I'm drilling holes in the piping to put in the eyebolts and hanging the chain.  It goes out, customer likes it, and they accept it...they said they'll weld it to our system, and we're good.

I have drawings, pictures, and a BOM.  A year later the customer buys the same system.The fabricator keeps stepping OVER my materials on the ground. He builds a whole platform out of 1.25"" pipe.  But I had submitted the pics/drawings to the shop in 1.5"".  The fabricator loses his mind and is screaming at me that I'm wrong and I don't know what I'm talking about.  He says my drawing said 1.25"" pipe.  Well let me see your drawing.  He hoes to his shelf, gets a binder and pulls out a drawing, and he starts waiving it in my face and screaming at me again. Won't let me look at it.  He stops, shoves the drawing towards me, but won't move his thumb....move your thumb.  Under his thumb, the text says 1.5"" Sch40 pipe.  He throws a chunk of pipe and goes out for a smoke. He comes back and looks at the pictures and argues up and down that he never built that platform and that it's 1.25"" pipe.... DUDE ITS IN YOUR WORK AREA. This is your coffee mug in the picture.
A week later it's all corrected, and installed..

#4 because this just bothers me. Every 4-20mA level sensor we use... you have to type in an analog value of ticks to set 0 and 100%.  There's no button for ""Set tank empty"" and ""Set tank full"".... someone has to type in 6200 and 6910 or 6915 etc to scale the transmitter each time.

81,How are high precision spindle bearings assembled?,1572516530,"Hey. I know two methods of assembly for standard ball bearings:
- The Inner ring has a little groove so that one can place the balls in the track one by one
- One can place all the balls on one side of the outer ring's track, put the inner ring offset, then center it before spacing the balls evenly and putting the cage.

What i can't grasp is how those tight, high precision spindle bearings (i have a FAG B7006) are assembled:
There is no groove of any sort to place the balls, and there are too many of them to be able to displace the inner ring before putting the cage.
Despite it being a 15° bearing, the groove in the OR is too deep to be able to press the balls in, even with heat ( and i'm pretty sure it's a bad idea to involve heat when assembling bearings).

Some basic components I am including in the EV  for wiring are-

\- 12V relays.

\- Ignition switch, head lights with switches, reverse switch, indicators, kill switches.

\- Motor, motor controller, battery, solar cells

\- Main contactor ( 4 terminals), fuses.

\- Auxiliary battery

\- Various microcontrollers to control the relay switching

I've  tried MATLAB and PSpice but neither could help in this case. I do have  solidworks electrical and autocad electrical in mind but they don't help  much with simulation and analysing the circuit.

84,How do I learn new skills and make the best of my time at a stagnant/mildly doomed startup?,1572505875,"I work at hardware startup that's recently fallen on hard times. Hardware development burn rate is super high while our investor cash has been dwindling month after month. In the past few months, we've had enough money to pay people's salaries but not much leftover for actually developing the product. Employees have been leaving left and right out of frustration. I estimate only 5% of those who left have been replaced so far, partly because word has spread about about our situation, which makes it very hard to attract new engineers. Lately, the company has thrown all resources into a hail mary: beef up existing prototypes (which kinda suck and we can't afford a new batch of improved prototypes) to barely-production maturity on-the-inside but pretty-on-the-outside in order to show off and convince a new batch of investors (yet to be found) to give us money and kick-start development.

My job description was relevant when product development was fully funded. Our funding troubles began about a few weeks after I joined. Now I just do menial tasks on Excel and PowerPoint that are just hand-me-downs of hand-me-downs from my manager and his manager. What can I salvage from this situation? 

Taking engineering training classes or going to programs, seminars, etc. are out, since ""frivolous spending"" is not allowed anymore. I wanted to try to learn some of the engineering software we use, like CAD, CAE, LabView, etc. However, licenses for those programs are restricted only to ""critical"" engineers, to save money. I've asked some of my coworkers in other groups if they have anything I could help them with or shadow them on. They're sympathetic, but tell me that with the recent departures of employees as well as refocus on beefing up the prototypes, they don't have anything for me to do that 1) I can accomplish at my skill level alone or 2) can accomplish with help, but they have no time to walk me through.

When I first joined, I asked my skip level manager if there were particular projects I could get involved with to learn more skills. He said that there were and that once I'd developed some basic skills at the company and there was additional budget, he could assign them to me. That was a few months ago, and funding has only deteriorated since then. I'm very tempted to just ask my skip what the heck I'm even doing at the company anyway if there's nothing for me to do, except I don't want to draw attention to myself as an attractive candidate for layoff. There was already 1 round of layoffs. HR claims there will be no additional layoffs but morale is so low that people don't believe HR anymore.

Is it true that future recruiters will judge you based on the stories they heard about your company? I've heard (unverified) stories that some of the employees at my company have had trouble finding other jobs due to our company's reputation of having incompetent engineers. Should I just try to stick it out for a few more months and hope I find something to work on? This is my first job out of college too so I don't have very many skills.

I also love to program microcontrollers including pic, arduino, RPi etc. The closest I could find were embedded systems, integrated systems, system designs and the like.

Are there any hidden cons which I should be aware and cautious about?

**About successfully getting admission:** I have discovered that most people who try to get admission overseas ""hack"" the interview through help from some ""consultants"" or friends. Same with the referral letter and the expressio of interest. Basically going in with alot of knowledge about what would be asked and how to answer in a way that would amplify your chances of getting the admission.

Large Structured Project with a Large (Usually nationwide competition)  Goal (FSAE, ROCKET, HyperXite)

Somewhat Smaller Project that still maintains originality in some regard (Cargo Plane, Solar Plane, Design Build Fly)

Smaller Ones that usually are based around a particular phenomenon and a little researchish (I don't even know these by heart very well)

Student ""Redesign"" of a well established concept (Anything from say, lets design our own flight controller,  write your own mini operating system, a toy car (for feasibility) with torque vectoring and make parts from scratch outside motors, etc, a lot of mechanical form and functional fitting with 3D printing and stuff , maybe anything like a product with a small embedded system). The difference between this and others is they aren't really ""a particular plane"" or ""a particular car"", but mostly they aren't large scale and used for a particular competition. These also might be like shitty versions of the real things. I've heard a professor pitch the idea of a mechanical computer, which is obviously not simple by any means, but kind of ""useless"".

as part of a school project, I am designing a buoy that will have some sensors on it. I need to balance the buoyant forces in such a way that the central hub and 'arms' (https://i.imgur.com/DM2O3jw.png) are as close to equally balanced as possible - as in, the rod is horizontal when floating in calm water. Balancing each of the volumes themselves would be simple, but am confused about how to treat the connecting rod - is it as simple as splitting the weight of the rod 50/50 between central/arm hub, or due to different pivots is there some nuance? Also for clarity, the arms will be in all 4 (fwd/back/left/right) directions, coming off central buoy. Also, the weight of the central buoy is more or less fixed, only parameter I can adjust is the weight of the arm (rod and end-piece). 

Also random question - I need to weld some 316 stainless steel while maintaining its corrosion resistant and non-magnetic properties, to what degree does welding affect these/how to mitigate?

94,I feel conflicted as to whether I should choose either mechatronics or electronics as my career,1572490638,"I don't know if this is acceptable for a post here, but I write it because I need objective eyes to help me here as I'm not analysing anymore here.

It's a long story but I'll keep it as short as possible:

I want to study mechatronics because it's a broad field where I can learn a bit from many areas and also because I want to help raise the technological level of my country. Exactly in what to work after graduating, I don't know, mainly because I can't find too specific information on what to do aside from a general idea of the areas I can work in.

My brother already studies mechatronics, and now everyone thinks that I'm going to study just because of his influence, but that's not the case, and despite that, with so much pressure I feel like they're right and I don't know what I really want now.

I have been practicing programming, some basic electronics with an arduino, and planned myself to build a robotic arm without any help in order to figure out how much I want to study this, by testing my will to go beyond my limit in something hard that I (objectively) don't need to do, nor I'm forced to. I'm delayed in that and frustrated, but still I want to build it, as I like to build and program, etc. and that keeps me going.

Also, I chose my career late (18) compared to my brother, and had to discard many other careers I had in mind in order to find this. Despite that, and despite being a disaster at both programming and electronics right now, due to lack of proper resources to learn, now that I tried that area, I don't want any other because it's where I can do the most things in my opinion. I like to build things, useful things, and I know that I can learn what I know and do something really useful for my home and help my people here.

I also like math per se, and the amount of math that's on the career is hard, I know, but I also feel a burn to learn it, because I want. And I've been thinking that I could pursue afterwards a degree in either math or computer science, as I also feel a greater interest in learning more about that.

In summary, as this is getting long, I don't have a clear plan of why to study either of these careers, but also feel I like all the areas they cover, and feel like I won't be happy if I don't take any of those, and I've isolated myself as much from my brother's influence in this and I keep going even though he's not around me pushing me to do something. At the contrary, seeing him suffer in the career, the most logical thing would be to turn my back there if I was following his example.

I currently work at a large defense contractor (the only one I have worked at) but would like to switch jobs to another company and work on new things/live somewhere else for a while.  Due to some other life changes (marriage) in May 2020, June or July 2020 seem like a great time to move states.

12,Mechanical Engineering Student Career advice,1572466380,"I’m a Junior Mechanical Engineering student and have been thinking about my future career lately. I’d really like to end up working with NASA or somewhere similar doing design work on rovers or something like that. Last summer I interned at an aerospace testing facility but didn’t totally enjoy the role of test engineer. I’m also planning on taking advantage of a program school offers to get my masters degree in MechE in 1 year, part of which would involve working in a lab that researches compliant mechanisms and other morphing structures, which I think is relevant to my career interests. Currently I’m on the payloads team of my schools rocket team, do some projects on my own and have a decent gpa (3.6) 



However it still seems really hard to get a spot at NASA or similar and I’m a little worried about my prospects after graduation. In light of that I’ve been considering the Navy NUPOC program. I have a high enough gpa where I could go through the program and stay on as a teacher for 4 years, and they also would provide a nice stipend while I’m still in college. My thinking is I could do that then either go back for a PHD or try to get a job with NASA, which I think would be easier after military experience. However I’m a little worried about spending 4 years as a teacher then transitioning back to engineering.

I'm an engineering student. I have welding and fabrication experience. I'm on my schools FSAE team, but more importantly to my question, I am starting to participate in Lemons racing.

I want to build a stupid minibike (preferably trike). Mostly for schlepping tools and fuel around the pits at Lemons races, but also for offroading in the US Northeast. Ideally, it would break into two parts (frame and front steering assembly) to fit in the back of a Jeep Patriot. Could also use this project as an opportunity to gain new knowledge and experience.

I can easily generate an appropriate frame, suspension, etc. I have determined that the way to maximize flexing on the puny Coleman two-strokes (and the EPA) is to power this meme machine with a small diesel engine. 

I have experience with Kubota 3-cylinder diesels, but new or refurbished articles can be quite expensive.

I am new to thermo/fluid design work and am really hoping to just get pointed in the right direction. I am in a hobby group that is attempting to design a combustion chamber for a high powered hybrid rocket engine.  This will be a prototype design just to get things going on the test stand, weight is not a concern. The engine will fire for less than 10 seconds, and I am wondering how I would go about modeling a high temp and pressure flow condition over this period of time. 

Bottom line is we want to know what material we can get away with using for this prototype (would aluminum melt completely during the short time period? Is this provable using theory? How will a given material's properties change under these conditions?)

My dream would be to create a simple model whose inputs are material properties and combustion/fluid properties, output being the state and properties of the material after firing.  

I have access to the Solidworks Flow sim package, but I have a feeling that is not going to be too helpful with  this sort of analysis. Any suggestions for resources/textbooks/flow sims (preferably free) to get this off the ground (no pun intended) would be very much appreciated

Specifically, I work in RF and am getting terrible power line gap noise that I tracked back to a specific angle pole feeding an adjacent property, where the tap pulls off the bulk 3phase feeder. This is new (re)construction with fiberglass pole arms and polymer insulators. The tap pole has three lightning arrestors, and the lower (ground)  side of each is tucked through the arrestor bracket along the pole arm, and where it makes contact with the bracket is the location of the gap. The lineman confirmed this by using a short pole to move the ground off the bracket and the noise reduced noticeably. These would typically be stapled tightly to the wooden arms, but isn't an option with fiberglass. 

Their longterm solution is to move the arrestors up or down a span to be replaced with scout arrestors, but they weren't interested in any short term solutions, or giving a specific time frame.

Shotwell also “portrayed...SpaceX as hungrier and scrappier than Blue Origin.” She asserted, “Engineers do better when they’re pushed hardest to do great things in a very short period of time with very few resources. I think that’s when you do great work.” Shotwell “referred to the $1 billion” provided by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos “to Blue Origin every year by selling Amazon stock as ‘free money’ and suggested that the funding model has its drawbacks.”

Now taking an axial compressor on a turbojet as an example I've always imagined that the ""pressurization"" in this case is moving a certain mass of air into the high pressure combustion chamber.. so basically moving a certain mass from point A to B where B is the high pressure means we pressurized A to B's pressure. 

But now while dealing with vapor compression cycles we have a compressor raising the pressure of the refrigerant to the condenser pressure, but *where* does that pressure in the condenser actually come from? 

In my turbojet example you're moving the air against the combustion chamber's back pressure , and that back pressure is caused by the combustion of gases. In the refrigeration example I can't find something analogous that'd cause high pressure in the first place.

Brief history: My highschool education is computer technician/electrician. I joined my current company as basic worker.

After that I got promoted to shift supervisor, which is still ""below"" my degree.

Good thing about my current job is that I can study on the job. And pay is not that bad (I make a bit more than I would as new engineer in prety much any company).

Additionally vacation pay will be decreased due to some random reason. And I've had enough.

I'm thinking of applying for a new job, but I'm scared. I'm 30y old and that seems above average for people who finish college. Additionally I feel like I lack experience compared to people my age.

84,Advice on Student to Mentor Saying.,1572323735,"Hi, I'm a ME student and I've been fortunate enough to have a truly amazing mentor of engineering at my internship/job named Steve. I started out working for this company as a machinist, as I knew machining would be a valuable skill as an engineer. After about 2 years of working as a machinist during the breaks of school, the company let me become an intern in the small engineering department. 

Steve (like the most of us engineers) is a nerd but is extremely gifted. Steve and my dad (also works at the company) are the same age and have been pretty good friends for the past 20+ years. So Steve was no stranger to me and we already got along.

Now, for the past 2 years, I've been working as a engineering intern (essentially full time engineer when I'm working). In these past few years, Steve has taught me so much and it has really helped advance in school more easily and prepared me for the real world of engineering.

As a ""thank you"" I've machined him a [bolt action pen](https://imgur.com/gallery/HmCjvgP) with red ink. Red ink because Steve, as lead engineer, has a lot of very strict drawing rules and standards; drawings must be check by him before going to the floor. The fellow engineers call it the red pen of doom. Along with the pen, I got him [this knight](https://imgur.com/gallery/fznqSv9) to hold the pen. Which is very fitting because the fellow engineers call Steve the ""master"".

This is where I need advice, on the bottom of the knight I want to make a plaque with some sort of funny saying on it but I can't think of anything good.

1,How do you value time spent managing as an Engineer?,1572294567,"So a quick overview of my current position:

I have about 9 years relevant experience in my field (MEP Design) and have been with my current company about 3.5 years. I also have my PE license in multiple states, and I'm the only ""manager"" and stamping engineer in a small branch office for a small company (&lt; 100 people). As of right now, I make $89,000 in Denver, Colorado (no bonuses or profit sharing) and get standard to low end benefits.  I've gone through all my work this year and I can comfortably attribute \~$170,000 to just my individual work at this point (which  is probably closer to $190,000+ when accounting for work I've done for the other branch) and I should bill at least another $30,000 by the end of the year. Given what I know about the costs of the office/licenses/benefits/etc. The best I can estimate my total cost to the company at around $155,000/year, which includes taxes, benefits, my share of rent/utilities, licenses, admin staff costs, etc. 

Given all that, I'd like to ask for $100,000 moving forward, but I'm worried they'll throw it back and say that my \~$200,000-220,000  this year can't justify that level of salary, so I'm hoping that I can put a price point on all the other stuff I do.  That list includes:

\- Managing all software licenses for the company

\- Performing QC on drawings for our branch office &amp; signing those drawings

\- Doing business development events (Trade shows, happy hours with clients, etc.)

\- Developing and maintaining custom CAD tools

\-Developing and maintaining new calculation tools and details/standards/specifications

I need some career advice from you all. My question is as the title states.

For context, I recently finished my masters and have been working a temp contract job while searching for full time work. 

I initially interviewed for a more technical position, and it doesn't look like the company is willing to hire me for a technical role as I would like (I feel like I should utilize my technical skills while they're fresh and before I get replaced by shiny new graduates in a few years).

I'm also worried that they're trying to push me into a lower paying position despite my Master's degree (something another thread said which made sense, I think they're trying to hire me more for a job for Bachelor's degree + 2 years experience possibly to save on cost).

• I have taken:
_ Theory of Elasticity: stress/strain theory, Airy’s stress, etc.
_ Wing &amp; Airfoil Theory: grad aerodynamics
_ 2 Grad Math courses: PDE’s and Linear Algebra + Vector Calculus
_ Structural Dynamics: bending/torsional/axial vibrations of continuous structures
_ Aeroelasticity: Divergence, Unsteady Aerodynamics, Flutter

• I am planning to take since it’s convenient to my plan:
_ Applied FEA and FEM: 2 separate classes. First one is basic FEM and apply them to ABAQUS. Second one is pure FEM theory. I think FE knowledge is very useful.
_ Acoustics Fundamentals: physics principles of sound. I think sound waves are very interesting and a lot of aero dynamic loads engineer job posts ask for acoustics knowledge. It’s also a different application of vibrations which could help me in another career direction if I cannot get into aeroelasticity.
_ Last elective is for a project with a professor on aeroelasticity or vibrations.

My dilemma is I also want to learn a lot of other topics that I’m interested on. For example:

• Dynamics / Modern Controls - I liked Dynamics &amp; Vibrations I was interested in Electrical in undergrad. Control could be useful for aeroservoelasticity.
• Fatigue / Fracture Mechanics / Composite Materials - might be useful for structures analysis with FEA.

My background: I’m a design engineer at an automotive supplier with a BS in Mechanical Engineering so my aero background is not strong. I will probably have to learn Flight Dynamics on my own, for example.

My goal is to move into a role dealing with dynamic simulation, structural vibrations, and aeroelasticity fit the requirements. But it’s not the only option since it is a niche field and hard to get a position in that field. So I want to be open to other career paths too.

Should I drop one of the FEM class and/or the acoustics class to take another useful class given my background? Sorry for the long post. I only seen 1 thread about this in the past so I want to ask it for my case.

I am currently looking into regenerative braking for truck applications, where you can possibly generate up to 400A of regen current onto the HV bus, that's 350A over the charge current. Super caps are a popular solution to this, however I don't exactly understand the specifics of the circuits, I was hoping people could shine some light on this. 

Specifically:

1. **Current sense and software/hardware activation.** A lot of papers I have read, reference the supercaps very vaguely, mostly in a block that just works. What is actually used to activate the super-cap bank? Is it a current sensor going to software controls that activates based on high-current conditions or is there a hardware HV circuit for this? Is it even a HV circuit or some analog current sensor and a LV contactor activation switch
2. **Capacitor voltage / power transmission.** So let's say the circuit activates perfectly when needed. How does the current on HV bus actually travel to the cap-bank? This of course depends on the exact bank configuration, but in most cases you would be stepping down 350V from HV bus to 160, if not 12V at the cap-bank. I see DC/DC and buck converters being used, but the former can output that high of a current? Or is there another method to this?

I have a series of excel data (X,Y) more than 1000 rows. They are forces and deformation. Do you know empirically what is the best curve fitting method?

Finally, I want to merge data from other files and correlate them with the X,Y excel files and fill the gaps where necessary or interpolate.

E.g. if we know that for X = 5 and Y= 3 point of a curve is equal to 5 Newton of Force, then how many Newtons of Force are equal to X = 5 and Y = 2.5 (data coming from the new data set).

Any ideas please? Better coming with a piece of code

I prefer small cities with population under 2 million people. Perhaps in such locations it will be more difficult to find a job in the field of information technology, but easier in the field of process control.

While I study, I try myself in the role of a junior process control engineer (not a petrochemical field). (My employer says me that chemical engineering is not a specialized education for this type of work)

I have a lot of questions. I will be very grateful for your help :). What education do you need to be a process control engineer? Can I work at this field with IT (computer science and engineering) education? How is arranged job market in process control field? Is job market also good as market for computer science grads in IT industry overall? What is like to be a senior process engineer?Where do they work? What do they do on daily basis? Will math and programming knowledge help me?Which countries have the most developed industry of process control and IT industry?

The video shows the dynamic analysis capabilities of the game's engine and some of the different failure modes.

I'm curious about the state-of-the-art simulation techniques that the game claims to implement. I already have a vague idea of the background I would need to study to model the geometric and material nonlinearities.

In the classes I've taken, we've typically used methods that have only worked for stable structures, so what I'm most curious about is how the game handles the post-failure transition from a stable structure to an unstable one, and how rigid body motion is analyzed alongside the stresses, strains, and small deformations I'm more familiar with.  

What finite element analysis formulation/algorithm is used to handle both the stable and unstable states of the structure? Is it still ultimately based on the same governing PDEs used in introductory FEM dynamics? Or are there transitions between analysis methods as necessary?

I envision something like an electric linear actuator (or maybe electric solenoid) that could move the gears into/out-of place, unless there is another way to do this.

Furthermore, I have read that increasing this rake angle will cause twisting, crooking, and bowing to occur on the tape. If anyone could send anything on the relationship of these reactions that would be greatly appreciated.

I take all the initiative I can in trying to optimize processes, finding projects, etc, but being a new grad I'm so inexperienced and naive I feel like I really need a mentor. The only other engineer at the company focuses on a different part on the business so I never see or talk to him; I'm basically all on my own. I ask my manager 2 or 3x a week if there is anything more I can do/help her with but she says I'm doing great and to just keep doing what I'm doing. 

The company also hired 3 more salaried employees right after me (none are engineers), and laid off/fired 2 of them and several other employees after about 2 months when they saw how much money they lost last quarter. I'm worried that I will be laid off next due to lack of work. 

Am I overreacting or should I start looking at other jobs? I've looked at other jobs and have seen a couple that I'm interested in and that have actual technical work, which is what I want to do. Will it look bad that I left this job so soon? Or should I try to stick it out a year? What should I say to prospective employers? I obviously wouldn't quit until I had a better offer in a position I'm sure I would like better.

65,Leaving a comfortable job?,1572189106,"I'm a mid-career engineer and worked the majority of my career at my current company (think F500 company).  The job is great.  I was promoted to a management position recently, they treat me well, salary/benefits are great, and it's in an area of my industry with a lot of opportunity for future growth.  It's a place I can honestly see myself working at until I retire.

All of that is great, especially in this era of unpredictable employment.  However, the commute has been wearing on me.  My fiancé and I commute in opposite directions, which means I'm commuting 1 hour each way on the highway.  I have a form of genetic arthritis, and the long commute has been wearing on me.  Due to the nature of the job, working from home is only an option in limited circumstances.

Recently, an opportunity with a new company has come up near my fiancé's work.  This would allow us to move and reduce both of our commutes, as well as live in the city near some of our friends.  The job itself is a bit of a pivot: It's in the same industry, but less technical, and more business/operational.

On one hand, this new job offers improved quality of life outside of work.  On the other hand, I feel nervous stepping from a known, good job into a new role with a new employer.

We're pretty inexperienced with materials for this kind of thing and so were looking for any suggestions on where to start.

- Must be fire resistant due to the nature of the ignition process
- must be manufacture-able by hand (in very good university facilities)
- must be a relatively affordable material (about a couple thousand pounds)

The servo in question runs on 6-7.4V and at the latter end of the voltage spectrum, can take up to roughly 9A. For steering, the servo seems to be taking up 5A at 7.4V, but the sound it makes is somewhat concerning. I know digital servos make noise, but it almost sounds like mechanical stress in the bearings.

We are using a 12 ton bottle jack pushing the log into a wedge, but when we are running the analysis the beam supporting the hydraulic pump keeps failing in the calculations.

When we compare our design to log-splitters found on the internet the cross sections we have tested and the cross sections used don't seem very different, but the designs we found on the internet actually work. 

The hydraulic pump is 12 tons so we are considering a force of 12 tons acting on our supporting beam. We were using a cross section of a w5 x 16 h-beam originally because we thought that would be plenty, since when looking at other designs they do not seem to be as reinforced. The material is a36 steel since this is the most available steal in my area to work with. Even when I plug a force of 12 tons acting on a 4 in. piece of w5x16 into Fusion 360, Fusion 360 tells me it will fail. 

Are we calculating the forces correctly or considering the distribution correctly? Are the companies using a stronger material than we are? We are at a loss for how we could be calculating this incorrectly.

3,Dual enrollment vs pursuing own projects at home?,1572045789,"I'm a high school sophomore who has a lot of interest in engineering, and since I have two more summer vacations left, I definitely should make use of them in some way to try to boost my future career. 

I have a friend currently studying CS in university, who took calculus 1 and 2 at a local community college during his summers. If you do so, you can take a special class from a teacher at my school who was a former university physics professor, where'll you learn mathematics beyond freshman year such as: linear algebra, vector analysis, differential equations, etc. 
He says that it's a good way to help boost your career, especially if you're going to be pursuing something engineering/CS related, and it seems so as if I went through this process, I could come into college already knowing some of these concepts.

The other option is to spend my summers programming and toying around with electronics; I'm specifically interested in ECE. It seems that getting some practical experience, delving into circuits and such could also potentially be helpful.

So, how should I decide what to do? It seems to be a split between more practical experience, slowly trying to get into the industry, versus the fundamentals of engineering. Also, the former process is very time-consuming. Given that I don't do a lot of other things, it definitely is feasible but senior year-- when I get to take it -- could be rough, as I'm taking that on top of many other challenging courses.

This is mostly aimed at my mechanical engineering colleagues because this is a bit beyond what my specialization is in. I am trying to size an inline duct fan for a spray booth assembly. To do so, I have to know the static pressure in front of the fan which means I have to know all of the dP losses from inlet of the system to the fan. The first problem I am running into is trying to measure the static pressure drop across the air filter which is the first thing the airflow sees. Since this is actually a fish tank filter for coy ponds, there isn't any data on the flow characteristics. So I made a small experiment where I connected a vacuum and had a pressure gauge in inH2O right behind the inlet pipe. I had two sets of points that I tabulated below. Honestly, I don't know what I am looking at? How does this help me understand the pressure drop across this filter material?

Hi guys, 

I am currently helping my friend create a ""Harmonic Capo"" for use and the installation of grand pianos. The first prototype has been built here and in use for only the first octave of the piano as shown:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmu9u-3eivE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmu9u-3eivE)

So as you can see in the video, it starts with being in a disengaged mode, and the sound produced were of normal piano sound. The winged bolt is screwed clockwise to lower the spine and all the stems that's attached to the spine, finally touching the strings and pressing on the nodes. The sound produced afterwards were piano harmonics.

As for our second prototype, we are attempting to make the capo controllable in some fashion, by using a remote control or a program to control via Arduino to individually control solenoids that would be attached to the stems to touch the piano strings instead of having to manually stand up and physically move the rods using screws. The point is that we want to control each individual stem.

We are complete newbies when it comes to Arduino and Electrical Engineering in general so we would like to ask here first!

23,How do you combat inexperience in engineering?,1572027747,"

Hey y’all,

I am a second year engineering student at a large university. The university’s resources gave  me the opportunity to explore student-run design teams, and I am currently working on the school’s Cubesat team. 

The issue is that the work distribution is such that I am expected to develop ideas that require a much stronger mathematical understanding of complex situations than I currently have (my coursework thus far is only beginning to touch on the complicated concepts of physical interactions). 

So my question(s), to anyone that’s ever felt like they were absurdly under-qualified to design something, or to anyone who could offer advice, is this: 

How do I tackle an engineering problem when I haven’t the slightest clue where to start? How do I design within the constraints that are based upon fundamental aspects of mechanical design when I have never been exposed to them?  and perhaps most importantly, how do I go about learning fluid dynamics and force analysis in an unreasonably quick amount of time? :D

37,"What can be said about DoF, materials,amplification, and friction as design choices when considering a vinyl record player?",1572013314,"
Hello all,
I had a few questions about the physics behind turntables. Sorry about the flair they didn’t have a “electromechanical” one haha... 

1. How many degrees of freedom does the needle have? I’m guessing 1 in the direction normal to the disc surface since the needle just bobs up and down while maintaining contact with the groove in the disc. 

2. Why was vinyl chosen as the ideal material for records? Given its thermal expansion properties, it seems like the environment could change the groove width and bring more instability to the needle thus lowering sound quality. 

3. In terms of electronics, how many power amplifiers are needed for a turntable with built in speakers? Again my guess is two, one to boost the signal generated by the transducer and another to boost the (filtered) signal to line level voltage which is enough to drive a speaker cone. 

Bonus. Due to the principle of increase in entropy, shouldn’t  the records undergo an irreversible interaction with the needle, thus meaning each time you listen to a record you hear a slightly unique version as they are (ever so slightly) worn down with each play due to friction?

41,Mechanical student about to graduate. In your opinion which class should I take as my last tech elective?,1572008530," 

I am a Mechanical student graduating in the spring. Its either Fundamentals of Product Design or Applied Finite Element Analysis. I know FEA is a very useful tool but FPD fits my schedule perfect. If I take it I would only have class two days a week. Then I would have three whole days a week for interviews. And I could **try** to learn FEA on my own during my free time. Here are the course descriptions

**Fundamentals of Product Design**

Many think of design as more of an art than a science. However, the growing body of research in the engineering design community teaches us ways to navigate the design of consumer products using interdisciplinary design tools and rational decision making. This course introduces students to scientific design techniques that are more effective than ""ad hoc"" tactics. By exploring how engineering principles integrate with ""real world"" design challenges, students will learn to solve product design problems that encompass heterogeneous markets, multiple disciplines, and large-scale complex systems.

**Applied Finite Element Analysis**

Finite element modeling techniques for solving real-world engineering problems are discussed. Theory of finite element discretization is highlighted follow by software implementation, emphasis is given on accurate prescription of boundary conditions that represent actual physical systems, modeling exercises and projects include solid structural problems, heat transfer, structural vibrations, fluid dynamics and contact problems, modeling is carried out using commercial software packages (ANSYS).",AskEngineers,False,Nat9523,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dmx4t2/mechanical_student_about_to_graduate_in_your/

53,How to calculate the pressure on a syrup syringe?,1571976600,"Here's the problem I'm thinking through and since it has been a while since my fluids classes, I need some help.

I have a syringe filled completely with syrup and I want to figure out how much force is required to push down on the syrup and get it moving and squeezed out of the nozzle. My thought process was that if we want to know the force, we would need to know the reactive force applied on the syringe piston by the syrup, meaning we would need to know the pressure of the syrup right at the top of the syringe in contact with the piston.

To solve for that I thought I would use bernoulli's equation and compare the point right at the piston and the point right when the syrup exits the nozzle. We know the height difference; I would assume velocity at the piston to be negligible compared to the nozzle velocity; I would also assume pressure at the nozzle point to be atmospheric. With that, Bernoulli's would just compare the exit velocity at the nozzle with the pressure of the fluid at the syringe piston. Since we get to decide how fast we want exit velocity to be, we can calculate the pressure and subsequently, the force, which is what I originally asked.

I really based these thoughts off of those types of large-open-container w/ opening at the bottom-type problems. However, I feel like I ignored or hand-waved a bunch of stuff. 

For example, syrup is a lot more viscous than water which I don't know how to deal with or incorporate into the analysis?

The motors I've seen are usually from 12"" to 19"" outer diameter - IDK how much of this is the rotor vs the stator, but it would seem this would effect how well the car steers.  I would think these could be good for low speed applications or maybe for something like the rear wheels of a semi trailer, for assisted drive maybe, to give added power and traction to the truck and I know there are some trucks &amp; trailers that already have this setup.

79,Should I work or go to grad school,1571936336,"I have an offer with a construction company &amp; have to decide by November 4th whether I take it or I apply to grad school. 

Gpa is good but GRE score probably will be below average.

I’m not interested in construction but my group would be the solar group and I’m interested in renewable energy. Will get paid ~100k. But will live in middle of nowhere (some field somewhere in the US-won’t  even know where until near start date). 

Grad school wouldn’t cost much because I’ll still be able to get financial aid. This last year only cost me ~$1000 because I worked on applying to scholarships the year before. 

Don’t know what I’d study in grad school specifically but I like learning/studying. I’d stay comfortable in school. 

Only thing is that I’ll miss this opportunity of working with solar panels (even tho it’s on the construction side &amp; not design side).

I know that is a simple question, but curently im strugeling with biomass chp analysis.

I got 16 MW biofuel boiler, 4 MW condensing economiser and 5 MW turbine which will procude about 4,8 MW of el. power.

Boilers eff is 0,85.

With these variables, the total fuel demand would be 16/0,85= 18,85 MW

Thefore the total eff of the plant would be calculated as :

87,Considerations on controlling floor heating,1571930441,"Last summer, we bought an apartment with central warm water floor heating and while the heating installation itself seems fine, with a new central unit serving 3 parties, the control of the actual circuits was in a dire state. No documentation on the heating circuits, pretty open 230V wiring, no hydronic balancing and only bimetal thermostats with huge hysteresis and shoot-over due to massive stone floors.

So I decided to do something about it, changed the valves to 24V and built a [fully programmable controller](https://github.com/kvoit/FloorHeatingController_HW/) that gets accurate temperature readings from all rooms and can individually control the circuits. Now I sit there with all the freedom I have and wonder what would be most efficient. I have contemplated going to /r/HomeImprovement, but a s a theoretical physicist myself, I would enjoy a scientific view on this. Also it may be a bit non-standard.

The general situation is that I have a well isolated apartment (we currently only heating one corner bathroom at around 10C outside temperature), with 6 individually heated rooms and one open space area with 3 circuits. All floors a significant thermal capacity, especially the open space area and the bathrooms tiled with 2cm thick granite plates.  
The central heating unit supplies 3 parties, with heat meters for each party. There are around 5 meters of pipe with some isolation from the unit to our heating circuit distribution where all the valves are located.

There are a few things I have not fully made my mind out about:

1. The **pump**. It is [this](https://www.plumbase.co.uk/link/1/h034357_31201_t.pdf) or a very similar model, providing either constant or variable differential pressure. Currently it is set to variable differential pressure by recommendation of the seller. For this, I don't really even have an angle on how to approach it.
2. Static **hydronic balancing**. I could adjust screws on the heating circuit distribution unit to balance flow through the circuits. However, that feels a bit like using current control resistors to run an LED and it seems that would decrease the efficiency of the pumps, which leads to ...
3. **Control method of the valves**. With the bimetal thermostats, the valves stayed open until the set temperature was reached, then closed (and temperature overshot due to the intertia of the system). To decrease the overshoot, I could reduce flow through the circuit.  With my new controller, I have the option to PWM the valve, which leads to ...
4. **PWM frequency and offsets**. Currently, I operate with 30min periods and let the thermal capacitance smooth it out. According to the manufacturer, I could do high frequency for half-open valves, but that would decrease the pump efficiency again, I think. So the question here is what would be a good frequency. It cannot be super short, since the actuators take about 2min to open and I think I want to avoid half open states for given reasons. It cannot be super long, or temperature will fluctuate too much.   
I am also trying to get my head around losses in the pipes outside my apartment. The loss is proportional to ΔT at the pipe (isolation) surface, so I would expect this to be most efficient if I pump hot water through there (and thus have maximal surface temperature) as seldom as possible, so I guess I should not offset the duty cycle of the respective circuits. Of course, the pump then has to be set such that it adjusts to circuits shutting on and off. This seems to suggest the constant differential pressure setting.
5. **Regulation of the system**. I think I can get away with bang bang, but in theory, I could also program a PID controller ... Right now, I only map on and off state to two PWM values and also maximum-filter the temperature over the interval of 30min to filter out ventilation (because with the given isolation, the actual wall temperature cannot drop that fast).

So .... I guess the most pressing question is what to do with the pump and if I overlook some practical issues because I assumed my apartment is is an infinitesimally small sphere in vacuum :)",AskEngineers,False,elcaron,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dmhwq9/considerations_on_controlling_floor_heating/

I'm kind of looking into graduation with no internships, already feeling like its going to be near impossible to get an engineering job. I almost feel like my degree is worthless, and I also feel like wanting to learn more will amount to nothing respectable for me.  Its almost like engineering ended up the same way people told me pursuing music as a career would. But I kind of speak with a filter outside a select few friends and my father.

I mostly run into an issue when talking to especially younger students in a non distasteful manner about my major though.

I got a call a few months later from this guy who ran by our booth and told me that my sons (around preteens I think) were inspired by the project and was interested in our goals (both into cars I guess).

21,Can you help me decide what to do after graduation? (Engineer) 2 options,1571874431,"I’m a mechanical engineering senior

Option 1: work for a construction company. I’d be part of the solar group, meaning I’d be out in the middle of nowhere on some field. No idea what location &amp; I wouldn’t know until near my start date. Base salary is around $70000 but total compensation package comes out to $100000 because of the fact that I’m in a “travel” group and they give us ~$700/wk for it. 
Deadline to accept is November 4. With this option, I’d pay loans off (around 30-40,000) but I’d be living in who knows where.

Option 2: apply to grad school for mechanical engineering. Not sure which topic exactly- all I know is I’m interested in renewable energy (hence the solar construction thing). If I do grad school straight out of undergrad, then I can still get $ from FAFSA and I’ve been good on applying to scholarships too so basically it wouldn’t cost much to attend. For instance, this last year of undergrad I didn’t have to take out loans. 
I love to learn/study. So, good part about this is I stay comfortable, my life wouldn’t change much. Bad part is I don’t get any work experience and I don’t know exactly what I’d want to study in grad school at all. Also another bad thing is if I decline this offer from this construction company, I might not get the chance again. Really, the only reason why I’d like this job is because it’d give me exposure to the solar field, which, although it’s on the construction side and not on an innovative/design side, it’s a good starting point I’d think. 
Risky part about grad school is the deadline to apply is December and I’d probably just apply to 2-3 schools in my state (hoping to get into the school I’m at now). My gpa is 3.95/4 &amp; I take the GRE this Monday (Didn’t study so I probably will do below average of my school’s average score 165).
So basically there’s the risk that I won’t get accepted into this grad school &amp; I’ll be left with nothing - no job, no school. 


The solar travel thing for the construction company would last maybe 2-3 years before I want to either settle in one of their offices (although I’m not interested in construction so maybe I’d just apply to another job by then- unless I become interested by then). 

I’m just so confused. I really could go either way. I feel the construction would be good because I get to finally get some job experience and feel that I’m actually doing something with my life + the pay , but bad because of the location. 

Then grad school is good because I stay comfortable, might not have to move and completely start my life again, I don’t think financial aid will be too much of a problem, BUT it’s bad because I take the risk of not getting accepted &amp; I miss an opportunity to finally get job experience / some experience in the renewable energy world.

Important note: I have already been given feedback that I need more of the mini 2x4’s, because the part with the foam is the part that is supposed to be leaning on the doorway. (As opposed to the little plastic point that currently is leaning on it).

1.) I have 4 4in screws holding in the long 2x4 that acts as the trim that would be around a doorway. I originally wanted to use some 6in lag bolts, or 10in lag bolts to go all through the double joists. The reason I didn’t is because the length of my drill + the length of the drill bit + the length of the screws ended up being longer than the space in between the joists. 

2.) the short stacks of 3 2x4s that act as the vertical sides of the doorway, each are attached to the one on top of it with 4 4inch screws, as well as I put wood glue in between them.

Other notes:

Originally I wanted to put a 2x4 vertically on the back side of the joists. I didn’t do this because it made the space between the “front” and “back” too far away from each other. That’s hard to describe.. but since it’s made to be in a doorway, the width of the doorway is part of the design. 

I also got a suggestion to use a long 4x4 instead of 3 2x4s, but I couldn’t figure out how to attach that to the ceiling.

To keep the line running during a coil swap, we use a looper system that takes up the slack while the new coil is welded to the old one so that the line never stops running. We recently switched to a thinner (.27mm!!) steel, and I am having some serious trouble developing a process for welding it. Currently, when welding the previous material, there is an automatic tig welder that travels at adjustable speeds with and adjustable amperage and doesn’t use any filler. The clamping mechanism is adjustable and the two pieces of steel are butted over a block which has a gap and gas ports in the gap for the argon shielding gas. I have tried welding the thinner stuff on a flat block, without shielding gas from underneath (still from the nozzle though), and had moderate success with that method, as it allows more consistent butting of the two pieces. I have been on this project since March, trying various settings with the welder and different clamping configurations to make this stuff weld consistently, but am running out of ideas to even try. I have found that the factors witch have the biggest impact are arc length (distance from the steel to the tip of the electrode) and consistent butting of the part.  However, I can’t make it work every time, and this causes massive amounts of scrap when the line has to be shut down and restarted because the weld wasn’t completed before the looper ran out of slack.

My father is a full scale agricultural farmer. He is currently setting up a new greenhouse for visitors to come see the growing process. The plan is to have four fans for ventilation with the aim of maximizing air velocity and minimizing ambient temperature. The structure of the greenhouse has already been built, but the internal walls have not been put up yet.

Question:  
The picture linked below shows the front, back and top view of the greenhouse. Taking a look at it now will help you understand the following explanation.  
[https://imgur.com/a/qT692vJ](https://imgur.com/a/qT692vJ)

The greenhouse is 40'x20'x100' (WxLxH). There are three designs I am considering. Remember, the aim is low temperature, high air velocity, and I have 4 fans to play with.

A) The back wall is fully opened and the fans are spaced evenly along the front wall. I believe this will result in the highest air flow but moderate air velocity. Intake temperature will be equal to outside temperature.

B) Back of the greenhouse is partially sealed, fans spaced evenly along the front wall. Low air flow, moderate local air velocity, but intake temperature will be slightly lower than outside temperature (due to pressure difference leading to air expansion, thus cooling effect).

C) Back of greenhouse is fully sealed and a partial dividing wall is placed in the middle, lengthwise. 4 dans on one half of front wall, with the other half fully opened. Moderate air flow, high wind velocity, intake temperature equal to outside.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize this is a lengthy question, but I wanted to be detailed. To me, C is the best option because wind velocity is effectively doubled. Please let me know if my logic is correct.

Ideally, not only is sub arc-second precision a goal, but also error/accuracy of the encoder should be kept as low as the angular precision.

This post is two-fold. First, I'd like some recommendations on vendors of direct drive torque motors or gearmotors, planetary gearboxes, and precision absolute bidirectional optical encoders. Secondly, I'd like some recommendations on setup. At the end of the gear train, I only require about half an rpm or so max angular speed and maybe 20-50 or so inch-lbs of torque. So.. should I put my money into the planetary gearbox and put the encoder before the gear train, or should I put my money into the encoder and get cheap gears with encoder after the gear train?

64,Research assistant position at MIT vs research tech position at Hopkins,1571801186," I posted this in r/bioengineering earlier and was wondering if I could get some feedback here as well

&amp;#x200B;

Hello.

I'm a recent engineering graduate looking to apply to graduate schools this fall and hopefully get in next cycle(Fall 2020). I did really extensive research as an undergrad in a lab at my school, which allowed me to grow extensively as a researcher and a scientist. It's an opportunity that I really appreciate and will always be grateful for. However, I feel like because I didn't really explore other opportunities, I didn't get a chance to have a feel for how different labs and PIs operate. When I graduated, I was also so burnt out from research that I only applied to engineering jobs and had a few industry research jobs as backup. I ended up taking a research job in industry after a lot of deliberating, since I thought this would have made more sense for grad school. However, after working at this place for close to 6 months I soon realized that I'm definitely not suited industry research and that it's just not for me because the bottom-line is just really different. I then decided that I want to go into academia(80% sure now compared to 30% sure a few months ago), and decided that research opportunities in academic environments would probably be more beneficial for this. I applied to a few research assistant/tech positions and was lucky enough to hear back pretty quickly from most places I applied to. At the moment, my main considerations are JHU and MIT. Both labs do quite interesting research, but I think I'm more drawn to the research being done at MIT because it's very cutting-edge. The research at Hopkins is definitely great as well and the PI is pretty widely recognized in the cancer field. The PI at MIT is also really well-known in the BME field. My dilemma right now, is that if I take the position at MIT, I would have to move to Cambridge,which is really expensive. Assuming I apply to grad school this fall, and hopefully get in so I can start next fall, I'll have to move again. The pay at MIT would also be a lot better than the pay from this lab at Hopkins. So my question is, would the move be worth it? I've only lived in MD my entire life and the thought of moving, while exciting, is also pretty daunting.

I'm currently thinking in pursue this chance once I finish my engineering career, since the university to which I plan to apply offers this program (MSc Computer Science). From what I could see, I fulfill most of the requirements, especially the study syllabus and previous programs that they consider I must have already seen in my career.

I'm more of a hands on type of person, I like to be involved with the work I'm a part of beyond sitting behind a desk and sending emails about it, I like the technical aspect of things. 

Any professionals out there that might be able to give me a bit of guidance?",AskEngineers,False,ItsYaBoiNick4456,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dlm2hg/looking_for_some_career_path_advice_student/
93,Impact Force (Impulse Force?) Calculations of an Object Falling,1571768688,"I was trying to work out the impact load of an object falling onto a steel cage/  tunnel.  Seems pretty straight forward.  I was trying to work through calcs to see if a given load rating was acceptable, more so for my own curiosity.   

I have a 82 kg object falling 0.343 m on a steel cage. With a 1"" deflection (an initial guess at this point) I'm getting a huge impact force value (23.6 kN) which doesn't seem to account for the uniformly distributed load.  Just trying to figure out how to relate this to a given load rating  I'll admit, dynamics wasn't my favorite subject in school.  

Any suggestions or links you could point me to?",AskEngineers,False,EngineerIT757,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dlm1wf/impact_force_impulse_force_calculations_of_an/
94,Is there value to a +1 MBA program for Engineers.,1571764346,"So a little background, I am pursuing a degree in Engineering Management and Industrial Engineering. With transfer credits I am set to graduate in 3.5 years but I am a college athlete and would like to stay all 4 years. My school offers a +1 MBA program and with some summer classes I could complete that along with my bachelors in 4 years. I’ve heard that an MBA out of college is useless and some places won’t even hire you since they don’t want to pay more. So I guess I’m asking if an MBA is worth getting before any full time experience in the engineering world?",AskEngineers,False,randal1999,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dlkz8s/is_there_value_to_a_1_mba_program_for_engineers/
95,Can anyone explain crimp terminal size numbers? Like SV5.5-5 or SV1.25-3.5S or KS5.5-4,1571764187,"Or a chart or something. Can't seem to find anything definitive on google.

I'm looking for supplies on Aliexpress and local equivalents to amazon since I'm not from America. Chinese listings tend to vague with not a lot of specs or dimensions but these numbers keep popping up on titles and on images of the terminals. 

I need fork terminals for my 3D printer power supply. All I can seem to find locally for 12AWG terminals are for ""#8-#10 studs"". Problem is that it's too wide for the PSU screw terminals which max out around 7mm so hopefully there's a smaller option available. All I can seem to find are those three up there in the title. 

Thanks.",AskEngineers,False,iman7-2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dlkxul/can_anyone_explain_crimp_terminal_size_numbers/
96,How do you use Neodymium strength values in calculations?,1571762423,"I'm trying to calculate the voltage induced in a copper coil by a Neodymium magnet. Based on the formula: 

emf = N\*(BA)/t

N = number of turns

A = cross sectional area of the wire

t = time to pass through coil

B = magnetic field

So if I have a, say N52 magnet, traveling through a coil, what would be the corresponding value for B?",AskEngineers,False,programmalfunction,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dlkiy4/how_do_you_use_neodymium_strength_values_in/
