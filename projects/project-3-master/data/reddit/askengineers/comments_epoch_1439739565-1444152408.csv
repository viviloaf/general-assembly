1,How unprofessional is it to cold call an engineer I was referred to about a position? More details within,1444144167,"One of my professors provided me the contact information of a previous coworker of his who works for a company I would like to intern with. I emailed his former coworker, who passed me along to a more appropriate person based on my interests. I emailed this person two weeks ago about starting a conversation for internship opportunities next summer and received no response. I have his phone number, but I am hesitant to call because I don't want to be too pressing. Is it inappropriate to call this employee out of the blue, given that he already passed on an opportunity to respond to me?",AskEngineers,oneplusoneoverphi,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3npr0i/how_unprofessional_is_it_to_cold_call_an_engineer/
2,Ideas for home use of free thermal energy?,1444144111,"Ok so technically its not ""free"" but close enough. I am currently building a solar boiler using compound parabolic concentraters in a trough setup. Besides the obvious use of a steam engine to turn a generator are there any other cool ideas for using either hot steam or hot air? The limit on temperature is going to mostly be what type of pipe i can install and the pressure is going to be kept low for safety reasons at first.

One idea i have is attempting to melt metal with it, but im not sure i can get my working fluid hot enough for that without risking damage to the pipes/valves. And i don't want to do active tracking with mirrors to have a small solar power tower.

The other idea is a steam jet cooler if i can get a steam ejector. Seems like a cool idea for cooling in the summer and just needs power for the pump.",AskEngineers,RedEngineer23,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3npqvl/ideas_for_home_use_of_free_thermal_energy/

4,I can't find a HV amplifier component for my task. Am I looking for the wrong components? Please help.,1444142619,"I want to amplify a signal (range: DC to 1kHz AC 10 Vrms) to about 300 Vrms (current &lt; 5 mA). Also, I have multiple independent channels that I want to work with. 

Let me start with what components, I have found: 

1. [Microchip HV256] (https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=HV256) - A 32 channel amp. 72V/V close loop gain ; max output 295 V.
2. [AD5372](http://www.analog.com/en/products/digital-to-analog-converters/da-converters/ad5372.html) - 32 channel DAC. 
3. [AD5535](http://www.analog.com/en/products/digital-to-analog-converters/da-converters/ad5535.html#product-overview) - 32 channel DAC with output range of 50-200V.

So my ideal device is device 3 but with bigger voltage output. I then considered using device 1 and 2 together, amplify the signals from the DAC. 

Now, I want a higher voltage output. I have been trying to find other such amplifier arrays or really high voltage amplifiers (or even multipliers) that I can use - I am willing to make my own solution. But, I can't really find amplifiers that give that high a voltage easily (I saw some really expensive ones from Apex - but they seem overkill).

If you have an idea of a decent component or really a better solution, I would greatly appreciate a pointer. I feel, I may be looking for the wrong components, because a 50x voltage amplification (for low power use) seems like a trivial problem.

FWIW, this is a for an lab experiment setup I am working on, so the requirements are a bit flexible and a non efficient solution is also ok. I just can't spend too much money and buy a custom solution.

I am contemplating a project to capture live images and transfer it (analogically for about 1 meter) to a computer with video camera to share it online. I look around and find that optic fiber cables seems to be expensive and in low resolution.

8,UK Engineers - What subfields of Electronics/Electrical Engineering have a good future in the UK (job-wise)?,1444126766,"I'm a 28 years old Asian woman, with a Bachelor's and Master's in Electrical/Electronics Engineering. I'd like to move to the UK for a PhD and try getting a job which allows me to stay there after completing my PhD. 
I'm interested in embedded systems, robotics, signal processing, bioelectronics, machine learning, speech recognition, using electronics/electrical engineering to develop artificial limbs and other medical devices, using MATLAB etc. I hope you get the idea what kind of field I'm interested in. 

But since I will **ONLY** be issued a work permit if there is a shortage of UK/EU citizens in that field, I thought it's worth considering what the UK wants?

If this subfield doesn't have a good demand/future in the UK, what other subfields do you think I should shift my focus to? I'm willing to learn if the job prospects are good in that subfield. 

Also, I'd like to ask if being a female in EE would be an obstacle in landing jobs in the UK? Will I get discriminated? There certainly is a discrimination in my home country, and it worries me.

What do I need to do to prepare for life after college? How do I choose what to specialize in? Currently, alternative energy generation and mechatronics seems appealing. I have been a mediocre student all my college life, only doing what is required to get by. How will I make up for my lackluster transcript of records?

11,Flow control on a centrifugal pump,1444088500,"For my senior design project, we have to pump water at a wide amount of flow rates through a system to measure pressure drop in a manufacturer's product. Ideally between about 1-60 gpm with up to about 100 psig in the system, so obviously way too much to just use motor control. We've looked into it and think an adjustable bypass line might work.

[This is a basic schematic](http://i.imgur.com/8i6degK.png) of what we've thought of, but we want a sanity check. Basics in case the diagram isn't clear: there is a bypass line feeding back to the tank controlled by an adjustable valve (we're thinking globe). There's another valve after this on the main branch, which we think may be necessary for pressure control, fine control, and possible shutdown of the flow through the system.

A few notes:

* This is for a test rig. It won't be running constantly or for process use so efficiency isn't a huge deal.

* We need to be able to vary both pressure and flow rate. Adding motor control is still an option too, to get the broadest range within our specifications that we can.

* Current design is to have the tank at atmospheric but we need the system under some pressure. Will we need to run the bypass to the suction line instead?

So, is this possible, or are we going to need to figure out a way to use several different pumps to cover that range?",AskEngineers,bigscience87,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3nn1ng/flow_control_on_a_centrifugal_pump/
12,Plastic Injection Q's - Smooth Part,1444088018,"Hello,
I am designing my first injection molded part. It essentially will be a frisbee around 10"" in diameter, 0.1"" wall thickness. The outer surface needs to be perfectly smooth and have minimal knitting or other marks as the part will be chrome plated.

Vendors in the US came back with mold costs around $15k but said that they would look bad, as getting a perfectly smooth 10"" surface would require intense consideration. For a mold that met those requirements it would cost around $70k.

The over-seas vendors have a more can-do attitude about it and claim the mold cost is more around $8k-$13k. I am however worried. Is it feasible to get a near perfect smooth surface? What types of gates should I consider? A ring gate?

Any advice helpful. Thanks.

13,"getting a masters after 5 years, I feel like I need to relearn everything. studied my ass off and still did meh in the recent exam. ( EE )",1444087569,"so the title says it all. I dont have anyone to discuss this with because it's an online class but it seems many of the MS students are either full time coming from UG or UG taking MS classes.I feel that i might have forgotten a lot of core concepts that aren't necessarily gone over in grad classes. 

I spent several days studying for an exam and I still blanked out. It didnt help that the exam was 1:15 minutes with 4 very long questions. Just calculating things alone was laborious so I dont know what the teacher was thinking when she made that test. 

I find myself looking up DE, Linear algebra, Circuits 2, energy systems, complex variables ALL the time. it's very frustrating and making me questions my skills. 

how do I deal with this? any one going through this at all? im taking online engineering classes and this is at Uidaho- EO program. Really lost here. I feel like I need to redo my undergrad or will risk getting C's in classs with these averages being so high among other students.

19,I currently work in an office for realtors and I'm wondering how much of what I do now would relate to an engineering job,1444069469,"I delayed going to college due to financial reasons. I'm still young so I'm not worried about graduating in time.

However, right now I work as an administrative assistant in a realtor's office and a lot of my time is spent goofing off. There are a few minutes in the day where I'm doing actual work, like making calls and emailing people, but about 75% of the time I'm staring out of the window or reading Reddit.

I've taken two years of undergraduate college as a mechanical engineer major and it's very busy. I went to a competitive university and we like to laugh about how much pressure, work and stress we're under because that was our reality. I thought that once I finished school my engineering job would be about epic mathematics and being crazy innovative. I assumed I would be running around attending meetings and throwing ideas at my fellow engineers, discovering something enticing. But now that I've read a few posts here and worked an office job, I wonder if engineering will be filled with the same about of bullcrap.

There are several threads about what you guys do on a daily basis. But how much of your day is actually filled with work? Do you feel just as passionate about engineering as you did in school? How much do you enjoy your jobs?

24,Test for calcination? Specifically for sodium bicarbonate? - Help a mostly clueless MechE,1444053935,"Hi all,

I'm a mechanical engineer in the business of bulk material handling.  I move powders and slurries from point A to point B, and it's probably more of an art than a science most of the time.  Every once in a while we come across problems that send us back to the drawing board, and I've come to one such impasse.  We are currently trying to move sodium bicarbonate but have come across an issue where the material appears to be setting and clumping (to the size of a football).  There are the obvious external factors such as humid air or leaks in the silo, but I'd like to explore every option.  I've been brainstorming what could be causing this and am aware that sodium bicarbonate calcines at approximately 122F, yielding Sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O.  My thought is that maybe this localized release of H2O in the storage silo could be causing/contributing to the clumping that we're seeing.   Some of my other reading has found that both the sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate are soluble in water, and titration of these solutions with HCl will let us approximate the mass of bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions, and ultimately the mass of calcined material.

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.

41,Troubleshooting an Outboard Engine,1443980619,"I'm with a group of people out in the ocean and we've come across some foreigners with engine troubles. I've never worked with outboard engines before and I'm just trying to figure out where the issues are. We pulled the spark plugs and they seem to be in good condition. When we pull start the motor there are small sparks being produced by the spark plugs but I can't tell what is adequate or not. There is compression from the cylinders as you get a good puff out the spark plug ports when it's being turned over. We directly sprayed fuel into the carburetor with a spray bottle and the engine won't start firing. The kill switch is extended out and held in place with a wrench to keep it from contracting and cutting off the engine (when it was running). This is a Yamaha 2 stroke manual start engine (60HMHD 6K5K L 1032564 C)  but I can't find a digital manual out there since they all seem to be hard copies being sold online. I'm thinking it's an electrical problem. The power head has a small triangular piece that is positioned through connections [magneto control?] attached to the throttle linkages but the throttle linkages are not repositioning the upper power head area where that upper piece is attached. I am guessing this upper piece (that's all I know to call it) is somehow regulating how much current is delivered to the spark plugs. From that upper piece, wires run down to a canon plug type connection that goes into a [CDI unit box] or can be jumpered out directly to the [ignition coil assy] and then to the spark plugs. We tried jumpering the [CDI unit box] out, tried different throttle positions, manually repositioned the upper piece all the way counterclockwise/clockwise through it's range of motion but to no avail. You guys have any experience or ideas of where we could go forward with this? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the poor image quality. No cameras allowed. :'(

edit: Found an [online parts manual](http://www.marmom-marine.com/parts_catalogs/yamaha/pc_e60hmhd_04_1.pdf), looking through it now, but I'll take any help I can get.


UPDATE: I managed to get a hold of a couple Yamaha mechanics on the West Coast later that evening and we talked through the issues. The magneto wasn't being repositioned at all when it should corresponding to throttle movement. I pulled the carbs and reed valves and everything looked pristine. The engine hadn't seen too many miles since it was last put together but I noticed certain things were already jerry-rigged after comparing the parts manual to actual configuration. The engine cutoff switch doesn't have all the pieces it should. The throttle moves through it's full range of motion whether it's in neutral or engaged. The spark plugs are good and the fuel pump pushes fuel into and fills the carbs. The issue I'm hitting that kept me from buttoning up the whole thing today was the throttle linkages connected to the magneto. The Yamaha guy said that would cause the engine to likely stall out since the spark plugs won't get the voltages at the right time if it doesn't follow throttle positions, which makes sense since we were able to get it running before but eventually cut off. The fuel is a premix and good quality since they get it straight from the source out here in the [UTC+3:00]. We've already resolved to get these guys onboard and home for processing so I threw in the towel after a few more hours of fruitless jiggering of the throttle linkages. There's stuff missing and we've already bought into this situation so I don't feel too bad about it. I learned a lot since I've never worked on these things before and now I won't feel too scared of buying an outboard engine someday since I have some repair experience under my belt.

46,Capacitive proximity sensor vs. induction stove.,1443961778,"Hello guys.

I have a problem and it's driving me nuts. A LED lighting strip in my kitchen is controlled by a capacitive touch [switch](http://shop.qproduct.cz/fotky20944/fotos/_vyr_229100114.jpg) that is glued on the inside of a cupboard so when I touch it on the outside the lights turn on.

But - this is somewhat above the induction hob and thus fairly close to one's head when cooking (some 30 cm) and whenever the person comes into conductive contact with the pan/pot/whatever on the active induction hob, due to some EM antenna/interference phenomena, the switch detects it despite any part of the body being far from its normal range (usually about 1 cm from the cupboard wall).

I did a few ""measurements"" and there is a sizable ""sphere of influence"" about 40 cm in which if any part of one's body is at the moment the person comes in contact with a pot on the stove, the switch detects it.

As you can imagine, cooking with lights coming on/off constantly sucks.

Is there anything that can be done to prevent this? I was experimenting with glueing pieces of various materials between the switch and the cupboard wall to reduce the sensitivity, but nothing seems to do the trick.

Ideas will be greatly appreciated.

So I'm building a 3d printed suspension for my 3DR Quad-C DIY, as a part of my school's Engineering Technology Club. ^(this is purely extracurricular)

The blue part is the quad's leg. 

The pink is only a representation of where the shocks [(from an rc car)](http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1is2XJXXXXXXaXpXXq6xXFXXXN/10Pair-Lot-Adjustable-Aluminum-Shock-Absorber-06002-For-RC-HSP-HPI-RedCat-Himoto-1-10-Model.jpg) would go.

The orange and yellow parts will be 3d printed.

The green will not move, it secures the spring to the base yellow.

The orange will not move. the yellow will pivot at the intersection between its upper hole and orange's lower hole.

The base of the yellow will not be translating vertically up and down. So when the quad lands, [the legs will either shift in or shift out slightly.](http://i.imgur.com/bvorVTM.png)

Then I'd shake the bottle, which effectively cools down the air to a point where it's actually colder than it was before I entered the sauna, and the bottle shrinks because all the energy has gone to the water which doesn't expand with heat.

1. Confused about the following:

&gt; Fuel combustion is also less efficient in a cold engine, and the air-fuel mixture is richer - in other words, there is more fuel and less air in the mixture.

Why is the air-fuel mixture richer in colder temperatures? With a higher air density shouldn't the mixture be leaner, or does the fuel injection change with temperature?

2. With regards to this statement:

&gt; excessive idling is not an effective way to warm up your vehicle, even in cold weather. The best way to warm it up is to drive it. In fact, with today's computer-controlled engines, even on cold winter days, usually no more than two to three minutes of idling is enough warm-up time needed for the average vehicle before starting to drive

&gt; the catalytic converter doesn't work efficiently when it is cold. Therefore it is important to drive the vehicle so that it reaches its proper operating temperature as soon as possible in order to maximize fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.

In another thread I learned that the main point of idling is to heat up the catalytic converters and not the engine. Per the above, is idling not sufficient to heat up the catalytic converters to its most efficient/operating temperature? If so what's the point of even idling the 2-3 minutes recommended above, as opposed to just driving off immediately?

My co-workers on the other hand, want me to start by first making the parts in the central library first.  That way the parts can be shared and in one place.  They think that having local libraries is bad practice, and all designs should reference the central library.  My argument against this is that when I first make the parts, they're not in the best condition, and if someone else uses it right away it could be wrong.

I just graduated, went to the first day at my job, and while the company seems awesome (great benefits, nice campus/ facilities, company activities) I am realizing my job is going to be completely a desk job. I get my own office (sweet!) but there's no natural lighting and the hallways in the building are dark. I'm in the semiconductor industry, and I think the topics covered in my work are interesting, but i hate the idea of sitting at a desk all day, everyday staring at a computer screen. My lower back already hurts from sitting all day and I'm already bored. It's draining.

I'm going to suck it up for at least a year since I know I'm working for a great company, and feel bad about wasting their time if I were to just leave now. I do however want to know what other potential career options are for future reference.

79,New Job Concerns (x-post /r/Engineering),1443754712,"I recently graduated with a BS in civil engineering, and have started working at a job doing computer science and other unrelated science fields that is very research intensive (experimental design, advanced statistical analysis, big data, and some brand new areas of research). This is not my ideal job, but it was either this or go straight to grad school (which some of my friends did). My question is this: how do I make it look like I know what I'm doing?

This job requires a lot of statistics and other fields that I have no experience with. It would be fine if everyone knew this; however, it feels like everyone working here thinks I am much more qualified than I actually am, and to be honest, I probably should have never been hired in the first place. Obviously, I'm busting my butt to learn as much as possible but it's a very steep learning curve to just jump right into something in which I have zero experience with. I make sure to ask questions whenever possible, but it feels like people have high expectations when I know they shouldn't. It's all very overwhelming and I'm concerned I'm ultimately doing more harm than good for the company. Any advice is welcome.

80,How would you design a flapping wing aerial vehicle capable of supersonic flight?,1443754425,"There was an [article in Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6151/1254) recently about insects with small gears in their legs to facilitate jumping. That got me thinking about how hard it would be to implement bird joints onto aircraft.

Anyway, here are the constraints:

No limit on cost or size, manned or unmanned, materials must be feasible enough to be in use in some capacity today. It could be the size of a dragonfly or an Spruce Goose.

The vehicle should take off under its own weight and be able to obtain supersonic flight.

3/4 of its thrust at any stage of flight needs to be generated by articulated wing flapping. Any gas turbine, battery, nuclear reactor etc. needs to be internal and not provide thrust &lt;1/4 of the total. The wings can't have a rotational range more than 1 revolution (no propeller wings)

Lighter than air designs frowned upon.

Objectives (bonus points):

100% flapping propulsive power

Mach 1 achieved in level flight (as opposed to a dive)

A ball (or other) joint for the wings that doesn't need to be repaired after every flight.

A bird plane in every home in 20 years.

93,Exactly how common is MATLAB in the real world?,1443716963,"All my engineering classes are taught using matlab, and I hate it. It lacks a lot of nice syntax and features of other programming languages like Python or Julia. A few examples:

* You can't define a function in the same file you call it. 

* No list comprehensions.

* No tail-call optimization for recursive functions.

* No do-while loops.

* No intelligent type conversion. You can't just write `display('The result is ' + var)`, you have to use `num2str()`.

* The REPL is *only* available on unix-based systems.

* `*`, `/`, and `^` operators default to matrix operations, not element-wise operations. This makes it easy to mix up scalar and matrix operations.

* `deg2rad()` was not added until *2010!!!*

...and so forth. I am constantly finding myself banging my head when I discover that something simple in Python requires many more steps to implement in matlab. There are certainly places where matlab shines, such as the sheer amount of built-in utility functions and terse syntax, but Python has a very large number of mature scientific computing libraries as well 

Every time I ask my professors if I really MUST use matlab, when I feel there are better tools available for the particular things we are doing in that class, the response is always ""But everyone else is using matlab, and it's not that bad. It's good enough.""

As part of a project, I've been looking for quick and cheap methods to create ""trip wire"" style traps and other traps. Currently, I've produced the following:

Trimmed down ""party poppers"" with fishing line tripwire and duck tape fastening.

A whole bunch of LED throwies with a trip wire switch (pulls a bit of card out).

""Toilet bang"" (I know) capgun cap-based traps.

However, all of these have their drawbacks, particularly when it comes to the trigger mechanism. The party popper traps require a decent amount of force to trigger (they're based on the friction of the knotted string going through the card+explosive) so I'm searching for ways to achieve a similar effect using a limited amount of electronics. My requirements are:

1. Must attach to a fishing wire or other tripline 

2. Must be LOW cost (I'm talking &lt;$1 per trap). 

3. Preferably reusable, but disposable would do 

4. Don't require a massive amount of soldering or PCB boards etc (a little electronics is OK, but it's not my forte).

We've reached the limits of what we can do with acoustical foam. More foam is not feasible because we'd have to either make the unit's bigger or negatively impact performance.  Our customers want quieter units, and as such we are looking at other sound attenuation issues.  My boss suggested active noise cancellation as an option and requested I look into that.

Our sound is in the neighborhood of 80 DB for most of the things we'd be looking at, and is typically a trailer mounted ~5 meter long x 3.5 meter wide x 4 meter tall steel box (with doors and such of course).

15,"One year into ""Sales Engineering"" at my company, should I begin looking for other jobs?",1443644281,"I was hired last September in the sales department as a Sales Engineer. It was my first offer coming out of a good engineering school with a 2.96 GPA as a BSME. I accepted thinking it was the best I could probably do ($56k starting but advertised originally as $45k, currently at $61 k) given my GPA, one internship, and involvement in a student organization that, while I built on several soft skills, had nothing to do with engineering. I was told I would be helping standardize customer packages for some of our product and play a role in the standardization of a specific product line so we can manufacture it faster. When I first interviewed, the office had 12 people including the sales/service office and the engineering office. This specific location isn't the company's headquarters but we do light assembly here, but not for product I would be working on. Since I started, the office went down to 3 people, and we replaced one engineer so now we're at 4. I have switched from a sales technical support role to project/product management and now I pretty much just get assigned random things my boss doesn't have time to do. I should say my supervisor originally didn't want me involved with customers or external reps initially (6-8 months from starting) since I was new and that was the issue they were trying to resolve with their regular engineers.

Honestly, I'm neither happy for fulfilled where I am. I really doubt I am helping the company in any way and I feel like the longer I wait to leave the less technical knowledge I will have retained from school. I've learned a good deal here about sheet metal design, electrical design, what parts should cost, SolidWorks (Inventor was taught at my school), PLCs (ladder logic, I/O requirements for large systems, etc), and other things, but I don't feel like I'm being developed into a good employee, just okay at different things. I get paid okay and the bosses actually like me a lot, but I feel like I set myself up for failure by working here in the first place. I want to be useful to the company and be worth my pay, but I don't know how. I'm afraid if I ask to do something else there won't be any work and they'll realize my position shouldn't exist or that I'll be exposed as an idiot.

19,Dampening device for oscillation effects?,1443633728,"Hello, all.

So I've got an interesting question using United States design codes; I'm looking for a manufacturer which makes oscillation dampening devices for small scale members.

The client wants to install some weather and traffic monitoring devices at the center span of a long truss structure.  Here's a rendering of what it could look like:

http://i.imgur.com/hW6CiOY.jpg

The problem, is the existing post to which the equipment will be attached already vibrates a significant amount; I saw it oscillating ~2"" just from normal traffic (not even design loads and wind events).  The traffic monitoring devices are vibration-sensitive and need to be pretty stationary for accurate counts and maintaining calibration.  A potential (and much more costly) option is to mount the weather monitoring device at the center span and mount the traffic monitoring devices on their own post at one of the piers.

So what we would like to have, is something haphazardly shown here:

http://i.imgur.com/IarUC4l.jpg

Something at the top of the existing post which will support the monitoring devices vertically but dampen lateral movement (FYI, the orange lines represent connection angles, the black lines represent the centerline of connection bolts, and the big red block is the dampening device).

Are any of you engineers out there aware of a manufacturer that supplies some type of dampening device which might help?

21,Choice of fabric for portable outdoor pellet trap.,1443628013,"So, I have a few airguns with a maximum muzzle energy of 16J and local regulations state I can use these on any private property as long as I can ensure that the pellet doesn't leave the property. 

Since I am not the only one shooting that's a pretty hard thing to ensure with most commercial traps. Since I really don't feel like having a massive wooden backstop in my yard all year when I only shoot a few days a year I would like to build a portable one and I would like to build to be able to safely stop anything from basic 4.5mm, 450mg wadcutters to 5.5mm, 2000mg steel or plastic tipped  hunting pellets at essential point blank range.

The basic PVC frame I don't care about. That's  essentially just a disposable if damaged, rectangular truss with feet. 

My question concerns the fabric. I'm not going to pull it taught but rather leave some slack to allow better energy adsorption.

What I can't figure out is how to choose a fabric. I know there are ballistic curtains commercially manufactured but as far as I can tell they are ridiculously overkill on the protection side and ridiculously expensive for what I need. So, what's a fabric I can safely get away with for this project? Is some rubberized nylon good enough? Do I need aramid fabric? A thick denim fabric? How much do UV light and moisture affect my fabric over time.  I am leaning towards the synthetics since the individual fibers are rather more elastic so I assume they'd deform and return while natural cottons fibers would take significant damage with each hit. Of course failure through wear would be expected of any fabric after a certain amount of time but I figure if I just double up the layers that's not going to become a big issue since I always have time to replace the worn layer.


So what are your thoughts on choice of fabric? ",AskEngineers,ZeMilkman,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3mz96j/choice_of_fabric_for_portable_outdoor_pellet_trap/

34,Salary negotiations after 1 year,1443559271,"Hello, /r/askengineers. 

I'm looking for advice on negotiating my salary at my current company. For a little background, I graduated with a Master's degree in Aerospace engineering with a specialization in structural dynamics and fluid structure interaction. I have several years of experience using ANSYS and my current job revolves around doing vibration analysis, fracture mechanics, stress, and transient thermal analyses using FEA. I've been with the company for 1 year. 

I got hired after a very lengthy and taxing job hunt. Competition in my area is very high, and I am very fortunate to have found a position at this company. My master's degree, past co-op experience (16 months), and knowledge of ANSYS are what got me in. When I received my job offer, it was low compared to average salaries in my area. I tried negotiating, but my boss wouldn't budge with his offer. He knew the competition was strong and I would be nuts to refuse. I accepted it. After all, I didn't have any industry experience outside of co-op. 

It's now been a year at my current job, and my performance review is coming up. My province's salary survey shows that I am making pretty much the bottom of the interquartile range for the lowest competency level. My job is actually very challenging and requires a wide array of specialized knowledge that not a lot of people at my level have. I admit that I have lots to learn, especially on the practical side of things, but I feel that I am being unfairly compensated. 

Can I negotiate up to a reasonable level after having already worked at the job for a year? To be clear, I'm looking for a raise of about $12,000 over my current salary. My boss is very stubborn and not easy to speak with. I don't want to leave this job. I love this work, and it'll be impossible to find another job here (I'm somewhat tied to the area for a while).

Basically it's and 8' I-Beam (W8x9) with A-frames made of 2 1/2"" and 2 1/4"" support tubes (all steel) and I'm shooting for a 4000 lbs rating. It needs to fit through a 4' doorway and the casters will not be supporting the load when lifting, they are only for moving the unloaded gantry around. It's not shown in the model, but the legs (along with the horizontal brace at the bottom) will telescope so I can adjust the height. This will make the width larger but that's fine because it can't be any higher and fit through the door anyway.

I don't have any experience in doing the calculations necessary to validate the design but I found a site that will [calculate beam loading](http://www.webstructural.com/beam-flexure/). The W6x9 seems to be a reasonable choice for an 8 to 9 foot span. I based it on the beam sizes of some [existing designs](https://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/product_200349918_200349918). However, I wasn't quite clear on the 'bracing' choice. As in the picture, there won't be any extra horizontal connections along the beam, but the calculation fails horribly if I chose 'unbraced'. It looks like an I-Beam is inherently 'continuously braced' (at least for the calculations on this site).

Another question that is likely misguided from me. Following my question yesterday regarding steel tubing/bar max. loads, I have the same question regarding a bearing.

I can't find any info on Google about this--which is why I think I'm probably going about it the wrong way--but I can't seem to find any information on how much weight a bearing can support. I have a specific bearing in mind:

A 25 mm pillow block bearing that would be using a 25 mm x 1000 mm solid steel bar as an axle (1 x bearing on each end of the bar) (http://www.astbearings.com/product.html?product=UCP205-16)

The tech specs have load bearing information (dynamic and static loads) but the units are alien to me:

Dynamic Load Rating (Cr): 3,152,
Static Load Ratings (Cor): 1,763

Can these numbers be converted to weight? I.e., 100 kg, 200 kg, etc? All I want is a bearing that can support a couple hundred kilos, at slow speeds on flat ground with very few bumps etc.

69,How stupid is this baby gate design?,1443459412,"Engineers. Parents. Skeptics. People who work with extruded aluminum--what is wrong with my design?
I can't find an elegant, off-the-shelf baby gate that will work for my situation and I've always wanted to play around with extruded aluminum (some people call it 80/20), so I came up with a design that I'd love to get some feedback on.

You can see a technical drawing here http://imgur.com/dtm3pxi. Please forgive any drafting errors, I am not an engineer (although if you see anything egregious please point it out.)

Here is a photo showing the location; http://imgur.com/UqYY7iD

The idea is to mount two 1"" x 1"" horizontal extrusions to existing porch railings. These horizontal members will act as tracks for a sliding wood gate, which will have four linear bearings mounted to it. The bearings can be seen here http://www.mcmaster.com/#60585k18/=z4x5qsH

There will be a stop and a latch so the gate can be secured when closed. These elements are not shown in the drawing. 
My concerns:

* The orientation of the bearings. The gate is essentially hanging off of upside down bearings. How bad of an idea is this?

* The large cantilever the gate will have. I'm open to adding a UHMW slide to leading edge of the gate if necessary, but only if there aren't any other better solutions.

* Would a bearing with wheels, similar to this be better? http://www.mcmaster.com/#9904k1/=z4x8ra

* This is an exterior application. I think the aluminum will be okay, but maybe I'm missing something.

* If you have a strong opinion about the type of wood to use, I'd love to hear it. I'm thinking cedar for it's outdoor durability and relative lightness.

Should I give up entirely and head to Baby's-R-Us?

71,What's the most accurate linear position measurement system I could realistically make myself with access to basic machining tools?,1443457521,"So I'm trying to build a micro-positioning stage with an accuracy somewhere in the vicinity of about one micron. The stage I'm trying to build would have an area of 6"" x 6"" (150mm x 150mm). I have no idea whether that is realistic for me, but that's what I'm aiming for. Specifically, I have a couple of tubular linear motors I've been working on, that I need some sort of position sensor to use for commutation and servoing. As I understand it there are several different options:

* Potentiometers: cheap, but far too imprecise.

* Ultrasonics: definitely DIYable, but again to imprecise.

* Magnetic/Optical Linear Encoders: these would be ideal, but are beyond my price range. They aren't really something I could make of sufficient resolution, at least not for less than I could buy one.

* Interferometers: these can and have been made by individuals, and offer extremely high resolution. However, my understanding is that they are very sensitive to vibration, so I'm not sure if they would be appropriate. Also, for what's it's worth I've never even heard of these being used in this sort of thing.

* Laser Triangulation: these have impressive accuracy as well, and might be something I could make, but the parts would be very pricey and would require calibration.

* LVDTs: I have heard of people making these at home, and they do offer AFAIK basically infinite resolution (as in only limited by the controller circuit). However my understanding is that they have problems with linearity for lengths of more than say 20mm.

Thanks for reading. I'm curious to know whether this is a pipe dream, or whether I should just bite the bullet and save up for linear encoders.

My guess is ~10^9 (one billion).

1. TV sat receivers: How many TV households are there? Wikipedia has [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_households) of households per country, but no sum.The data looks like [Zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law), so I can approximate the sum of the ~200-enty table with *first_entry* * *sum(1/1+1/2+1/3...+1/200)*, which is 450M * 5.8 = 2.3B households. I would guess that at least 2/3 of all households have a TV, which is 1.5B households. I would guess that maybe 1/2 of all TV households have satellite TV, which is 750M satellite receivers.
2. Trucks and agricultural machinery: probably negligible. Wolfram Alpha says there are 200M ""trucks and vans"" around, globally. I would guess that at best 50% of them are equipped with GPS tracking, which is 100M sat receivers, which is negligible ;-)
3. Cars with GPS: Google says there are 1B cars driving. However, the number of GPS-equipped cars is probably low, considering the ""long tail"" of junkers that still exist, and the low-ish percentage of cars that come with GPS, even today. I assume factory-GPS-equipped cars are at best 10% of all cars, so 100M receivers, so negligible again.
4. smart phones: google tells me that we are on the way to 2B smartphones. Wow! Thanks to the kind of short lifetime of smartphones, I would guess that most of them are GPS enabled, even though GPS smartphones are *relatively* new - although many cheap ""smart phones"" do not have a GPS receiver. So, gut feeling says maybe 50% GPS-enabled smart phones, or 1B sat receivers, rounded up.

Conclusion: ~1B sat TV receivers + ~1B GPS receivers = ~1B* satellite receivers depending on satellite technology.

I think I covered the most common receiver types. Any thoughts? Please comment what you think the answer is.

94,Sweeping in a circle.,1443353825,"I didn't know who else to ask.

I'm in the air force and work on a crew with a bunch of technicians, so we have a lot of down time to argue this...

So every Sunday we have ""hangar cleanup"". We spread this green dust [it's called DustBane and it's supposed to stop particles from becoming airborne] around the perimeter of the hangar and then all sweep it up in to a big pile. Every Sunday we argue about how best to sweep it up.

One group argues that we should all stand in a straight line with pushbrooms and sweep from one side to the other. The only problem is that we only have 20 pushbrooms that are about 2 feet wide. The hangar is about 100ft by 200ft. So we'd have to stagger and walk 200 ft while sweeping up the green stuff, then walk back to the line and start again. This walking back is wasted time and we'd have to do it a couple times to get the entire floor. There are also obstacles on the floor [power carts, aircraft, maintenance stands].

The other group wants to sweep in a circle. Rather, a spiral. One person starts sweeping and tilts their broom inward so the green stuff rolls off the side of the broom. Then someone else is behind them off to the side with their tilted broom, and so on and so on. So they walk around in an ever shrinking circle pushing the green stuff into a big pile in the middle.

96,Diagnose brushless AC motor,1443327331,"I pulled a non-functioning brushless AC induction motor from a laboratory diaphragm pump.  Trying to understand what is causing the failure to operate.

I just replaced a stuck bearing, but that doesn't appear to be the issue. when powered on, both poles on the stator magnetize and will attract my screwdriver to whichever side it is closest.  The rotor just buzzes when inserted, however, and becomes very difficult to rotate by hand.  I tried starting it with the rotor spinning and it immediately stops.

My assumption is that one of the windings has failed, but I'm a novice so I'm looking for other ways to confirm.  It is possible that the shaft is misaligned somehow, but I can turn it with a couple of fingers and it doesn't seem to rub.

99,How fast does an autopilot have to run at to create a PD controller that reacts immediately to any disturbance?,1443314140,"Howdy,

Currently, I have a pixhawk running at 200hz, and I have my PD code that is supposed to keep my pixhawk stable for one Degree of Freedom. The problem is that mine cannot keep the system at exactly 0 degrees, it fluctuates from -5 to 5 degrees, and if I disturb the system it takes roughly 2-3 seconds to dampen out the disturbance. I want to know what I can be doing wrong and what I need to do to create a more responsive and better PD controller. I want to make it so that it never deviates from 0 degrees and if it is disturbed than it dampens out its oscillations in less than a second.

So my first question is how fast should a pixhawk be operating that? should it work at a higher frequency? or is 200hz fine?

If 200hz is fine, then my code must have some sort of problems, how would I go about finding my errors?

34,Can someone overlook this math for me?,1443129689,"My friend posted this as definitive proof that the towers fell. I'd like some insight into it.

 In the aircraft crashes at the World Trade Center, the impact (with the aircraft going from 500 or 600 mph to zero) would have throughly mixed the fuel that entered the building with the limited amount of air available within. In fact, it is likely that all the fuel was turned into a flammable mist. However, for sake of argument we will assume that 3,500 gallons of the jet fuel did in fact form a pool fire. This means that it burnt according to reactions (2) and (3). Also note that the flammable mist would have burnt according to reactions (2) and (3), as the quantity of oxygen within the building was quite limited. 

Since we do not know the exact quantities of oxygen available to the fire, we will assume that the combustion was perfectly efficient, that is, that the entire quantity of jet fuel burnt via reaction (1), even though we know that this was not so. This generous assumption will give a temperature that we know will be higher than the actual temperature of the fire attributable to the jet fuel. 

We need to know that the (net) calorific value of jet fuel when burnt via reaction (1) is 42-44 MJ/kg. The calorific value of a fuel is the amount of energy released when the fuel is burnt. We will use the higher value of 44 MJ/kg as this will lead to a higher maximum temperature than the lower value of 42 (and we wish to continue being outrageously generous in our assumptions). 

For a cleaner presentation and simpler calculations we will also assume that our hydrocarbons are of the form CnH2n. The dropping of the 2 hydrogen atoms does not make much difference to the final result and the interested reader can easily recalculate the figures for a slightly more accurate result. So we are now assuming the equation: 

(4) CnH2n + 3n/2 O2 =&gt; n CO2 + n H2O 

However, this model, does not take into account that the reaction is proceeding in air, which is only partly oxygen. 

Dry air is 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen (by volume). Normal air has a moisture content from 0 to 4%. We will include the water vapor and the other minor atmospheric gases with the nitrogen. 

So the ratio of the main atmospheric gases, oxygen and nitrogen, is 1 : 3.76. In molar terms: 

Air = O2 + 3.76 N2.

Because oxygen comes mixed with nitrogen, we have to include it in the equations. Even though it does not react, it is ""along for the ride"" and will absorb heat, affecting the overall heat balance. Thus we need to use the equation: 

(5) CnH2n + 3n/2(O2 + 3.76 N2) =&gt; n CO2 + n H2O + 5.64n N2 

From this equation we see that the molar ratio of CnH2n to that of the products is: 

CnH2n : CO2 : H2O : N2 = 1 : n : n : 5.64n moles
= 14n : 44n : 18n : 28 x 5.64n kgs
= 1 : 3.14286 : 1.28571 : 11.28 kgs
= 31,000 : 97,429 : 39,857 : 349,680 kgs

In the conversion of moles to kilograms we have assumed the atomic weights of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are 1, 12, 14 and 16 respectively. 

Now each of the towers contained 96,000 (short) tons of steel. That is an average of 96,000/117 = 820 tons per floor. Lets suppose that the bottom floors contained roughly twice the amount of steel of the upper floors (since the lower floors had to carry more weight). So we estimate that the lower floors contained about 1,100 tons of steel and the upper floors about 550 tons = 550 x 907.2 ≈ 500,000 kgs. We will assume that the floors hit by the aircraft contained the lower estimate of 500,000 kgs of steel. This generously underestimates the quantity of steel in these floors, and once again leads to a higher estimate of the maximum temperature. 

Each story had a floor slab and a ceiling slab. These slabs were 207 feet wide, 207 feet deep and 4 (in parts 5) inches thick and were constructed from lightweight concrete. So each slab contained 207 x 207 x 1/3 = 14,283 cubic feet of concrete. Now a cubic foot of lightweight concrete weighs about 50kg, hence each slab weighed 714,150 ≈ 700,000 kgs. Together, the floor and ceiling slabs weighed some 1,400,000 kgs. 

So, now we take all the ingredients and estimate a maximum temperature to which they could have been heated by 3,500 gallons of jet fuel. We will call this maximum temperature T. Since the calorific value of jet fuel is 44 MJ/kg. We know that 3,500 gallons = 31,000 kgs of jet fuel 

will release 10,850 x 44,000,000 = 477,400,000,000 Joules of energy.

This is the total quantity of energy available to heat the ingredients to the temperature T. But what is the temperature T? To find out, we first have to calculate the amount of energy absorbed by each of the ingredients. 

That is, we need to calculate the energy needed to raise: 

39,857 kilograms of water vapor to the temperature T° C,
97,429 kilograms of carbon dioxide to the temperature T° C,
349,680 kilograms of nitrogen to the temperature T° C,
500,000 kilograms of steel to the temperature T° C,
1,400,000 kilograms of concrete to the temperature T° C.

To calculate the energy needed to heat the above quantities, we need their specific heats. The specific heat of a substance is the amount of energy needed to raise one kilogram of the substance by one degree centigrade. 

Substance Specific Heat [J/kg*C]
Nitrogen 1,038
Water Vapor 1,690
Carbon Dioxide 845
Lightweight Concrete 800
Steel 450

Substituting these values into the above, we obtain: 

39,857 x 1,690 x (T - 25) Joules are needed to heat the water vapor from 25° to T° C,
97,429 x 845 x (T - 25) Joules are needed to heat the carbon dioxide from 25° to T° C,
349,680 x 1,038 x (T - 25) Joules are needed to heat the nitrogen from 25° to T° C,
500,000 x 450 x (T - 25) Joules are needed to heat the steel from 25° to T° C,
1,400,000 x 800 x (T - 25) Joules are needed to heat the concrete from 25° to T° C.

The assumption that the specific heats are constant over the temperature range 25° - T° C, is a good approximation if T turns out to be relatively small (as it does). For larger values of T this assumption once again leads to a higher maximum temperature (as the specific heat for these substances increases with temperature). We have assumed the initial temperature of the surroundings to be 25° C. The quantity, (T - 25)° C, is the temperature rise. 

So the amount of energy needed to raise one floor to the temperature T° C is 

= (39,857 x 1,690 + 97,429 x 845 + 349,680 x 1,038 + 500,000 x 450 + 1,400,000 x 800) x (T - 25)
= (67,358,330 + 82,327,505 + 362,967,840 + 225,000,000 + 1,120,000,000) x (T - 25) Joules
= 1,857,653,675 x (T - 25) Joules.

Since the amount of energy available to heat this floor is 477,400,000,000 Joules, we have that 

1,857,653,675 x (T - 25) = 477,400,000,000
1,857,653,675 x T - 46,441,341,875 = 477,400,000,000

Therefore T = (477,400,000,000 + 46,441,341,875)/1,857,653,675 = 282° C (540° F). 

So, the jet fuel could (at the very most) have only added T - 25 = 282 - 25 = 257° C (495° F) to the temperature of the typical office fire that developed.",AskEngineers,notaproofer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3m919d/can_someone_overlook_this_math_for_me/

I believe this is an appropriate subreddit for this type of question. I recently started a 3D scanning and rapid prototyping business on the side that specializes in reverse engineering and first-article inspections. I've worked in the field for 5 years previous. 

Recently, an engineer at my current employer suggested that having manufacturer's reps pass out your info is a good way generate leads, and for the reps to make an easy comission. I get the concept and it seems like a great idea, but I am looking for food-for-thought on what type of vendor I am looking for. I currently get a lot of visits from electrical distributors (resistors, caps, etc) but these folks are unlikely to visit the mechanical engineers that I am looking to connect with.

So, I guess that I am looking for input on what types of reps you deal with as a mechanical design engineer, so that I may locate similar companies in my area (Milwaukee).

I decided to return the original PSU back to PC A and it still refused to work. The mobo on PC A gives error code ""Power Supply Unit Failure"" but both PSUs worked with PC B so I know the issue isn't with the PSUs. I decided to move PC A to another electrical socket and it started working. So the issue is with the electrical socket that PC A was using. However:

1. the electrical socket was working fine before I swapped the PSUs.
2. I tested the socket and it reads exactly 120V on my multimeter.

46,Redirecting heat from a home server closet for maximum heating bill reduction in the winter,1443100987,"I'm a computer nerd by trade, and as such I have a lot of hardware in my home lab, including personal and corporate stuff. Since I own the place, I had 5 circuits brought into my server closet, and if I'm running anywhere near full tilt, it gets hot in my office, especially in the summer. This is exacerbated by the fact that I keep my office door closed to keep the cats out.

The closet sits on an external wall, so venting waste heat in the summertime should be pretty simple (especially if I can get a good seal on a one-way valve of some kind). During the winter, though, I'd like to capture that heat and use it to augment my HVAC, so I have to spend less money burning natural gas.

Directly below the server closet is an open basement. It's poorly insulated, since I'm in Georgia, and construction standards haven't exactly been great until recently. Above is the master bedroom and adjoining bath/hallway (lots of space to dissipate); to the side that's not the office, there's a very small bathroom, whose door to the stairwell/hallway area generally remains open. 

Given that heat rises I would guess that my best bet is the master upstairs, but since fans are also pretty trivial to run (and might be fun to plug into some sort of Raspberry Pi-based temperature control system in the server closet) I'm willing to be convinced that pumping it into the basement or the bathroom is a good idea.

59,What is the strongest method of hanging a Torsion Box?,1443042994,"I’m overhauling my current master bedroom into a dual office for my wife and I. The plan is to make two floating desk attached to the wall (Torsion Box Style). Then have a bench spanning the far wall between the two desks that will have shelving beneath it and a torsion box top for seating.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I have a few concerns with the torsion box design with load capacity and wall attachment. First off I was planning on following the guide on torsion box from [thewoodwhisper] but he suggest using ½’ ribs and a ¾’ skin which seems like an overkill for a simple computer desk. I plan on doing two different desks, one is spanning 5ft and the other is spanning 8.5ft. Both will be 24in deep, the longer desk will have a wall on both sides and the back, while the shorter desk will have a wall on one side and the back of the torsion box.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

With ribs being 3in tall and spaces at 7 ¼’in is this strong enough to support a computer, and the usually activities on a work desk? Do i need ¾’in mdf for the skin or would ½’in skin with ¼’in ribs be sufficient reducing the weight?

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

How would you attach the torsion boxes? My only two ideas would be either cleats attached to the wall, then the torsion box screwed into the cleats. Or ¼’ steel rods put into the studs and ¼’ holes into the torsion box for the steel rods.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

My final question and concern is the torsion box bench. This bench will be spanning 7ft, will be 16inches deep and sit roughly 18inches off the ground. Currently there will be 4 shelves underneath this bench with a wider shelf in the middle(Making two shelves on each side of the wider shelf). With a back on the bench will this be enough support for people to sit and use?

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Any and all suggestions are welcome, this is one of my bigger projects and would appreciate being able to do it right the first time.

I am currently a ME student, but I have become really interested in Engineering Physics (or physical technology in German), as it fits my likings better at first glance (esp. job wise).  
This has led´me to thinking about switching my major but after some internet and irl research, I became a bit worried about this decision.

First of all, I have spoken to someone who has studied Engineering Physics and he told me that he has never done anyhting really related to that field in the many jobs he worked. [This really fits the information I gathered from a comment in another thread on r/askengineers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rf9o9/is_pursuing_an_engineering_physics_major_a_bad/c45c6ce): 
&gt; you probably won't end up with the job or work you expect anyway.

On the other hand, I am sure a degree in Engineering Physics can land you a job in fields like lasers/optics, scientific instrumentation etc. (as consecutive master degrees are suggesting)

Secondly, I was told that I can pretty much do anything in Engineering Physics as a ME. This is really odd to me because I didn't find a single master's degree which is for both MEs and EPs. For example, there isn't a master for laser technology that I can do with a ME degree. How am I supposed to work in this field then? o.O
If this point is really true, then Engineering Physics would be a totally unessential field.

Lastly, what are fields where a EP can shine and are those fields big/represented by many companies? 

So, is a degree in Engineering Physics worth it opposed to one in ME?

Thank you guys!

72,Black Powder Cannon(On A Budget) Assistance?,1443002925,"Hello Reddit,


     Engineers of the internet, I seek your wisdom on the following. I am building a black powder cannon, but I am relegated to a college student's budget(I have $350 for the entire project, including wood stain, finish, iron straps, etc). Luckily, most of the wood for the carriage is freely available from family, so all I need is the barrel.

I was curious:

-What is the strongest type of steel pipe? I presume steel is the strongest type of pipes commonly available.
-What is the thickest type of pipe? Ideally, I'd like a 2"" Interior Diameter, with at least a 1"" wall thickness, if not 1.5"". Heavyness is less of a factor than safety.


The pipe in question must be commonly available, and have commercially available end caps; the more threading the better. I plan to have the pipe taken to a machinist and threaded at least 6""(the entire gun length is 50"") if not longer, then ""cold"" welding the threading together. After that the end cap will be standard-welded and beveled, creating an effective barrier against any type of malfunction.

The shot will be stainless steel ball bearings. 2"" or 3"" interior diameters are preferred but I'll listen to any advice given.


For calculations, should you need to:

-Shot: 1.1lb, 3"" diameter, stainless steel
-Load: 2.0lb FFg black powder.


Old cannons were made of brass, so I can't imagine steel is going to be anywhere close to exploding, but I thought I'd post this and see what the people had to say.

Each box is 2x2""

The dotted lines are 'tongues' of wood inside the other pieces. So for example, the 2x4's go 4"" into the wheel rim, and are secured in place by 4 bolts. Unless screws are better?

76,Looking for help with a project I'm considering: a mechanically-driven nixie-tube pocket watch,1442978906,"For the past few days I've been thinking a lot about a project that seems to be more and more plausible. The straightforward description is an oversized pocketwatch, driven by a skeleton clock movement, but with the traditional display of hours and minutes replaced with four nixie tubes. It wouldn't be inaccurate to call the aesthetic ""steampunk"", though this isn't necessarily intentional.

You might be familiar with [Cathode Corner's Nixie Watch](http://www.cathodecorner.com/nixiewatch/index.html), which is very impressive and well made, but a bit out of my budget, and has a few features I'm not a fan of (including being awfully large to put on my wrist). I've never attempted anything like this, however, and I've got a few questions I'm hoping some kind souls can help with.

As an engineering student, I have several CAD programs, access to 3D printers for testing parts, and will eventually have access to milling machines to manufacture the casing and some of the brackets I will inevitably need.

A website called Klockit sells a [Quartz Skeleton Clock Movement](http://www.klockit.com/products/dept-379__sku-10148.html) that I was considering buying and cannibalizing; by stripping it down to just the action and fashioning a bracket to hold it inside the watch casing, this would be the mechanical movement that keeps time, and the ticking hand for the seconds would most likely stay (it's a nice touch, and would probably be a hassle to remove). I've since emailed the sellers to find out more about the movement.

There are many places to buy nixie tubes, but [this one](http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/nixies.html#catalog) offers a fairly large selection, despite a good number of them being out of stock. Ebay also seems to be a popular source. I'm no expert on nixie tubes, but I know they seem to mostly take about 170-180 volts to power. I still need to settle on a model to use, but I'd like it to be as small as possible on the axis it's viewed (that is, to have a minimal depth) and be socketed and reasonably available so I can replace it if/when necessary. If anyone has any recommendations, I'd love to hear them.

By now you're likely noticing the two big problems that I haven't addressed, and which I've come here to ask about. The first one is *how am I going to convert the motion of the quartz movement to digital signals for the nixie tubes?* I'm open to suggestions, but the best idea I've had thus far is a set of swing arms in place of normal clock hands that direct power to the appropriate numbers on the appropriate tubes by closing circuits based on their position. The biggest problem I see with this involves imprecision causing the hour or minute to be incorrect, hit a dead zone, or accidentally try to light two numbers. I was hoping someone would have something to offer on this front, especially if there was a way to make the movement less smooth and more sharp and snappy.

The other one is power. The Nixie Watch uses a CR2 750mAh disposable lithium battery. I estimate that I could probably fit two such or similar batteries into my watch, and use them to power both the tubes and quartz movement. Nixie tubes consume considerable power, being basically mini neon lamps, so the idea was to have power to the tubes be controlled by a button on the side. The nixie watch multiplexes it's output - it actually rapidly turns the tubes on and off so they're never both drawing power - and I was considering attempting to do something similar. A friend of mine suggests a relay and an oscillator to achieve something called ""pulse width modulation"" but electrical engineering isn't my domain and I'd need some instruction to attempt to implement such a system.

I know this has been a wall of text about what may seemed like a bit of a far-fetched and incomplete plan. If you're anything like me, you may have fun just throwing any ideas you have into the hat, and maybe a working solution will come out of this. If there is one, I'm definitely going to need the help of those more experienced than me, and I welcome absolutely all input.",AskEngineers,FoxtrotZero,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3m0ubn/looking_for_help_with_a_project_im_considering_a/

84,What are the physical differences between steam relief valves and compressed air relief valves?,1442948742,"There are alot of different relief valves, some rated for steam, some not. I'm building a &lt;1HP monotube boiler, and I'm looking at relief valves. Obviouly the standard response is to buy one of those super expensive ASME steam relief valves that is much bigger than both my budget and my boiler. On the other hand, I see lots of smaller boilers with relief valves that are nothing more than a spring pushing a ball bearing against a pipe outlet.

I've seen a few boilers use one of those cheap air compressor relief valves. But at one source said that they had to replace it because it didn't last long in steam usage. So I'm wondering what the physical difference is between a steam rated relief valve and an air rated relief valve. Is it the expected number of usage cycles? Do they use low grade (not stainless) springs that lose strength in the heat? 

If I can make some minor modifications to an air relief valve to give it steam capabilities I will. If there is some radical difference between the two, I'm just going to go the way of a homemade relief valve. Either way, I'm not buying one of those steam rated relief valves unless someone links one that is under like $20, regardless of how much anyone screams about safety.

I was wondering if anyone had any experience regarding the benefits of using a shaft to rotate a device. Basically, I have a probe that is oriented vertically and that will be moving over a device; you can visualize this as if it were a plain and vertically oriented cylinder. If we assume the cylinder is of perfect form, I want to rotate it so that it's vertical axis will not adopt any angle during the movement. I was wondering if using a continuous rotation servo in conjunction with a shaft / bearings held any significant advantages over attaching the probe directly to the servo. I imagine the bearings would add additional constraints to the rotational motion and may increase stability, but if I use a motor with internal bearings this may be redundant / unnecessary. There will be no significant radial, axial, or torquing forces applied to the cylindrical probe, it does all of its work without making physical contact to the devices it tests.

I'm trying to set up a system that allows rotation when screws are loosened and stops all motion when screws are tightened by hand (against a load of about 80 N with a moment arm of up to about 10 cm).  I had it all built but it just won't lock.  I'm working on a redesign to increase the frictional torque by increasing the moment arm but increasing the coefficient of friction would be much, much easier.

I assume I need some sort of rubber, but I want to get the best material.

I've tried googling this but I'm not having much luck.  I was hoping I could find a nice table showing various coefficients of friction but I've got nothing except pages that assign a value to a generic rubber.  There's lots of information in engineering handbooks about REDUCING friction, but that's not what I need.

I know that softer is better and I'm currently looking at silicone rubber with a durometer hardness of 30A, the lowest I could find on the site I'm ordering from.

Alternatively, or in addition, how can I best increase static friction without adding normal force?

The reason is this: If the actuators get out of sync, then the desk will begin to tilt. If the desk tilts, then the screws that I have holding the desktop to the actuators shells will start to rip out. This is obviously not ideal even though this shouldn't happen because I have two ultrasonic sensors that are constantly leveling out the desk through its motion. I've thought of a different way to connect the two pieces, but I'm unsure of where I would get something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Z7xsuKE.jpg), or what it's even called. The idea is that if the desk started to tilt, it would just rotate about the two pins (one on each actuator shell). No screw ripping.

I know I could probably just get two U brackets and a pin and it would be the same thing, but I want to see first if there's a dedicated piece that's used for a similar task.

12,1 inch LCD for a display in front of the eye. What kind of lens do I need?,1442832672,"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=spynet+night+vision+goggles+teardown&amp;num=100

The Spynet night vision goggles - a toy - actually works.

It's got a small web-cam type camera minus the IR filter, and a 1 inch LCD panel all in a tight little module!

The toy itself is big and unwieldy, the little module fits inside a large and long case as you see in the photos.


I plan on stripping it down, and using a GoPro head strap to make a head-mounted super tiny IR night vision camera. (I don't see these online anywhere!)

My plans involves making a new case for it.        
Either by 3D printing: https://www.tinkercad.com/        
Or the soft option - a project box, and drilling the required holes for power cables, and lens.

I want the LCD panel nearly as close to the eye as possible, so I need a lens.

But I don't know what magnification I need to give someone a clear view of the screen when it's an inch away from their eye. =(

I've started looking, and imagine something like this may work... but a hunch is that it's not strong enough:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Reflector-Collimator-Optical-Glass-Degree/dp/B0136JGT8I/

The lenses that came with the toy are weak, and bring it in focus only around 4 or 5 inches away.

Please help with the theory and answer if you could!

I'll post pictures once I've boxed it up!

The reason I think I can get away without lubrication is because the system will only run for about 30-60 seconds, and then will be turned off and allowed to come to rest.

I am trying to find the resonant frequency of some inductors that are being installed in an RF compensation network. A Langmuir Probe is being inserted into a plasma that oscillates in it's voltage at the radio frequency level. this causes the probe to collect AC current and ultimately to draw an I-V characteristic curve, seen [here](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/plasma-exp/180E-W97/LprobeFullSweepC600W.gif)

However oscillating at this frequency causes the data to come out wrong, leading to more negative predictions of the plasma potential. That's where the compensation comes in. 

I'm new to circuits, but what i've read is that LRC circuits have a resonant frequency that depends on the components and occurs because EM energy is stored in capacitors and inductors. I know that these circuits are used to filter out noise and that compensation is a feedback aparatus used to control a dynamic system. 

So first, how does the compensator do that with the LRC components?

I spent the week finding the inductors that had a resonant frequency at 5 MHz and 11.7MHz (I think because that's the frequencies of the heating antennas used in the plasma). I found them by plotting the RMS voltage response versus frequency and found the frequency that made the voltage zero, as seen in the graph alongside the circuit schematic above.

Why am I trying to find the frequency that causes the voltage to drop to 0, and how does this help control the dynamic nature of the system?

My previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/32tft4/extremely_low_paying_job_but_i_need_the_experience/.

In short, I made some poor choices at the start of my career and struggled to find my first job. I'm being paid half the market rate for an engineer, but I thought it would be worth the experience to get back on track. I made the decision to stay for at least 6 months to have something I could put on my resume. They told me they would reconsider my salary when 6 months had passed, but I get the feeling that it won't change significantly.

The bigger problem is that I'm almost positive that I'm not doing actual engineering work now that I've been here a while. I spend 100% of my time in front of a computer 3D modeling. There's no mathematical analysis involved beyond basic algebra or trigonometry. I work with structural steel and sheet metal in machine design, but rather than proving something will work with math/analysis, I basically guess what sheet metal thickness I will use based on what my coworkers have used in the past. The most intensive analysis I have done so far is using rotational kinematics to estimate the amount of force I would need to push an swinging conveyor belt. I honestly believe that any person off the street could do what I do. To top it off it seems my mentors, as experienced as they are, base all of their design decisions off of past experience, which makes me uncomfortable since I went to school thinking that design work involved FEA or similar. 

On the other hand, I've designed a machine from start to finish within the first 3 months I've been there. It was a great deal of fun to me and I found that design work came very naturally to me. My coworkers are pleased with my progress but I can't shake the nagging feeling that what I'm doing isn't engineering and anybody could just pick it up and do it just as well. 

I planned on staying after 6 months if there was a salary increase to something reasonable, but if this is a dead end I'll be trying to get out ASAP. Between these doubts and my low pay, I'm really stressing about whether or not I've dug myself even deeper into the hole I'm in. I spend the majority of my days thinking about this now and I need the opinion of other engineers. 

Is this what design work really is for an engineer? Or am I just a drafter? I have nothing against drafters, it's just that I feel I may be selling myself short and working a job that won't build a career from my degree.

This week I started my first job as a graduate engineer. I expected to be started off gently, maybe helping out with little bits and stuff. But first day I just got dumped a load of papers on my desk and set away on a job about something I havent done in the best part of 2 and a bit years. A bit suprised that I wasnt eased in, I put my head down and tried to crack on but I've been struggling with it since through gritted teeth - I've been to ask the boss for help - but he ,and everyone else who can help in the office, is busy and when I did ask him about it he came across as though I should know it from University and (I'm sure he didnt mean to) it made me kind of embarrased and upset. 

The basis of the issue is a check on a steel beam outlined in the picture below

http://i.imgur.com/pmN2m46.png

The story goes that the silo above is new and replaced a smaller silo that used to sit above the stiffener highlighted. The question being raised now is 1) will the beam be ok with the new load and where it is now applied, 2) will the beam fail locally at the new point of load due to a web or flange failure etc.

Having only done really basic stuff with beam bending on my civils course where the extent we looked at was bending of a simply supported beam with a point load and udl I can just about cover the basis of the 'will it fail through bending', but the local failure due to torsion etc is a long stretch for me especially as the small amount of stuff was so long ago. I dont think it looks that hard of a problem problem, but when you take into account its my first week so I'm already overly anxious, you can understand why I'm not working efficiently or absorbing stuff. 

I get the overall concept of whats going on, its just finding the right formulas etc and what order to work through the problem that is getting to me and causing problems and ultimately bringing me down

47,Replace GFCI with standard receptacle - A few issues,1442611042,"I have a levity GFCI in my office that died a few years ago. Of note, before moving in the home inspector noted that it was a standard receptacle and suggested I have it changed to a GFCI because I planned to plug it into a computer. 
A few weeks after the GFCI died, all down stream outlets on the circuit stopped working. My electrician hooked this circuit (breaker #4) to another (breaker #3) in order to restore power (because I had failed to tell him about the dead GFCI - I know now it would have been an easy fix!). All power did return, except for that leviton GFCI. I'm pretty sure this was the culprit. 
Now I want to replace this GFCI with a standard leviton-USB receptacle. Hooking up the line black and white line wires is pretty straight forward. But what do I do with the load wires? Can I just cap them off? I'm not sure the dead GFCI is doing much now to protect any of the circuits. 
Would it be important to unhook the the connection between breaker #4 and #3 before installing a functioning receptacle? I feel like if I hook up a functioning receptacle, the circuit will be restored and and now a bunch of outlets/switches/lights will have a dual breaker supply.

I'm part of an Inspection team that deals with all kinds of parts from eletronics to machined metal and though we do well for ourselves, it's time we upgraded and/or bought some tools to help us out.

My main question is to help one member of our team that does majority of Metal parts using a Smart Scope. He doesn't have proper fixtures to hold the parts in order for the scope to get the best measurements and we think he could use better. 

**Questions**

1. What would be some good fixtures, clamps, etc. to buy with $3k that would help someone measure parts under a Smart Scope? He basically MacGyvers stuff we have to hold various parts in place to get the readings we need to make sure these parts are up to standard so it would be nice to have some official tools to help him.

I'm 21 now doing my 4th year. I was a Math major for the first 1.5 years, then switched to EE because I wanted something more hands-on. Now I'm starting to think EE isn't right for me.

If I stick to EE I will have 3 semesters left to graduate. If I switch to CS now it will take me either 3 or 4 semesters to graduate (done with all my gen eds at this point).

I've had one engineering internship so far doing microcontroller programming and PCB layout design.

In all honesty, I don't think I'd make a good electrical engineer. When it came to robotics teams I didn't know/understand shit about the electrical components and so far in every lab I've yet to learn to use the oscilloscope and function generator - I was always to guy to just take down the notes and write up the lab report. I think it's because this is all new material to me so I'm never sure if the question I want to ask is ""retarded"" or not.

In my spare time I'm mostly interested in learning new programming things, never electrical hardware or anything.

I'm expecting to work here long enough to get Chartered Engineer status but the wife and I both want to eventually move to the US long term.  Therefore I'm wondering whether I'll need to get professional engineering status in the US when I move there.  I just don't want to move there and find that my chartered engineer status isn't going to be recognized and I have to start over or something.  I've been trying to figure out as much as possible with Google but haven't found a ton of clear answers and so I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this.

According to [this abet page](http://www.abet.org/global-presence/mutual-recognition-agreements/engineering-washington-accord/is-your-program-recognized/), my degrees (both BEng and MSc) are recognized by ABET according to the Washington Accord.

Obviously things will vary state to state (and I'm unfortunately unsure where I'll end up..) but the term acceptable is very ambiguous to me.

Here are the questions I have:

* If I have chartered engineer status in the UK and 4 years of experience, would I qualify to take the FE adn PE exams right away in order to seek professional engineer status?
* Alternatively, if I took the FE exam next time I'm visiting the US and then came and worked in the UK for 4+ years, would that likely qualify as acceptable work experience in my field? Basically, would they be more likely to count the experience as acceptable if I can already claim to be an EIT?
* If it is likely best for me to take the FE exam before I start working, does it make a difference if I take it after the BEng or 1 year later when I finish the MSc?
* If I have chartered engineer status, how urgent would it be for me to get PE status when moving to the US?  Would it likely impact job prospects or salary for me to have that done before job hunting or is it something I would likely just be able to sort out once I'm already working in the US?

Just hoping someone has some experience and/or coudl shed some light on this.

81,Are there any HVAC engineers or specialists in this sub that can help me out?,1442494433,"I am designing a vacuum exhaust system that calls for ""x"" amount of vacuum pressure to be applied to a machine.

I have a theory in mind that I think would help me out, but unfortunately I do not know how to calculate the end result.

The theory I am referring to is something like a shop-vac.  If you were run a shop-vac normally with the standard hose you will get a fairly fixed amount of vacuum pressure.  But if you were to hold your hand over the end of the hose and close it off, you will increase that vacuum pressure.  My vacuum exhaust system has this same theory, but a little more complicated.

I am trying to apply vacuum to a cylinder paper machine, which uses a series of screen covered rotating cylinders to form a sheet/board of paper.  Now, because the cylinder is covered with a screen, and its main function is to grab paper fibers, the surface area of the cylinder is about is about 75% open to atmosphere.  When I apply a vacuum to this cylinder, the exhaust is pulling from this open surface area instead of the other 25%, which is always covered in paper stock.  This area of about 25%, needs to have all of the vacuum applied directly to it to help aid in the sheet formation and allow for the fibers to uniformly dispersed across the face of the rotating cylinder.

I have already designed my exhaust ducting and required flow rates, but from there how can one determine a vacuum pressure?

Assuming the 25% of the cylinder that is subject to only seeing paper, how can i numerically determine the real vacuum pressure if the cylinder was completely sealed from atmospheric pressure?

In much simpler terms (via shop-vac scenario) how can you calculate the vacuum pressure if you completely seal off the end of the vacuums hose?

89,I'm trying to design a water-fueled science fiction airship engine,1442461190,"Okay, guys! I'm working on a fantasy/sci-fi story, and I need to talk to an engineer at this point. Hopefully you can point me in the right direction. Because this is science fiction, I'm less concerned with understanding how to create something that would actually function. I'm primarily wondering how the physics works out. Once I understand that, I'm reasonably happy to create a Magical Engine Box which I can point to and say ""Oh yeah, it does that.""

Our protagonist is a female scientist flying an aircraft which studies weather. I would like the ship to take in water from the atmosphere, which is collected in interior tanks, and then convert the water into some kind energy which the ship's engines run on.

I already have the mechanisms for drawing water out of the atmosphere, but I'm having some difficulty figuring out how to get energy FROM that water. My initial thought is that the very act of splitting the hydrogen from the oxygen creates energy - but now I'm unsure. I suppose splitting a molecule is a very different thing from splitting an atom.

I've read a bit on hydrogen engines fueled by water, and the objections I find center around the fact that you gain and lose the same amount of energy when you split and then recombine the water molecule. But perhaps I'm missing something - I don't NEED water to be the byproduct of my engine. Once the molecule is split, I am fine with hydrogen and oxygen left over as waste products. Am I missing something fundamental to how a hydrogen engine works? Does it require recombining the hydrogen with the oxygen?

Of course, if anyone knows alternate energy ideas that run on water, I'd be excited to hear about that, even if it's merely theoretical at this point.",AskEngineers,Kreyl,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3l9cxk/im_trying_to_design_a_waterfueled_science_fiction/

I'm a first year engineering student so I'm pretty clueless about these things since I've only learned the concepts behind engineering. My current idea, and it could be awful, is to buy a linear ball bushing such as [this one](http://simplybearings.co.uk/shop/p690026/LM25UUAJ+Adjustable+Linear+Ball+Bushing+with+Rubber+Seals+25x40x59mm/product_info.html) and securing it within a radial ball bearing such as [this one](http://simplybearings.co.uk/shop/p6872/SKF+60082Z+Metal+Shielded+Deep+Groove+Ball+Bearing+40x68x15mm/product_info.html). Would this work? The shaft itself must be able to move as smoothly as possible, without breaking the bank. I'm thinking £60 or less (~$90 inc. shipping and UK 20% VAT). Are there any easier/cheaper/better ways to do this?

99,"Bottom of 2 year old driveway was cut into during road work, cracks appearing down entire length of driveway, city only accepting responsibility for damage on bottom half where work was performed. Untimely coincidence, or do I actually have a case?",1442445669,"I would like some professional opinions on this situation before I resort to litigation. The driveway in question is asphalt and only 2 years old. 

When they carried out the work they had to dig a massive hole at the bottom of the driveway, approx 10' x 10'x wide, and 15' deep to access the municipal water mains. The construction company agreed to repair what they damaged. A few weeks after the work was performed, in addition to the damage directly adjacent to where the hole was dug, cracks began opening up at the top of the driveway as well. They refuse to accept responsibility for the cracks that are opening at the top of the driveway, and insist that these are due faulty workmanship/environment and not the construction activity. 

The cracks fall in line perfectly with the damage at the bottom of the drive way, and any reasonable person would conclude that they are a result of the work that was done, and the massive hole they dug right next to the drive way. I'm concerned that somehow the entire base of the drive has been compromised when they did the digging as these new cracks started showing up nearly a month after the majority of the digging was completed.

I contacted the contractor that installed the driveway, but he wasn't much help. He went into instant CYA mode and cited a hundred different reasons why it could have happened, being careful to note that none were covered under warranty. Thanks guy. 

[Pictures of the construction damage and cracks are here](http://imgur.com/a/sErA0) - these pictures are nearly a month old and the cracks have since opened up wider, and have become longer. To me it seems clear that the cracks longitudinally line up nearly exactly with the cracks evident directly near the dug out area - would this not indicate that they're related?

3,What are the signs that your company is preparing to liquidize?,1442438289,"I'm getting suspicious.

Edit: The Reasons:

First, we've downsized a lot over the past year. Like from 40 people in the office and 80 techs in the field to about 15 in the office and 15 techs. People who have been with the company for a decade have been let go. I'm now the ONLY engineer on staff, and the ONLY person capable of the work required to do the projects that I'm told are supposed to be our new core business. 

Second, We're selling off almost all our inventory, which kind of makes sense, but it's something we would do to make the books look better. 

Third, We're pushing super hard to get projects signed, even ones that are likely to struggle towards the end. This seems like a way to artificially increase revenue to make us look more appealing without actually really helping the company in the long run. 

And fourth, and most important, we got a new CFO, who is seriously shaking things up. At first I thought it was good, but some of the decisions he's made and the way he went about some things make me believe he has little interest in the long term best interests of the company or anyone in it.

32,Does this math check out? (flood return period),1442295972,"&gt;But when it comes to communicating potential risk from flooding, Vogel says, return periods, widely used in hydrology, give many people a false sense of security, partly because they are often mistaken as absolutes instead of averages. Also, people can easily misconstrue the short- and long-term likelihoods of a severe event occurring. A 1 percent chance of a 100-year flood occurring in a given year, for instance, doesn’t equate to a 1 percent chance that such a flood will happen during a 100-year period. Rather, he notes, **if you calculate the actual probability, “there’s a 64 percent chance you’re going to see something bigger than that in the next 100 years.”**

Many of them have told me that if I want to actually build or help design them, I should consider electrical engineering instead. Is this necessarily true? From what I can tell from them, it seems like BME is just gathering the electrical data from cells, then a team of electrical engineers use that data to design a device that fits their needs. I really hope that isn't true, because that would kill my interest in BME.

36,Can you create or resist a mechanical force in a system without acceleration of any component in said system?,1442282967,"This is a cross-post from Askscience, where I didn't get an answer. Let's see if you guys can help me:

Can you create or resist a mechanical force in a system without acceleration of any component in said system?
Backstory: I've been arguing with another engineer friend that you can/cannot create or resist a force without accelerating something in the system. My first point was air resistance since it is proportional to velocity, but air particles are still being accelerated away from the system. An example of this is a sky diver reaching terminal velocity.
My second point was purely theoretical (I guess these all are?). A linear motor pushing a mass at a constant velocity, only overcoming the friction of a plain bearing. Assume the system is in a vacuum, so there is no air resistance. There is no gravity, but the mass is pre-loaded against the plain bearing using springs, creating the friction. None of the mechanical components are accelerating. The questions will be if the electrons ""slow-down"" at all as they run through a straight wire perpendicular to a magnetic field. I'm not as knowledgable about this level of the physics.

41,"DIY Exhaust/filtration (for weed smoke), need to know the essentials",1442268535,"Hello Engineers,

I'm a weed smoker, trying to be courteous to my roommates and keep the house from getting all treed up, especially since I have a lot of free time right now (going back to school, only have class 3 days a week) which basically means a lot of tree time.

The basic idea is to cut a sheet of cardboard to fit into my window frame and then cut out a small hole to fit a piece of tube into (Probably a paper towel roll with dryer sheets inside) and then attach some kind of electric air pump onto. I considered getting one of those small handheld fans that could fit right into the tube or something, but I feel like an actual electric pump capable of generating decent negative pressure on my side would make it more thorough and eliminate as much smoke as possible. 

I'd like to hear from some residents engineers before I decide what to buy, just based on what you know about filtration and exhaust systems. I'm talking about things like how the tube diameter will affect the vacuum pressure, as well as what a reasonable rate of airflow would be to achieve necessary suction. Also I suppose another consideration is, if I use additional filters such as dryer sheets should they be on the exhaust or the intake side for better efficiency? I'm assuming exhaust but I don't really know.

Among the pumps I could reasonably afford to order off Amazon, it would probably be of the aquarium air filtration variety or inflatable bed/pool pump variety. The aquarium pumps are typically smaller and cheaper and move around 35 - 40 liters per minute, which I feel should be totally adequate for one big hit of weed smoke. The only thing I'm worried about is that they all have tiny input/output fittings at like 5/8"" diameter and I don't see how I could possibly exhale a bong rip into a tiny hose. So even if I try to keep it all in the general area it seems that a lot of smoke will be able to diffuse relative to the volume of ambient air that will also get sucked in.

The pool/airbed pumps are not too much more expensive, but they're bigger and I imagine a bit louder although I don't really care about that. They all move like more than 400 liters a minute which I would imagine is way overkill but the part I like about them is they have larger diameter outlets. I can't find an exact measurement but let's say generally the size of a paper towel tube anyway. I feel like I could probably just blow smoke in the general vicinity of it and the intake would capture it all right away.

How far off am I? Do I know what I'm talking about? I'd love to hear back, thanks so much for your help in advance :)",AskEngineers,lighght1916,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3kysvt/diy_exhaustfiltration_for_weed_smoke_need_to_know/

The light is obviously a different color now [appears blue-ish wheras before it was orange-ish], but the real problem is that it now seems *dark*. Dark enough that I have trouble seeing, especially after going in from a sunny commute

This quote turned up the other day:
*""The original fluorescent lights provided a range of 5 to 11 foot candles of illumination in garage. The new installation provides the same level of illumination when the motion sensors detect activity in an area. When there is no activity, the lighting level ramps down after two minutes to a range of 2 to 5 foot candles, which is still well above the building code standard of 1 foot candle.""*

Is this right? It's the same nominal illumination-units, but now appears dark. Even after my eyes adjust, it's a noticeably darker experience than it was before.

What's up with all this? Is it some artefact of my eyes? A couple colleagues have mentioned they find the lighting just fine [more sensitive to that light, I'm guessing?], but most appear to agree it seems darker.

EDIT: To note, the sensors are obviously not working on one floor, so it's *very* dark there.

I'm at a point in my life (24, gettin hitched) where I need to work in ernest toward establishing a stable, long term career around which I can establish a secure family. As I look across the industrial horizon, I cannot shake the fear that, well before I am ready to retire, additive manufacturing and increased automation are going to cause a significant contraction in the CNC machining labor force. Couple this with the fact that I have noticed over the years that I have much less interest in any of the parts we make than in the machines themselves and in the dynamics of how to efficiently coordinate product flow and labor. I'm in a position to pursue more advanced training, but am unsure which route I should take. Taking into consideration pay, stress, demand and security, which would Reddit recommend?

72,I want to design a digital camera. Where do I start?,1442159558,"Howdy.

I have a concept for a novel digital camera that I want to design and build. My background is in the arts, however, and while I am technically oriented I have never studied engineering of any sort (outside of half-assed stabs at programming). I've been dreaming about this in sketches and notes since 2013 and have gotten to the point where I have to commit to this endeavor or put it aside.

That said, it occurs to me that the best way to realize my ambition may be to collaborate with others who have developed those skills, but my inclination is to create a prototype on my own or at least be able to describe it well enough that an engineer could understand me.

In a nutshell, here are the broad strokes of what I want to do:

Retrofit a Leica MDa with the guts of a compact APS-C digital camera (I would prefer to use a Sigma because I love the Foveon sensor). There are a host of problems associated with this, I know... firmware being the biggest one I can think of. 

Design a hardware based system for setting white balance. I imagine two dials on the rear of the camera, one for Blue - Yellow and one for Green / Magenta. The settings from those dials would have to be recorded in the metadata of the RAW file. Firmware again.

I want to create a readout that allows the user to see the color s/he has dialed in by shining colored light onto a neutral gray panel recessed in the camera body. The Leica MDa, since it was designed without a viewfinder, has plenty of room for this. The purpose of this design is to provide the user a method for quickly and accurately capturing his or her impression of color. It's important that the feedback from the camera be in the form of reflected light (as opposed to emitted light) because that's how we perceive light and color in the scene which we are photographing. Naturally this same window could be used to provide feedback on exposure. 

Aside from this window of colored light, the camera would not have a screen or viewfinder. One would have to rely on their mind's eye and an understanding of the lens in order to focus and compose. This is perhaps the most important aspect of the design: my intention is to create a camera that allows a user to stay fully engaged in the flow of time. Not only that, but that also demands an intuitive understanding of space - one would have to learn how to judge distance and field of view rather than relying on focus and compositional aids.

The experience I want to create for a user of this camera is one of a poetic, emotional, impressionistic approach to the act of photography. Once one masters the camera it will be possible to capture images that are technically superb and true to the unique perception of the user. 

TL;DR: I want to stuff a modern digital camera into a Leica MDa and develop a novel hardware / firmware interface.

I'm looking for some guidance and resources. What would help me to understand the hardware I will be working with? How about the firmware?

I'm starting my career, and have two offers.

One for an awesome company, great vacation, benefits, culture (social events), etc. I think the job will probably be somewhat boring though, as it would be entirely documentation (but I would learn a lot).

The second for a decent company, okay benefits, okay culture, but with lots of stress and overtime. The job itself sounds really interesting, though, as I'd wear multiple hats in design and test.

I am, or at least was, a student studying towards a degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Sheffield (relatively good British university), however I failed at the end of second year and only have 2/3rds of the credits required to pass though to my third and final year.

At this point I'm just looking for some advice on where to go from here. Should I try to complete my degree by perhaps repeating a year or moving to a different university. Should I stop with higher education and start applying to jobs, in which case what kind of jobs should I be applying to and what sort of salary should I be willing to accept.

My practical skills and teamwork skills are excellent and I'm most comfortable when working hands on or with projects in a group. Unfortunately I had very little opportunity to exercise these skills during my studies which were heavily focused on theory and analytic skills, things I find it very difficult to engage with.

86,A mechanism to drive differing outputs based on input rotation?,1442091756,"Hey,

I've been poking around inside an old ""robotic"" toy (along the lines of a Furby, but older and less sophisticated), and one of the more interesting things about it is that while it can perform multiple different actions, it is all driven by a single motor.

So if the motor is driven one way, it rotates output shaft A and performs action A, but if the polarity of the motor is reversed, A is stationary and B rotates.  It seems like there's some degree of locking of the non-rotating output when driven, but I haven't forced the output sides very hard.

I'm sure there must be a variety of different ways to achieve this sort of rotation-dependent output splitting, but unfortunately the guts are in a sealed plastic gearbox that I doubt I can open without permanent damage.

The obvious solution I came up with would be a pair of opposing ratchet-type drives, so for a given direction, one slips and the other drives the output, but I'd expect some amount of noise from the pawls if that were the case.

Is there maybe some other form of directional clutch or cunning design that could be used here? I'm much more interested in *possible* ways of doing it, rather than the precise method used in this toy (which is almost certainly just the cheapest).

For bonus points, is there any way you could multiplex more than 2 output shafts for a single bidirectional input?

I have many years of hands-on machining experience and I know how to run lathes, mills, CNC's, bridgeports, etc. I absolutely loved it. I loved working in the machine shop. My time in machining was before and during school, but my senior year I ended up taking a job in MEP (HVAC and plumbing design). This is a totally different branch of engineering.

Back before school I really thought that spending time in the machine shop would really help me out after school insofar as getting a job that I enjoy. I just can't make myself enjoy MEP. I don't like the constant overtime, disrespectful emails and phone calls from contractors, mundane/tedious drafting all day, and I don't like that I'm not being challenged.

To update. I just accepted the new role. I have more concerns over the market right now, and I cant afford to be unemployed for 6 months. I did however talk to my recruiter about how unhappy I was with the unprofessionalism. They sent a lengthy response that they were not aware of a change until recently, and that I was intended to go into product development, but unfortunately I am not on the budget for them at this moment. This somewhat confused me as Im a new hire, and really cheap. Could be a lie, but it is somewhat comforting.

My old managers and coworkers tracked me down. I explained my situation and they were upset that I was in manufacturing after helping with such a high-profile project, but they said that there were alot (4/5 ME's) of new hires were transferred or let go.

In fact I only recognize one other intern. Our projects were both successful. He was put into a more technical role, but hes a MechE, and I am a EE. 

Nonetheless my old mentor offered to mentor me still, and offered more technical projects to me (in my free time) so I can build technical skills as well as prestige in the company. He was promoted to a managerial position when I was in uni.

Nonetheless, it was really refreshing to see my old managers and coworkers, they were trying to look at the bright side of things. We planned lunches.

I looked into policies. I will be eligible for transfer after 1 year. But considering that I will be the only ME for that tool, means I will probably be stuck there for a while, so I may have to find a new job at that point. I would be okay with this if this job was a good fit for me. But it doesn't line up with my interests, nor personality. But I will give it my 100%, as my old role was that important to me, and I don't want to jeopardize that possibility.

Building foundations are not generally damp-proofed here.

I was thinking of having a differential gear system and use brakes to slow down one side whilst the other spins  at whatever power setting.

First, some background
I'm studying mechanical engineering with a focus in robotics as an undergrad and I have 4 workgroups to choose from for a one year project

1. Working on hardware and software in order to make a pre-built social robot recognize and incite laughter

2. Control an inverted single pendulum mobile robot with ROS

3. Control an inverted single pendulum mobile robot through a smart device

4. Creating an educational kit on mechanics and electronics for use in tertiary education

I've recently read up on the ROS and I'm very interested in it's supposed flexibility and widespread usage. What I'd like to know is whether it's really as popular as claimed and whether it might be too much for an undergraduate student to learn in a year. Should I stick to Visual C and cloud computing which is what the 3rd project will be using.

I'm also interested in the other projects but my main concern is with the applicability of the ROS in the future. I only know so much about it as an undergrad and I'm hoping some people can shed more light on it. Or should I take the chance to learn as much about hardware as possible with the first project?

The ones that came from the factory had rusted down to the point where the excess bolt sticking out from the nut had rusted down from 10mm to maybe 1-2mm(it took ~10 years), and had to be cut out with a torch and air hammer.  The ones I replaced it with are already to the point where I doubt I can reuse them 3 years later.  I'm looking for something that is moderately cost-effective(I need to buy 4 of these, and the Inconel ones were $20/each when I got them, I'd like to keep the cost below $100) and would hopefully last 5+ years before it needs to be replaced.  These bolts are exposed to anything that is on the road(water, salt, sand, etc), as well as large temperature swings(I don't know for sure but 500-600F is probably a safe bet), and are going to be in constant contact with steel.  In the format of an M10x40 bolt, it needs to be able to hold 30Nm (22 ft-lb) indefinitely.  A nut that can survive the environment and not seize to the bolt would also be nice, as the stock ones are copper, or possibly copper-plated steel, and they also corrode like crazy.

My hot tub is on the fritz and I've gotten to the point where I need some help before I move forward.  I went to the local hot tub store to run some ideas past them, but they were only interested in sending someone out to look at it ($100 just to get them to come to your house).  Any help beating the hot tub techs would be immensely appreciated.

The imgur album linked below has some pictures of what I've tested so far.  To sum it up, my temperature controller seems to be working correctly and the temperature readout is also correct, but the heater runs constantly until it gets to about 112 degrees and starts flashing OH and shuts the shit down.  

http://imgur.com/a/eIesT

One other thing I've tried which isn't mentioned in the album is to remove the filter and let the system run.  A clogged filter could slow down the flow rate and cause waste heat from the pump to overheat the water (from what I've read).  The problem persists even without the filter in place and I've also cleaned the shit out of the filter to no avail.

UPDATE:

So today I went out and checked across the contacts of the suspect relay (K2) and it was open, as it's supposed to be.  I went ahead and powered on the tub and checked the voltage on the heater terminals when the Heater Indicator LED was on...240V, just like it's supposed to be.  Checked again after I lowered the setpoint and the LED went off...still 240V.  This time I tapped the relay with the back of my screw driver and lo and behold, 0V.  I repeated this test several times and it did it every time.  So now I have a replacement relay on the way and HOPEFULLY I'll have a working hot tub by this weekend.

Tomorrow they are asking me to sign a new offer letter with my new role... Basically I am hearing the current job climate is utter shit. I have bills. Lets hope in 6 months I can find a better job. Its a shame because I loved my previous role. Best job I think I will ever have.


Essentially what happened was I worked as an intern doing design work for my internship last year. I loved it. Best internship I had. I decided to accept an offer despite a mediocre salary due to the potential experience I would gain. I waited months, and due to market conditions, my employment was delayed. Nonetheless, when I went to my first day, I found out that I was put into manufacturing, instead of design. I was very upset and confused. When I signed my offer letter ( did it twice mind you ) I made sure they did not change my assignment. So I was under the impression until today that I was in design.

I just graduated uni with my BSEE.. I wanted a technical job. This job seems more like middlework lean six sigma work. I am extremely worried that if I stick to this job, I wont be able to market myself back into a technical career.

When I brought up that I was upset, they told me that was how they do things. They just put employees where they need. Thats fine, but this is a career defining job. If my only experience on my resume is manufacturing engineering, and I want to go work for product development, I would be at a disadvantage. 

I do not find the work exciting whatsoever. In fact I had something somewhat similar for my first internship and thats why I knew to avoid it. 

What are my options? Would it be acceptable to leave so early? I like the company, but not my role. It seems this is not a permanent role, but im not sure if I want to devote 3+ years of my life in the hopes of getting the role I was originally guaranteed.The job market here is not the best due to downturns, however, I just dont know if I can continue to be miserable for 3+ years

I input some step inputs into the motor to get it's dynamic model. Obviously it wasn't incredibly accurate as there are a bunch of non-linearities I'm not accounting for. 

But one thing I've noticed in operation (and thinking back, in the data too) is that there seems to be some directional asymmetry in torque on both motors. I set up a position controller using the arduino and found that it would consistently overshoot or undershoot in one direction or the other. Also when in operation, when the robot leans to one side it can stabilize itself, but leaning the other side it seems to react a bit slower and doesn't generate enough torque to right itself.

I plan to get current readings soon so that I can update my model, but for now I'll have to live with voltage input, encoder output and velocity estimation.

98,Can we cool the planet with space dust,1441508228,"Recently I read an old magazine article about the space mirror. It’s a proposed Geo engineering solution to climate change, involving a giant mirror that is balanced between the earth and the sun at lagrangian point L1. It’s been dismissed as too expensive and difficult but it gave me a similar idea that seems far more practical.

Instead of a mirror, imagine a stream of moon particles, shot from L1 towards the Sun. It seems like it would be possible (with the right sized particles shot in the right direction at the right speed) to suspend these particles between the Earth and Sun for a significant amount of time by balancing them between the push of the solar winds and the pull of the Suns gravity.

To get the moon material to L1, imagine a continuous supply of small vessels being launched from the moon by a rail gun and rocket power. Within the vessels, a pay load of moon material processed into pellets that can be fed into a small gun at the nose of the vessel. As the vessel nears L1, it starts shooting the pellets, one by one until they are all free of the vessel and flying in a nice neat line towards L1.

Once the pellets reach L1, they crash into a catcher craft that is parked there. The great advantage of crashing pellets into a catcher craft is the free or near free deceleration. If the pellets were impacting along the line between earth and sun, then it would be a simple matter of bringing the catcher craft a little closer to the earth while the collision forces push it away. If the pellets must come in at an angle, it might be possible to hit the catcher from opposite angles and get the same free deceleration effect.

I feel like it could be done several ways, but 2 ideas seem to come to mind.  

1. A conversion of the petrol motor to an electric motor that controls the already present drivetrain. 
2. Servo motors at each wheel that are controlled by an ecu.

I don't think an all-around conversion kit could be likely as all types of cars have different torque requirements, but trying to make a kit for something like a sixth generation Honda Civic would be a good way to do some trial and error on what will and will not work.  I could be wrong, but it seems like a possibility.  ",AskEngineers,icanhasreclaims,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3jrqwo/what_are_some_of_the_technical_issues_faced_in/
2,"Overturning Moment &amp; Anchor Bolt Tension Force - 6 Methods, 6 Different Solutions - Which Is Correct?",1441472529,"Last week, we were tasked to check the acceptability of some anchor bolts securing a piece of equipment to a foundation due to overturning moment.  It seemed a simple problem, until we ended up with 6 different methods all giving different solutions.  I've idealized the situation below to make the math easy, but I'd really love to find out which way is most acceptable.

Setup:  15"" x 10"" steel foundation with 8 bolts.  The bolts are arranged into two rows along the long axis - 4 bolts on each side spaced 3"" apart.  The CG of the equipment is right in the center of the bolt group and 4"" above the bolt interface.  Here is a quick CAD drawing of the setup:  [FDN &amp; EQPT](http://i.imgur.com/DwRnSjn.png).

Method 1:  It was suggested to just create a couple and test the outermost bolts.  If the outermost bolts pass, then all bolts pass because this method is very conservative.

* Pe/nd = 10k * 4"" / 2 bolts * 9"" = **2.2k / bolt**

This method didn't meet acceptability.

Method 2:  It was then suggested to imagine the couple distance to be measured between the tension bolt group centroid and the compression bolt group centroid.  So, same method, but now we have 4 bolts in tension and compression on each side.

* Pe/nd = 10k * 4"" / 4 bolts * 6"" = **2.0k / bolt**

This method also did not meet acceptability.

Method 3:  M/S will gives stress.  Calculating Ixx, assuming 1/4"" bolts, Abt = 0.031 in^2 :

* Ixx = 4 * 0.031 in^2 ((1.5"")^2 + (4.5"")^2) = 2.79 in^4
* Sx = 2.79 in^4 / 4.5 in = 0.62 in^3
* Tensile stress per bolt = Pe/nS = 10k * 4""  / 2 bolts * 0.62 in^3 = 32.3ksi / bolt
* Tensile force per bolt = σAbt = 32.3ksi * 0.031 in^2 = **1.0k / bolt**

This did not meet acceptability, either!

Method 4:  On a whim, I decided to idealize the foundation as a beam with 4 pin supports.  The reactions of the pin supports should be the tensile force in each bolt plane.  Using a skyciv.com, I placed an applied moment of Pe = 10k * 4"" = 40k-in at midspan and pin supports as indicated in the drawing.  The [solution shown here](http://i.imgur.com/dPyJG0M.png) indicates the the innermost bolts will have the most tension force ±16.7k and the outermost bolts will have a tension force of ±1.1k.  Dividing the force by the number of bolts in the plane means the innermost bolts have a tensile force of **8.4k / bolt**.  This method didn't meet acceptability by far and I'm pretty sure, based on the reaction directions, this method is fundamentally flawed somehow.

Method 5:  The head engineer, tired of our incompetence, said, ""it doesn't rotate about the midpoint, it rotates about the edge!""  So, we did a neutral axis calculation and found the tension force assuming all 8 bolts are in tension.

* 2 * 0.003in^2 * ((3""-x) + (6""-x) + (9""-x) + (12""-x)) - 10"" * x * x/2 = 0
* x = 0.19""
* Ixx = 2 * 0.031 in^2 ((2.81"")^2 + (5.81"")^2 + (8.81"")^2 + (11.81"")^2 ) - 10"" * 0.19"" * (0.19"" / 2)^2 = 16.0 in^4
* Sx = 16.0 in^4 / 11.81"" = 1.4 in^3
* Tensile stress per bolt = Pe/nS = 10k * 4""  / 2 bolts * 1.4 in^3 = 14.3ksi / bolt
* Tensile force per bolt = σAbt = 14.3 ksi * 0.031 in^2 = **0.4k / bolt**

This **PASSED** acceptability.  This is what we went with for the check.

Method 6:  Later, I was researching this mess on my own and I found yet another method from (the message board claimed was) the ACI code.

* (Pe - righting moment) / nB = (10k * 4"" - 0.1k * 7.5 in) / 8 bolts * 15"" = **0.3k / bolt**.

This *really* passes for acceptability.  I showed my boss this method and he pointed out that they're just taking a generous couple distance and applying it to all bolts - a really non-conservative approach.

So, which method is right?  Is there a preferred method?  Is there a reference in the steel manual someone can point out?  Why is the alleged ACI method so non-conservative?  I'd appreciate any help or guidance on this matter.

4,Just finished my BS in EE. Have an interview for a technical writing position.

5,"Semi Crazy Question about Linear Motors, Racing Cars and Non-Newtonian Fluids",1441450377,"So I have a bit of a strange problem/idea. I'm thinking about building a moving platform for a driving simulator but my approach is very different to what I see is normally done and possibly a bit unrealistic.

A TL;DR - Can a spring system be the **opposite** of your normal non-newtonian fluids? (eg. cornstarch and water)

From a uni project I've had to learn a lot about linear motors and the context that I was looking at them for required really precise and fast control. The kind that suited that situation was the [moving stator kind](http://shop.linmot.com/E/ag1000.37.065/linear-motors-p01-37/stators-ps01-37x60/ps01-37sx60-hp-n-agi.htm). 

Sim racing cockpits seem to be all about the big movements I assume they'd be using systems that would not allow very precise movements. I find that the tiny little movements are 90% of the road feeling when driving so I want to go the other way so I can feel vibrations. (I'm assuming that the games like rfactor 2 will give such detail, maybe not though)

The problem with moving stator linear motors (apart from cost) is that there is no static resistance and very poor static force (eg. it gives only high freq movements). I want up and down movement with a static middle (holding my weight) so this is a problem.

The solution I'm thinking is maybe I could get longer shafts for the linear motors and have the cockpit suspended on some hydraulic cylinders or springs. The Linear motor will then not have to battle a constant force of the driver's weight and can reset to a new zero value for each driver. The linear motors will now only have to go against inertia and the spring constant of the hydraulics/spring.

My main question is that because those linear motors are expensive buggers would it be possible to reduce the effect the hydraulics/springs have on the linear motor whilst still effectively suspending the seat. The way I imagine doing this requires a spring system that's pretty much the opposite to cornstarch and water, allowing sudden changes in force to have effect but constant forces to be opposed. Can this be done cheaply and is this even possible??? Or maybe would Pneumatics be good?

One of the employees asked 
&gt;why do we have smart phones that have improved very quickly in recent years while cars have only gotten a little better over the last  100yrs. (Better as in miles to the gallon)

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm not someone who knows the answer to this. But I do know:

1. This is a question of comparing two different techonlogies that came out of two different eras and 
2. I think its pretty rude to say that cars have improved very little over 100yrs. (have you seen a model T?)

&amp;nbsp;

 He continued on this idea with cars have not improved to give 100's of miles to the gallon because oil companies have stopped progression..

&amp;nbsp;

Now my question is this. Has their ever been a better engineered car engine, that was not used? If not, why can't we get 100's of miles to the gallon?

All I know is you can only get so much energy out of a combustion engine because most of it turns into heat.

12,How to put even clamping force on an octagon?,1441386399,"Hi everybody. I'm making a pair of clamping rings that are meant to hold an octagonal sheet of plastic to an octagonal piece of glass.

In one arrangement (the first) I have the corner holes slightly inset to be the same distance from the corner as the other holes are from the edge. In the second arrangement, I have all the holes lined up, which makes the corners slightly farther away from the corner hole than the edges are from the edge holes. Which would be best to put the *most* even amount of pressure around the blue/red octagon? Is it negligible?

It is a pretty (otherwise) airtight Vocal recording booth with a simple plenum/ventilation system that makes it not as airtight as every other edge, corner and crack which has been treated with soundproofed silicone and double doors with rubber and weather stripping.
Interior dimensions of the box are 183.4 cm x 143.4cm x 193.4cm (6 x 4.7 x 6.4 feet) which using the CO2 build up equation from http://kimberlymoynahan.com/2012/04/friday-fiction-facts-trapped-in-an-airtight-room/ gives 3.17 hours before a human would suffer damage using 3% as the highest safe limit. 
However there are two 100mm (4"") holes in the box about 1m (3 feet) apart, Each hole has 3.8m (12.5') of 100mm (4"") flex duct that is snaked/bent so it looks like a high frequency wave on the outside of the box.

And I know the ducting and curves effect airflow, but this seems to be more about diffusion than anything to do with actual ventilation.

There is good background data here:
http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA299145

I would assume the interior of the booth to be at least 10 degrees Celsius warmer than the outside of the booth due to body heat and respiration, and for the sake of argument let’s assume the walls are totally impermeable even though strictly speaking they are not.

Some form of equation where the size of the room and the surface area of the ventilation are two variables to easily change would be good in case anyone else ever wants to know something similar. it's actually kind of weird to not be able to find all this information in one place, you'd think in the history of humans building rooms and humans keeping creatures in boxes with airholes that some kind of surface area of ventilation to room size to mammal size equation would be out there.

I will Paypal or otherwise buy a gift of equal value (inclusive of postage) to whoever the subreddit selects as the winner. 

EDIT Assume the person is breathing in the middle of the room not with their mouth against the vent. The room is pitch black and they can't see the vents or know to breathe through them if they felt them. The issue is average co2 diffusion in the room not utilising the room in the most efficient manner.

26,Drywall dust + shopvac + homemade oil bath filter = reasonable?,1441310898,"I've toyed with the idea of making a (very crude) oil bath filter to tuck inside my 10 gallon shop vac for the sole purpose of preserving both paper filter life and suction consistency when sanding drywall.  I'm not a professional, so the solution would not get 9-5 use; this is weekend warrior fodder.  Is there any reason this wouldn't work as well as I hope?

The interior dimensions of the box are 183.4 cm x 143.4cm x 193.4cm (6 x 4.7 x 6.4 feet) which using the CO2 build up equation from http://kimberlymoynahan.com/2012/04/friday-fiction-facts-trapped-in-an-airtight-room/ gives 3.17 hours before a human would suffer damage.
There are two 100mm (4"") holes in the box about 1m (3 feet) apart, Each hole has 3.8m (12.5') of 100mm (4"") flex duct that is snaked/bent so it looks like a high frequency wave on the outside of the box. I suppose they are like two giant bendy snorkels.
So my question is.. what do these two 100mm x 3.8m (4"" x 12.5') snorkels do to the 3.17hrs a human can spend in the box? I have no real concept of what additional pressure the tubes add to the holes or what rate of ""osmosis"" the co2 would have to the outside of the box.

42,Can I make a sapphire or am I crazy?,1441247415,"So I have had this crazy dream of making my own sapphire/ruby crystal. I've read various methods for this including the Verneuil process, although after researching more, it seems like the [Czochralski process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czochralski_process) would be simpler and safer (since I don't need hydrogen and oxygen gas).

Basically the idea is to have a crucible (probably tungsten) containing Aluminum Oxide (corundum), heat it past the melting point of a sapphire (about 2000 C) and lower a slowly rotating seed crystal into the molten liquid.

I was thinking that I could heat the crucible using an induction heating element (something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KJD6IKZ.gif)). The entire thing would be done inside a vacuum chamber with a low-pressure inert atmosphere. Heating to the required temperatures will probably be quite hard because there aren't too many refractory materials that will work at those temperatures. By my research, I think purified graphite is probably the best bet (which is unfortunate since it would burn, but that shouldn't happen with an inert atmosphere).

At lower pressures, I think the main source of heat loss will be radiative. This will be pretty rapid at these temperatures, but by my calculations, I think I can reach the required temperatures for a small amount of material with a reasonably sized induction element, assuming I have reflective materials on the inside of my chamber (so the radiated energy is reflected back).

I know from reading that people have made this work. But my question is whether I'm insane to think this could be done as a DIY project. Is there anything I'm missing in my planning here?

Or is it maybe even that cobblestone does get maintenance, it just maybe isn't as obvious to the naked eye as the cut sections and tarring that asphalt roads get?

I need to put a sensor inside a pneumatic device. There are 3 signal wires that need to come out. It is possible to drill a hole, but I have no idea how to seal it. It needs to withstand 8bar (116 PSI) of pressure, and whatever the solution, it needs to be tiny. Think 2mm diameter for the hole, and the sensor kinda sits right on top of it on the inside.

I thought about some sort of glue, but I have no idea what type. It should bond well with the metal surface and the silicone wire, and be strong enough to withstand the pressure. I'm pretty sure something like this exists, I just don't know what it's called, and I can't just go and use some generic hot glue, a failure would be quite devastating.

We are working on a hybrid rocket and are in a testing phase. We are suppose to test a 10 feet long tank that will hold liquid nitrous oxide at 750 psi. I contacted a hydro testing company, but they said they won't touch anything that doesn't have a DOT number and a manufacturer's name on the tank. So, I tried looking for a hydro testing pump near by, but they only go up to 1000 psi. We want to test the tank at 1500 psi so we can have a FOS of 2. Another option we had was to fill the tank with water and use an inert gas like argon to raise the pressure. Issue with that is our teachers are not comfortable with us going that route. And now our next option is to use a pressure washer, since we don't care how much water we are pumping in. I am a little concerned about overheating the pressure washer, since we will need to hold the pressure at 1500 psi for a certain period to verify that the tank won't blow when liquid nitrous is poured into it. What do you guys think about it? I would feel alot better if we can have it done from a professional, but if that doesn't work, then we will construct our own rig to get this done.

1. One often-cited fact is that the reason that water towers are so high is that each additional foot of height means an additional x pounds of water pressure. But considering all the pathways this water must go through to make it to a sink or hose or whatever, isn't a lot of water pressure lost along the way, rendering the little extra pounds of pressure moot?

2. Those towers with the tiny center section and the massive tank on top like [this](http://www.painesville.com/vertical/Sites/%7B66FDE066-2B9A-43E2-8DFC-2129003D50A7%7D/uploads/%7B38B9C02A-7200-462F-9672-CA86E060166B%7D.JPG), how do they stay up?

It was designed with a small adjustment mechanism that relies on a spring to apply pressure to a fulcrum that rotates the entire laser.  A screw is used to apply and release pressure on the spring thus moving the laser very small amounts left and right.

I am getting a drift in the lasers horizontal position of about 1/2inch at 100 feet over the course of several hours.  I am doing this test at night and there is about a 15 degree Fahrenheit temperature from when I start the test to when it is complete.  

I made a Sketch-Up model of the device and determined that 5 micron change in position (at the end of the fulcrum) is all it would take to move the laser 1/2 inch at 100ft.

My question is it possible that my spring is expanding and contracting 5 microns with a 15 degree ( Fahrenheit ) temperature change?

I want to be able to have a rechargeable battery running the circuit,  and when the battery voltage drops too it's minimum safe level,  the generator/alternator will start turning (solenoid output).  

This will power a battery charging circuit to top up the battery and when the battery is full,  the generator will turn off until required.  

Best scenario I'd to have a high capacity battery so that the generator doesn't often need to come on.  


Does anyone have any recommendations for A,  the best kind of battery for this application 
And B,  does anyone know of any existing circuits which would fit or I can modify to work in this way.  

Thanks

62,[non-industrial batteries] Clear some myths about Batteries?,1440685609,"Can you guys clear up some myths for me regarding batteries (not the gigantic Industrial kind, just the commercial kind).

1. Is it true that keeping batteries cold or below freezing will improve their efficiency?
2. Exposure to salinity (i.e. salty air at the beach or ocean) is bad.
3. Rechargeable batteries should NEVER be allowed to reach 0% capacitance. 
4. There's no such thing as ""topping off"" a battery (i.e. recharging a battery at 98% makes no difference).
5. the 'acid' leaking from a battery is not strong enough to melt flesh.

I look at cities like New York, Manhattan especially, where there are dozens of enormous skyscrapers on the very edge of the ocean, all concentrated into a tiny area. There is a lot of mass in those buildings all crammed into one spot. In my youth I wondered why they weren't pushing the island further downward, the surface that is, thus causing the water level to relatively rise.

Eventually I realized that the foundations for these buildings is likely all the way to the bedrock so the soil itself isn't bearing the weight. However my question now is that wouldn't this incredible mass still move the bedrock, even slightly? Or is the bedrock far too rigid for any significant lowering of the land?",AskEngineers,grigby,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3illl0/does_the_weight_of_massive_cities_push_down_the/

Is it worth it to change my major and focus in this specific area or should I stick with the plan and graduade in electrical engineering?

66,How do I deal with downtime in a manufacturing plant?,1440676664,"I should preface by saying that I'm a new hire at this plant. We're a 350k square ft. sized transmission mfg. plant with about 700 employees with die casting, machining and assembly all done in house. Everyone is busy and nobody has time to keep tabs on what the engineers are doing,

I have been here for about 5 months, got hired in as a mfg. quality engineer, with an emphasis on setting up new projects based on my previous experience as a development engineer. I've run into this issue where I'm finding myself with a LOT of free time at work. After training for a month or so, I got sent to get trained on Faro Arm/Polyworks for a week after which I spent about 2 weeks setting up the software and processes. Now that I'm done, I literally have nothing to do. I initially quoted a much longer time to set everything up so I may be at fault here. 

My issue is that nobody seems to particularly care about what I'm doing or giving me something to do. I have a long term project setting up an automated leak tester but unfortunately my boss hasn't followed up with me on it since we last talked about it (he promised to get me drawings and information from HQ, we're a major automotive company and I'm kind of forced to implement hand me downs from our parent plants most of the time). He also had to take two weeks off when he was in the hospital for a heart condition, probably from the stress of being PM for 6 years straight. I feel really bad hassling him about giving me something to do all the time.


Should I just take the extra initiative and keep asking for work to do until I finally have something? I've tried doing this before mind you, and even suggested that I was a bit bored and hoping to work on something.  A different manager took pity on me and gave me a few things to do, but none of these tasks were challenging and I accomplished what they asked from me way before their deadlines. Now, my work days just involve sitting on reddit and walking around the plant trying to somehow make it to the end of the day and it's slowly killing me inside. 


We get paid 1.5x straight overtime for any hours above 40, and most of the engineers work about 10-15 hours overtime every week. Except me, I jump out when my day is over because there really isn't any point in staying around getting paid overtime to do nothing. I've also noticed some snide remarks about how I disappear when the clock strikes 3. (I work 6:30 AM- 3PM)


If there are any seasoned project managers or engineers facing the same issue, please let me know the best way to proceed in this situation. I don't want to come off as ""that"" guy who's a try hard and end up getting taught a lesson or being given a project that's way over my head and fail.

edit: I should also mention that though my official title is ""quality"" engineer, I'm not very much involved in the day to day q.c activities. We have two other quality engineers in my department who handle everything from maintaining the DCMs to signing off on check sheets. I personally wouldn't mind being more involved in day to day, and I've been trained on it, but the two engineers would rather not have me involved and I'm not entirely sure why.",AskEngineers,countermeasurebyCOB,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3il74j/how_do_i_deal_with_downtime_in_a_manufacturing/
67,How to follow-up with online applications at engineering companies?,1440661191,"Hi guys,

I'm a recent graduate and have been applying to jobs online for a few weeks with little response back (a few no thank yous). I was wondering what more I can do to follow up and help me stand out. I feel like all my online applications are going into a black hole. Should I just email their general HR asking for updates? I can't seem to find emails for specific people that work in HR. Would it be appropriate to message an engineer on LinkedIn who works at that office?

I am working my best to network and potentially get interviews at companies where I have friends, but the two current leads I have won't have open positions for at least two months, so I want to search in the meantime. There will also be an engineering career fair I can go to in two months.

Side question: I have a BS in Electrical Engineering, did an internship in the power industry for almost two years, and have got a lot of chemistry research/lab experience (I have minors in chemistry and math). Would it look negative if I took a position not in my major (Software engineering at a semiconductor firm, equipment engineer, engineering technician etc.) with regards to career advancement and salary? I want to go into electronic materials R&amp;D, so I'm thinking if I get an engineering job at a company that focuses on that, maybe I can work my way up when position become available if they aren't currently? 

I'm looking for jobs in the Portland, OR area if that makes any difference.

2,"I Have a Degree, I Hate It. What Do I Do Now?",1440539337,"I graduated in December of 2014 with a degree in [Radiological Health Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/nuclear/academics/degrees/rhen). The original plan when I started my degree was to become either an health or medical physicist. While attending school I began to realize it wasn't for me. Now I believe I have a very specific degree and have dug myself a hole that I cannot get out of. My interest for my degree came from wanting to build things and to be able to help people. 

Since post graduation I have found myself very depressed because I feel lost. I want to get into a different field but having the hardest time doing that. One reason is that because I don't know what I want to do now. While in college I found that I have a knack of leading projects, I was in multiple organizations and held leadership roles in each. I have been told by many people that I have great personal skills. I thrive in high energy environments, mostly because it's difficult for me to focus on one thing for a long period of time. 

Are there any suggestions that you all may have for a career path to look into? I have gained interest in energy engineering, environmental engineering, project engineering, start-ups and careers that have nothing to with engineering such as management, marketing, and business. I am completely lost with absolutely no direction.

Any advice or help is greatly appreciated.

12,Should I walk away from a promising career to get a Masters degree in a slightly different field?,1440508765,"I just started work as a controls engineer for a consumer products company about 3 months ago. Through college I was always very interested in robotics and motion control, and in my final year was introduced to machine learning and intelligent systems (graduated with BSME, did discrete event simulations during internships).

My controls job is fine, still heavily in the OJT phase for controlling chemicals processing equipment, but I'm realizing that pumps and valves are not the same as robotic actuators and other 'cool stuff'. The job has great pay with lots of room to grow in the company and potentially move to other more interesting areas.

Here's the complicating factor- my wife of a couple months really wants to go back to graduate school to get a PhD, and there are no good options for her nearby or anywhere my company could send me. We brought up the option of us both going to grad school together, she'd get her PhD in her field, and I would go for my master's in Robotics and /or intelligent systems. This way we could apply to schools in the same area and do the grad school experience at the same time, as opposed to living separated for the entirety of her degree and have her try to find a job afterwards in the same city as me. 

My dilemma is that while returning to school would open much bigger doors into the robotics controls world and potentially relieve stress on my marriage, it would mean sacrificing my challenging, stable, but not terribly 'cool' job. 

My other concern is that jobs in the field I want may not be as plentiful or as exciting as I'm imagining, unless I find work with a tech startup or something, but then the salary wouldn't be the same as where I am now.

I've had a pretty good run in my role. Worked on projects, local and worldwide, both large and small, worth millions of dollars or less(and sold a few) .
Even worked as an expatriate(in the US) for more than a year.

Now I'm back home and I'm beginning to have a quarter life crisis. I took the first interesting job I got out of college. I work in an MNC and don't really like the corporate culture in my country (I felt that the US was much better in this regard). I also don't particularly like the field I'm in and the career path ahead doesn't look too promising. I don't want to become my boss. I loathe the long commute to work where I feel like I'm wasting my life away in traffic.

I love working on the technical and customer oriented part of my job and I feel like I've gained a lot of valuable skills.

I've always been a bit of a science buff (that's why I became an engineer) and love reading about the stuff going on in the frontiers of science - especially in the fields of energy and space.

Back to my question: Have any of you been in a similar situation? I guess I'm a bit burned out by corporate and want to get in touch with my passions again. I already have plans of applying to grad school in the US or Europe. I plan on quitting my physically and emotionally draining job to take a career break and in the meantime figure out what I want to do and where I want to go.

Have you had success in getting into research after working in the industry for a while? I know that the flow usually goes in the opposite direction. Does (unrelated) experience count in a grad school application?

32,Do you learn new material or do 'work' after work? How do you motivate yourself?,1440439033,"I've heard from more than one engineer and entrepreneur that in order to be really successful, you have to develop additional skills and knowledge at night after work and on weekends; i.e. after your 7-5 job, go home and do what is essentially more work — whether it's building something, taking an online class, learning how to code, or reading/learning advanced material.

**My personal example:** I'm not happy with my current job so I'm looking to move into the space sector, where I've always wanted to be. To do so I started learning Python, started an online class from Stanford ([EE263: Intro to Linear Dynamical Systems](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee263/lectures.html)), *and* started learning STK 10 (software for guidance &amp; nav simulations).

All of this began when I looked at the job postings in the space industry that I wanted to apply for, and realized that I'm horribly unqualified even for entry-level positions. I don't do any of these things at my actual job so my current skills aren't 100% transferable. They're not even 50% transferable.

In other words, I'm trying to un-pigeonhole myself out of being a lowly aerospace structures analyst and get into something I'll enjoy a lot more. I feel this is very important during my formative years as a new engineer to get the career I want.

The problem is *it's pretty goddamn hard.*

Between dive_into_python3.pdf; digesting lectures &amp; taking notes for 2 hours a night; and STK 10 training videos, it's difficult to find the time, energy, and motivation after work even if I have a double espresso at 5pm... which starts other problems like staying up late which turns into being late for my actual job in the morning. I also feel like I don't have a social life anymore.

I have a silly GE over-the-range microwave. The touch panel that controls this thing's core functions started being unresponsive to touches.

There is a membrane on the outside and a harder digitizer-type screen underneath (which is the one that cracked) and the LCD below that. LCD displays things fine. Now it sure as heck doesn't respond to any touches.

GE/retailers says you have to replace the whole control unit which is as expensive as replacing the microwave. Always had the utmost disrespect for GE so thanks for allowing me to maintain that opinion.

50,Tool advice for those young engineers and technicians that need to have a box of goodies,1440373485,"Hey engineers.  This is my advice from the year of internship and career with respect to getting the tools you need.  Lets start off by getting to the elephant in the room.  TOOLS ARE EXPENSIVE.  And after awhile of using them, you will realize why.  I started out needing the standard stuff, like wrenches, screwdrivers, allens, hammers, etc.  Then I started more machining and fabbing and had to make my collection grow.  I went on craigslist and got a cheap rolling toolbox and started filling it up.  I got a few paychecks in and hat a bit of money and I went to Horrible Freight and stocked up.  Do NOT, stock up on your tools at the Snap-On truck, you can't afford it.  Buy cheap stuff.  If you break it, that means you need it to be worth a damn, unless you abused it, then get a quality one.  Here is my list of things I found that I needed to be of high quality:

1. Socket wrench (Not the sockets themselves, but the socket wrench)
2. Safety Glasses
3. Allen wrenches (If you get cheap ones, you will turn them into ball end ones)
4. Pry Bars (The load you put on them is not a load you want snapping back at you when that thing snaps)
5. Pin Punches (Cheap ones made of pot steel will bend)
6. MultiMeter.  Make sure it is a passive one, and not active
7. Side cutters.  I recommend Knipex, but something hardened is a must.
8. Flashlight.  The last thing you want is a flashlight to start flickering out when you really need it.

That about covers it for now, and if anybody has some recommendations, please leave them below.  There is lots of information to be had in the tool world.

The new swing arm I decided to weld into place and make it more of a... an arm, idk. I'm not quite sure if not having support from the around the axle mount to the top of the seat frame will be an issue or if it's good as it is. Thanks!

I'm a mechanical engineer and I need help calculating some reactions on a load bearing wall. I'm pretty confident that I can perform a static analysis on the current condition of the walls and roof structure. I'm more concerned about making the proper assumptions, according to common construction practices, when designing the new condition. I want to accomplish a couple things and any help is greatly appreciated.

1. I want to appease my wife who is in the middle of ""remodeling"" our kitchen. She Googled ""Load Bearing Walls"" and most results returned some form of ""Consult an Engineer"". I'm an engineer so she consulted with me.
2. I want to correctly calculate the forces acting on the wall.
3. I want to transfer the forces calculated in #2 to the nearest load bearing wall.
4. I want to design a floor plan and construction plan.
5. I want to take said plan to a professional engineer to review.

Bottom Line: I want to do as much of the leg work as possible before consulting a professional engineer.

Questions:

1. How do you determine the weight of the roof? What types of assumptions are made? What types of margins of safety are commonly used?
2. When removing a retaining wall, Is it necessary to calculate the current condition or should I just move to the proposed design and determine those loads and have a wall(s) designed that can support the new loads properly?
3. What are the construction/engineering standards that govern these types of projects in California?

75,Build a waterproof air vent to a house,1440234734,"Hello fellow engineers,

I want to build (have built) an air vent for the house of my father. The house is a sturdy brick house with a concrete basement. The basement is waterproof (the house is built in an area with a medium probability of flood). But for the air ventilation in the house, there is a hole in the otherwise waterproof basement. I now want to build an airvent, that serves as a kind of snorkel.

The idea was using 3mm thick stainless steel, having it welded into a box, with a flange, and then fixing it to the wall with M10 stud bolts. between the wall and the box, I would have put something like a rubber gasket, and then completely sealed it with some silicon.

[Here are pictures of the idea in 3D.](http://imgur.com/a/6seBc)

The brick colored thing is the wall, the brown stuff in front of it is the isolation of the house. The 13 bolts in the wall are M10 stud bolts. Water would in the worst case scenario rise up a bit further than the bend.

My questions now are: Would this work at all? With water standing on it from the outside, would it need further reinforcements? Is there a better way to seal between the wall and the air vent?

I have no experience with this kind of constructions, so I would just overspec it and hope for the best.

I'm trying to make a bldc motor from scratch and would like to use stator alloy for the actual stator to wind. My only problem with the design comes from the fact that I want to angle the stator in by fifteen degrees or so. The two ways I can do this are to either create a press and shape each waffers to be angled then stack them again or to cut the stator waffers so that each armature is an individual piece. 

Both have their draw backs but I was wondering if the field diffusion occurs across the whole surface area of the stator or is it strong at the creation but diffuses by the time it gets to the center of the circle. This would be my preferred option because it would allow for flush stator alignment between each waffers.

The second option is to create a press and shape each waffer with a bend at the arms. I think this would work too but the arms would have a slant at the end and would cause the winding to be slanted. It would cause a lot more experimentation on how the magnets would have to be angled.

So I'm hoping somebody could give me some clarity or maybe an option in not thinking of. ",AskEngineers,SimianWriter,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3hxl7r/im_designing_a_bldc_motor_and_want_to_make_a/

81,New SE Needing Help With Design Procedure...,1440202004,"Hello all,

It's my first month on the job.  I've been doing a **lot** of calculation checks.  I'm really enjoying myself!  But I want to make sure I keep up on how to do design work...

We recently had a design for a steel foundation that's welded to a high strength steel shear wall that's intended to hold a piece of equipment.  We have the FEA solution.  However, I wanted to try and do the math by hand and see if my design solution matches the FEA solution.

The foundation is two pieces of angle welded to the steel shear wall with two pieces of plate welded between the two angles.  There are two bolt holes on each angle's flange.  Here's a quick AutoCAD drawing I made to show:  [Steel FDN](http://i.imgur.com/XWHUKTF.png).

How would I check this by hand?

I started with the bolts.  The bolt size and thread were specified by the equipment, so I just needed to figure out which grade I needed based on the load of the equipment and things like shear, bearing, etc.  Fine, I need Grade 5 bolts.  Problem solved.

I think the next step is to design the angles - solving for the thickness and length of the flanges, but I have no idea how to do this!  It's not really a beam *or* a column because of how it's welded to the wall lengthwise.  I don't think any of the methods I learned in steel design cover this situation.  :/

How would I design the angles?  Also, would I design the angles and *then* design the plate between the two angles? I feel like I shouldn't treat the entire foundation as a single unit because there will be welds between the plates and the angles that need to be designed.  Right?

Once I figure out how to design the angles and the plates, I'm pretty sure I know how to design the weld size.  So, I'm good there.

Any guidance would be very helpful.

My complaint to my bosses is that the nature of the maintenance-side of my job is mission-critical and because of that I can't plan any design tasks. I nearly always get interrupted. If a molder breaks, I need to drop whatever I'm doing and get it running because it costs a fortune not to run something that's scheduled to. My design seems to suffer at this, though. I feel that designing a product well shouldn't be relegated to left-over time. When I'm working up some sheet metal in Solidworks, the best result always comes from playing with it for awhile during my best hours of the day. When a molder or something breaks when I've planned to have a long look at a design problem, it's entirely possible that I'll be fixing that molder continuously for 3 days. At the end of those 3 days, I'll be lucky if something else isn't broken that I move on to.

94,Sanity check with HVAC Heat Rejection?,1440135617,"Hi everybody!

Any chance someone could save my aching brain and help me think through something. I'm just coming down with a flu, and I noticed something on a chiller plant that I simply cannot explain.

Backstory:  So I have a chiller plant that has 2x 450 ton chillers (Turbocor stuff), and 2x 500 ton towers, plus two CDW pumps, two CHW pumps. I've got VFDs on everything, and for best efficiency, I'm running everything. When the plant first went live, we had a big cock up with the condenser water treatment which led to the chillers getting pretty damn dirty, leading to some stupidly high approach temperatures on the condenser barrels (like 10-12 degrees). We brought the condenser temperatures back down a bit to around 7-8, and are planning an acid wash and brushing next week to get them back into reasonable.  

The Issue: Today, I was watching the plant on the EMS, and the load was about 400 tons (remember 900 tons of capacity connected), the chillers were each running about 45% (scaling reduced capacity a bit), but I noticed that my condenser side was nearly maxed out at 8 F delta and 2000 GPM (1000 per chiller), while my chilled water side wasn't even close, only doing about a 7.5 degree delta at 1200 GPM. 

Now, here's what I don't get. How can the chiller be rejecting 645 tons, when it's only receiving 400 tons from the building, and the chillers are only drawing a total of 261 kW? Where is the extra heat coming from? That's almost 3 million BTU/h extra, which is equivalent to an additional 861 kW over the building load? How can this be true?

Here are some numbers from right now:

Condenser side: 

In: 80.5 F

Out: 88.3 F

Flow: 1985 GPM

Chilled:

In: 52.3 F

Out: 44.8 F

Flow: 1281 GPM

And before you say my sensors are fucked, I have THREE sequential temperature probes that back up these numbers (onboard chiller, chiller piping, common header), and the flows are spot on for my pump curves.

Can anyone please tell me where this energy is coming from, or tell me I'm wrong? I simply don't see how this works?

I've read that the Swiss designed their bridges with explosives in the piers.  In case of invasion they could quickly demolish their bridges and slow an enemy attack.

Skyscrapers have an expected lifespan, and are designed to be demolished and recycled at the end of this life.

The Trade Center towers were built with demolition charges already in place.  

In the event of catastrophic failure it would be more dangerous to allow the building to tip and fall on it's neighbours.

I'm looking for guidance on the order to design my steel foundation...,1440107366,"It's my first month in the office and we have been designing steel foundations that weld directly to a steel shear wall of high strength steel.  The steel foundations are intended to have equipment bolted to them.  They are essentially two pieces of 3x3x1/4 angle steel and two pieces of 1/4"" thick steel plate welded between them as such...

[Very Quick CAD Drawing of the foundation - the image on the left is a profile view (but I'm an idiot and drew it with the up side to the left), the image on the right is an elevation view.](http://i.imgur.com/wi2zzRO.png)

We typically just model them in FEA and then use the results if stresses aren't too high, but I feel like this is something I should be able to design by hand.  It's so frustrating, though, because of the way the two angles are welded to the steel shear wall, they don't really fit the description of a beam or column - the two things I learned how to do in steel design.

So, what is the order I should follow to design this foundation - not just check the adequacy?  So far, I started with the bolts.  The equipment listed the 1/2"" bolts and thread count, so all I had to do was check their adequacy.

I feel like the next step is to design the angles using the applied loads from the bolts and determine what thickness I *should* have (it might not be 1/4"" angle required), but I'm not sure how to start that because of the 1/4"" plates between the two angles.  Additionally, the two 1/4"" plates are welded to the shear wall themselves!

Anywho, once I solve for the thickness of the plates, I think the next step would be to design the weld thickness.  That part's easy enough.

The whole crux of the problem is how to find the thickness of the angles and the plates.  Any suggestions or guidance would be very much appreciated!

Since I am academically weak, I to make up for it by being 'hands on' and have being doing part time work since I was 17. I did one year work experience which had elements of programming and my boss gave me a grade A-.
The job might be similar to what I did for my dissertation. I get shit scared during exams but in all my projects and assignments , I gotten a b+ and above. 

Any tips on how to prepare for such an interview for someone with my skills. 
Thanks in advance

Assuming they're approximately twenty to thirty feet tall (and that money isn't an option), I'm mostly concerned about the following points.

* 1: Is it possible to provide the power neccesary to pilot such a vehicle?
* 2: Is it possible to have the vehicle accelerate/decelerate rapidly? (Top speed? Safety margins?)
* 3: Would such a vehicle require some form of aerial ability, due to weight concerns?
* 4: Is it possible to prevent joint shearing during any movement?

three days ago, coding, nearing the end of a project, shit is intense daily. I knocked over my coffee thermos - it was open - onto laptop.  My coworker proceeds to help by immediately flipping it upside down. We took it apart to see water only reached the keyboard no further. Took keyboard to the manufacturing department, cleaned with DI water, dried, etc. Put the laptop together again, doesn't turn on, no charging light, nothing. Everyone knows about this laptop #1. One by one, they all had their coffee keyboard story to tell me, and the lesson to learn.  I stopped keeping coffee next to my laptop on my desk.

Story from laptop #2:
Yesterday, while relocating to the warehouse to finish some testing of the code that was developed, on new laptop #2. I had my thermos of coffee in one hand and my laptop opened and in the other hand with the powercord as well. The warehouse door handle caught my powercord and I nearly threw the laptop across the concrete, BUT instead I fell with the laptop preventing this, and in the process my CLOSED thermos, landed onto the keyboard and spilled about 4 quartar sized drops of delicious creamy coffee onto the lower right corner.

I freaked out, but it wasn't much, I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol wipes after shutting it down, while holding it upside down to prevent further damage. It worked still! But throughout the day, my enter key broke, the middle row broke, numbers started typing the middle row instead, coding became really hard!  So I brought the laptop home, did further cleaning with rubbing alcohol and artist brushes, the broken row is now the bottom row, but the numbers still type the middle row, essentially this keyboard is useless now!

I obviously have to tell my manager/bosses my fuck up, I can't program with this keyboard. How should I present my fuck up to my boss? And should I bring in a usb keyboard as well?

17,I have the passion for a Masters but not so much the grades: do I still have a chance?,1440052861,"I messed up my undergraduate degree and graduated by just getting by ultimately due to a lack of maturity. By the time I had matured (3rd and 4th year), I already had to live with my poor choices and undesired major which I went with for the sake of continuing school. I graduated this May in Materials Engineering and haven't been called for a single interview yet. I intend to keep applying, but I also want to apply for graduate school to try and improve my skills while the economy is bad (or so I've been told). 

In the state I'm currently in (no co op, very average grades, barely any connections, etc)... even I wouldn't hire me. Absolutely nothing sets me apart from other applicants. There's nothing about me an employer couldn't find anywhere else or within the applicants they receive. Really, if I ever got a job, it would probably be because they were in a rush and they just decided to go with the first person who applied. I think I'm being serious when I say this because I really don't want to waste any more time. 

The thing is, I'm a B- student at best. So GPA wise, that's ~ 2.7 at best. Most graduate programs I've seen (in Canada) say their minimum requirement is 3.0. Should I just apply? Do I have any chance at all if I express my passion for pursuing a masters (in a field I like, that is not the same as that of which I did my Bachelors in because I hate my Bachelors degree)?

18,Can I remove the fan from this Shop Vacuum to reduce noise?,1440052699,"I wasnt exactly sure where to post this, so here we go. I have a small CNC milling machine that I am trying create a vacuum system for so I purchased a [Workshop WS0450VA Wet/Dry Vacuum](http://workshopvacs.emerson.com/shop/en/wsv/vacs-s-vacs-air-movers/vacs-s-at-home/45-gallon-50-peak-hp-contractor-wet-dry-vac-wsv-ws0450va) since wanted something somewhat portable. After running my first job I realized a huge oversight, the noise. The vacuum is loud (75-80db). After researching other shop vacs that might fit the requirements (&lt;65db, portable, wet/dry, under $200 and a connecting port for an exhaust hose) I realized that it isnt going to happen by buying one. So as a warranty voider, I dissassembled the vacuum and attempted [noise reducing adhesive backed foam](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811999222) that helped minimaly (1-2db). 

**My next idea is this:** 

Remove the fan from the shaft.

Cool the motor using PC fan, small blower, or inline fan that is significantly quieter 
by cutting a hole in the top of the housing with either a push or pull configuration.

Use the exhaust from the vacuum ducted through two 3/4"" Loc-Line tubes connected through a Y-reducer with 
the nozzles aimed at the cutting head to push debris into the Vacuum intake. This is so that I can more clearly see the cutting head as it removes material.

Add better and/or more sound dampening materials

**Possible issues I have thought of in my research are:**

Removing the fan will reduce the drag on the motor causing it to spin too fast. I planned on dealing with this by adding a [motor controller](http://www.harborfreight.com/router-speed-control-43060.html) to further reduce heat, noise and rpms.

19,What are the current limits for concrete in regards to height?,1440048316,"I've been curious about the feasibility of high-altitude spaceports lately. More specifically the technical feasibility of taking a tall mountain on Ecuador (20,564 feet aka 6.26 km) and building a tower of concrete with a lift a few kilometers high. I don't have any material science background so it's hard to envision the feasibility of such a structure. Can't compare it to a skyscraper or really any modern structure I can think of since building just for height isn't really done usually.

A tower, from what I gather, is mostly limited by the compressive strength as long as it has a large base. (Correct me if I'm wrong). I saw online that ultra-high performance concrete exists with varying properties. There's a lot of papers in regards to bridges. Was looking at [this in particular](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/research/resources/uhpc/104-M17.cfm). Other sources list 22 ksi as ultra-high performance concrete. That government site goes all the way up to 194 ksi with steam treated for their tests, but that sounds outside of the realm for large construction. That's from 2007 though. I saw articles about ""ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete"" at [30 ksi](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/infrastructure/structures/hpc/13060/002.cfm). What's the maximum strength variation that people could currently use to build a tower? (Anyone that does bridges or concrete in general what would you have on hand today that could be created or available in mass amounts?).

One thing I've noticed is that prices aren't listed anywhere for these kinds of concrete. I imagine they'd be custom ordered for the project. Would be cool to find the price of any UHPC if anyone knows.

It sounds like this could be simplified to treating the problem as if we're dealing with a 1 square inch (0.0006452 m^2) area then finding out how much dried concrete represents 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg). (Since that volume would be 30,000 pounds per square inch). That would be the maximum possible before compressive failure assuming a perfect continuous pour over years building the tower's core. (Also assuming it's design to not explode outwards). Seems like the weight varies a lot. For the CRC UHCP stuff it's 1,100 kg/m^3 to 1,437 kg/m^3. That would be 13,608 kg / (1,437 kg / m^3) = 9.47 m^3 and 9.47 m^3 / 0.0006452 m^2 = 14.677 km. That's extremely high when added to a 6.26 km mountain. (That's over 20 km which would be amazing for a spaceport).

Also I'm curious how engineers would approach this. (Non-solid core for instance or using metal for the last few kilometers?) Also does concrete cure faster or slower at high altitude? At 20 km it would be 5.5% atmospheric pressure so workers would be in space suits. I noticed a lot of these concrete mixes recommend very high temperatures to cure. That seems like it could be a problem or is that solved since I noticed a lot of companies will pour concrete in cold weather? Any other thoughts on the feasibility of this.

***Double thank you to those who have the patience to read through my long post!***
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I entered the field of Bioengineering with the goal of finding steady employment in the STEM field upon completion of my undergrad curriculum. In fact, the outstanding employment prospects of Bioengineers/BioMed Engineers was the single largest selling point of the professor who convinced me to attend the University and enroll in the program. 

I started applications for entry-level R&amp;D, Quality, Process, Manufacturing, Device, etc. engineer (Associate Engineer, Engineer I...) during the fall semester of last year (~October 2014) and have continued applying with zero success ever since. I have submitted easily over 100 applications in the last 8 months. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Some background information into my situation:

i) B.S. Bioengineering : 3.7+ GPA, Summa Cum Laude

ii) Co-Op experience in Biotech company

iii) Well-edited / Well-maintained application materials (Carefully designed resume, written cover letter)

iv) I've only applied to positions for which I felt I was an outstanding candidate &amp; 100% confident on required and preferred skills/experience

v) Networked extensively--made contacts with engineers and hiring managers. Complete and thorough follow-up on dozens of industry/engineering contacts

vi) Taught myself highly desirable skills in industry: MATLAB, Python, ISO/FDA Regulations...etc.

I'm describing the above list to demonstrate the level of effort I've put into both my education and my job experience to get a career in engineering, with absolutely no job offers. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I did a survey of reddit after months of frustrating lack of progress to find that the general consensus is that BioE's/BioMed's are not considered to be at the same level of technical competence as a more traditional field of engineering and thus drastically less desirable for even positions explicitly titled ""Biomedical Engineer"" or ""Medical Device Engineer"" (versus a MechE, EE, CompE or ChemE). By the time I found out about this trend--I was in the last month before graduating with my degree.

For the relative few positions that will seriously consider BioE's/BioMeds -- I am getting the sense that the oversupply of unemployed people with this degree leads to a glut of applicants for the few positions that exist, allowing the industry to establish unrealistic selective standards. I feel I'm a strong candidate with good credentials but I cannot compete with the pedigree of students from top 20 universities. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I feel compelled to explore changing my title to another field of STEM with graduate education such as an M.S. or M.Eng. in Mechanical or Chemical or CompSci. 

I'm reluctant to turn to graduate education just because I can't find a job but I cannot continue to not have a plan or career. 

If I did graduate education--I'd like to start with a master's program that is funded if possible. Do you all have any advice on what programs like that might exist? 

 I consider how much a University master's program wants me, hence my focus on M.Sci/M.Eng programs that reimburse costs/ pay stipends, to be a top priority--right up there with the University's pedigree.  I know UWyoming has a paid, combined M.S. ChemE/MBA program, for example.

I know this is a lot of detail and discussion -- trying to put this confusing decision-making process out in words is something I need to practice. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

***TL;DR*** : *Recent grad with B.S. Bioengineering. Did well in school, did all the stuff I should have to get me a engineer job--8 months so far and zero success.* *Reddit tells me (generally) BioE's are not wanted and/or perhaps not respected; for the jobs that do want BioE/BioMed it's so competitive that it's untenable. Looking *for a Master's program in Engineering / Applied science that pays stipend or* *reimburses tution. It's important to me that the grad program values its Masters students--what do you guys recommend?*

59,To PhD or not for experienced engineers,1439873369,"Hi All

I've searched through this sub-reddit and read some of the relevant replies, and I'd still like to ask this question given my situation is very specific.  

Briefly, I'm an experienced (and registered) consulting engineer with around 8 years of experience.  I currently hold a Masters degree.  I recently received an offer to pursue a PhD at one of the world’s top 10 engineering schools on the following arrangement:

-	Fully funded by my company for 4 years.  Condition is I’ll have to stick with the company for 2 years post-graduation and I’ll have to repay the funding if I leave before then.  Doesn’t count if I’m made redundant. 
-	Working with familiar supervisors (we have collaborated on different projects). 
-	PhD topic is work related.  I will still be working for my company for 4 days with 2 remaining days (including weekend) spent in the university.  The research and my work are inter-related / complimentary.   
-	Because I’m working for 4 days, I will have to take a 20% pay cut. 

I’ve considered the pros and cons. 

Pros

-	Connection between work + research will mean after I graduate, I have enough knowledge and experience to be an expert in my field. 
-	Promotion to director level as a technical expert.  This is as discussed with the company manager responsible for this.  
-	Additional opportunities to move into lecturing at university. This aligns with my longer term plan. 
-	Satisfy my personal aspiration of contributing to the scientific knowledge.  
-	A subject that I like (I’m already doing research in this area on my own time).  A PhD is to formalise this.  

Cons

-	Loss of 20% additional income for 4 years.  
-	Will be 35-36 by the time I graduate. 
-	Primary focus for four years will be on the PhD and not developing my career.
-	Not being able to finish the PhD (time wasted). 
-	Change in company manager, i.e. reporting to a new manager not as keen on these things.  

In short, I’m trying to decide, and see if there’s anything I need to be mindful of.  And I certainly welcome the diverse experience we have on this sub-reddit.

If you were to ground the bottom rail, the output voltage would then be modulation_index*Vdc.

78,Solid seamless aluminum ring machining,1439824225,"Hello,

My wife recently purchased some solid aluminum rings for use with fabric in a ring sling baby carrier. They are about 3 inches in diameter, and about a half inch thick. 

I'm curious how these were manufactured, as they have no seams or imperfections that would lead me to think they were cast. Also, being aluminum I'm guessing it would be pretty unlikely that it was molten at the beginning of the process, but I guess it isn't impossible. 

Might they be stamped? ",AskEngineers,phade,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3hbn70/solid_seamless_aluminum_ring_machining/

Worried about getting burned.,1439814041,"I'm considering recommending our company buy a 78'' OD bearing for a crane (technically a drill rig).  We're going off a previous manufacturers drawing which the company will custom make for us. Our original material was C45 N but they are actually suggesting 50mn instead.

The price they quoted is pretty low. about $3k shipped. Before I go ahead and tell the boss I think we should move forward with this, what questions should I be asking?  Going through Alibaba was my suggestion and if something goes wrong with this bearing it will probably fall on my shoulders but if it goes well I'll look like an all star.

As Nm^3/hr is at 273K and 1atm, and my experimental results are at 298K and a range of pressure steps, what would you advise?

 I have tried using P1V1/T1=P2V2/T2 to work out the Volume in m^3/hr and then converted to l/m, however my results from this conversion mean that the experimental results are drastically different from the tables. Now the tables appear to be worse, however not slightly worse drastically worse. Hence my confusion. 

Any help would be great,

I have a product idea that uses a tracking device. And it looks I can, based on the other tracking products, have it tracked through a smart phone. But I also want the ability to make a light flash or the device to emit a sound from up to a 500 yard range. But I can deal with a 100 yard range.

95,Where are the healthy work environments?,1439742595," I'm a bit stuck, and looking for advice from someone with real life experience.  I just enrolled back in school and I keep bouncing between ME and CS.  I'm trying to stick to the rules and not make it a question about what i should major in,  i'm more concerned with what kind of work environments either majors would provide for me once i graduate.  I live in the south east of the USA but am not against re locating.  

Please feel free to correct ANY misconceptions I have about either of these majors.
 
I'll start by saying I am more interested in the subject matter that ME has to offer.  I feel that learning the principles of engineering, physics and different materials will benefit my long list of hobbies and other skills i'm looking to learn in the future( building motorcycles, robotics, metalworking, woodworking, leatherworking, etc.)  but from what i've read and heard online is that a large majority of engineering jobs are not very healthy work environments.  i.e. bad co-workers, long hours, lack of actual design, just sitting at a desk wearing a tie.  (please correct me if i'm mistaken)  but i'm a pretty laid back guy,  have tattoos (that I can cover) a beard, and like to have some fun.  I'm afraid this environment will suck my soul dry!  I know every business is different but I tend to hear a lot more about the negative ones than the positive ones when it comes to engineering roles.  I just want the simple 40 hr. week, with a healthy work environment that I can leave my work at when i go home for the night.  
 
Which brings me to CS,  Idk if people are just trying to make it sound super ""hip"" and a fun environment because theres supposedly a shortage of good programmers?  But the software world sounds like it would be a lot more accepting of casual attire, laid back attitudes, work/life balance, alternative lifestyles, and all around a more fun place to be.  I find CS interesting enough that I could buckle down and learn to love it,  some people have a passion for it so theres gotta be something to it.  And the little bit of coding i have done i've enjoyed, just not on the same level as working with physical objects.  But If it means the possibility of leading to a more fun and exciting career, than CS would be worth it to me.  

TLDR;  I'm more interested in ME but the work/life balance that the software world ""seems"" to offer is what draws me towards that.  
 
Sorry if this topic gets posted a lot,  i've done all the research I can and i've hit somewhat of a dead end.  Any advice will be very much appreciated.  ",AskEngineers,AdviceSponge11,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3h7nk4/where_are_the_healthy_work_environments/

  - the connection should be self-centering, for correct positioning.
  - I want the arm to come down onto the tool and lock into place.  The arm will repeat this movement to unlock the tool and disengage.
  - the connection should be uni-directional: there's a 6 pin electrical connect on one side to power the tool that must mate for power/logic to pass to the tool.
  - the connection should be better than a friction fit.  I fear the tool would fall off unexpectedly.
