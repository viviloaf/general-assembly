2,"Is it truly dangerous to wash glasses without removing the lenses, in an ultrasonic cleaner?",1539096987,"My friend's a chef and my brother's an elementary schoolteacher. For their birthdays, I'm thinking of buying them each an [ultrasonic cleaner](https://www.amazon.ca/s/ref=lp_11849791011_nr_p_72_0?fst=as%3Aoff&amp;rh=n%3A11076213011%2Cn%3A%2111076214011%2Cn%3A11849466011%2Cn%3A11849781011%2Cn%3A11849784011%2Cn%3A11849791011%2Cp_72%3A11192170011&amp;bbn=11849791011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539063019&amp;rnid=11192166011). 

I've seen that when my chef (and her colleagues) are cooking, [the grease and oil](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/20559/24882) obligate them to clean their glasses every 30 mins. 

My brother usually washes his pupils`glasses, as some of them have broken them and carelessly wipe them with their clothes. An ultrasonic cleaner can help him wash 15 glasses/day much faster!

What do you think? I stumbled on this warning from [ZEISS Canada](https://www.zeiss.ca/vision-care/en_ca/better-vision/understanding-vision/trends-and-advice/what-s-the-right-way-to-clean-and-care-for-your-glasses.html):

&gt;###4. Give your glasses an occasional treat: the special care offered by an ultrasonic cleaner

&gt;The use of ultrasonic cleaners is your best guarantee of thorough, convenient cleaning of your frames. **But note: this cleaning method is appropriate for frames only, and should be done by your eye care professional, as they must remove your lenses from your glasses first [emphasis mine]**. Please  don’t use the ultrasonic cleaner you use to clean your jewelry on your glasses, but have your eye care professional handle this job.

&gt;Your eye care professional will be pleased to clean your lenses in their ultrasonic cleaner - ideally every six months. This is part of eye care professional's standard equipment these days.

5,How does refrigerator coolant absorb heat?,1539094099,"I understand the basics, I think. 

Coolant liquid flows into an expansion valve. The sudden drop in pressure makes it expand, the expansion makes it cool and turns it into a gas.

 That gas coolant flows through a pipe on the interior of the refrigerator and *absorbs the heat of the air/food inside of the cooling cabinet.*

The gas coolant, having absorbed the heat, enters the compressor which heats the coolant raising its temperature and pressure.

The coolant gas flows through radiator pipes, moving the heat to the outside of the refrigerator, and this cooling of the coolant turns it back into a liquid. Then the cycle repeats itself.

If I’m wrong about any of that, please let me know, but my real confusion now is in wondering how/why the coolant can absorb heat.

6,How do I quantify glue strength?,1539092867,"This is likely a really simple question, but I was wondering how glue strength is measured. 

I have two materials glued together with different types of glue. My plan is to add weight to one of the materials and see how much weight it takes to cause each glue joint to fail. 

Each test has about 1 in^2 of glue between the materials. I'll be applying a load in such a way that the force is perpendicular to the normal of the glue surface ( I think that is shear strength?)

So if I find that 5 cm^2 will hold 10 kg, is the relevant unit kg/cm^2? Is glue strength measured in units of pressure?

I got my undergrad in Digital Media Design back in 2017 and have spent the last 11+ years working as a web/software designer, climbing the ranks, etc. About five years in I realized how much I hated it. Lots of handwaving blowhards... five years later I had become the handwaving blowhard myself. I quit my job and moved to upstate NY to take over ownership of a print and design shop that was in the family. It's a little more ""honest"" but we're living hand to mouth and I'm pulling 70-90 hours/week... it's not sustainable. With the industry headed where it is, it feel like I own one of the last Blockbusters.

It's 9:00pm and I've disassembled one of my laser printers (Xerox DocuColor 242) so I can swap out some parts. It's a Xerox and they keep all their parts and service info under lock and key and I've basically had to take this machine apart to learn how to service it myself, it's 13 years old and no one else will. I hear a know on the window (the shop closes at 6:00pm) and I look up to see one of my regular customers. I let him in and he's curious what I'm doing. I explain to him like I have to you and  also that I've had to teach myself all of the machines I own (there's a half dozen others). He tells me to call him when I'm finished and I tell him it'll be 2-3 more hours until I'm done. ""I don't care, just call me. I'll take you to Denny's"", he says. So I do and we go to Denny's where he spend the next hour and a half pleading for me to got to engineering school. I kind of laughed it off because I already have a heap of student loan payments to make, as if I really want to triple-down on that...

But I do. He's absolutely right that it's what I should be doing. But how the hell do I get there from here? Is it even wise? How would I prepare for an engineering degree?

32,What are your go-to DC Motor design resources?,1539032122,"Hey All,

**I'm curious to know what everyone uses as go-to ""design bibles"" for DC motors.** 

In my relatively short time doing mechanical design and R&amp;D work, I frequently find myself working on problems where I've had limited previous exposure. Often the best resources for practical design questions aren't textbooks, but design guides or white papers put out by the companies which sell these products. Examples might be [Parker's O-Ring Handbook](https://www.parker.com/literature/ORD%205700%20Parker_O-Ring_Handbook.pdf), or [Dupont's Guide for Engineering Polymers](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/dupont/products-and-services/plastics-polymers-and-resins/thermoplastics/documents/General%20Design%20Principles/General%20Design%20Principles%20for%20Engineering%20Polymers.pdf), which I've referenced as an intro to design for injection molding. The Eaton Mobile Hydraulics Manual has also been on my Amazon wishlist for over a year now, just waiting for an excuse to be purchased. Both Norton and Shigley's are fantastic machine design resources.

I've used brushed and brushless DC motors in designs before. However, I have yet to find a solid design resource which covers much breadth and depth. A lot of basic Kv/Kt explanations on one end, and papers or articles on specific control problems, or high-level marketing for advanced new motor designs on the other end. There also seems to be an industry divide between lower voltage motors (&lt;50 VDC) used for battery-powered mobile platforms, robotics and consumer products (my chief area of interest) and the larger NEMA frame sizes and voltages used in manufacturing and other stationary and industrial-type settings.

**Have you found a design guide for DC motors &amp; gearmotors which covers everything from basic speed &amp; torque calculations to more advanced problems like inductance matching &amp; current/torque ripple, when and how to add varistors and ferrite cores at the motor, heat generation/dissipation calculations based on duty cycles or loading patterns, typical efficiency losses of different gearbox designs, dealing with backlash, backdrivability, determining when it's actually worth switching from brushed to brushless, etc. etc.**

On a related note, as I'm now starting to encounter or revisit similar challenges, I'm interested in compiling a library of the most useful resources I find for various design areas.

It's important for me because I study electronics engineering but I'm also partially interested in automation and would like to get to it as close as possible from my position. What I noticed so far is that automation has also something to do with the algorithms and in general programming so it's a bit far from circuits and closer to robotics and design of the dynamic systems while electronics is used in circuit design.

40,Designing a turning platform for acoustic measurements?,1539022018,"I am a diy-speaker designer. Part of speaker design is measuring the acoustic response of the speaker from many different angles, and then importing these measurements into software to create diagrams that look like [this](https://imgur.com/a/oo95cj2) What this diagram tells us is that although the speaker has a linear frequency response on axis, there are some big irregularities at 5 and 7.5 khz at other angles. A speaker which looks smooth on this graph will generally sound nice. 

To make acoustic measurements, you need to lift the speaker up off the ground away from reflective surfaces, the higher the better. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWQudBXWUZs) video to get an idea of the type of thing I'm trying to build. 

Now, I currently have a manual set-up, which means I have to manually rotate the platform between each measurement. This is time consuming and creates opportunities for error. Measurement of a 3 way speaker take about an hour.

I would like to press a button, and have a platform rotate 5 degrees at a time, so I can sit at my computer and press the 'measure' button. Accuracy is not absolutely critical, but if the accumulated error over 360 degrees of rotation was less than say 2 degrees I'd be very happy. Integration with my PC is not necessary. 

The speakers I design aren't too heavy, 50 pounds at the very most. 

I have basic tools and very basic electronics knowledge. I am working on a hobbyist budget, so elegant cheap solutions would be ideal (professional products exist but they are $$). 

I have access to all manner of CAD software and can have the parts CNC cut. 

Any ideas would be immensely helpful. Even the proper terminology for the type of motors or controllers I need would be helpful. Bonus points if the solution is relatively portable - it's nice to measure outside. ",AskEngineers,False,smashey,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9mhb8z/designing_a_turning_platform_for_acoustic/

47,Perception of PhD applicants in Industry (Chemical),1539017080,"Hey Everyone,

I've begun the process of applying to M.S. programs for Chemical Engineering. My undergraduate degree is in Environmental Science (math minor), and after a few years of taking some prerequisite engineering and physics courses, as well as nailing the quant section of the GRE, I've finally begun my application process. 

I'm applying to three schools, but one of them explicitly told me to apply as a PhD student because their MS students receive zero funding. The other two schools I'm applying to fund their MS students, and there's a great chance of me getting an internship/co-op while studying at those schools. The issue is I really am not sure if I want to pursue a PhD yet, if ever, for the reasons below:

1) Most practicing engineers I've spoken to say that there's a stigma against hiring PhDs because they're either too expensive or too narrow. 

2) Having a PhD, but little work/internship experience to balance it could make me over-educated for entry level work, but under-qualified for mid/senior level work. Bad dilemma to be in.

3) A PhD could take 4-6 years, and if I have a bad PI could be a nightmarish portion of my life.

On the other hand, getting a PhD could differentiate me in a positive way as well and open doors to more research-oriented industry positions. Although I have no interest in a career in Academia, I think a PhD could lead me into some more fulfilling engineering positions like consulting or research. 

At the end of the day, I'm intent of using my experience as an M.S. student to straddle both sides of the fence; get an internship and complete a thesis project. This will help steer me, hopefully, in the direction I wish to go in.

So my question for you, as engineers, is whether or not you would recommend a PhD to anyone seeking to be a a) an engineer in general and b) a chemical engineer specifically.

TLDR: How does industry view PhD applicants? Is a PhD in Chemical Engineering a door opener or a terrible idea? ",AskEngineers,False,LeonardoDaBrody,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9mgjlg/perception_of_phd_applicants_in_industry_chemical/

I graduated in 2017 with a BSME and pretty much took the cool things that came my way, but I definitely need something more stable so I've been looking at more traditional companies. I've just received an offer for $51k from an engineering consulting firm - infrastructure type work, fire protection, civil, that kind of thing. There are two problems with this for me: first, $51k seems low for really anywhere in the US, and second it's not really the area I see myself being interested in. Plenty of people from my class are at $60k+ - a few really motivated/lucky people got \~$75k offers - and I'm really more interested in component-level design than I am infrastructure-level work.

Also pertinent is that I went through a recruiter to find this position. They told me the salary was going to be lower than my target of $60k, and when I got the offer I was told that their range was $45k-50k and that they were doing me a favor by going out of their way for $51k. The recruiter also called me this past Friday, two days after the interview on Wednesday, and wants an answer by this coming Tuesday - that's only two business days to decide.

Masters in Urban Planning - I took an urban planning class in college and loved it.  I've also worked with planners at my internship and see that CE bachelors and UP masters is a pretty common path.  I'm just not sure how marketable it is.

MBA - I went back to school to go into business.  I switched to engineering because business bachelors are a dime a dozen and I was good at and interested in engineering anyway.  But from the engineers I've worked with, a lot of the guys who get an MBA end up leaving engineering altogether.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.

I'm happy to hear any thoughts, or maybe areas I've not considered.

At what rate: on a 1 hz basis

Why:  Trying to quantify what (if any) effect of A/C on tailpipe emissions.  Thus, not trying to fix or diagnose any problem. The tailpipe emissions  are being recorded on 1 hz basis. The A/C switch on/off is not helpful  since the compressor comes on/off based on additional logic.

78,Writer looking for assistance,1538930722,"Hello engineers,

I am a writer that started off his college career studying physics engineering and got through the first year before shifting majors; writing science fiction, that education has been invaluable and I strive to continue it out of university with classes, lectures, etc. 

Anyway, this pertains to my writing. I write science fiction with a decidedly hard (true to science) bend and my writing is illustrated. Here are some examples: [https://imgur.com/a/4Pk9xr9](https://imgur.com/a/4Pk9xr9) 

I did the blueprints for the ship, the math for the planet, and some other things, but the art is primarily commissioned; my CAD skills are adequate for concepts, but not for much beyond rudimentary design. That, my engineering friends, is the point of this post. Some of the yet-to-be-commissioned concepts are too advanced for a general artist; not saying they are idiots or anything, just that few art students choose physics as their gen-ed science and, therefore, lack some of the fundamentals that are needed to even understand how some of the tech functions. 

To that point, I have concluded that I need more of an engineer than an artist (but definitely both) to help with some designs—specifically redesigning the final piece in that gallery. It’s an engine, but one that dips into physics principals that just aren’t general knowledge (but really should be: Newtonian stuff, mostly). 

What’s more, if I can find someone who can really get what I’m trying to do physics and engineering wise, I would like to work together on ships, stations, and other things that utilize tech with a solid foundation in different branches of physics. 

So, all that said, I’m looking for some advice. I figure if I go to an engineering firm asking for them to design a starship, I will either get laughed off of the call or get a bill on a scale that should require congressional approval. Ideally, I’m looking for an artistic engineer with an interest in science fiction—someone willing to moonlight on surface level design projects—but any advice would be greatly appreciated. For the most part, what I need is someone who is fluent in CAD. Like I said, my skills are rudimentary and sort of fall apart when I am faced with anything outside of straight lines and simple geometry (my artistic lean is decidedly not organic).  Most of this work would benefit from mechanical engineering, so I'll use that flair.

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read and I hope you enjoyed the gallery. Any questions, comments, or critiques are appreciated, but advice is cherished. So, any advice?

Thanks again,

Is this what a Mechanical engineer supposed to do? This job is very simple. It's like data entry. I don't know if I am even in the right field. I thought engineers were supposed to go to fields and do site visits, I have been stuck inside an office working on excel. I'm not complaining about that. I'm just worried about progressing beyond this task. Also, my true passion is in the aerospace industry, but due to financial difficulties and family problems, I'm stuck here for the time being.

84,Negotiating Salary as a newly grad with no job experience,1538877894,"**Disclaimer:** Sorry. This post came out longer than I expected.

So a few things to get out of the way. I graduated back with a Mechanical Engineering bachelors in March from a top 20/top 50 (I never know with university rankings) school with a 3.5 GPA and currently job hunting in the Bay Area. But I don't have any engineering internship/job experience so I don't think I'm all that valuable. Here's my resume for reference.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/hlcu60deo60gkp6/Anonymous_Resume.pdf?dl=0

After a month of job hunting, I just got a job offer as a Manufacturing Engineer for 62k. It's definitely on the lower end of pay, especially for the Bay Area.

I've done research with online salary calculators and I think the market value of an entry level Manufacturing Engineer hovers around 70-75k but feel free to fact check me.

I kind of want to just get my feet wet and just get some damn experience. I'm living with family so rent/food costs aren't *too* much of a concern but I'd rather have a job sooner than later. I haven't had any promising leads other than this job after a month of searching, which I know is relatively short but I'm not eager to go back to the hunt. ""I'll take what I can get"" is what I'm saying here.

**But getting more money is good. But am I in a position to negotiate?**

Now I guess the reason I'm making this post is that I'm afraid I don't have any leverage to negotiate. But I'm more afraid that they'll rescind my offer if I negotiate with them. 

I don't have any experience. I don't have any other offers lined up. I don't want to be jobless right now. My resume is probably a dime a dozen.  

According to Glassdoor reviews this company is notorious for average to low compensation. Which is fine to an extent. I don't mind looking for a different job after a year or so of work there. I want experience but there's such a thing as too low. I was thinking about asking them for 70k since that's what I initially asked for.

Sorry, I know I'm rambling here. [Here's a picture of a cat.

**tl;dr**: Entry level manufacturing engineer position offer at 62k in Bay Area. I have no engineering job experience and have been out of school for 6 months. Not hopeful about future job prospects Key questions are...

85,NSPE Engineers' Creed - Serious Question/Discussion,1538877875,"I am an ME Senior, nearing graduation, and I am really starting to take in the role I am about to enter - and in many ways have already entered. I was in the Army for a number of years so the Engineers' Creed is something I am prone to take to somewhat to heart. I read it first as a Freshman in one of my intro engineering textbooks and the overwhelming duty to the ""betterment of human welfare"" was very appealing to me - and continues to be. Everyone has their reasons for studying engineering and this was something I found honorable and justified the hard work that has gone into it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Being something of a heathen, I found qualms with the last line though. ""In humility and with need for Divine Guidance, I make this pledge.""  I agree wholeheartedly with a need for humility - a trait I believe many people could use more of, myself included. But I fail to understand the need to compromise the expertise and ability of engineers by pledging it is somehow by ""Divine Guidance"" we are able to accomplish anything of merit. I realize a solution to this personal unease is simply to not look too much into the creed or any creeds and get back to work but coming from a society of upmost professionalism - I cannot help be frustrated by what seems to be a willingness to chock things up to a higher power when they are in fact the product of hard work, creative brilliance, and generations of learned skill, shared knowledge, and passion. I am undoubtedly a bit naive in my romantic views of the profession - but that is a product of my passion, interest, and how seriously I take my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having said all that, if anyone is still reading this far, I am deeply curious to hear from anyone else that might have an opinion either way. If anyone else was struck by these codes of ethics as I was, if they have become disenchanted over time, or if you simply think they are for show and hold a superficial meaning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side-note: I found it interesting that this form of the NSPE Engineers' Creed was adopted in 1954 - the same year that ""under god"" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance. It is also a sentiment that doesn't appear in the ""Order of the Engineer"" obligation statement.

TLDR;
I’m going to take on an additional role doing sales and plan on asking 1/3 of the average salary for this position as a raise. Is this reasonable?

Story time:

I’m a young engineer and have been at my current employer for a little over a year as a design and development engineer. I work for a foreign, medium sized company with a small but growing presence in the US. Because we are a small office in the US, I’m used to taking on tasks that are normally done by other departments. I’ve also become fairly efficient at my job (it’s also pretty easy) and am able to finish most days within 3 hours or less. This has lead me to become bored and I usually spend the rest of the time either helping my colleagues or trying to learn something new. My boss, whom I have a good relationship with is aware that I do not have enough to do within my current role. I approached him several weeks back and expressed interest in taking on a more active role with sales along with my current one in hopes to have more work. He thought this would be a great idea and so does the rest of management. He never brought up the topic of extra compensation and neither did I at the time. However, since I’m filling the job of 2 people, I feel a pay bump is in order. I looked at the average starting pay for this position in my area and plan to ask for 1/3 of this as a raise. Does this sound reasonable to you all or is my expectation out of sorts?

There are two channels, one is excited by the following signal: [https://imgur.com/a/tsKQ59n](https://imgur.com/a/tsKQ59n) the other one is excited by the tracking error of this signal and a multi-sine disturbance signal. 

For a pure multi-sine signal one would need to define the bounds where the signal has power (sines are periodic, hence power signals). The signal I include in the URL consists of pulses. I'd say they are non-periodic, and therefore I would need to use the energy (note: energy =! power) of the signal.  With the known energy and Parseval's theorem, the frequency bounds can be defined.

However, one could also claim that pulses can be viewed as a series of infinite sines (characterized as the sinc function).

So long story short, I was helping a friend fix an axis in one of the machines in his workplace.

Such as, excess position or velocity error, I2C communication error, thermal shunt related error and a couple more.

I checked and found that the parameters for both drivers are almost identical, since they are basically the same. So, I suggested to switch the drives and check if the problem is with the servo motor or the drive itself. After we made the change, and tried to start the machine, it gave us a new error. The other drive gave an error that there is a power leakage. We reset the machine and tried again, before any movement, the drive got fried so bad.

46,Writing in Engineering: How important is it? What can we do to make sure undergraduate engineers meet the standards of industry and academia?,1538716215,"I am currently a freshman doing a research project for my college writing course. The theme of the research is investigating  how undergraduate students become more proficient writer-practitioners in their field of study (i.e. engineering).

I don't know a lot about writing in the field of engineering besides the fact that engineers tend to write analyses, progress reports, and proposals. In general, I have observed that many undergrads feel that writing is not a crucial aspect of engineering. In contrast, many professors have claimed that writing is extremely important in every field STEM or not.

Here are my questions for you reddit engineers:

1.	What kind of writings do engineers do in industry and academia?

2.	How often do engineers write in industry and academia?

3.	Does being a better writer translate to more success in industry as much as it does in academia?

4.	Does the current undergraduate curriculum successfully prepare undergraduate engineers for writing in industry as well as academia? If not…

5.	What kind of education is needed for undergraduate engineers in order to improve their writing?

6.	Does practice of any type of writing successfully prepare undergraduate engineers for writing in the field? Should undergrads practice field specific writing instead (e.g. analyses, progress reports, project proposals). In your opinion does the type of writing curriculum taught in universities provide undergrads with a good expectation of what they will be writing in the field?

7.	How do we encourage all undergrads to go through this process of improving their writing? It appears that for many years, professors and industry leaders have been pushing the importance of writing in the field of engineering. Despite this, many undergraduate engineers feel that writing is not an important skill. Why? How do we change this ideal amongst students?

I am looking for some suggestions of where to look for force transducers for my project of measuring jump landing forces.

In previous studies they had mounted 6 strain gauges to the stanctions of the blade, they recorded forces up to 7-14 times body weight. Would it be possible to measure these kinds of forces simply using strain gauges or would I need a pretty heafty force transducer to pick up this amount of pressure?

52,"Hall Effect Sensor Application micro turbine, how did the stock system work, and how should I redesign?",1538702239,"This is a senior project. This is a micro jet turbine that we are attempting to improve thrust to weigh ratio on, and we need to redesign the controller. The propitiatory factory controller has tight fuel mapping to RPM and exhaust temperature, so if we change the exhaust nozzle for example, the controller sees that for a given RPM the exhaust temperature is not within design parameters and it shuts down. Everything on the controller has been easy to re-design, but the problem is sensing the RPM, and trying to replicate the stock system. To be clear, we are aware of the safety risks and appropriate PPE and measures are taken during development, the department has to approve test procedures etc. The turbine is a JetCat p90, the pill magnet is under the little purple cap in the center of the compressor. The stock system is roughly drawn below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When rotating, I see nothing, I need to hold the magnet within 5mm or so to see the hall effect sensor work. It seems to work exactly like every hall effect sensor I have ever used. But in the stock configuration it is 35mm away from the magnet and I see nothing at all when testing at starting RPM (not running the turbine, just the starter on a test bench). The sensor is on a PCB that has the exact application circuit from the 401 Hall Effect Datasheet page 18 ([https://www.micronas.com/en/system/files/downloads/files/HAL401\_Linear\_Hall\_Effect\_Sensor\_IC\_%28DSH000018002EN%29.pdf](https://www.micronas.com/en/system/files/downloads/files/HAL401_Linear_Hall_Effect_Sensor_IC_%28DSH000018002EN%29.pdf)) 

&amp;#x200B;

It would be nice to have a setup similar to the stock system, but I cant seem to find any applications notes that have a hall effect sensor working at this range with such a weak magnetic field. It is also possible that a previous project damaged the sensor, so if this seems like a perfectly reasonable application, let me know. I do see the anticipated voltage change when I hold the magnet close to the sensor, but nothing when in the stock location.

&amp;#x200B;

So now my questions: Has anyone gotten a sensor to work similar to this, any pointers? Any ideas for a redesign that would work more reliably than this configuration?

75,First engineering job after ME degree. Having some issues. Wondering if I have a bad ME team or this is just how it is.,1538669852,"Ok. So I graduated with a BS ME degree (ABET accredited) in December 2017. I accepted a position after that as the Industrial Engineer at a small/medium sized manufacturing automotive parts supplier. I’m apart of the Manufacturing Engineering group. I’m mainly responsible for our capacity, plant layout, labor quoting, and a few other things. Pretty standard Industrial Engineer stuff. 

Upon first starting here I noticed a lot of the other MEs were fairly hostile towards our boss (ME Manager) who had been at the company for 7 years, left for 1 1/2 years for a startup company, and is now back in his old position. A lot of the team seen him come and go for that so I assumed that was the source of the aggravation. 

I’ve now been here 10 months. Over that time we’ve had our 3 primary manufacturing engineers leave for other opportunities. They were the only members of the team that could use CAD apart from me. I am now the only person that holds an ME degree on our team. The rest are much older guys that have 10-15 years of maintenance experience. So as a result of this I have taken on all my usual job responsibilities on top of doing ALL of our CAD work. I was initially promised a pay raise to compensate me for my new job responsibilities, and was actually offered one of our Manufacturing Engineering positions the morning that the last guy resigned. But my boss ended up hiring another older guy without a degree to fill the position without communicating any of this to me. And has basically had me covering both positions during the job search all the while I was thinking I was getting the new job, but I’m still in my position with added responsibilities and no pay raise. (I was told just to be patient about 5 months ago, haven’t heard a word since)

And on top of all that I had a meeting this morning with my boss to discuss my leaving work early one day this week. My father had a heart procedure so I left the office about 2 hours early (didn’t mention it to anyone at the office, just left. But the company culture is comprised of an entire office of people sneaking around to leave early). We have hourly techs who are constantly trying to see which engineers have left early because they’re aggravated at their hours and aren’t exempt. He said many contradicting things also. 1 that the MEs don’t have set working hours, but that 8:00am-4:45pm was the bare minimum. I told him I would have never left had any work been pending or if anyone had needed me for anything. He claims it isn’t about that but that if he needed me he didn’t know where I was. (This has been the theme in the past also. If I leave early at all I will probably receive a text asking where I am (never asking about any pending work, only curious if I have left))

I’m basically just curious how close this is to a typical ME team or if this is an exception and I should seek other employment? I’ve been submitting applications for other positions this week. But all this today has really motivated my search. 

TL;DR: Only ME team member with a degree. Am doing all the CAD work for an entire team of old guys with a lot of maintenance experience. Am also being hassled about work hours even though all of my work is always 100% caught up.

I'm 22 years old recent graduate from a UC in Electrical Engineering, I currently work at a PCB manufacturing company. My compensation is fair I assume since I had no internships during school other than business/marketing related ones but my GPA was never good enough to obtain an internship at a lab or engineering company. Lets be honest I struggled with engineering, id study hours, nights and obtained a mediocre GPA overall 2.67 and major a 2.3. Classes where I felt the professors didn't care and TA's id flat out just give up entirely or study bad by reading the textbook word for word, classes where the professors had good notes, cared and TA's had extended office hours id be there all the time and I did receive a few B's and B+ at times but not often. Mainly in major classes id receive B-, C+, C- and some D's. I feel like where I work at is a good skill to have and I could learn a few things but I don't think there is some serious electrical engineering going on here. I feel like I'm wasting my time being here and I want to do more complicated things related to signal processing and communications since those are my specializations and I tried really hard to be good at those classes because I seriously enjoyed it.

Hi guys,

I'm currently a student studying engineering in my penultimate year (still have a semester left).

I'm currently in a part-time student role in a larger council (started in mid-July with 6 other recruits), but I just got offered an internship position full-time over Nov to Feb at a much larger firm (tier 1 multi-national firm).

This firm is bigger, and I would think that I would be exposed to more different work (and maybe interesting) work in a private consultancy environment.

I would like to take the offer, but I do not know how to bring it up to my manager or HR system.

I was thinking of just being straightforward, saying that I scored an internship in where I would want to take the opportunity in, while still thanking their time in giving me some experience in the current role.

But in doing so, when would be the best time? Should I just bring it forward in my next shift ? I also hope they don't take it as a slight, especially if they had hoped I would be staying longer. My direct manager that I report to, seems quite nice and understanding so i hope he will get the message.

There are similar forum based sites out there, but none that tap into the needs and communication preferences of the current younger generation of engineers in traditional disciplines.

My questions for you are:

1) Do you see a similar need for this based on your experience? 2) If made available, what functions or features would be most helpful to entry to mid level engineers? 3) What obstacles do you see this project facing? this is reddit so I'm guessing most responses will focus on this ;)

Any comments are appreciated. Thanks for your time. I'm happy to answer any questions to give you a better idea of our vision!",AskEngineers,False,weezer8o,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9l91dw/messaging_service_for_young_engineers_by/

93,Are there electric motors with electromagnets for both the rotor and stator?,1538618791,"As far as I know, motors have a permanent magnet side and an electromagnet side. Like a typical set up has the stator as the electromagnet side and the rotor as the permanent magnet side. 

Given energizing a rotating object is more of a challenge than a stationary object, I understand the reason why motors are set up the way they are. But they are set up that way for a brushed DC motor (The rotation of the rotor itself changes the poles of the rotor)

Couldn't a bigger magnetic field be generated in a smaller package as an electromagnet compared to a permanent magnet? Theoretically, can't the stator match the frequency of the rotor with a slight phase shift to keep it just ahead of the rotor? Shouldn't that allow for a lot of torque?

I am an EE student about to graduate concentrating in power at an well accredited engineering university (with kinda low grades). My goal was to find smaller companies that would hire me in a related field (maybe lean toward a field like engineer?).

I met with some companies today and one I got an interview for said they don't do utilities work but they like go to a project, see what the employers want, and then provide an estimate and options for the employer for equipment and such. This was not what I expected but I was intrigued. They did say you don't NEED to be an engineer, but they said one of their best guys WAS an EE. Apparently this position is a lot of looking through data and picking the right parts. 

I don't know what to think of this. If I took a job like this would my degree (with the pain, suffering, and awful tuition bill) go to waste in a job that doesn't need it? Or can an EE background excel?

99,Gravity battery powered by water from my well,1538606391,"This is crazy. Please either ignore my post, reaffirm my ideas, or discintigrate them with reason so I can quit this obsession! Or just read on if you need a laugh. 

A bit of back story first. I am looking to move to my off grid 40 acres next year, and I would like to have an on demand source of power without traditional battery power storage, or the constant need for a fuel generator.  Think something I could use to run a load of laundry or use power tools for a project for an hour or two. 

I am having a well drilled with a windmill pump installed to provide water for the house, garden, animals etc. I have no need for air conditioning or most other big power consuming appliances, just laundry and some power tools. 

My idea is to have a maybe a 50 gallon water container hanging some 20+ feet high attached to my windmill tower at the highest point of my property.  The tower will have a water tank filled by the well whenever wind is sufficient, and this elevated tank will refill the container. The container will hang with an appropriately sized cable on a spool attached to a heavy duty gearbox to very slowly descend toward the ground creating power with a generator as it descends. This gravity battery idea is nothing new, but how to reset it? 

The container is guided down precisely by a pair of poles and descends toward a water storage tank directly below it. When it reaches the tank, a valve on the bottom dumps the water rapidly into the tank below it. Once it is emptied, a counterweight will pull up the now much lighter container disconnecting and closing the valve.  The container will need to disengage the gear box precisely before it connects to the valve to allow it to seat quickly, and to allow the counterweight to return it to the top quickly to begin filling with water again. 

When the first container is disengaged from the gearbox, a second container already full of water engages the gear box, and begins its descent along its pair of rails to do the same process as the first. 

The ground tank they empty into would tie into the water supply used at the house and around the farm and not be wasted. 

I have plenty of mechanical aptitude to accomplish something like this, but I have a feeling it would only work on paper.

13,How much does changing a lathe affect the final product?,1538594219,"So my question comes from a vendor that wants to upgrade their lathe from an old 70's era machine to a modern one.  They claim they will use the same cutting tool and the new machine has tighter controls and so they can forgo fatigue testing on the new parts.  The machine is cutting threads in titanium for a critical application.  I know that machining causes some surface residual stresses but I don't think it would be possible to measure the residual stress at the most critical point in the root of the thread.  The part does get shot peened afterward which should relieve the stress, but again I don't know that the shot will reach the thread roots.  While going to a new machine sounds better, is there any to prove they are making identical parts without going through fatigue testing?  Fatigue testing can be very sensitive to certain factors.  One thought that came to me is that an older machine is probably largely bulky with lots of cast iron or steel and a new one is likely lighter.  Would that lead to potentially more vibration that could make some un-measureable changes in the final product.  Or do new machines have a way to offset this?

27,Would it be possible to make a hand powered refrigerator using a syringe as a compressor?,1538576180,"So a typical fridge compresses a refrigerant, condenses it, and then lets it evaporate. 


If I used a suitable refrigerant, like butane/lighter fluid, which liquefies easily, would it be possible to make a very small scale hand powered version of a fridge? 


Here's what I imagine:


* Take a length of tube and hot glue it to the outlet of a bic lighter. (Tube acts as evaporator coil, lighter button acts as expansion valve).

* Take the other end of the tube and put on a check valve and put it into the syringe. Pump the syringe a few times to remove as much air as possible from the tube. (syringe acts as compressor)

* Put the tip of syringe into the lighter's refill thing, also with a check valve. (lighter acts as condenser)


Would this work? I press the lighter button to let gas escape out the tube and into the syringe, expanding and cooling as it goes. Butane vapor pressure is 2 ATM, so the plunger on the syringe automatically moves back as the syringe fills. Then at some point I push the syringe forward, injecting gas back into the lighter, where the gas condenses into liquid butane (No idea if this is possible)

28,A few questions about geotechnical engineering?,1538574915,"I'm a first year university student in Canada and I'm not sure what I want to do. I was looking at geology but it seems that the job prospects are not that good and I'd have to travel a lot, which is something I would rather not do. I have done what research I could using google but I would still really appreciate the input of real engineers.   
   
1) Does geotechnical engineering involve a lot of traveling to find a job? Do you think it is in decent demand in Canada?   
2) Does the job involve tight deadlines? Can you come home and leave work at work or do you keep stressing about it?   
(this is one of  my main worries. My personality is such that I stress about unfinished work all the time)   
3) what I gather from the internet is that this field of engineering has more fieldwork and less sitting in front of a   
computer. This means that I could leave work at work and not stress about it at home, since I can't very well do field   
work any other time. To what extent is this true?  
4)  Do you have any regrets about choosing geotechnical engineering? is there anything you would've done different?

Unfortunately, this requires a good deal of plumbing design and I am a complete novice in the area. I hope you would be willing to answer some of my questions.

Now, we are planning to hold the Kerosene and LOX in two separate tanks (likely purchased from the local scuba supply store) and to pressurize them with either carbon dioxide or helium. I'll be purchasing a vacuum-insulated dewar from ARC3 and the kerosene will either come from a gas station or the local airport. The only other relevant info I can provide at this time is that the flow rate for the kerosene must be about 6.534 in\^3/s, the LOX flow rate must be about 7.209 in\^3/s and that the combustion pressure must be about 200 psia.

Now for the wall of questions:  Will scuba tanks suffice for my needs? What sorts of pressures will they be under? Will the dewar ARC3 provides have a liquid tap included? How should I go about insulating the LOX tank so it doesn't all evaporate before I can burn? What sort of hoses should I purchase and what kinds of standard connectors will they use? How should I go about designing the electronics that handle the solenoids? Do I need to purchase special solenoids, vents, pressure regulators? Do I need to worry about vacuum-insulated hoses?

52,Program management Co-Op and what it has taught me; where do I go from here?,1538504065,"This fall I accepted a 3-semester-long co-op at a plastics manufacturing facility. The experience is invaluable and I couldn't have asked for a better position, especially at my age and mediocre GPA. I've essentially begun paving the foundation for my career. 

Though the most valuable thing I've learned from the position isn't engineering or management related; it's what my life will be like once I graduate. I'm confronted by an archetypal existential crisis. I've got a good work ethic and can get a lot of stuff done, but working the full 40 hours (some people work up to 60 a week here) leaves me with so little time to do the things that I feel give my life meaning (music, travel, art, socialization, exercise, etc). Socialization is SO much harder, and I've been fighting to continue interacting with people my age. I don't dislike the work; in fact, the facility is nice and conditions are relatively low stress compared to other career horror stories ive heard about. but seeing the angsty employees that have been here for years gives me a bleak look into my future. 

If I were to find a wife and begin working toward a family, then I could put in 60 hour weeks and not complain in the slightest. Everything I would do would be for them. But I don't want to get married hastily. However, if I'm working full time, not meeting new people, and still struggling to get everything done, it seems unlikely I'll be in an environment conducive to finding an SO. Besides, I believe I should find personal fulfillment individually, outside of a spouse. I know I'm young and have a lot of time, but I can't help considering these sorts of things now, given that I have the most control over the arc of my career right now.

I chose to study Mechanical Engineering because I love math, to build and design things. But most importantly, I chose it so I could be flexible because of the extra money I'd make over, say, a degree in a foreign language. I would love to excersize that flexibility. Is there such a job where I could make an engineer's salary and only work 20-30 hour weeks? Hell, at my previous job I did a 40 hour week M-R and it was far preferable to working fridays. Alternatively, are there jobs where I could grind nonstop for six months and then get the next six off?

What if I busted my ass for fifteen years, living very frugally and investing in mutual funds, so that I could take a hiatus in my mid thirties to travel or spend time doing other things like trying to start a business (thats just an example, I believe something like that would be fulfilling)? I could put my money into a rental property and live off the rent people would pay. Then, I could return to the engineering side of things whenever (I know a hiatus wont look as good my resume but i wont mind the salary setback if the years I take of are genuinely fulfilling).

What is your all's experience? Do you feel fulfilled in your work? What do you attribute that fulfillment to? Have any of you been in a similar existential situation? What changed that for you? What would you do differently In hindsight?

 Am I just whining and should I hush and be thankful for the opportunities I've been given? Am I asking too much when (above) i said I would like a lighter work week/year with a comparable pay rate?

I'm studying the second year of a three-year technical ""stage"" in school where I'll study for a masters degree afterwards. I'm seventeen and will start university at 20. (Swedish school system) I'm leaning towards a masters in mechanical engineering or mechanical engineering-technical design. Both masters are a 5 year plan and I'll become what sweden calls Civilingenjör (civil engineer?)

I like to make stuff (like woodwork) and draw but also figure out clever solutions and my line of school doesnt have any design aspects to it. 3D CAD is also a lowkey passion, as well as drafting.
Maths and physics arent that hard for me to do and I am prepared that whatever I do there's a lot of hard work.

I have the following problem:

I have a series of data (they are temporal sequences) with features calculated on them.

The features are the derivative and other things like that.

The problem I have encountered is that since my time series have different lengths, the length of the features I'm going to calculate is variable. I can have a series of features of a timeline equal to 100 and another equal to 60. I would use a classifier (like SVM or something) to classify these data, but how should I do to obtain features with a fixed size to give to the classifier?

So I guess the title says it all. I was a transfer student, so I had only 2 years to squeeze out as much as I could. During undergrad I was extremely dedicated to school and getting/giving opportunities. I started an honor society at my campus and was the president of the AIChE (chem e club) chapter at my school, captain of the fuel cell car team, was extremely involved in everything from volunteering and field trips, to working on extra projects, and was at school Monday-Sunday every week from sun up to sun down working hard on building a better life for both myself and classmates. I guess getting into the working life 3 months ago has had some shocking realizations. I dont have nearly as much to do at all, I feel like I could perform this job with an 8th grade education, and the job satisfaction I yearned for so much (making a difference, being valued for working hard) is just absent from my job. The reason I got into Chem E was not the same reason as 95% of my classmates ($). Ultimately I wanted to work in the energy sector - particularly, Nuclear and make a difference as I know we dont have much gas, oil or coal left on a global scale. Many of the people I've talked to have told me about how this a very altruistic ideal, but I'm still convinced I can contribute my knowledge and skills towards something in the nuclear industry. So I guess I'm at a cross roads now and would like some insight from reddit as I use the site often but have never posted. 

Some options I've researched so far (not exhaustively, so open to any insight) - 

1.) Getting into the Navy as an officer for the nuclear engineering program 

Pros- great benefits, serving the country, traveling around on a ship /sub for 4 years, getting invaluable experience and expertise, becoming more desirable and attractive to employers once out, good compensation 

Cons- a large commitment to the armed forces of both life and effort, potential isolation being on a ship for 4 years (with breaks in between, of course, but still), less pay than private sector, difficult to build a life for 6 years 

2.) Going into the reserves (air force or navy) and getting the GI bill to go to school of my choosing after 1 year of service for nuclear engineering 

Pros- great benefits, less commitment, still can have a civilian life and job, can go to a different type of school instead of being stuck in Connecticut for 2 years for the Nuclear program in the enlisted route 

Cons- no experience in the nuclear field, never know when you'll be deployed, less work for the force, have to wait 1 year to get school training 

3.) Opening up my own business in food services (I have a huge passion for cooking and producing good for you products - making a difference in people's lives) 

Pros- huge impact in peoples lives, money if successful, can hold a regular job to a certain point,  travel, business write offs

Cons- time, resource, and effort intensive, huge risk, becomes priority over all other things in life, strains relationships, probably a lot more cons that I'm not seeing currently 

4.) Masters in N.E. online while working 

Pros- can continue to get experience in the engineering field while having my company pay $5000 in my tuition per year, overall reducing the total cost as well as gaining valuable resume building skills, attend school from the comfort of my own home, do homework on my own time, still be in the area, open up more opportunities in the nuclear field (I think) with this new degree 

Cons- have to pay the rest of the 20k for tuition, have to continue with unsatisfied work conditions, wont have much of a life with work and school 

5.) Masters in N.E. but quit current job and move to somewhere like Boston or Michigan for the N.E. programs (currently located in CA) 

Pros- can focus full time on getting a degree, will be able to go to top rated schools, do my own pace 

Cons- costly, have to take out loans, no income, not sure if this will ultimately lead to entry in the nuclear industry 

6.) Switch careers to something in the nuclear field now for somewhere like Lawrence lab, particular accelerator, etc.

Pros- gets me to my goal faster than getting a second degree, will enjoy my work and purpose, will gain experience in the field I want, will pay well based on research of median incomes for nuclear work

Cons- have no idea where to start, what opportunities are available to someone with a B.S in chem e, what credentials are required (other than researching online from job boards etc.)

So there is pretty much what's floating around in my brain at the moment. Any insight from people with experience in the chemical, nuclear, military (air force, navy), or engineering field would be much appreciated, and any advice you could give a young professional just starting out would be invaluable to me.

1,How do I prepare for a Ph.D. engineering program without any background?,1538415892,"Hi,

I am a  junior BS Polymer Chem major at UNC Chapel Hill. My research for last 2  years centers around development of a bio-analytical cancer model.

I  am at the point where I begin to explore exactly what I want to do in  the future. Will be applying next cycle (Fall of 2019). I want to do a  Ph.D. for sure, because I want to have academia as an option. I am  strongly considering engineering, because I realize I love both my major  and my research. Biomaterials is the perfect marriage of the two,  namely tissue engineering.

My problem is  that UNC doesn't have a engineering school. Unfortunately, I didn't  applied to the only engineering program offered (biomedical) and am too  late now to do so. In terms of major courses, I take more than what  polymer major requires, i.e. taking higher analytical &amp; biochem  classes at UNC. In terms of physics, I have taken up gen physics 1  (classica mechanic + relativity) and gen physics 2 (electromagnetism and  quantum mechanics)- **however**, I  am horrible at physics and received C+ in both classes... In terms of  math, I have taken calc 1-3 and differential equations, with all grades  above B+.

How do I prepare for lacking physics and math? I can't fit any more classes into my already hellish schedule. I can *try* to learn the subjects on myself. How much will I struggle if **frankly I don't remember squat from these courses.**  I am doing fairly well in my major courses, currently with 3.6 GPA. My  strongest area is in research, with 4 fellowships/awards (1 national), 1  second author paper (3-4 papers in preparation), and fantastic\~strong  LORs from PI and faculty mentors. I also have good  extracurricular/leadership activities.

I have a BSEE and originally wanted to take a job in software because I thought it was fun. As an intern yes, but now as a full-time employee not so much. 

I can't see a future doing this and I want to go into power design/engineering. I've been applying to a few jobs a week for the past month and haven't gotten responses. I've reached out to friends and other colleagues from my courses as references to hiring opportunities within there jobs. I get emails of people to contact and apply but similarly no responses from HR. 

I reached out to a professor who I did undergraduate research with and she told me if I were interested she'd love to have me as a PhD student. From my experience with my undergraduate research it was very hands on and working with some of the big local companies solve relevant industry problems. It seems like a good opportunity that may not come up again if I let it pass.

I'm honestly worried that with only BSEE the job opportunities that I have will be limited. I don't want to be stuck doing the same everyday with minimal thought plug and play solutions for the next several decades like I am with software.

The only doubt I have in my mind is the ROI for 4 years at ~$24k as PhD along with future job opportunities (I don't think I want to be in academia). I've read through other threads and heard from some of  my peers how a PhD limits your job pool, but a couple people I know seem to have gotten great jobs at national labs or work interesting projects.

8,Suggestions for Engineering Projects for High Schoolers,1538400809,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I teach Engineering I and II at my school, and was wondering if people had suggestions/ideas for good projects for them to work on. I did not take any Engineering classes in college, so my class is mainly project-based and in groups where students are given a problem, are given time to research and plan a solution, they construct their design, the design is tested, they then reconstruct a new and improved design, and finally communicate their results in a paper and presentation. I have all of the projects figured out for Engineering I, but am struggling a bit with Engineering II. Here are the projects that we have done so far:

Egg-Drop

Wind-powered car

Mousetrap Car

Balsa Wood Glider

Electric powered boat

Rube Goldberg Machines

Hurricane Proof Houses

Balsa Wood Bridge

I need 1-2 more projects to finish they year, and I would love if one of them was in the branch of biomedical engineering (I wanted to have them make a prosthetic arm, but I was told this would be too challenging). My school does not have a ton of funding for materials, so suggestions need to use pretty basic materials if possible. Also, the performance of their design is used as a test grade, so there needs to be a way to quantitatively test and assess the design. Any suggestions would be great, and specific resources would be even better! Please reach out with any suggestions or questions.

Long story short, I absolutely *love* it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to eventually get into a role that involves more equipment, process or even plant design but I know that I will need education in engineering before any employer will take me seriously for a position like that.  I was ecstatic when I found out that getting a masters degree in an engineering discipline is possible with a non-engineering BS.  Surprisingly enough, I would need to take the same amount of prerequisites for all three of the fields I'm most interested in: Electrical, chemical and manufacturing.  I'd prefer to pursue my degree while still working and since my current contract position doesn't afford me any tuition reimbursement, I'm using the next few months to educate myself and figure out which degree is a best fit for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, engineers of reddit:  Do you have any suggestions on books or sources of information that could give me a good big picture view of these fields?   Or do you have any personal anecdotes or opinions as to which is better and why?

48,Career help: should I take Bs.CS after Bs.ME?,1538293068," 

Hey all!

Quick intro to my issue: So I already graduated with a bachelor in Mech. Engineering. After working for 1 year as a CAD drafter (the job was half-automated through VBA macros with SolidWorks API), I realized I wasn't learning anything in my position, and felt like I would be stagnating after a few years there with nothing new in my head to climb up the career ladder. I do like the mechanical engineering subjects, especially material mechanics and fluid dynamics. 

At the same time, I have discovered programming to be quite interesting as well, with what seems to be very varying everyday life with new problems to solve and a lot of on-the-job learning. I'm also interested in living a ""digital nomad"" life eventually, to travel the world. I am an active investor as well, and I can possibly see myself working in this sphere later on through for example programming trading algorithms also.

&amp;#x200B;

This year I started my 2nd bachelor degree in Computer Science. It is fully paid for by the state (I was one of the lucky few who qualified for a budget place), and I get a good deal on my student loans (once the degree is completed, only 60% has to be paid back). Financially it is a good option, and since I have a hard time finding jobs/internships in programming without any experience in it and an ME degree, I decided that taking this free education would be the best option. After this first semester I will look for part-time jobs/internships to start filling my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

My worries nowadays though is that I'm doing something unnecessary; as in if taking a 2nd degree is worth the time? I feel like I would lose out on so much by spending another 3 years in university, when that could have been spent working full time. At the same time, it seems like the right thing to do to give me an entry at least to the programming field. At one point, I would love to utilize both my mechanical engineering education and computer science education, so below I have listed a few options I am considering:

1. Complete enough of my CS degree to qualify for a full-time job as a programmer, through also doing internships/part-time jobs. Drop out of the CS program and work full-time for 2-3 years, gain enough experience for more advanced positions.
2. Fully complete the CS degree, with internships and full-time jobs. With a full degree, I can probably apply to more advanced positions for software engineering etc.
3. While studying CS, keep doing ME related jobs or internships. This would allow me to build a stronger ME foundation to get more advanced design jobs, with a foundation in programming to allow me to work on software as well, either automating design processes or FEA calculations etc.

What I hope to get to one day would be a job within robotics or aerospace, or CFD/FEA calculations, or a programing job. I don't know other possibilities for combining ME and CS, so the above options are kind of what I have at this point - feel free to suggest more. That is more long-term though, and being able to live the ""digital nomad"" lifestyle for 1 year or so is something I plan on doing regardless, to travel around the world. I am also interested in start-ups, and I figure having both mechanical and software skills for both hardware and software design could be benificial.

&amp;#x200B;

66,Career outlook in battery design,1538242872,"[Cross posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnergyStorage/comments/9jyuow/career_outlook_in_battery_design/) to r/EnergyStorage

# Background

Over the last 15 years, there has been an explosion of applications for large lithium-ion batteries in automotive, industrial, and grid balancing. The field is growing, and (to the eye of a non-expert) shows no sign of slowing.

Someone has to design, manufacture, and maintain all of these systems. And as more batteries are demanded, it would seem that we will need more engineers with the specialized knowledge of battery design. 

Large battery design is unique in that it requires a comprehensive knowledge of mechanical engineering (thermal, structural), electrical engineering, software (BMS), and chemistry. If you have a large engineering team, these roles can be split up across multiple specialized engineers. However, you need architects that can see the larger picture. Thus far, there are very few courses available in University undergraduate programs which allow people to gain this skillset. It seems to be mostly gained from experience and individual research/experimentation.

Because the knowlege/skill-set is difficult to gain, and the field is new and growing, my hypothesis is that there currently is (or soon will be) a shortage of talent in the battery design field.  

# About me

I am a 4th year mechanical engineering student in Canada. Through an electric racing student team (FSAE electric), working on an electric car team for a major automotive company, and working in a research lab, I have been part of the design/build/test process for three separate large EV batteries. Thus far, I have enjoyed battery design far more than any other area of engineering, and have sought to educate myself, gaining knowledge in areas outside my primary discipline (mechanical).

I am now considering battery design as a long term career. 

# Questions

There is little information available on the prospects of a career in batteries. I need to know about salary, job security, room for growth, and the best way's to get into the field, etc. If you can, I think myself and others would benefit from answers to the following questions:

1. What is the job outlook for large battery design engineers? Is there currently a shortage or surplus of talent?
2. How much do/can battery design engineers make?
3. Where are the ""hot-spots"" for battery design? Country, city, etc.
4. What level of education is required? Is it worth it to get a MASc?
5. What advice would you give to someone that wants to design batteries?

During the interview process, I was told that the position was a mix of general engineering office work and field work, and that I would at times be responsible for CQA (construction quality assurance) - completing and submitting reports, working on CQA and safety plans, etc. In my offer letter they specified ""occasional overnight stays and work on weekends"" but ""generally a standard 40+ hour work week"".

I've been working for just under 2 months, and now I'm finding out that my position is expected to also do CQC (construction quality control) in the field, documenting the whole construction process and ensuring everything is done correctly. It isn't exactly what I was told in my interview, but whatever - I'll get the opportunity to see the field a little more than I expected. Not an overall bad deal, or so I thought...

Right now I'm currently on a landfill working with a crew of 3 members. Their supervisor is gone. The next closest person ""in command"" is new to the company and is unfamiliar with the policies. My principal engineer promised me that I would have one of the construction supervisors on site with me to answer questions, AND that we'd have an experienced CQC here to work with me and show me the ropes. However, I get to the site, and neither of these people are here.

I cannot answer the questions that the construction crew is asking me, because I was not trained to do this. When I call the engineers in my office to ask questions, they're really dismissive and tell me that this is easy work, I should just ""understand it"". I understand how to fill out my logs, but I was never fully briefed on the safety information, never told what to expect, I was literally given a ONE WAY plane ticket to the job site with no expectated completion date. I was told ""we'll just keep extending your hotel reservation until it's finished and buy you a plane ticket back whenever the project is over"". I was also promised a company credit card for expenses on trips during my interview, but they did not get the card to me in time. For now I'm paying for everything out of pocket, expecting to be reimbursed in the next 2 months.

Crew members rarely wear their hard hats, and constantly smoke on the landfill. I ask them to stop, and call their supervisor but am essentially told ""not to worry about it unless OSHA or the client comes up on the landfill"". My employer has asked me in the past to delete pictures/records of employees not wearing their hard hats. There are tasks that require TWO crew members to work over a 100'+ borehole, but the company only supplied us with ONE safety harness. I was given a personal gas meters, but the rest of the crew was not, even though the client's policy states all employees working on site must have the meters on their person.

I expected to be thrown to the wolves somewhat, but I honestly feel like I'm being dicked around a little bit here. Am I being unreasonable? Is this a common experience in the engineering world? I feel extremely unsafe, and would prefer that an actual trained, experienced CQC person was here to work with me. My name is attached to these reports but I don't feel comfortable certifying that this construction project was done safely, or to the standards set out in our CQA plan.

I'd appreciate any advice or recommendations you could give me.

Ever since I was a kid I felt I was worse at math then other people and had very little attention to detail. Math is tough but when I put in a lot of time and effort and manage to solve a problem, the feeling is amazing. Thus I was thinking about studying engineering since it's about problem solving, but I'm not sure I'll like (or be good at) the job itself. In real life I'll be given big, stressful projects to do right? And there's strict deadlines which I suck at maintaining. In school there's assignments too but I can choose to take a lighter course load to decrease the pressure. I can't to that with a real job. So in case it becomes something that makes me miserable, how easy would it be for me to switch to a job that is less about overseeing big, complex projects and more about working with people and figuring out what I can do to achieve the best balance of happiness between them and upper management?

81,How does your company coordinate information on complex tools between teams?,1538187418,"Background:  At my work, we make tools that are *very* intricate.  We will have a mix of electrical components (motors, analog/digital sensors, analog/digital I/Os), mechanical components (several types of fluids each with their own plumbing and controllers, manual valves, regulators), and several layers of software (GUI, back-end architecture, module-level software, and a controller to interface with OEM firmware).  Due to this, it feels like every other week I'm trying to reverse-engineer a mountain of black boxes.  The mechanical and electrical parts make sense and they're stored in a central location (several mechanical or electrical schematics).

&amp;#x200B;

But the software is a complete mystery.  Not only to myself, but to a lot of the other engineers.  For example, earlier today I had a flow controller I swapped out (new one has a higher resolution and flow rate, among other things).  But it's causing the tool to timeout because a value somewhere in one of the literally hundreds of screens (each of which has several dozen variables) needs to be adjusted and I have no idea which one it is.  I keep having to waive down 4-5 other engineers and techs or wasting an hour or longer looking through and or guess-and-check to find out how something should work.

I graduated last March from a pretty well known school with a GPA hovering around 3.50. I don't have any internships and I know I shot myself in the foot there, but that's the reality. 

I've only started job hunting earlier this month because I honestly wasn't quite ready to join the workforce quite yet.

While I would love to do something involving robotics, I need some engineering experience to start off with.

But I recently applied to a Field Service Engineer role and the company said   I wasn't a good fit for the engineer role, but if I wanted to get my foot in the door, I could be in consideration for a Field Service Technician role. I politely declined, but I'm wondering if I'm being too picky. 

I've read horror stories of people who get pigeon-holed into technician roles or how technician jobs look bad on an engineering resume. But is there any merit to that?

88,How do I find out if I don't like engineering or if I'm not competent enough for it?,1538173313,"honestly, i believe that i never liked my electronics engineering studies.  i somehow ended on enrolling this faculty, well, because I had to choose something after finishing the high school (education is free in my country, so...). i  used to learn only few  days before exams and luckily i managed to pass them (obviously with  rubbish grades). i also dodged all the lectures that were not compulsory and few times professor kicked me out of a lab, because of my mental absence/daydreaming.

now i'm employed. i've had few jobs so far, as a student and as a regular employee. in all jobs i  had horrible productivity. while there was maybe some initial interest, it just somehow worn off or something. hard to explain. finally i was fired due to lack of productivity, or i quit job to end the rat race  misery. sadly, being fired or quitting job this was the best event in each job, similarly as is was the best event of the work day to head it home. sometimes watching on time is just horribly painful, especially if i'm *really* not in the mood. i just feel tired and it's so freaking hard to start anything. it's so hard to deal with mentally challenging tasks, or to engage team conversations. However, it really depends on the mood that i'm in, but average is still very bad. however, i can help a lot if i drink energy drink or coffee. On the other hand, in some days, I'm totally fine and in those moments I think that I didn't make a miss with my career and I actually produce something. Unfortunately, this happens rarely.

Now the trick: The lack of productivity also extends to my hobbies, and not only to my professional side.  Here as well, I don't finish anything, everything becomes boring at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

Angles - Start with a huge circle and divide as necessary.  When shrunk down to a smaller circle, the error should be smaller.

Roundness - A rotating bar will become round if 2 bearings are constrained and the bar is machined with a stationary tool of sufficient rigidity.  Then move the bearings to the recently-machined portion.  Measuring the perpendicularity of the tool may be an issue.

Concentricity - Maybe not an issue if the roundness problem is properly taken care of??

Flatness - ?? Same ""scale-down"" approach as angles, immerse a large plane in a liquid of very low surface tension?  Then use that plane to make a smaller tool/instrument?

Parallelism / Perpendicularity- I'm not sure, but maybe something like a very long plumb-bob and a pool of liquid?  Related to flatness.

Straightness - ?? Most guides on how to make a wooden board straight begin with an already-straight board.  Could be done by making a round bar but a very long bar would bend during manufacture or require additional bearings which may not be concentric with each other.  Related to flatness.

Length - Start with a standard unit of length, then ??

2,How to connect steel pipes?,1538145729,"Seems like a very simple question, and should probably be asked in an askplumbing subreddit, but here I am.

Building an industrial injection mould cleaning cleaning machine. Ultrasonic cleaning, pressure spray and all that. We have tested all the systems individually, but are now at the point of trying to connect them all together and throw them in our prototype frame. The problem is that we haven't found an ideal way to connect the pipes.

A bit more information about the machine: max pressure 4bar/60psi, 60C/140F alkaline all purpose cleaning agents, maching oil coming off from the parts. At this point we have designed everything using 1"" and 1.25"" threaded stainless steel pipes.

There seems to be two problems faced when connecting the pipes:

1) Making sure they don't leak

2) Making sure that when the parts are fully tightened they are facing the correct direction. For example if you have a T-joint and have fully tightened the two parallel tubes, how do you ensure that the perpendicular joint is actually pointing in the direction you want it to?

From what I have seen the answers to 1) are Teflon tape, bonding adhesive and correct tightness. I'm not wholly convinced I have a solution to 2). All I can come up with is loosening the joints until they are oriented correctly and gluing or using flanged joints. Flanged joints would be a pain and require a lot of overhead for us.

Perhaps I should be looking into PVC piping?

3,New Product Development/ R&amp;D Release structure,1538145466,"Hi guys. I've run into a headbutting argument with management and operations a few times on NPD/R&amp;D releasing of prototype parts I EXPECT to change. These are parts that do not go to customers for approval and are mostly handled internally or with vendors. My preferred strategy right now is to use use alpha-numeric revisions (A, B, C, etc) to denote it is an NPD/R&amp;D part.

The issue arises when these parts need to change. Standard products (Rev 1, 2, etc) must go through the engineering-change-order (ECO) process and get approved by sales, engineering, operations, quality, and documentation. I understand this level of accountability is necessary to know what we did/have done for a product. But for NPD, things change and need to do so quickly. I made this process strictly to avoid the ECO process to speed things up so I can get them to vendors/internal manufacturing.

I'm getting pushback now that this kind of steps over the other departments, and they're right. It was designed that way to avoid the revision approval process so NPD doesn't need to interact with other groups to get it done. It goes through an internal NPD process, which has a quality, caricaturing, engineering, documentation, and project manager rep. It should be noted that the Rev 1 version of the part will be the same as the last alpha-numeric revision, when all the kinks and issues are worked out. After that step, it goes into the standard ECO process.

So my question for you all, what is your NPD/R&amp;D release structure look like? Does it have a lot of red tape? Is it similar to the one I described?

English is not my first language so I have trouble finding this type of things on google. I tried ""self-locking clamps"" ""friction clamps"" and many other terms. 

In spanish, I was told the name was ""tenazas mecánicas de fricción"", which would literally translate as ""mechanical friction pincers"", to no avail. A diagram of said mechanism can be found [here.](https://imgur.com/a/zidoAJi)

39,Should I quit my engineering career?,1538077989,"I am a junior software engineer and I am considering whether I should finally quit my engineering career or not. The problem is that I have under-performed in basically all of my jobs, but I'm not totally sure what could be the root cause, so that I would be able to act accordingly. I think that the matter is a bit complex and some psychological know-how might be required to find an underlying problem. However, I would still give it a try in r/AskEngineers as there might be some fellows who went trough similar stuff and therefore would be able to share an advice.

Under first point, I have to admit that I never truly liked my studies. I could have picked engineering discipline due to status and money. In addition, maybe I was always feeling like a loser so I could have picked something that could hold my confidence level higher, in this case studying engineering. I was always told that I have pretty much shredded confidence. However, the studies were pretty much a mixture of boredom and mentally intensive stuff, so I tried to dodge most of the lectures that were not obligatory. I learned only few days before exams - I stripped down all the ballast content and had only learned what I believed it's a very core of the subject. Luckily I somehow managed to obtain my masters in EE, with bad grades, with lots of luck and after multiple attempts to quit it and changing my mind in last minute. If I would go back in time and would be able to study again, I don't know what I would study. EE was kinda last minute choice.

As a student I was laid off at my first (part-time) job, not programming anything in few months span. While programming sounds like a cool thing, and while having an application done sounds like a cool thing as well, I think that I  always found programming boring and too much challenging. It feels absolutely impossible to persist with this mentally intensive task for a longer period measured in days, weeks or months. When I sit in front of PC and look into the programming IDE, I just get some weird feeling in my stomach. Then I program for 15-30mins and somehow I end in front of a fridge, on toilette, fidgeting with tabs in web browser, or in other words, doing something else that is not a programming. Finally I don't finish anything. And it's the same with my hobby projects. I just start a stuff, but not finishing anything. I feel like a master of starting projects, but never being able to finish anything. Similarly was happening with my other engineering hobbies - ie. electronics design, wood crafting, music making - I started stuff, but I rarely finished anything.  Maybe I am just trying to fool myself with this engineering stuff to prove myself to others. Or maybe i secretly like it, but I am incompetent for it and I cope with not finishing stuff.

When I'm at workplace, again I have that feeling of ""repulsion"" when staring in compiler. Besides never ending bug-hunt saga, which feels the hardest thing to do ever, the next hardest thing is probably just the thought that I have to do this stuff. Or start doing it.  I can usually make it for few hours, but after lunch I usually lose it. Sometimes i feel totally desperate. Often my work is just about watching on time when we're going to go home, and meanwhile pretending that I'm working. On most days I feel that my work is some boring pointless rubbish and not so rarely I'm totally down and I'm just hoping that I'll be fired. Rarely, I'm in good mood and I totally fall into programming task and my 8 hours pass like few hours. However, it might be that in these""good mood"" events I manage to somehow trick myself into believing that what I'm doing is actually a cool stuff, you know kinda mind-hack thing, or simply ""i'm just in the mood"" for some reason. Also, most of time I can't sit behind PC for more than one hour, unless I'm you-tubing or doing some fidgety, less-tiring stuff.

So basically, I am a bit more than halfway done with my BS in chemistry. I had to take a break, and now I’m looking at schools while working for a metallurgy company on third shift.

A. Going for a BS in chemistry, doing an online MS in materials science and engineering

56,What are some things that give piston engines good 'low-end' torque?,1538054932,"I've heard that the Jeep 4.0L is a very 'torquey' engine, and after owning one for a few years I can agree fully with the statement. But on paper to the untrained eye, the numbers aren't that impressive- peak is \~230 ft-lb at 3000 rpm. That's not a ton of turning force, and it's not as early as it feels when you're driving it. 

I've been pondering it alot lately- how come it takes so much to stall it then? One of my theories is that a straight 6 has a much longer crankshaft than a v6, and especially if it's cast iron, it'll have a much higher moment of inertia (it has a lot more rotating momentum, therefore it takes a higher load to stall it). Also, the cam isn't very aggressive- of the power produced from combustion at low RPM, the camshaft doesn't take much power to drive. Works well in low RPMs, but inhibits the engine from breathing well at higher RPMs. Also, it is a reverse-flow cylinder head... One more thing that keeps it from breathing well, and I would think the exhaust would heat up the intake air.

Kind of thinking out loud here, I just can't understand what makes this particular engine (and others like it) so 'torquey'. Even though its an older platform you have to try to stall it, even with a heavy load.

I'm part of a team that is trying to break the world record for largest blanket fort. I would love some feedback on what we can do to keep everything safe and up to code while staying within a budget. The fort will be a total of 6k sqft

The first issue is blankets! We will need at least 12k sqft of blankets and either need to buy fire rated blankets or take existing ones and make them flame retardant. As far as I've seen fire rated blankets will be very pricey and will lack diversity in style and color.

I've heard mixed reviews with spray on chemical flame retardant not being very effective and being very dependent on type of fabric and requiring many coats.

A cheap and effective solution I've been told of is treating them with borax but my understanding is this only works on natural fibers.

The fire marshal will be conducting flame tests on the fort. I would love to learn how to do this on my own and find out exactly what to look for.

I've had 10 interviews that were in the final round, and 14 phone interviews.  I'm still waiting on 2 MEP companies in Chicago, but they seemed underwhelmed by my lack of experience.

**My Background**

I graduated in May, 2018 from UIC with a 3.31 GPA in BSEE.  My only work experience is being a building service worker aide there.  I tried to get an internship but I wasn't able to.  I was vice president of Audio Engineering Society there, but we didn't really do electrical engineering projects.  Interviewers have been most interested in my senior project with Caterpillar.  I've spoken to a recruiter from CAT and there are no suitable jobs.  I passed the FE exam in May.  Since graduation I learned AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD MEP, and Revit through Lynda.  I know I don't want a career in pure software engineering.  I got an engineering graduate from UIUC that worked for career services to correct my resume.  I'd really like to stay in Chicago area due to family problems, but I'd relocate farther. 

**My Job Search Strategies**

I've talked to my/my family's/ my friend's contacts that work in engineering, and there won't be jobs.  I got an alumnus to pass my resume to his manager for an entry level test engineer job, and I didn't even get a phone interview.  I'll send LinkedIn messages to UIC alumni that work for engineering companies, and will have mutual connections introduce me.   
I've been to 3 engineering events at McCormick Place since January (I volunteered at AWEA.)  The contacts I've met there won't respond when I reach out to them, or they'll also be recent grads.  A couple of companies seemed pretty interested in me at the career fair last week, so I'll be calling them soon.  I've of course applied to 100+ jobs through job portals and UIC careers site.  I tailor each cover letter.   I've gotten about 5 interested responses from companies not in Indiana or Illinois, but they won't pay for expenses to do in person interviews.  I got to one final video interview for an MEP company in St. Paul.  I got an interview by sending a cover letter and resume to a company that didn't have any jobs posted (it's one of the pending interviews right now.)  I'll talk to recruiting agencies but I'm uncomfortable doing a 6 month contract job somewhere that I'll need to get a car and apartment.  My last interview rejection was for a 6 month automation engineer contract job 4 miles from my house.

**My Interviews**

I've had multiple sessions with people from Career Services/ Engineering Career Center at UIC working on interviews.  I'll practice common questions out loud and look at questions on Glassdoor.  I'll look up the interviewers, the company's Youtube channel, and every part of their site.  I've been told ""good question"" and that I know more about the company than other applicants.

81,How do I lube a trackball mouse well?,1537992178,"So I recently bought an ""Elecom Huge"" and have some problems with how smooth the ball is; it essentially has a problem wherein small movements just jerk instead of being smooth.

I'm not exactly sure what the material of the ball is made out of, I think ceramic? However I know the bearings that hold the ball are made out of ruby and are referred to as ""ruby bearings"".

For anyone curios on the dimensions of the device, here's a link:

https://www.trackballmouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Elecom-size-comparison-EX-G-DEFT-HUGE.jpg

It's the one all the way to the right.

I've tried various different lubricants so far:

Percy Nobleman's Moustache Wax -- so far the best one, however it's not exactly cheap, and it seems to only last for a couple of hours. This has beeswax in it and I think that might be the ""secret"", though I need to investigate further.

Sebum -- basically the oil stuff our bodies produce. It seems to kinda work, but the biggest problem I have with it is that it's in low supply and it's hard for me to get more of it...

3-in-1 multi purpose oil -- doesn't really do much.

Argan oil -- didn't really do much.

Lip balm -- I just had some lip balm lying around and wanted to try it, it didn't make a difference.

Butter -- I tried smearing butter on it, but sadly the effects were pretty bad...

I have also tried to polish the ball with a diamond polish at a micron level of 1.5, though that did not do anything, perhaps even made it worse.

Before I tried each of the methods above, I washed the ball with soap to clean it and get rid of any previous grime/oils etc...

So anyone have any experience in trackball lubrications? Or can just give me some advice on how to deal with this? I have been contimplating to use some actual grease, but I'll be using this with my hands so not sure how toxic it'd be to me.

Another thing I'm contemplating is buying a new ball, however I am unsure of which one to buy as there are different types one can buy, and I'm not sure on what size I should get because the Elecom's ball size is 52mm, so would a 50mm ball size work?

I was driving in heavy rain yesterday and my windshield wipers were going strong. I have a small radio transmitter that is plugged into my cigarette lighter which I use to listen to my phone music on the radio.

Now the curious thing is that I noticed whenever my wipers got to the far left, at the peak of their motion the radio signal would cut out. It was brief but the music suddenly got staticky. I increased the speed of the wipers and then the frequency of the disturbances got faster, still happening at the peak of the wipers motion. 

So what causes this phenomenon? My only guess would be that the wipers draw the most power at the peak of their movement because they require the greatest acceleration (very akin to simple harmonic motion). I'm not sure if this could potentially steal power away from the transmitter or not. Maybe it has something to do with the car's antenna? I'm not sure.

The kernels get pressed through a cylinder by a screw.

20,Membrane Distillation Senior Design Advice,1537907264,"TLDR; senior design project with membrane distillation practicality, any advice appreciated

Hello all,

For my senior design project, my team is working on something that must fit under the broad term of “use of solar energy and/or seawater desalination.”


One idea we would like to explore is that of membrane distillation. I found some literature on it and obtained some insightful full-texts of research papers. However, knowledge of this process still seems less common, and I am concerned if this concept proves too difficult to deliver a solid project on. I have some numbers from the research I found that I am basing some of my assumptions on.



In the process, essentially:
1. Run “hot” (60-80C) seawater in one direction (up to 800mL/min)  on one side of a membrane (pore size .22 micron)


2. Run “cold” (20-40C) pure water in the opposite direction on the other side of the membrane. 


3. The temperature difference leads to a difference in vapor pressure, which causes seawater to vaporize at the pores and join the rest of the pure water.


Pros: 37L/hour per square meter water desalination can be achieved at the highest temperature difference and highest flow rates. Still functions at less ideal conditions. We don’t have to reach boiling point to desalinate and temperature differential could be achieved through passive solar heating (tying in another aspect of the project). 99.99% salt removal can be achieved with the best materials. As long as there is a pump (manual or electric) driving the flows, and heat on the hot side, the system can run.


Cons: the membrane is costly. After 150-200 hours of running, scale clogs the pores (can be fixed by running some chemicals through). Seawater also has to be put through an initial filter to remove larger debris.


We would be building the chamber with the membrane, tubing for the hot and cold sides to run through, either an electric or manual water pump system, and a configuration on the hot side that absorbs thermal energy from the sun.


Our budget from the school is $700, with free machining and some free scrap metal. I would be willing to spend some of my own money as well. This project would be likely in the proof-of-concept region as opposed to the practical-product region (for now). Our deadline is middle of May 2019.

26,"Being told reports are ""too technical""/""not simple enough"" and being made to redo them - Advice?",1537897510,"I'm in a bit of a conundrum and wondering if anyone else has been in a similar position.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background: I'm a reliability engineer at a medical device company. This involves assessing the risk that hardware/software failures, user errors, etc. of our product portfolio poses to patients. We assess risk according to ISO 14971, which involves determining the range of harm severities that may arise from a particular failure mode, and then calculating the rate of occurrence of each of those harm severities using field data.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on that description, you can surmise that statistics and probability play a large part in reliability engineering. I've been working this position for a couple months now, and have been told by our quality directors that my reports are too technical or not simple enough. Being that this discipline relies heavily on statistics and probability, I use a fair amount of mathematical notation when drafting my reports. However, the notation I use isn't anything that an engineer wouldn't have encountered during their engineering undergrad (I'm using only algebra, no calculus), and I define each of my variables. Their argument is that this is alarming to the FDA or other regulatory bodies during audits, but I have been told that it is the quality directors that vouch for the work included in these reports, and not me. It seems that if I were given a reasonable amount of deference in matters related to reliability engineering and the opportunity to explain my own work to the auditors (and I have no problem explaining it), this would be a non-issue. But thanks to the massive degree of siloing at our company, the nature of the discussions between the auditors and the quality directors is not known to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been asked repeatedly to redo my work to simplify it, and have complied with these requests (to the detriment of other assignments) to the best of my ability, simplifying mathematical notation, supplementing equations with sentences describing what the equation signifies, creating line breaks before and after equations to enhance readability, creating separate supporting documents for the reports containing the ""nuts and bolts,"" and supplementing the notation with graphs, tables, and charts showing the data. I still get complaints that the equations are in there at all, but am concerned that if I remove them, significant information will be lost (after all, I use mathematical notation because it's \*more accurate\* than using sentences in trying to convey the meaning of an equation). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am growing concerned that my job will be on the line if I can't find a way to simplify my reports, since redoing my reports, after all, means I am getting less work done than other people on my team. I don't believe other members of my team use a great deal of notation (I haven't spent a whole lot of time reviewing their reports to verify for sure), but I have reached different conclusions when I've been reassigned their work. This is troubling because they have all been doing reliability engineering longer than I have, so I don't really know if I am in the place to say whether their conclusions are ""wrong."" I'm frustrated because I conduct my work with mathematical rigor in mind, trying to deduce the most accurate estimates of the rate of occurrence as possible, and then being punished for it.

28,[Advice] Clarification of Job and My Future,1537895654,"Hello Everyone,

I have been debating where the proper place to ask these questions would be and figured this would be a good spot. If anyone thinks there is a different place they would suggest, or if this place isn't the proper place, please let me know!

Background: I am a 26yr old who has mostly worked out of high school in jobs pertaining to my dreams. I have a 2 year degree in Business Management, but I spent my last 2 years of high school taking Engineering and Design classes at a trade school where I was the top of my class. Unfortunately, I did not capitalize on this opportunity by following it up and going to college after high school for Engineering. I have been on my own since graduation, with no support or help from family. I was constantly told that I wouldn't succeed at college. I have since acquired my Business Management degree while maintaining Presidents list throughout my degree. After that I got a job labeled as a ""Drafter"" through a local company. This is where my questions begin.

""Drafter"": My first question pertains to my current job, the position I was hired for was labeled as a ""drafter"". I do not have a degree in Engineering (though my current plans have me going back to college). However, I can't help but feel that the responsibilities and job description for what I do, does not match that of just a ""drafter"". I am responsible for every part of a project from receiving the architectural design from the client to handing the keys over after installing. We do High-End Retail counters across the country for ""fancy"" brands. My job duties include: Working with the client to maintain design aesthetic, producing full shop drawings of the design for our shop to build from. Drawing, sourcing, and ordering all materials (metal frames, finishes, fabrics, lighting, glass, etc), ensuring they all work and fit together with high accuracy. Working with the shop to ensure that the finished product is at the highest of quality and resolving any issues that may arise during production. My job is also to work with the GC on the project (we are classified as a Millwork Contractor), to ensure the site space matches the build, electrical is provided in the right location with the right connection, and the site is finished properly for our install. I am curious as to if ""Drafter"" is the proper title for this position, or what would be, and an estimation of what compensation would be considered fair (a range works, as I know it's all dependent on location, experience, etc.).

This brings me to my next question. As I feel that there is a glass ceiling at my current job. I have made it clear to management, that I wish to move up and utilize my business degree with the knowledge I have gained of this industry to move higher in the company as their has been an open position for ""project manager"" for sometime as our GM left abruptly who filled the duties late last year. However, the company has decided that my co-worker and I in our positions are to good at what we do to move up, and would rather higher from outside the company to take the position, than lose the production of either of us in my position. (We have more through-put with the 2 of us, than they have ever had with 3-4 people in the department before us. They also have tried finding help for us, but after 13 failed attempts of hiring ""drafters"" who were unable to do the job, they seem to have given up and are content with using us under a heavy work load.)

This has led me to consider going back to college, as I feel like I am not receiving fair compensation (50k/yr) for my abilities, through-put, and responsibilities with minimal room for growth in compensation (Started at 45k/yr 4 years ago which was UNDER the starting compensation as I had no ""formal experience in the industry"" [to get my foot in the door as I needed work after graduating with me business degree]). 

Do I really have it easy having this position without getting a degree at this level of compensation (we live in a fishbowl, and I have no outside experience networking so it's hard to gauge where I am at)? What would be a good title for what my position is, if I were to try and find another position doing the same thing with more room for growth? Based on what I do, what type of engineering degree/field would you recommend for me to research for the degree I wish to start going for? (aerospace/mechanical/computer are all ones I am interested in at this point)?

Thanks for any and all help. I know there is a bit much here, but I am trying to get answers to as much as I can while deciding the best path for my future, and don't really have anywhere else to ask to gain insight on these thoughts. If you need anymore information to help answer any of my questions, feel free to ask/pm me for more detail or post/pm your answers.

I am unsure of the exact chemical mechanism that would be applied to this process, that would have to be developed, if one does not exist already, but I think the bigger question would be where do we situate these systems, and what do we do with the carbon once extracted?

I thought about offshore oil rigs, which in the US occupy tens of millions of acres.  This could be advantageous, since it would not offset any land that could be used for agriculture or something else, and it could utilize the offshore infrastructure that already exists.  Furthermore, and as crazy as it may sound, if we then inject the carbon into the oil wells for enhanced recovery, it may be possible to have carbon negative oil extraction.

One last possible carbon negative integration would be creating seaweed farms all around the oil rigs, to sop up the carbon, and then fermenting the seaweed for use in plastics or animal feeds or fertilizers.

1) The studs. This I kind of understand. Most likely welded at too low of a temperature for too long.
2) On the side without studs? This I don't understand. For whatever reason the supplier used a sharp edge to sketch the grid pattern on the side without studs.

I always wanted to make an electric motor which I could explain every design decision of. I have a book called ""Principles of electric machines and power electronics"", and it starts easy enough. Magnetism, torroids.. blabbidy bla.. And then at one point, you gotta calculate the flux in the space of a rectangular C shaped thing, and then you ask yourself what does this even have to do with motors and machines, and how that would be even applicable to anything. I get lost at that point, and the rest is a blur.


I need something that tells me: aha! First you gotta decide on speed and torque, then you gotta see how big the wire is, then you gotta calculate the size of the rotor and the material of the armature, and you gotta calculate the magnetism, so you can see how far apart it has to be from the stator and its magnetism to create the wanted flux.


Something like that. Theory is all well and nice, but I can't look at abstract things that I can't see the purpose of, in order to learn of a concept. There is a whole section in the book about three phase motors, and I didn't read it the first time around because I was focused on brushy brushy dc ones. But I learned from 1 youtube video much better, the whole concept of a three phase motor, and the genious thing where you just connect the 3 parts of the wire so they nullify each other out. Genious. I would have never understood the thing if I had just looked at the pictures.

Today at a seminar on hydro power, a P.hd. scholar presented his thesis that he has/plans to design/ed a turbine which will have a flexible shaft i.e. some kind of string instead of rigid solid shaft like we know and use. The advantages, he said, will be:
1. No need for stabilization of rpms of various shafts at the hydel power plant.
2. I Don't remember. He had me on flexible shafts.

His inspiration was high tension hanging Bridges for the flexible strings.

I had a couple of questions that he was not able to answer mainly because the research is in early stage. 
My concerns were:
1. Strings, though good under tension aren't designed for torsion. Whereas turbines shafts are made from engineered materials to withstand high torsion.
2. How is he gonna achieve coupling with generator?
3. He showed us a simple illustration with 2 strings holding a propeller floating on a small waterway. The ends of the strings were connected to some kind of non-de-script plate bearing. Wouldn't such an arrangement result in doubling the bearings and accessories cost?

I'm 29 and have a BS in EE. I got a job in a corporate environment after college doing PCB/prod development and have been there since (6 years). I can honestly say for the past two years, I've been pretty displeased with the work location, skill set I'm not developing, and potential for advancement at my company. 

For the past 6 months, I've been applying to a lot of medical based companies on west coast (except Bay Area). Simple reasons being I love the ocean (I'm landlocked) and want to put my effort toward something I believe will give me job satisfaction and help people. 

I've had around 7 interviews, and have not made it past the first round with any of them. There are a few problems here that I've recognized...

A.) Employers want to see someone who has their own webpage/blog about problems they are solving or general engineering interests. Is this true? I have been asked if I had one in multiple interviews now... 

B.) I haven't developed any deep, technical knowledge at my job. In my head, I just make powerpoints. When it comes to technical questions during the interviews, I fumble around with wording and don't have projects or examples where I've used certain technologies. Maybe this is my own fault?

C.) What are good continuing edu resources for EEs that are worthwhile and credible? From what I gather online, certificates don't mean anything and professional/personal projects are the way to go. How the hell am I supposed to do this with something medical related? Taking it to another step, how do I do this at work where we repeat our products so often?

I'm a graduate student working on my thesis, and one aspect requires I discuss, essentially, the effect of axial tension in a single metal wire to its torsional stiffness. I've been looking back at my graduate and undergraduate structures books to no avail, variously trying modifying energy methods for pure torsion contained within those books, different versions involving Castigliano's theorem, and even investigating the definition of shear modulus itself to try to ""modify"" it with a change in differential length of an element. I keep coming up short, essentially that the torsional stiffness doesn't change. Logically this seems wrong to me, though, and my graduate advisor believes it should change as well. The closest I've found in literature involves metal ropes, but these look at entire assemblies with internal tension, winding, etc., and the earliest sources I could try to check, to see if they could be simplified to one wire, are buried in libraries far away.

94,Tank tread drive motor configuration question,1537730105,"Hi,

I am building a robot with a tank-tread drive. One of the constraints is the spacing between the treads needs to be less than or equal to 6 inches. Each tread will be separately driven by a DC motor attached to a drive wheel. Because the space between the treads is so tight though, I don't think I will be able to put both motors on the front drive wheels. I'm thinking of putting one motor on the front drive wheel for the left tread and one motor on the back drive for the right tread. Does this affect the steering at all, or is the result the same as having both motors attached to the front wheels?

Nominal:

22.5+9.39=31.89

With tolerance:

(22.5+0.15)+(9.39+0.13)= 32.17

(preface) I've had a look around, but not being a chemical /mechanical engineer I have had trouble finding resources related to this problem. Feel free to point me the right way please! (/preface) 


So, I have an implementation requirement to provide a regulated flow of dilute aqueous mineral solution between a various number of branches, in this instance that is two. The flow rate needs to be kept at 1.5(±0.5)L/min. For reference we are feeding the various runs in an NFT hydroponic system. 

As usual I'm attempting to keep costs low, and thereby feed the system from one low pressure pump. Each leg of the system after the split is an open loop, so I can't use return line pressure regulation or monitoring etc. 

I'm using an impeller style hall effect sensor to measure the flow provided to each of the legs, which I would like to shift to before the split, if there is some trivial or novel way to split fluid flow equally. This would allow me to remove 'n' sensors, and replace them with only one. However... 

Not coming from this field of engineering, my first attempt at a solution is to have a low pressure pump feeding a 3-outlet manifold, where each of the first two outlet legs have flow sensors followed by in-line electronic flow control valves, and the third leg only has an FCV, as it is a return line, since the pump is low pressure. I would be using a PID controller to monitor the flow sensors, and adjust the FCVs to maintain the appropriate flow rates. 

I have an inkling that this may be a severely over-engineered solution. Can any of you more enlightened folk help me?

I'm hoping to get feedback on my design, or ideas for a more efficient design. I've attached a link where you can download a *very* rough 3D concept model for what I'm planning on building, as well as a picture of a similar professional Equatorial Mount.

The most important part of the model is to have the two arms slowly turned apart at a set rate of angle per time. By increasing the distance between the drive arms and the axis of rotation, you increase the precision of the motion. I'm planning on making this distance 30cm. The two arms will be rotated around a 608 bearing.
On the bottom arm, there will be a stepper motor which will be connect to a gear system, that involves a ratio of 1:5, followed by a beveled gear, that will rotate a bolt on a fine adjustment screw. This Screw is the driving force for the rotation, and is attached to the second arm.. (Please see model to clarify what I've poorly explained). The gears are not at all finished, especially the beveled gears.

Any feedback on my concept and model is highly appreciated.... especially the gear system, I have practically no experience with gears. Would this gear system result in high precision motion?

35,"Anyone care to speculate on how the walls at Sacsayhuamán in Cusco, Peru might have been built ?",1537598923,"I'm curious to hear the opinions of engineers on how you think Sacsayhuamán in Cusco Peru might have been built. As you can see in the link below the bigger stones fit into each other like they were melted. Also the surface of the stones have some very strange indentations, which looks like someone was paving concrete unevenly. Common belief is that the Inca built these walls, but there is clear difference between the Inca repair work with smaller stones and the much bigger stones. No discredit to the Inca as they did build some great structures at incredible scale, but it seems almost certain that two diffrent cultures using two different methods built these walls.

I need to make R2 small enough to have less impedance than the LED, and large enough so that the tranny doesn't get fried by all that current.

57,GPA on resume for a college student?,1537555700,"Hello all,

I just wanted to get some more input on whether or not I put my GPA on my Resume. I've had 2 internships (1 before junior year, one before senior year) and I have plenty of extracurriculars, so there's plenty of good content for me to talk about in an interview should I be called in. However, my current GPA is a 2.64. I don't want it to be a red flag, and I'm scared that it is. I've been told by professors that I have a very strong resume, I don't want the GPA to scare somebody off. 

One of my professors (one of whom worked in hiring) told me to put it on there because not having it on there is suspicious, and if they want they can ask about it. My dad (who has also worked in hiring) has told me to leave it off unless it is well over a 3.0.

The thing is, of all the companies I applied to for summer internships, the ones I heard back from were the ones that got a resume without a GPA. This is why I'm still questioning whether or not to have it on there. 

My thought is that when it comes to a resume, a GPA is a quick and easy way for a potential employer (especially a computer) to put me in the 'no' pile. Without it, I can't find any reason to put me in the 'no' pile unless they ask about my GPA and don't like my explanation. I'm sure it makes things easier when a company has thousands of applicants. I've heard a lot of companies '*don't really care'* but I've heard the opposite, too. Maybe this professor is telling students to put it on their resume as another way of motivating them to do the best they can (which I am), a little farfetched but I don't know. Just thinking out loud.

I am currently in the prototyping stages of developing my product. I've never gotten far enough to be sourcing parts with mass production in mind. I've tried to change my designs to work with ready made springs from various manufacturers but despite my best efforts in searching, I haven't been able to find one that is suitable (diameter is too big for the shaft, too many coils, etc...)  


So now I've designed a spring to my specs and have started reaching out to spring manufacturers for quotes. Now however, I am running into cost issues. I understand the money/time cost of tooling and all that- but in conjunction with the minimum order quantities of like 25 and at $5+ a spring, I can't help but wonder if there is a better way.

92,Best engineering field for algal technologies (or other carbon negative technologies),1537488124,"I am currently going into the engineering field with the intent of developing carbon negative technologies, for the purpose of abating the effects of climate change.  In my research so far, it seems algae has a very large potential for this, since it is much faster growing than plants, and thus can have a much larger impact on the carbon cycle in a much smaller footprint.  Plus, it could be possible to grow on marginal lands and on water that is not use-able for agriculture, and is much easier to be turned into many useful industrial products, like plastic and batteries, which could sequester the carbon in the long term.  I'm also interested in other carbon negative tech, like certain types of concrete, CCS, etc, but algae is the one I'm most interested in.  


So, I have decided that I would like to develop some sort of carbon negative technology, algal based or otherwise, the specifics of which I am not yet certain, but I know that algae is a passion of mine, and I would like to work with it in some way.  As such, I initially thought that environmental engineering would be the best fit, given that this field works with waste water and biological systems a great deal.  However, I have recently been considering the possibility of doing chemical engineering, possibly with a focus on biochemical engineering.  It seems like both would be a good fit, but I'm uncertain of which one would be better.

When I was a kid, I was a real ""Star Wars"" geek, and dreamed about making spaceships or robots and droids. This sparked my interest for physics and science, and I have always known that I wanted to pursue a career in engineering. (I think many of us may relate to being a little kid and wanting to work for NASA or ESA or something, am I right?)

I know that I want to study mechanical engineering of some sorts, and considered doing that and then specialising in aerospace, automotive or robotics. However, as I have been looking up different university courses, I have found several engineering courses completely within the fields of ex. aerospace or automotive (instead of Bachelor's/Master's of Mechanical -- specialise in aerospace, the courses are Bachelor's/Master's of Aerospace Engineering etc.). 

These courses seem very attractive as well, but I am afraid if I choose one of these programs, that the job market will be much more restricted and that I will not have as many options as if I rather chose a traditional mechanical engineering degree. 

Is there, by any chance, anyone in here that have studied one of these or have careers within ex. aerospace? What is the job market like for the different ones, and is anyone happy to share own, personal work experience and what you do at a normal day of work?

I'm  using it for humidification and my nozzles require 3-10 bar pressure,  the pump has a height of 75m (7.5 bar) but naturally the water only  recirculates with no valve so i put a tap on the end of the line and  partially closed it til i got about 4 bar

My  concerns are that it makes quite a noise restricting the flow to boost  the pressure and after an hour or so the pump runs quite warm and the  water recirculating in my tank also gets over 35c degrees.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Many makers have made claim that once the resin is cured , it contracts thus applying pressure on to the crystals thus creating piezoelectric currents. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) A quartz crystal wrapped in copper wire acts like a faraday cage in orgonite , i dont see how this theory relates to the application of a faraday cage.

&amp;#x200B;

From my training background in calisthenics , the loading and unloading of joints ie elbow flexion to full lockout in a pushup generates P-electric currents that encourage osteoblasts to form new bone tissue. In orgonite , there isnt any release of mechanical stress,  does this make the claim a baseless arguement?

&amp;#x200B;

Next , i watched ""the pyramid code"" on Netflix , it mentioned that  the core of the Pyramid of Giza was made of dolomite (high magnesium content which conducts electricity well? ) at its core. Tura limestone ( high calcium carbonate , a low conductor of electricity ? ) on the outside. Guest interviewee John Burke states that the structure mimics a cable ( conductor insulated with rubber )

&amp;#x200B;

So , i am thinking if the orgonite pyramid i have on my table is an attempt to copy this model. There are metal shavings and crushed crystal shards , as well as resin that insulates.

I'm also pursuing a minor in mechanical engineering (my school doesn't have a civil engineering department) to gain exposure to topics such as statics, solid mechanics, finite-element analysis, etc.

My question is this: From a materials science and engineering education, could I successfully pursue structural engineering?

I am torn, because I want to be involved in Design/Product Development, and if I accept the Drafting position I'll eventually have the opportunity to grow into a Mechanical Design Engineer within the same company. Unfortunately, there is no say in how long that may take. 

The Field Engineer position is for a company that specializes in Rotary Kilns. The schedule is sporadic and frequent travel is required (18-20 days per month). The position is very strenuous and the work environment is less than ideal. I admit, I am not too keen on the frequent traveling and schedule since I want to start a family eventually.

However, they said I can assist the design team whenever I have the time since it is an area of interest for me. It will be nice to have Engineer in my title though instead of just being a Drafter.

I have a vague remembrance of how to translate spring force into rotational speed based off of shaft diameter.

I have a good concept of gears and how the teeth work together to generate what I’m looking for in terms of actually rotating the gears in the desired fashion once I have a source spinning a shaft at a specific speed. I don’t necessarily know specifics on how reverser gears can wind the mainspring.

I can do calculations using ball bearings but don’t necessarily know types of suitable metals, sizings, or how they are typically manufactured.

I graduated college several months ago and I have always wanted to work in the space industry. In college, I interned at a major aeronautics company, and then NASA. Both were great experiences but one thing I remember the most is how painfully slow and even boring the work day was. I figured ""these are just internships; when I become a ""real"" engineer, things will pick up."" 

I am several months into my job at a major space company doing DoD work. I thought it would be enjoyable but it is not. They're hiring like crazy because they have a lot of cash, but I am not getting consistent work to do. It's pretty frustrating to be sitting at my desk doing nothing. I constantly ask for work and even the other engineers are like ""we don't understand why they keep hiring."" Also, I sit in a corner cubicle alone. No windows. So corporate. It is so boring.

2.) What are steps I can take to leave this job? I want to work exploration space at a different location my company has. Would it be wise to take the first opportunity I can find, or build some experience here first?

39,Think I chose the wrong career (Systems Engineering).,1537394500,"Just a bit of background about myself before I talk about the problem I'm having... I have a BSc in mathematics and just graduated with an MSc in applied mathematics. During my MSc I applied for a few graduate schemes (full-time job consisting of 2 years training where you're ""qualified"" at the end of the training) and managed to get secure a Systems Engineering role, at a large defence company, just a short walk from my family home. At the time it just ""made sense"" to accept the job as the pay was decent and the commute almost non-existent. Not only that but securing these graduate schemes involve jumping a lot of hoops - telephone interview &amp; online tests before you're even invited for an assessment center (with an interview at the end).


Immediately after handing in my master's thesis, I began my job as a Graduate Systems Engineer. I had a vague idea of what the job involved and I was aware that Systems Engineers were kind of laughed at by ""real"" engineers. However only now is it really setting in what Systems Engineers do day to day and I really feel that I've made a mistake.  I thought the role would at least involve some coding or modelling/simulations but it literally is all documentation/reading/excel spread sheets. Everyone I work with are all aged 50+ and fell into the Systems Engineer role (at a management level) after decades of experience in their respective fields (i.e. mech eng, electrical etc). They're all happy to teach me but I can clearly tell that they are concerned whether or not I chose the right job... They assure me that I won't find anything mathematical in this career and tell me to really consider what I want.

I'm currently on my 6 month probation period (ending March 2019) and I'm completely lost at what to do. My passion and skills are in coding/mathematical modelling/control theory but this job will have none of that. Do I stick it out for the 2 years? If I did - would I be able to transition from being a Systems Engineer to something that isn't Systems? I don't know if employers would see this as very strange or not...

I'm really starting to feel depressed. My parents are so happy that I've found a job so close to home so that I can save and get a place of my own. I feel like I'm potentially throwing away a fruitful career for a career that may not even exist. 

So I guess I'm just looking for any advice or comments. Yes I know it was completely my fault for not reading the job description carefully and for being so naive but it won't do me any good to lament this. I'm looking towards the future now. Should I apply for jobs now and jump ship as soon as I find another? or should I just undergo these 2 years of training and then somehow find a more mathematical career (even though this training involves none of the maths)? and does anyone know what kinda fields I can go into which involves the coding/modelling/possibly control theory?

I’m currently a third year civil engineering student and what I thought I wanted to do with my life has recently changed a lot. If you have any advice it’s really appreciated since my advisors haven’t been too helpful. 

I have now had two internships in the construction field, one for a purchaser of a major job in the public sector and another in the private sector with an engineering procurement and construction contracting company.

I now know I want to aim my career to fight for the environment and as of about a year I have realized I would want to go to graduate school if it would help. My school has an environmental specialization but it mainly deals with hydrology related subjects nothing related to clean energy. I still think I will pursue it however my advisors say it will limit me.

I loved the pace of the private sector and how much I learnt but it was all about making money for a big environmentally unethical company. 

I am thing between a masters in civil engineering, an mba or a business related masters, pursuing a PhD in economics, or challenging actuarial exams if they would help me get a position.

If civil engineering is not the right field to make the difference I am looking for I would go the business route since I have good management and people skills. I just want to be a weapon for the environment.

I also would want to go away for grad school and I am confident I could perform on a ged/gmat and have already started saving funds. Europe seems to be bustling with green innovation and it would be great to study there but I still haven’t researched programs at universities over there or in North America much.

53,A Wrist Hook - A climbing &amp; parkour device,1537374783,"Hi everyone, 

I would like to share with you a concept that I've had in mind for a long time. I will also share my concept drawings and relevant images and footage. 

Below, you will also find a few clips of similar constructions from other people.

This is a reimagining of the Hookblade from Assassin's Creed: Revelations:https://i.imgur.com/zdSaVUI.jpg

The purpose of the wristhook (haven't figured out a name yet) would be to enhance the natural reach of the hand, and removing the strain on the hands therefore making climbing walls and rocks nearly effortless. This is mainly oriented towards adventurers who do a lot of rock climbing and freerunners who want to increase their reach when climbing walls.


My goal would be to build it myself or pay an expert to build it for me, test it and then 


The mechanism used would be a double action out the front system, with the trigger being a ring resting in the palm, with a strap attached to the mechanism that one would put their middle and ring fingers in and pull outwards, in a manner that would resemble Spider-Man shooting webs.


Once pulled, the hook would shoot out, and stay rigid until the mechanism is pulled again, after which it would slide back in.


The hook itself would be bent somewhere between 30 and 45 degrees, in order to fit into most nooks and crannies of modern architecture, between tiles or simply on rocks.


The elongated part would consist of one segment or two, whichever gives more durability and safety. One could perhaps also choose between the two for longer or shorter reach.


This Wristhook should be made of a material sturdy enough to hold a bit more than the weight of an average adult man, and ideally a lot more, since there would be a lot of situations that applied a lot more stress on the device. 


It should also be able to hold a person for long amounts of time without bending or breaking, and not be too heavy to be considered a burden to the user.


The device would have the appearance of a large bracelet strapped tightly around the forearm, perhaps with somwthing like a strap to further distribute the weight and prevent slipping. Once greenlit for selling, it would have a lot of different designs, like modern, minimalistic, carbon fiber designs or more rustic designs like wood et cetera.


Here are some sketches I made that further illustrate the look and overall design: https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4m3xj5shmgz79r/IMG_20180919_175455.jpg?dl=0

For a basic example, if someone working for you screws up and you need to report to a higher power, YOU take credit for the fault, and it could be because you didn't explain the problem/objective well enough to this individual, you weren't paying close enough attention to your team, or if this person really is ""hopeless"" and terrible to work with, why haven't you done anything about it?

Im looking for advise and opinions on my plans once i graduate with an associtaes in electrical technology.
 
So after this fall semester of physics 2, I shall be done with my associates degree in electrical technology.
I'd be graduating with a 3.0 overall GPA, and ~ 3.4GPA (should/will double check but pretty sure its within .5 ) in my E Tech concentration. 

-my prior education-
Ive ha two majors before electrical tech, first was flight training at Bridgewater state Uni. An awful program btw, pretty much a scam by prolonging progress. Regardless different topic for different day, my second was when i first transferred to Bristol Community College but got placed in computer science since i said i wanted something that woild transfer nicely into either computer or electrical engineering and did pretty poorly in programming classes like Java, sql, and html, all with the same teacher btw. After a year or so of that i switched to electrical technology and put in major work to recover my gpa. 

-My current situation and plan-

Currently I live in south east Mass, but I am saving and planning to move to the LA area sometime in the spring.  
Id be looking to get entry level electrical technician job there before I make the move so id have a job as soon as i get there.
I also plan on going and finishing my bachelors for Electrical Engineering. I'd prefer to do it part time, working as a tech to built work force expirence and see what the field is really like.
 I have a list of schools I'm planning on applying (not all are in La tho)

--California state university Los Angelos 
I don't think I'd get accepted as a transfer but id like to take the shot

-- California state university  Long Beach
I feel pretty confident that Id be able get in and is the school I'd prefer, based on what I've read about it (also will be touring it in a week and meeting with admissions)

-- California state polytechnic university Pomona 

-- Texas A&amp;M international university 

--Massachusetts University Dartmouth
This is a fail safe, my sister is alumni there and with the mass transfer program @ my gpa I'm guaranteed in.


Id like to here any ones opinions about what i have planned an by advise for me.

81,Can tubeside fouling in a Heat Exchanger actually cause an increase in the tubeside outlet temperature?,1537330388,"Hear me out. I know when the tubeside of a heat exchanger gets fouled, less heat is transferred and the tubeside temperature doesn't change as much with the fouling. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, let's say we have several coolers connected to a single cooling tower. Let's also say the cooling water flows on the tubeside.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, it's well known that the cooling water temperature will not increase as much through the coolers when there is tubeside fouling. However, since the shellside fluid is not getting cooled enough either, after some period of time wouldn't the inlet temperature of the shellside of the coolers increase in temperature causing the cooling water to eventually elevate in temperature?

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, would the tubeside fouling cause the return water to the cooling tower to eventually be higher once it circulates through all the coolers that are fouled? I'm also assuming these coolers are recirculating a lot of the shellside fluid.

84,Advice on learning about how to create an Air Purifier,1537328393,"Hi all

&amp;#x200B;

I am an EE undergrad student looking to make an air purifier as a side project. However, I do not know where to start - let me explain further. I understand the basic idea - push/pull dirty air through a filter. That's about it. I have looked at various designs, cross-sections, and disassemblies of commercially available air filters and have a rough understanding of the common layouts. However, I do not know how to design one from scratch. For this I think a great place to start would be to learn about air flow and how it works and this is my main problem. I would like for it to be as powerful and quiet as possible. So I have the following questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do you think learning more about how airflow works is a great place to start? Or am I overthinking it?

&amp;#x200B;

2) If this is a good first step to take, what can I google to learn more about it? Are there any books or chapters of books you would recommend? Any YouTube channels? What is this branch even called?

&amp;#x200B;

An example of a problem I think about is - should I push or pull the air through the filter. How is performance of a fan measured (is it just in terms of volume, or pressure that the fan can create)? Let us say I put two similar fans one behind the other in series, does the volume of air they move double? What if the fans are counter-rotating? How would performance be affected if I put one fan pushing in and one fan pushing out? Does performance increase/decrease when the fans are dissimilar sized or is a ""limiting reagent"" type of scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry if the post seems unorganized, but I have thoughts just flying around in my head and I think this will be a great learning experience for me.

5,Recent ECE Grad seeking advice on what type of job to pursue,1537287030,"For a bit of context, I graduated a couple years ago from a strong ECE school with a focus in circuit design and signal processing, with a bit of microcontroller work in there.  I loved my program and what I studied (circuit design and signal processing were really cool!) and it made me really excited to begin work in industry.

However, my industry experience has been really disappointing and has given me second thoughts about everything.  My  final long term internship before graduation was exclusively hardware focus doing analog motor design, and I found that really unpleasant as it was very slow paced and most of it was just testing different components and collecting data.  I decided that as cool as it was learning about it, circuit design would not be right for me as a career.

After graduating, I took a job as an embedded software engineer, implementing image processing algorithms on FPGAs - which I though would be right up my alley.  However, that too I found very boring: simulating and checking bit correctness day after day was making me go crazy.  It was slow and very repetitive. As well, the bulk of signal processing work was done by people with PhDs, and I was just implementing what they came up with which was not very challenging or interesting.

Disappointed with my experiences, I decided to give high-level software engineering a try.  After a bit of self-studying I was able to get a great software engineering job in the Bay Area.  Although this has been the best of my experiences, I still do not enjoy it.  What makes it better is that I find it faster paced; I am working on something different every few days, and the testing and debugging process goes a lot quicker than in hardware and embedded work.  However, I find software engineering also un-challenging: I find that coding does not require the same level of analytical skill that hardware design does or as much attention to detail as embedded software.  I can put up with it for now, but it scares me to think that this is what I will be doing for the rest of my life.

I am seeking advice on where to go next.  I have tried all hardware, embedded, and software jobs and none have made me happy nor have given me any sense of fulfillment.  Maybe I have been unlucky in my experiences and should give one of them another go, maybe I should quit engineering altogether, or maybe I should give academia a shot.  I wanted to become an engineer because I love building things, and I really loved learning about everything in school.  But since graduating, I have found myself depressed going into work everyday.  It does not excite me, and not what I want to be doing for the rest of life.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think it's worth noting that I am a very hard worker.  I had a 4.0 GPA, and if I need to learn a bunch of material in order to switch industries and find the right job then I will put in every bit of effort I have to.

21,Resin Transfer Molding as alternative to 3D printing/Injection Molding - how to reduce voids in 3D parts,1537257070,"Hi everybody, I have a project sitting on the shelf that hit the wall about six months ago, so hopefully I can recall all the details. I think it's an interesting problem and I'm not quite sure where to look for the answer, but if we came up with one it would really help me and maybe help others who are interested in urethane and Resin Transfer Molding, I think it's a really promising production method that seems to be really underused by amateurs and hobbyists. The goal is to use Resin Transfer Molding or Vacuum-Assisted-RTM for small batches (10-100 parts) with a nice surface finish. I'd also like to be able to make the molds myself using silicon, SLA or cnc machining.

I had a whole debacle with roughing together a meter-mix solution (why are meter-mix machines so expensive? 15 grand???) eventually I settled on a volumetric pump that consisted of some big syringes and some off the shelf static-mixers that is... enough of a solution, it's basically a scaled-up version of those two-part epoxy tubes or those epoxy dispensers for boats.

The problem comes when I'm actually feeding urethane into the mold, if I just try to do it in open air then the surface-tension of the urethane and the air in the mold have this complicated interaction that cause large parts of the mold to remain unfilled, in particular if the geometry is tricky or labyrinthine. I sort of anticipated this, and had a plan for vacuum assistance which was to just put the silicon molds into the vacuum chamber and have a poly-tube feed-through that connected the silicon molds to the source of mixed urethane outside the vacuum chamber. The result was a new form of sputter-deposition that coated the interior of the vacuum chamber with urethane, I'm really not sure what I was expecting.

I then started experimenting with having the molds outside the vacuum chamber and using the poly-tube feedthrough to connect with a water-trap to avoid more contamination of the vacuum source, but this is also pretty tricky because it means the molds themselves need to be vacuum-tight now or else the atmosphere just rushes in from the mold lines, which is a real pain, it really dashed my dreams of scale-ability. If the molds aren't vacuum tight then air will leak in or urethane will leak out (or both) as the material is curing and the result is, once again, just a bunch of nasty voids in the cured part.

The other problem is that the vacuum seems to essentially ""boil"" the urethane and introduce all sorts of bubbles, I'm pretty familiar with this from pour-molding but the whole static-mixer workflow has really thrown me through a loop, I've experimented with vacuuming out part A and B before putting them into the pump, but the difference seemed to be negligible, especially after the urethane sits for a day or so. I'm wondering if I have to scrap the vacuum assistance altogether?

It's basically around this point that I just can't get a handle on all these different dynamics, I'd love to just have some definitive answers from someone who's already gone through this, but the information is really sparse, I'm not even sure where to begin. I do know that my budget is about 200 bucks and my deadline is in about fifty years, so if someone knows what the next step is, that would really help me out tremendously, I really wish I could use all this urethane I bought x)",AskEngineers,False,HungryGeneralist,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9gst4w/resin_transfer_molding_as_alternative_to_3d/

As the title says, I graduated from an ABET accredited university with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering last year in 2017. I had an okay/average 2.96 GPA but had no internship experience due to complications and other struggles. I had machine shop training during my 3rd year and had project experience with a winery for my Engineering capstone project my final year. 

As my graduation approached, I applied to multiple jobs and after graduation I applied to more. The applications totaled to 150+. Due to financial complications, I couldn’t ride out unemployment for a long time. Had multiple interviews for positions but did not get any offers besides as a Mechanical Testing Technician for a private testing company within the Aerospace Industry. I got this job about 3 months after graduation. I took the job with the idea that it’ll train my technical, hands on skills, along with strengthening my knowledge of fracture mechanics, strength of materials, and material characterization. I also thought that this would get my foot in the door within the industry. My company primarily works with composite testing so I learned every kind of composite testing as per ASTM and several other industry specifications. 

I’m approaching my 8th month with the company and I am seeing the ceiling for my potential approach rather quickly. The company does not have any other engineering positions besides a project engineer or a test engineer, and that is something I really don’t want to do. I’ve heard about the stigma of technicians basically shootings themselves in the foot so I’ve been actively applying to other positions after my 6th month. Other companies seem to not notice my application so I’ve been feeling a little bummed out. I’ve been putting together a portfolio of CAD parts I created in my under grad but it seems to go unnoticed.

40,My career is being more process oriented (ME degree but now doing a lot of engineering documentation and release work),1537225555," 

I am 4 years into my engineering career and have realized that my current role is focused a lot more on documentation control and engineering releases vs actual design. I worked in aerospace for 3 years as Mechanical systems engineer which was a mix of project management, design work, and owning releases and build documents.

I recently got a job in an amazing company (been here for one year) but they have really utilized me on owning lots of part/module releases and creating our engineering release process. I still do some smaller ME design tasks and help a lot with CAD but am worried that this release oriented specialization will hurt my future career as ME job postings don't seem to ever mention this kind of work. I was aware of this when i took the job but was ready for a change.

If anyone has any experience with being more of a engineering release engineer (is this a thing?) please let me know your experience and if it hurt your potential for future positions. I am early in my career and don't know exactly what I would like to spend most of my career focused on but don’t want to make myself less competitive with putting a lot of energy into this kind of work.

I need to accelerate a ~250kg mass to provide around 140kN of feed force at 50m/s^2 up to 1 m/s speed, maintain that speed for 0.1s and then take it back down to stand still at the same rate or faster. Servo motors and ball screws are preferred.

Must be done in a controlled and adjustable manner, nothing explosive. Also, absolutely no hydraulics.

The torque requirements to get that mass up to speed, along with the spin up of the motor internals themselves look crazy. The best idea I've come up with so far is using a compressed air shot to jump start the acceleration, have the motors take over, and again use an air brake to decelerate.

I found a job close to where I wanted to move to (back close to home since I liked the area). The job pays exactly what I asked for plus bonuses which I believe is above average pay for a first year engineer so I am not complaining about that. The people are great, the environment is very good, my manager is easy to talk to. The only problem is that I'm not completely enjoying the work I do.

When I was doing interviews, the job made it seem like I would be doing alot more electrical wiring schematics and building circuits and such on the computer. There were some customer facing parts but I figured no big deal the job sounds perfect. But now that I've been here for a couple of months. My job has been nothing more than copying and pasting off an existing file and quoting our products. It's boring work and within two weeks I found ways to make my job more efficient. Which also meant less work. My problem is that I love a challenge. I want to build, think, use my degree that I studied hard to get. But how am I supposed to complain about a job that's giving me more than what I asked for and with people that already made me feel like part of the team the first week.

There is room for growth but it's limited since everyone else here is mech and I'm the only electrical engineer. Pretty much all of our stuff is mechanical and I can only push the limits of what I can do for the company so far.

56,I need help with outlining the job of a Space Mission Planner?,1537195158,"TL;DR: Have to make a presentation about Space Mission Planner as a job. Is there some agenda side or something which lists information, basic data and is a starting point to familiarize with the subject?  

&amp;#x200B;

In school, we are doing presentations about jobs that we want to familiarize ourselves. I love rocketry, space and astrophysics (and like playing KSP :P) so I wanted to do something in the fields of rockets. First, I aimed to review the job of an ""orbit designer"", who works out the orbits for space missions. I, for sure, heard that term somewhere but as I did some minor research it became apparent to me that such a field doesn't really exist. So I opted for the Space Mission Planner instead which perfectly fits my interests as well.  

Now I have still some difficulties getting started with the subject. At the start, I was yet again not sure if there actually is such a job but then I saw an Interview by Nasa about a [woman](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/4182/samantha-walters/) who's a Space Mission Planner at Nasa. That was extremely helpful but I still don't really now where to go from there. I always have some difficulties getting started with any kind of reasearch.  

My teacher told us that the point of the presentation is to learn something new, open up our horizons and maybe even get some idea where our careers can go and therefore we should just try to make the class enthusiastic about the presented job and we should also display some basic information like wage, study field, career prospects, etc.  

In the end, my question is where I can find more resources like the interview, if there is someone who has himself experience with the subject or just a site which displays information about this job. Also, if Space Mission Planner is not a correct title for a job, it would be very nice if you could tell me the appropriate title for the Engineers at Nasa, Esa, etc. that plan where the rocket for a mission and namely it's payload flies along, flies by, which burns it executes, and so on.

Problem is, when I model it, I tie the weld bead (cohesive elements) on the top surface and tie it to the bottom of the lid. Everytime I try to simulate it, I get the message below: (it goes from 1 to 25 element)

""The node numbering might not be correct for element 25 instance cohesive-1""

For better understanding, the image below show what is what on the simulation

First time poster to reddit so please bare with me if I posted this to the incorrect thread. I am looking for suggestions and guidance in picking out the correct hardware for our machine learning application. We are looking to use two imu sensors affixed to the bottom of a figure skating boot to collect and categorize data from the 6 different figure skating jumps.  


Currently we are using MetaMotionR sensors but they are $75 per sensor and seem like they are overkill for our needs. Does anyone know of any sensors that would be cheaper for our task? We aim to give out 90-120 sensor kits to participants for the purpose of collecting data. However at a cost of roughly $140 per kit times 100+ participants that would equal roughly $14,000 -15,000 just for the collection of data...this is way too much for a self funded project.  


So any guidance in potential sensors would be greatly appreciated. We have a product/ electrical engineer working on the project and can build out a product around the chosen board/ hardware requirements.

88,Starting my career with job offers in several fields. Not sure which is best starting point for my career.,1537119054,"I'm a recent mechanical engineering grad. My undergrad focused in robotics and fluids, but my internship experience is in both utilities and software engineering. Long story short, I'm trying to decide which job offer would be best to launch my career. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Distribution operator for a fortune 500 utilities company. Starting salary is 70-75k+. Covers masters degree and pays OT (converts salary pay to hourly, but keeps 1.0x rate). Extensive training program after starting position. Workers report high job satisfaction rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern with this position is my career trajectory. I'm not certain how easily I would be able to switch jobs if I wanted to. Additionally, the job seems to be high-stress. While I usually thrive in this environment, I'm not certain if I would do so after half a decade. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Network engineer for a fortune 500 company. Starting salary is a bit below 70k. Covers masters degree, but benefits aren't quite as good as utilities position. Would mainly be working in a Linux environment with an emerging network engineering technology. I can't state the job title without giving out information that's too specific for my liking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, this position seems like the best for the long run. While I studied mechanical engineering in school, I pick up on anything computer-related fairly quickly. I'd likely be a better network engineer than a mechanical engineer, and the skills I'd learn at this position seem fairly transferable as well. There would likely be more career-networking opportunities at this position as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Mechanical engineer for a company specializing in compressors. Without disclosing too many details, their products tend to be high-end.

&amp;#x200B;

My main concerns about this position is that it's a contract position. The pay rate during this period is 20k less than the other two, and I can't find information on their full-time salary or benefits. While the company has high ratings for worker satisfaction, I'm uncertain of advancement opportunities. Additionally, the company doesn't have the same ""brand recognition"" as the other two. However, this is the field that I majored in, and I know that I'll like the day-to-day. I thoroughly enjoy the skills that I'd have to learn for the other two positions, but I *love* the skills I'd need for mechanical engineering. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning toward the network engineering position, but wanted to hear from more experienced professionals before I make any decisions. My goal is to become a highly-skilled engineer making six figures while doing something I don't hate on a daily basis. I think that I have the opportunity to do so, but I'm having trouble making up my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Long Version:

Hey Yall!

Im currently finishing my bachelors degree in Medical Engineering in Germany and would like to make my Masters in either electrical or medical engineering in the UK (because I'd like to have the language and both university experience).

After that I'd like to move to or stay in London permanently with my wife (whos currently studying medicine). The reasons are very subjective, mostly that we fell in love with the country, the city and the culture.

After checking the job market though Im a bit surprised at how low the wages seem to be compared to the german job market. I already understand the difference between an engineer without a degree, IE and CE. Seeing that I will probably have to work for a few years before beeing able to become a Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer is the title for me to search. And the entry wages on the portals seem to be around 30-40k£ (33-44k€). In Germany the equivalent job would get me around 50k€ (44k£) minimum.

Is there a factor I do not take into account? Like that the salary doesn't include bonuses or the like? Or that the taxes are considerably lower? The cost of living seem to be rather high in the UK. Especially in London when its about rent, food, schools, etc.

It'd be great to hear some opinions and stories how engineers are doing in the UK and I'm happy about every advise I can get!

Do I need to work hard to specialize, or do I need to find positions that are looking for someone with a wide variety of skills? With that question in mind, my background:


* I have a BS Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a 3.75+ GPA. I know GPAs don't really matter to a large degree, but I am mentioning because I feel like it is relevant to companies in a new job search situation.

* I have 4+ years experience in an automation engineer role for a very large manufacturing company, where I'm tasked with performing a variety of different functions. These include programming in languages that are new and old (.NET, Java, Fortran, etc), DBA work in MSSQL and Oracle RDB, Windows server administration, and other miscellaneous network/automation related platforms. Nothing PLC or direct automation related, however.

* I am wrapping up an MS Computer Information Systems, currently with a 3.95 GPA. I love my degree program, but again, I feel like it is quite wide in scope.


With that background in place.. I have about 2 years before I'd like to begin looking for jobs. I feel like I have a good enough resume to have a great shot at some interesting and challenging jobs. However, I look at jobs around the US pretty regularly and can't help but feel like I still don't directly qualify for many of them. Despite my experience in my current position, I don't feel like a legitimate pure software developer, DBA, IT systems professional. I just feel like I can kinda figure out how to do whatever I need to because I work pretty much on my own without much structure/guidance/project management/expectations.

I do consider myself ambitious and hardworking, despite suffering a little bit from impostor syndrome. I also feel like I can learn to do well in any position that I can get. With a 2 year lead time, I want to improve my skills to the point where I feel confident applying to senior positions in a new city. I feel like virtually all of the positions I am seeing are very specific: full stack senior developer, senior DBA, etc.

Does anyone have any advice for a situation like this? Do I need to just put my head down and lean into whichever aspect of my job I enjoy the best (for example, molding myself into a pure DBA for career advancement purposes?)

At the same time, I am really interested in digital signal processing (which I had for a couple of undergrad courses) and digital design (courses are sadly not offered/very limited).

I was really happy not doing any analog circuitry (apart from the foundations), however, now I feel like I am missing certain knowledge that I am expected to know. Therefore I really wanted to get some Analog Integrated Circuit courses for my Masters. The courses I am currently looking at are:

Foundations:

\- either Applied Electromagnetic Field Theory or Foundations of Stochastic Processes (leaning towards this one)

Automation/Control Theory:

\- MIMO-Systems

\- Hybrid Systems

\- Nonlinear Control Theory

\- System Identification and Modelling

\- Signal Processing

\- Simulation and Diagnosis (Must do)

Mixed Signal Circuits:

\- Analog Integrated Circuits

\- Advanced Analog Integrated Circuits

\- High Frequency Data Converters

I'm in what I think is a bit of a unique position, and I'm soliciting opinions on a predicament. I work at a small civil/environmental consulting engineering firm. It's pretty well respected and I've gain a very solid position in the firm. I'm a bit over 5 years out of grad school and I'm probably about 4th or 5th ""ranking"" person. (Being less than 20 people, there isn't a super defined chain of command.) 

Anyway, the boss and a senior engineer are nearing retirement and I've been offered an opportunity to buy into a small portion of the ownership group. Problem is that I really don't like the work I do all that much. I almost would say I hate the client types we work with. But I have gotten very efficient at getting deliverables to clients. So things are on time and on budget. But to make a long story short I tend to be extremely stressed all the time. I've gotten better at managing it, but I've spent a lot of time the last two years scanning the job boards hoping I stumble across some ideal public sector job, where it's easier to clock in and out, and I take less of the job home with me.

Another confounding factor is my wife and I are in the process of adopting. Again, it's a long story but I can't really change jobs for the foreseeable future. I.e until the adoption is finalized, hopefully in the next 6 months.

So here's where I'm at. Basically I know I need to stay at my current job for now. But I'm interested in seeing if anyone has gone through turning down an opportunity to buy into an ownership group (I'd be one of about 3 ""owners"" with a 3% stake, and the company has steady profits so it feels like a very safe investment). Also I'm basically 50/50 that I'll leave within the next 6 months if I can find a new job or alternate income source. I'm not sure the buy in opportunity will be there in 6 months so it's now or never probably.

Do you expect the expert in the subject matter to also write well, or is it common to leave the expert's writing as-is, no matter how simplistic the writing seems, or is the standard to have someone, who is capable (maybe a writer with experience in the related field), re-write the paper?

I thought it’d be a neat project to add such a gauge to a regular SodaStream genesis machine. There is no numbers on the gauge on the KitchenAid so I need to calculate the pressure that is the water bottle experiences.

Given that cylinders that provide the carbonation come with 425g of CO2 and are suited for approximately 50 liters of carbonated water it would seem reasonable that 8.5 g of CO2 is being used per liter. The bottles that come with the SodaStream are 1 liter, but are only fillable to 0.84 liters of water, in which the CO2 can dissolve, the headspace is pressurized. Now I tried looking up the solubility of CO2, and the best I can find is at atmospheric pressure of 1.25 g/L (27 deg C), thus 1.05g dissolves in a bottle leaving 7.45g of CO2 in the headspace.
I then used the ideal gas law to calculate the pressure;
p*V=nRT, where n=(7.45g)/(44g/mol)=0.1693mol giving a pressure of 26 bar at T=300 K.

I do however see that the solubility of CO2 might change with increasing pressure, and external factors such as hardness of the water.

So I recently graduated in SP 18 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ohio state with a decent GPA (3.25). I had plans to join the Air Force after school, but as time progressed some of the things I was initially told didn't seem to pan out to what would actually happen if I joined, so I'm looking at other options now and having a minor freak out with loans due soon. One option that was suggested by an older friend is doing some field engineering work with PLC's, which I have little experience with other than hearing of them while working for an OEM office. The closest work I have to PLC's seems to be with micro controllers, of which I have about a year of experience through projects. 

So my question is this: For anyone that has worked with PLC's before or is a controls engineer, would spending a couple grand on doing PLC training with RSLogix500 and RSLogix5000 be worth it? From what I've seen, it seems that this could give me a jump start over other candidates recently out of school, and could also give me some leverage to command a higher starting salary. The prospects for PLC work appear to have a strong outlook, and it's a field I can see myself working in provided I can get through the first few years of field work and travel.

I'll cut to the chase. I've got 2 Sulzer 4D reciprocating O2 compressors that are having an issue. When the machines are shut down the pressure safety valves on the suction piping lifts multiple times until the compressor has wound down.

Some of the facts:
The PSV's are set at 10 psig. 
The PSV's were re-certified in March 2017.
Suction pressure typically runs 2.1-3.4 psig. 
Discharge pressure of the machines is ~425 psig. 
The compressors are 3-stage with 4 cylinders (1st stage has 2 cylinders in parallel). 
To shut down the compressor, the vent and recirc valves are opened 100% and the suction valve is slowly worked down to ~25% open.
When the motor is stopped, the suction valve automatically closes the rest of the way to 0% open. This takes a few seconds.
Once the suction valve is closed there are no other pressure sources to that line. 
We've got other identical compressors with identical piping and valve sizes and configuration that don't have this problem.

-31 years old

-Live just outside of the GTA in Canada

-started my B.Sc in 2005 at Queen's

-dropped out partway through 3rd year, 2nd semester

-marks are not great, most of 3rd year is fails.
 
-spent 8 years as a cnc programmer/set up, specializing in moldmaking and micromachining for fiber optics and microfluidics

-currently mill dept lead

-make about $50k/yr

Is it worth it for me to go back?  Average wage of a mechanical engineer around here is $80k, from what I've read. I figure that I can make $80k in my current trade in the next 7 years, which is realistically how long it would take me to finish school. That would likely be the cap for me in my trade, though.

The company did not respect its employees. I worked hard, but had no plans to stick around, and I think they picked up on it. There were a lot of people leaving the company. The turnover rate was very high. People who've been there for a long time were getting fired for mysterious reasons. It was bad. I was fired in the middle of a turnaround, while I was working 72 hr weeks, in a mixture of night and day shifts, 2 weeks before Christmas, and I thought I was doing an awesome job, dealing with all the shit that were thrown in my direction. Basically, I think I was disposable, and they were way over their heads in their expenses, and had to make cuts.. While there, I made savings for the company that were worth 2x my salary, and was going to implement more changes to make an even bigger impact. Anyway, I took a year off to ride my bicycle across the country, and did not have success looking for jobs, for various reasons.. But I went back to school for my master's, in an area that I'm actually interested in, and am in a much better position now to find a job that really suits me. However, I have a 1.5 year gap in my work history due to that firing, and a hiatus period of waiting to be admitted to the graduate school. And I'm wondering if I could just say that I left the job, instead of saying that I was fired/laid off, because that really communicates a bad vibe to the interviewers, as if I was the problem; I really wasn't. I mean there really is no way to put a positive spin on a company that completely screwed me over.. I know people with whom I've worked with at that plant, who knows the kind of worker I am, and I could use as references.

75,Setting up PID Temperature Controller for Home Made Bioreactor,1536877142,"I am designing a bioreactor for our lab and trying to set up a temperature controller/heat pad system to keep the reactor at 37C.  Cells are sensitive so I can't have the temperature varying more that +/- a degree. The items I am using are:

* NOVUS N1040 PID temperature controller
* Tempo strip heater (Grainger, #6TFK9, 120V, 250W)
* Surface thermocouple from Omega (#SA1-T) 
* 3-pronged power cord with exposed wires. 

My background is in chemistry and biology, so this my first shot at such a project.

I've connected the power cord to an outlet and connected the white and black wires to the power supply of the N1040 (Panel #8&amp;9).  The green ground wire is just floating there. The thermocouple has been wired into the input of the N1040 (Panel #2&amp;3), and the sensor head is attached to the heat mat.  The heat mat is wired to the OUT2 relay (Panel #6&amp;7). 

For the PID parameters of the N1040, I've set the SP at 37C with a min and max of 20 and 45C respectively.  The thermocouple seems to be working correctly and is reading the correct temperature.  The N1040 is powered and is functioning.  However, my mat refuses to heat and remains at ambient temperature so I'm not sure what I'm missing.  My questions regarding this system are:

*  I am using NConfig to set the PID parameters (software from Novus).  Is there a secret combination of parameters that will get me to 37C?  Or just to heat my mat at all?  Can anyone offer a starting point?  I've tried doing the autotune function, but it seems to get stuck and nothing happens.
* Is something about my setup incorrect?  I have an input, output, power source, and sensor, so do I need something else? 
* For the output, is it better to use the OUT2 relay or OUT1 pulse output for such a project?  I don't understand the difference.

77,I don't want to work on The Wall,1536874270,"I got informed a few days ago that my company, a small geotechnical firm in Southern California, got selected to do some field exploration for the border wall (The Wall) in Arizona. I may be selected to go because, out of 8 staff- and project-level engineers, only 4 of us are US citizens, and only US citizens are allowed to work on this project.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, I like doing field work, especially as a newly-minted project-level engineer, since I now spend more days in the office than I did when I was a staff. However, this project seems particularly intense, not to mention, I am intensely ethically opposed to The Wall and do not want my name associated in any way with it. So far, it looks like that the people selected to go work on The Wall would be working for about 6 weeks straight between November and December, 6 days a week. That means I'd be missing out on seeing my family, my boyfriend, and all the things I like about home, to go work on a project that I think is, quite frankly, despicable. The other 3 co-workers also don't want to work on The Wall either, for similar reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, /r/askreddit, what would you suggest? I plan on telling management that I will refuse to work on The Wall should I get selected. Do you think this is a good idea?

82,Civil Engineering or Product/Industrial Design?,1536868192,"Hi all, i wanted to ask a very important question, should i apply to enrol for a civil engineering course, despite not doing any A-Level Maths or Physics? The reason why i ask this kind of goes along the lines of this:

I am from London, UK and have been studying BTEC Art and Design Level 3; this year is my second and final year and once it has been completed, i will head off to university; not sure which yet. Thing is though, is that i decided to do BTEC Art and Design because i thought that i wanted to do architecture in the future. However, in recent times, i have lost interest in studying architecture as a university course option and i have instead turned to considering civil engineering as a potential course option. Reasons include my assumption that civil engineering includes the usage of architectural designs, skills, knowledge and much more, alongside other things, such as engineering elements. Plus, something about being an engineer seems both pleasing and satisfying. Unfortunately, I did not study A-Level Mathematics or Physical Sciences (I honestly knew nothing of their existence at the time of starting my course, plus i had to resit maths to get a passing grade, which i did) and because of this, even if i was accepted for a place at a uni, I think that the maths (literally just the maths and nothing else) will be difficult enough for me to not be able to catch up to and past the first year of the course with the other civil engineering students who did study A-Level Maths and Physics and passed them.

So i have to ask here, even if i was able to enrol into civil engineering (i think some unis offer foundation years for the course), should i do so? Or will it (or rather, the maths) be to difficult for me to comprehend fast enough, considering the fact that i did not do A-Level Maths or Physics and instead did a BTEC in Art and Design...

About Me:

I graduated in 2009 with my BSME at a 3.6 GPA, full-ride scholarship, worked as an intern for my scholarship sponsor. I then graduated in 2011 with my MSME (coursework only) at a 3.97 GPA while working full-time for my BSME scholarship sponsor. I loved the work there (R&amp;D for US Govt, secret clearance level) but the company has a paradigm shift and we no longer matched. In August of 2012, I left the company in pursuit of greater income. After that, I worked for six months at another R&amp;D company only to realize (in hindsight) that I had burned myself out. Well, come to find out years later, I was actually suffering from severe mental illness. Now I'm on medication for it, and things are looking up! So I'm ready to get back into the game :)

​

1. How can I put this 6 year hiatus on my resume in a professional way that will do the least damage to my hirability?  
During this time I traveled, worked part-time jobs in unrelated fields (usually service or sales) and worked on my own personal projects, so my skills are not sharp but they're not completely gone either.
2. Do I need to go back to school?  
I'm thinking as soon as I can, I'd like to pivot into something with more of a software development aspect to it, perhaps in robotics fields. I'm not sure if I need to go get another BS for that or if I just need to find the right company?
3. If you were interviewing me, what would you ask me about the 6 year gap? Would I even be considered? How can I salvage my career?

87,Balancing question for rotating equipment.,1536862000,"So if a person is making a machine with a reciprocating saw assembly using a crank arm and flywheel, is an approximate balance point 180 degrees away from the pivot point at the crank arm? 

I designed a flywheel in fusion 360, cut away exactly as much material as the moving assembly weighs and made the centre if gravity exactly the opposite of the pivot point for the connecting rod.  Think it will be close to balanced? Or am I missing how much weight is rotating around in the circle and how far that weight is from the centre of mass? 

My trades brain is great at geometry and trig but I read the engineering info on designing balanced assemblies and my brain broke.  I did not do well in physics way back a quarter century ago. 

This machine runs at a pretty low RPM. Like 700 or so (variable).  The flywheel is 5” by 1/2” stainless. My connecting rod pin is 0.5” off centre and my centre of mass is now exactly the opposite of my crank pin. Am I getting close or did I completely miss the mark? (The model is still digital right now).  I’m not looking for perfect here. The machine does have some gravity to it so it will absorb some vibration.

I bought this to power my bipolar stepper motor from my microcontroller. I have wires, but I see a few additional components that I either don't recognize or am wondering are optional.

&amp;#x200B;

Im unsure about what needs to happen to the following pins seeing that the example has a circuit containing additional components:  


\&gt;OSC, which has an = sign as a component

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Vdd and VMa and VMb all have an = sign as well, including some sort of zzzz.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Protect, Mo, RNFA and RNFB all have an unspecified resistor.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, my graduate salary is £27,000, however, I saw in a post recently that the average engineering salary in the UK is ~£35,000 which is strange as within several years I would expect to be above that. 

I know engineering isn’t a ‘protected profession’ but why is the average seemingly lower in comparison with other professions such as law, medicine etc?

Basically, I want to build a container that can exist inside of a sanitary environment and protrude outside of that environment without contaminating what's going on inside. The container would need to open at a point determined by the operator, and so I would like a button or lever to be accessible from outside. I am unsure how to achieve that without the possibility of contamination or without using an electronic signal to open the container.
