3,Reinforce Lime Mortar'ed Masonry Building (In Italy!!),1568207253,"Long story short... My in-laws gave my wife and I a stone building next door to knock down and rebuild.  Be the typical astute (and broke) structural engineer, I concluded I don't want to tear down the whole thing.  I can rebuild what I've got.  


Right now I'm struggling with a particular challenge... the walls are river stone (from local river) and the mortar is lime and sand (sand also from local river).  The building is about a hundred years old and was 'renovated' in the 50s.  That being said, much of the mortar can be removed by hand (without tools mind you).  Labor here is cheap, so this is what I am thinking of proposing:  


1. Remove 25% depth of mortared joints (walls are 17 inches thick, so it might about 3 - 5 inches)
   1. 50% of building area has rotten mortar
2. Pack fresh mortar into joints
3. Apply parge coat over from of entire building

Here's a challenge... Do you think wire mesh is necessary?  Maybe only at corners extending 5 ft or so in each direction?  Building is in a seismic zone but there's fortunately a brick seismic break (bond beam?) every 30 cm.  


I know this is uncharted territory but I'm not going to be the greater fool who tears down a building and sinks another $100k into a summer home in a foreign country.  


Ideas?  I don't even know where to begin with calculations or evaluations... this type of project might be closer to eye-balling things.

4,Faking Test Reports - advice,1568195746,"I'm looking for some advice if possible. I currently work in testing for a company that supplies parts to OEM automotive companies. I am responsible for testing components that we sell them for adherence to standards (stuff like SAE standards and ECE standards).

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I report to my manager and director that an item has failed testing, and they have me draft up a report (which I dont put my name on) that states that the item has passed testing. We are accredited by our national body to say that these items are road legal via this testing. We then give these reports to our customers (automotive OEMs). I have also found evidence of this occurring in the past, i.e photographs and data stored that do not match with the relevant test report. Whenever I raise the issues everyone agrees that its not ideal but I am told it would be the same wherever I went to work, no matter the industry. They say that experience shows that the product is safe and that it's an engineering judgement call, and that the standards are overly restrictive. I'm getting more and more irritated by this every day, and it's causing me lots of stress. It's only ever done to meet target dates set by salespeople and management, when they say there ""is no other option"".  


I'm only relatively junior, having just been an engineer for 2 years, and have had one year at this company. Is this normal wherever you go? Should I be sucking it up?

7,How to make clear to a prospective employer that I'm not changing continents for a local's salary level?,1568189155,"Hi r/AskEngineers,

I'm a EU national currently working in Belgium, as a Mechanical Engineer. Salaries in the part of Europe are very high (not as high as in the US tough), I'm around 55k€ (gross) per year, which after all expenses paid nets me around 1500€ at the end of the month. It's a fair salary for my experience level, but I'm currently interviewing for more money. I'm at the moment asking for 60k€ (gross) per year + company car, in Belgium.

Recently I was contacted by a company in South America, regarding the possibility of working for them in their South American site. I developed a new technology in one of my previous jobs, and *they want them some of that.* I'm one of the only few people in the world that has worked with that specific technology. Not because it's rocket science, it just it's just super super specific. I believe I'm the only person on the planet that fills all 3 requirements they have: ""speaks the local language"" + ""is free to come to South America"" + ""has experience in that specific technology"".

That particular South American country is very safe, so I'd not be fearing for my life (too much).

I already interviewed once with them, and made very clear that ""yes, I can come to South America, but will be for European level salaries"". I'll have soon a 2nd interview with a top-dog in the company, and I was thinking of asking for a really high package:

Company car + paid housing + paid trips back to Europe 3x a year + 60-70k€ (gross) per year

The possible issue is, this total compensation is easily &gt;10x what a local with an equivalent job and years of experience would make. Does anyone here have experience in negotiating for this type of outrageous contrast in salary vs. the locals?

How can I make clear in a diplomatic way that, if I am to come, I'll need to make quite a lot more net than in Europe? (to justify the hassle of going to the other half of the world)

22,HS Senior Struggling with Physics,1568168198,"I (17F) am interested in going into the engineering field and have just started the college application process. I'm really into math and have usually thoroughly enjoyed my math classes, including Geometry, Alg II H, Trig/Pr-calc H, and AP Calculus AB. However, my physics teacher is absolute hot crap and cannot teach for the life of him. I took his Honors Physics class last year and am currently taking his AP Physics C class (Honors Physics is technically AP Physics AB but the school dropped it down a level since everybody was failing the AP test). Needless to say, I am hardcore struggling in the class. There's an average of about 10 minutes of lecture for the two chapters that we simultaneously study and finish in a matter of two weeks. Before you think it, this is not easy physics! It's a damn college course!! Half the time, he can't even solve the questions on our homework/tests (*not* an exaggeration). Also, because of his horrible reputation at the school, there are only 8 students in my class. I'm currently averaging 80s on his tests/quizzes and A's on the homework/labs. This puts me at a 90.4% in the class right now. Despite this, I'm definitely falling behind. Quickly. The calculus that he's ""taught"" us (more like shoved problem sets and videos onto us in hopes of us absorbing the information) hasn't even been touched upon in my AP Calculus class so I'm having to learn both the new physics material *and* derivatives/integrals all at the same time. Have an idea of what I'm going through, yet?

Moving on from that, you could guess that my relationship with physics isn't exactly doing so hot. This is worrying me since engineering literally revolves around physics. I'm still planning on going into it in college and have pretty good grades (\~4.4 GPA) but yet I'm still nervous about never actually getting ahold of it. What are your guys' experiences with physics in college? Is it taught well or will I have to self-teach it there, as well?

My question is that if you have a two component mixture, why can you not use temperature control on the product stream as the difference between the dew and bubble temperatures are non-negligible? 

As the book states this, is it making the assumption that the material is one component? If that's true then it makes sense as the saturated vapor and saturated liquid line are the same line and the temp difference is negligible.

60,Water propulsion idea - using pressurized air against a corrugated shaped form feasibility,1568080578,"I had an idea that if you took a piece of material shaped like corrugated steel and positioned it such that the runs were horizontally oriented, attached it to the back of a water craft to span the width, angled the top of it at a tilt forward away from craft and at the bottom direct pressurized air up against it. 

The idea is that since air bubbles rise in water, the tilt of the corrugated shaped material would force the bubbles to rise along the profile of the material and would move in an s pattern until finally reaching the surface of the water. The corrugated material would have to have a smaller span from the bottom and a larger span at the top so the bubbles travel upwards and outwards. To prevent the air bubbles from blowing out the sides a flange would have to be made to steer the path of the air to go up along the runs and not out the sides and up. 

The theory is that the air rises and displaces space between the corrugated shaped form and water that creates a wave pattern as the water fills in and pushes out.

86,Looking for advice as an early career engineer considering declining contract extension without necessarily having something else lined up.,1568048360,"Brief context. I had a hell of a time finding a job upon graduation. Bad grades and few local opportunities meant no internships. Two years after graduating I finally got a 6 month contract as a (Research) Engineer in Training. Despite my desperation I surprisingly got hired by a nice guy paying fair market rate. However, the company is so small (1 + 3 young engineers on contract) that it clearly lacks the resources to do anything. Being hired on for a 6 month project as a design engineer with no design software license and no relationship with local machine shops (or possibly even the money to pay them?) means the owner and I have been hand fabricating cheap low quality components (e.g hand bending and cutting brackets). The project is plugging along very slowly, I'm not really gaining many new skills other than project specific knowledge and hands on work, and I don't believe this prototype or this company in general is going anywhere and it seems like a dead end.

In 2 and a half months the contract expires and we will likely have a conversation soon about the future. I obviously would like to go somewhere else so I've started applying but I could very well not get an offer in time to transition smoothly and without a gap. I need his reference and I don't want to burn the bridge. I've considered saying I'd like to take time off to consider/re-evaluate my future.

I've considered saying I would like to switch fields (which is true I'm very disillusioned with the mechanical engineering opportunities in Canada and am trying to learn to program atm).

88,Help with water cooling systems: How to design pipe diameter?,1568045336,"Hey fellow engineers,

I work with a machine which needs forced water cooling. 

We recently bought a new system and hired a company to setup the cooling system for us. Given the requirements of the machine, they were supposed to deliver a reliable cooling system to us.

We are struggling for a few weeks now, because the system keeps leaking. The company we hired said that the diameter specified by the machine supplier was too small. The coupling piece from the hose with bigger diameter to the hose with smaller diameter is often leaking. How can I calculate the correct diameter given a flow rate?

Some information about the system:

The working environment is clean, inside a building with climate control, and the water temperature for the given specifications will always stay below 20°C. The pipes are made of PVC nylon braided hoses, similar to garden hoses. 

System specs:

Line 1: 11 to 15 liters a minute
Line 2: 1 to 3 liters a minute
Line 3: 8 to 12 liters a minute

Line 1 and 3 are often leaking, especially 1. Line 2 almost never leaks.

I would really appreciate either some way to proper calculate the correct hose diameter or how to tackle problems like this. We have no mechanical engineer in our group, and this has been rather frustrating. Feel free to use advanced math or calculus if needed, I am an EE.

91,Help with pH sensor E201-C,1568038478,"Hello,

I'm using the E201-C pH probe, which outputs an analog voltage level corresponding to a pH value, like any other pH sensor. I am going through some trouble callibrating it, though. Here's what I'm doing and where I'm stuck at:

\-Since the board comes with an offset potentiometer, I short-circuited the BNC connector to simulate a pH reading of exactly 7, then adjusted the voltage output to 2.5V

\-Then, I removed the short circuit and immersed the probe into a pH 4 solution, and got a reading of 2.10V

\-Afterwards, I immersed the probe into a pH 8.1 solution, and the reading was 2.28V

Now, here's the problem: from what I've read, an acidic solution should produce a voltage higher than the neutral one. The voltage values obtained here don't make much sense to me. Note: I'm cleaning the probe between one testing and the next one, and waiting even longer than the response time to measure the voltage.

92,High acceleration actuator/mechanism with long stroke,1568036509,"Hello everyone,

I have an assembly of around 0.6kg that has to move up and down about 1m in under 0.2s.  
Once the position has been reached, the assembly should stay stationary for 0.2s before moving up/down again.  
This could be done by either an actuator or some (intermittent) mechanism.

\-Pneumatic cylinder with compressor: 76% efficiency at best  
\-Linear motors: 85% efficiency  
\-BLDC servos with rack and pinion drive: 89% efficiency

4,Dealing with career middle managers?,1568001169,"Hi, I am an engineer who ended up at a glorified consulting company.  Technically, they exist with an R&amp;D mission but it turns out mostly everyone is a ""leader"".   Unfortunately, it's turned out to be a cabal and they continue to just hire more ""leaders"" with little to no technical experience.  One interview went like this:

""do you know how to program?""

""not really""

""are you sure?"" 

""well, i used this program 15 years ago for a project but it was barely scripting""

later: ""we should hire him because his programming experience would be useful""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't deal with tasking people who turn out to be incompetent, so what's the issue?  Well, apply that level of critical thinking to every aspect of these people's jobs.  ""Optimism"" is the number one grounds for promotion.  Once, I was asked to provide input on how a proposed $120k internal project was going to help our customers, only, it wouldn't, because it was in no way going work.  When I told them I was called a ""pessimist"".  An uber boss later asked me to explain my pessimistic thought on why it wasn't going to work (he didn't say it an elitist tone, he seemed genuinely curious).

&amp;#x200B;

Again, what's the problem?  Well, I'm really concerned because these are the people who are getting promoted like wildfire, yet they're committed to blind optimism to the point it's unethical.  The current uber-bosses don't appear to be bad, but I'm really concerned because my ""peers"" are having their ego's stoked by promotions and are starting - it's subtle now - to beat engineers' ideas down because it doesn't align with their uber-optimistic view.

Also it's just goddamned annoying seeing people my age become well paid ""engineering managers"" even though they do more to derail projects than actually accomplish anything.

I believe I want to be an engineer. What type does this sound the most in line with? Currently Ive just started and intro to mechanical engineeting. I already have a BA in psych with minors / certs in environmental faculties. 


Who I am , 28yr male.  I love problem solving, I love helping people and creating things, I'm an empathetic person and enjoy communities, I adore the outdoors and prefer to spend the majority of my time there. I'm okay with office work, but id prefer it to be half and half generally. If it's one more than the othersl some days(outdoor / indoor), that's okay.

I want to help out the environment, or people. I'm a very moral person, so working in petroleum or oil industries and companies who take advantage of resources or people doesn't sit well with me. 

I'm doing mechanical, but I've never been the fondest of working on cars or intrigued by engines as much. I do like the idea of sustainable energy and resources , building bigger things or planning for bigger things. Doing research for the problem or prototyping for a problem. 

So again, I do like the environment. So do I still sound like I've made the right choice with those caveats to be in mechanical engineering? Or does this sound more like civil or environmental? I've just had this itching anxiety that I've made a mistake. From what I've read, mechanical seemed best, but since I don't care for manufacturing or products/ general consumerism , I feel it's wrong.

Goal: To earn the most amount of money possible while working the least amount possible.

I currently work as an HVAC sales engineer in southern California. Graduated with a B.S in Mechanical Engineering. I am currently worked to death everyday and need to get out of my job. I am considering going to graduate school for either Software Engineering or Civil Engineering.

Option 1: M.S Software Engineering - Almost every engineering job posting seems to be in software. Especially for Sales Engineering. The pros would be that it is very high paying in SoCal (150k-300k), lots of job opportunities, get to meet lots of new people, job stability. The cons be of having to continue dealing with only 2 weeks vacation a year and constantly be working in a frantic state. 

Option 2: M.S Civil Engineering - There are a lot of decent paying city/government jobs in SoCal that pay 100-150k. They all seem to be in civil or environmental engineering (basically just a subset of civil). The pros are that some of them have ridiculous benefits (up to 10 weeks of time off when factoring in vacation, sick time, personal time, etc), its extremely hard to be fired, and the work life balance is top notch. I have a friend who currently works for the city straight out of school and he works 4 days a week, has like 5 week of time off, and gets paid 100k.

\-An embedded systems course (typical course filled with tests and programming assignments), I have heard the instructor grades quite harshly

The growing popularity of modern embedded systems calls for a new generation of electrical and computer engineers who can easily cross the boundary between hardware and software. The course is designed to help breed such engineers by introducing students to a balanced, integrated view of software and hardware in designing electronic systems. The lectures will survey a broad array of subjects including system specification languages, embedded processors, memory architecture, communication architecture, real-time operating systems, scheduling, energy efficiency in hardware and software, hardware-software co-design techniques, and verification techniques. The concepts will be reinforced with homework and project assignments that involve system design, modeling and validation. The assignments will involve C/Linux programming, ARM/Linux-based evaluation boards, and optionally other microprocessor or FPGA-based boards.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Dynamic System Theory, A high level controls course (100% Abstract mathematics), Instructor is droll

Introduction to analytical concepts and examples of dynamic systems and control. Mathematical description and state space formation of dynamic systems; modeling, controllability, and observability. Eigenvector and transform analysis of linear systems including canonical forms. Performance specifications. State feedback: pole placement and the linear quadratic regulator. Introduction to MIMO design and system identification using computer tools and laboratory experiments.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Distributed Systems (typical course filled with tests and programming assignments), Good prof but super hard class

Programming-centric introduction to how networks of computers are structured to operate as coherent single system. Introducing principles of architecture, processes, communications, naming, synchronization, consistency and replication, fault tolerance and security, and paradigms such as web-based, object-based, file systems, and coordination-based.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Advanced Digital Design with Verilog and FPGA (No Idea who will be teaching this or if it even will be offered)

Content includes use of HDL (Verilog) for design, synthesis and simulation, and principles of register transfer level (RTL). Programmable logic, such as field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices, has become a major component of digital design. In this class the students learn how to write HDL models that can be automatically synthesized into integrated circuits such as FPGA. Laboratory and homework exercises include writing HDL models of combinational and sequential circuits, synthesizing models, performing simulation, and fitting to an FPGA by using automatic place and route. The course has lab orientation and is based on a sequence of Verilog design examples.

33,I need help with this project,1567955261,"Hey y’all, 

I am a first year ME student and just got my first project assigned. I am looking for some ideas/suggestions on how to make a mechanism described below. 

The goal is to design a mechanism that can move upwards through a transparent tube, constructed from laser-cut sheet material and standard connecting means. The mechanism should be hand operated via tension cables.
 
The conditions the mechanism has to meet:
 
Firstly, the goal is that the operation is done via pull cables from below. The person must stand behind the tube. The mechanism must move forwards and upwards while you can only exert a downward and backward force on it. You have to push by pulling! - For clarification: the goal is that the climber system climbs independently through the pipe. You cannot attach anything to the other side of the tube that the climber pulls up because the tube can be meters long and the end cannot be reached. The goal is that the designed mechanism has to move away from the person pulling on the cables.
 
Secondly, the challenge is to achieve this without wheels. Nothing may roll into the tube. The climber must do something that looks like walking, sliding, stepping, clamping, and / or scrambling. In any case, it may not roll or drive.
 
Thirdly, you should indicate in advance at what angle your climber can still climb the tube, so what performance your climber is capable of. You can vary that angle from very small to the ultimate challenge of an angle of 90◦ where the climber climbs vertically upwards with only downward pulling forces on the cable (s).

I am looking for similar systems in real life so I can see how such systems work. Pretty much any idea/suggestion is welcome. I already have something in mind but think it can be done much simpler.

I’ve been doing a lot of research and can’t seem to find answers to these questions and would love some clarity:

1) Why not run a motor at max mechanical output power? That’s the largest rate of work, roughly half of stall torque, so we shouldn’t have to worry about “overloading” it, right?

I'm tempted to reach out to one of my internship employers (who I worked for in 2016) as they indicated they would be willing to hire me once I graduated.

Also, the location that I'm in really isn't the greatest and I would ideally like to move back to a city (the country/suburb life really isn't suiting me).

My question goes out to all airline engineers: could you explain your job to me? Would you recommend working with an airline as an engineer? How are benefits of the job, i.e., salary, culture, health insurance, career progression, etc.? And if you have ever worked with a company that works with the manufacturing of airframe or airplane parts/systems, how does culture and benefits compare to big companies like Boeing, Airbus, GE, UTC? The biggest perk for airline careers to me is the free flights. That seems awesome to me.

75,Lack of focus and its effect on my role as an engineer,1567869671,"I want to start by apologizing if this not the typical AskEngineers question, but I really need some help from my fellow engineers to advice me on how to fix my lack of focus.

Let's start with a bit of background. I work as an mechanical engineer in a startup. Due to the small size of my company I have to do a bunch of things such as fabricate designs, do material testing, experimental design, manage the company wiki, read a LOT of literature, etc.

I think I perform reasonably well as an engineer, but I am having issues focusing which is really affecting my work. I can't seem to focus on a train of thought for more than a couple minutes until I jump to another thought. This issue is most noticeable when I try to read research. I can only seem to get through a few lines I until I jump paragraphs because I'm bored or decided to switch focus to some random thought. 


I am pretty sure this was an non-issue when I was younger (26 now). I should definitely mention that I live in a legal state and I smoke cannabis on a  regular basis. I  have considered this to be the root of the problem, but I'm always sober at work and the research is still not conclusive on the long term affects of cannabis of memory and focus. I am aware that it affects short term focus and even when I have taken tolerance breaks for over 4-5 months, my focus did not show any improvement. 

Another possibility I  have considered is ADHD. But I am sure I did not show any symptoms as a child. Adult ADHD is a thing, but I am yet to visit a doctor for consultation yet.

79,36 gallon fish tank concerns?,1567859705,"Hey guys, wondering if anyone can give me some opinions on my 36 gallon fish tank and hopefully put my mind at ease. It is on the stand that is made for the tank, I purchased them as a set. 

The first concern I have is about the weight. I did a lot of research on this as it’s in my second floor apartment bedroom. I have it on a flat bottom stand to distribute the weight. I also have it against two exterior load bearing walls. The way it’s set up is perpendicular to the floor joists. Everything I read said you should only start to get worried at 55-75 gallons so I’m hoping a 36 is okay. 

My second concern is the floor under the stand is slightly uneven. Two corners are at the same level, then one is slightly high and the last is slightly lower (1/8” difference each) Is this going to cause the water in the tank to put too much strain on the seals and cause the tank to leak? 

I am currently not in a lease. Therefore I am not explicitly told to not have a fish, but I know landlords can be wary of large aquariums cause of water damage and since I’m not in a lease he could tell me to leave (he’d probably say get rid of the tank first, but still) I would just sleep better having some outside opinions.

2. I have to print and post another paper every time they fill in all the spaces available.
3. The reports get generated too late so we are reactive in nature.

**I think it would be better to have a computer/tablet at each CNC table so the reports are digital from the get-go.**

I'm embarassed to not have anticipated this detail better, but the balls initially load into a 5 gallon water jug- the type you recycle at walmart.   This jug is inverted and I naively thought they'd just run smoothly out the neck with gravity and maybe a bit of air pressure.  This isn't the case.  I wanted a ""rapid fire"" solution but they crowd together and you really have to jiggle things to get them moving properly out the hole.  I tried making a little ""table"" platform that relieves some of the pressure from balls above and allows 3 paths to reach the hole but its not much better.  If not for the handle (or even with it) I may try to fabricate a big internal helical track to roll them down in one stream.   Of course the easy solution is a simple straight pipe sticking out the top, but I wanted something more portable.  The jug would be great if I could just come up with a better load solution.   Is there a particular mechanism or geometry that can help save this without me having to restart the whole design of that subassembly?  Thanks for any help!

The beam is made up of 3, 2"" x 10"" boards that have been laminated (using screws, no glue) to make a 6"" x 10"" beam. From this, we'll be hanging 3-4 swings from it. Eventually, we might turn this mean into a ""walkway/catwalk"" to get from one platform to the other.

One of our platforms is 5' x 5'. The 4 corners are made with 4""x4"" posts, and the platform is framed out with 2"" x 6""s with 2"" x""6"" joists, which we then attached decking to. This platform is 5' up. The beam is 8' up. To support this beam, we have a 4"" x 6"" beam that's been notched into the 4""x4 posts.

0,Career advice - Water utility EI looking at applying for management positions,1567813864,"Hi AskEngineers,

I am looking for some career advice; or at least maybe a ""you're crazy; stick with what you've got"" check on my idea. Understanding that can be difficult without knowing someone, I'll attempt to summarize my situation.

I've worked in water/wastewater utilities for about seven years now, coming from retail store management for about seven years. Four as a wastewater plant operator and three as an engineer for a water utility. At the wastewater plant, I became a shift lead for about a year before moving on. I did my undergraduate while working as a plant operator and found a good job a few hours away from home, so I relocated. In my current role, I act as a project manager for capital and non-capital projects; I'm not terrible at it but the larger construction projects are an opportunity for personal growth. I also serve as a data analyst; heavy into billing analysis and non-revenue water reduction, a program which I have really enjoyed. I had to opportunity to guide our leak detection and demand management program, which was a great experience. I've been helping the utility maximize its use of advanced metering infrastructure and also have become quite proficient at interpreting SCADA data (for example, finding failing pressure control valves before they fail completely, pump control improvements, creating graphs to highlight preventative maintenance issues). I really enjoy modeling, forecasting, and finding new ways to use the utility's data.

I received my EI about three years ago and have about one year to go to qualify for a PE. I've done enough design projects and of sufficient quality that my supervising engineers feel confident enough to sponsor me for licensure when the time comes.

Recently, two utility management positions opened up right near where I used to live (different municipalities). I'm familiar with one of the utilities; visited their water and wastewater plant in undergrad, used to live in their area, even did some graduate coursework involving their system. The requisites for one says 5-7 years but requires a PE (less responsibility). The other states 10 years experience but no PE requirement (more responsibility). In terms of job knowledge, I feel like I could 'fake it till you make it' but greatly fear that applying would be silly at this point. It seems like it may make more sense to wait another year, get the PE, and then start looking for such positions, but there is some familial pressure to apply for these and move back where our family is located. 

Based on what I've said, would I be out-of-league for director/assistant director positions? I feel like I could definitely do the job with less responsibility, but as it requires a PE I think it would be an outright no since they probably are looking for someone to be able to seal documents. If that's the case, how long should one wait after getting their PE to apply for management positions within a water utility?

The college also helps students get placements by liaising with local companies. The only problem with this is that students are allocated to companies randomly and you MUST take the first position you are offered.

I'm a bit hesitant to take the position with the startup since I know how volatile start-ups can be and there's a chance they could go tits up midway through my placement. On the other hand I'd have a very short commute and would gain hands-on experience with some very interesting technology. I've also heard horror stories of startups not paying students properly and expecting crazy overtime. There wouldn't be much formal training either and I could find myself in over my head.

On the other hand if I wait to be randomly allocated to the college there's a chance I could end up in a larger corporation which may have more formal training procedures for students, better benefits, more stability, probably a better chance of them offering me a job after graduation. However I could be sent anywhere in the country and may not necessarily get an R&amp;D role like I hope to get (could get put in quality or production), may get pigeonholed inside a larger organisation.

7,Gravity drained washing machine,1567808520,"As the title says, I currently am researching if I can somehow modify my  name brand electric washing machine to work with out a pump. 

Mine smells like it has burnt out. Coupled with the ND code on the front display I believe it to be bad. I've already cleaned the primary drain to the pump and the exit drain and found them to be clear.  

Yet the machine stops at the first drain process every time. So I've decided to try to work around it temporarily. At least until I can get to town have the pump repaired.... If it's even worth it.

So far I can run the thing through a full cycle using a shop vac. I just tried on a quick cycle. Which lead me to believe if I attach the primary drain from the tub reservoir to another hose. Provided I have a coupler on hand. I could just let gravity drain the hose out to the ditch. I live rural, what I can't recycle for gray water all goes to the ditch. Septic water  to a tank.

14,Question on lever forces.,1567796968," Hi guys, I posted this on /r/engineering and I was pointed here for help. I'm working on a little home project, a trailer specifically, and I wanted to calculate some forces and I don't know if I have the right idea or not, I'm all self taught so I figured I'd ask someone if my logic is right.

[https://imgur.com/dQGGAwg](https://imgur.com/dQGGAwg)

I have attached a diagram. You can imagine the 2 circles as 2 pipes welded into a frame and the frame being theoretically bolted into the ground, so the pipes are fixed in space but can still deflect away from each other. The rectangular bit as another pipe/beam jammed in between them. The triangular arrow implies where I'm applying a force.

Am I correct in thinking that to work out the forces on each of the circle ""pivot points"" I just need to work out the moments and that's it, or is there more complicated math to consider. For example if the beam was 1000mm long, with 1000N force applied downwards on the end where the arrow is, then the force acting down on the right pivot point would be 1000Nm. And at the same time if the distance between the ""Pivot points"" was 200mm, then the leftmost pivot point would be 800Nm? Which would cause it to splay out, the right beam deflecting down more than the left one would be deflecting up?

I kind of confused myself and not sure how to figure out the relationship of the forces involved, I want to know the forces acting on each of the pivot points to figure out if my assembly is strong enough. (Which it is, but out of curiosity I want to know how much over-engineered it is, and if I can cut down on some material).

16,What minimum wall thickness do I need for a threaded cylinder with 0.4375(inch)-20 threads,1567796816," 

Hello I am currently designing a cap that fits over a threaded cylinder. Due to certain limiting conditions the cylinder diameter can only be so large.

here is link with the description of the problem below:

[https://imgur.com/a/qCEskxw](https://imgur.com/a/qCEskxw)

Currently the cylinder's outer diameter is 26.77mm with an inner diameter of 25.28, This leaves a wall thickness of 1.49mm and we have to cut standard 0.4375(inch)-20 threads cut into it, leaving a minimum wall thickness of 0.8mm after the threads have been cut. It threads into a cap, both parts are 300 series stainless steel, the product is a consumer stainless water bottle, besides compressing o-rings to seal the bottle, the cap does not experience intense pressures. I have attached a link so you guys can see, ignore the space between the cap threads and cylinder threads, I don't want to waste time modelling until I solve this question.

My question is does this wall thickness give enough meat for the cap to hold on to and not break down the line? Is 0.8mm minimum wall thickness too thin for these threads in stainless steel? I have seen rules of thumb for fastener design where as long as you give the same thickness to wall as the fastener is wide you are ok, but obviously this can't apply to cap design where I have such a wide cylinder and cap.\\

The gutters are made of a PVC extrusion and are dark grey. The open end is shielded from water falling directly above.

The water is from a city water source and we don't want to significantly change the composition of the water.

Filming them dead on isn't going to work as they are part of an enclosed compartment which we can't access while equipment is running.

The idea we've come up with is to paint the inside surfaces of the gutters near the open end with a water soluble substance which will be removed by the flowing water, but not by light spray/misting. This would leave us with a tell tale of the depth of flowing water.

One way to do it is by using an inverse engineering technique in a software like ANSYS.  


I'd like to know as many ways that can be done as possible.

I.e. the elevation of the tracks decreases, then increases back again since the actual stations themselves are more or less on the same level.

The best answers were about the municipality planning other lines above/below existing tracks or that the depressions helps acceleration and the climb back up reduces braking - thus reducing wear and tear on components.  These answers make sense.

However, many started saying that it saves energy because when a body in motion goes into a dip rather than a straight line, somehow it saves energy.  My understanding of conservation of energy rejects this because although it might sound intuitive, it cannot be physically true - travelling the same distance in a perfectly horizontal line must be the lowest energy way of travelling.

64,Wanted Advice for how to approach last school year/ post graduation for an Underwhelming ME/AE Student entering Senior Year of college (kind of a series of topics to address regarding Entry Level),1567724199,"I won't lie... my track record is underwhelming. So I'm not trying to pretend I'll be on par with those who gave it all in for high school and college after a good year, and it will obviously require effort. But, I'm wondering how I can best position myself to be competitive at this point.                 

And I guess another point is I really have NO IDEA what to expect when I Graduate, it seems likely that it will turn into apply to everybody and their mother kind of thing though, and being able to relocate is a minimum expectation (from SoCal) . 

I won't be graduating with much job experience, and will have no internships, as of now I have no research experience and not too much in terms of cap stone projects. My GPA is decent (but not as good for Upper Division classes), but outside that (which is more important than GPA), I'm just not going to be competitive at all in the entry level job market. My discomfort with taking a low paying engineering job, which seems to be confirmed here, is not at all the low pay itself, but the fact that from reading comments that low pay automatically means unmeaningful or not at all real engineering experience as well as the fact that its inherently a bad employer and that its hard to work yourself up from that.  I've heard a lot that ME/AE is either you make it or you don't as a graduate, and that in general its a whole lot less robust of a market than say, an SE/EE/CS/CE graduate would experience. I kind of would like addressing on how true this really is or any nuance, but thats kind of my conclusion from reading a lot here               

Anyway, My plans Senior Year is (which I should mostly be focusing on at this point) :        

1. Work Part Time in Food Service (hopefully  I can log about 17 hours a week or something)
2. Take 4 classes/quarter and hopefully get like a  3.8 GPA (10 Upper Division MAE and 2 gen eds)  for the year              
3. Joining a Project which seems mostly comprised of graduate students, its research adjacent (if that makes sense) but is also a senior capstone. It's unsteady aerodynamics/ Controls related. I certainly won't be on any leadership position for this project, and I wasn't on my limited experience with other projects. Hoping to have a good commulative design report and weekly tasks presentations at the end of the year
4. ? I'm trying to brainstorm CE/CS/Embedded Projects I can do and currently trying to familiarize myself with digital architecture, compilers, operating systems, programming topics, etc., so any personal project pertaining to that will most likely start in January. Want to wait to see how Fall Quarter goes.                 

***Now, I have some actual questions/inquries :***            

How much will an improved Senior year over my first three years make up for lack of internships, etc.?  , I know not 100 percent but other than that I'm not really sure at all. I guess I'm kind of fishing for a particular answer on this admittedly to jumpstart motivation 

Going into an engineering discipline you struggled to find opportunities for as a BS graduate for graduate school is a lofty idea &gt; How True or False is his?      

If your first job is something like drafting or a non engineering task,  do you think it would be best just to revamp your  career to CS or something that can more likely be self initiated, if you have just about equal interest in that with ME? 

How worthwhile will it be to spend time trying to learn the intricacies of FEA or CFD, and if I do, is there a best way to present your knowledge? I've heard a lot of negative opinions about something like this , same goes with whether I should aim for the CSWP sometime this year (have completed the CSWA), with the same conflicting opinions surrounding the idea of nonwork study/certificates. Is something like an informal article written about certain intracicies of a simulation (since actually a simulating a product with physical testing is difficult) and being able to answer questions about it worth anything? I'm unsure how much opportunities in practice there will be for this on my senior project or if it will be aerodynamic topics beyond me, making any analysis  I do kind of meaningless          

Should I build personal projects more around a design portfolio linked on my resume description of the project, or to be able to answer interview questions, or both?               

Is working a job at McDonalds or at a food stand in an ammusement park a better go to for a post graduation pending period than a lot of these minimum wage engineering adjacent jobs I hear about with those who didn't have an impressive resume and experience that stuck out?  I've heard of the latter kind of roles being blamed for late career low salaries and lack of opportunities, while I doubt the former plays any real bearing             

Is it unreasonable to think that if you didn't get an offer in 100 applications, that you might get an offer in 400 or 700 applications? 

How much would being willing to move to an area like witchita, or in general less competitive than SoCal, amount to for acquiring entry level positions? I think you conclude its easier, but how much exactly I have no idea

My hypothesis is that well the panels V- line is the same as earth, in essence it's floating, so when I connected the board GND and the panel GND together the voltage could have been significant to me, i.e. although I'm touching GND, were all grounded/floating at different voltages relative to each other.

I understand if that's appealing to a lot of people, but I also want to be working on cool things. Who doesn't? I'm worried that accepting this position might pigeonhole me for future roles, but I see nothing but upsides in working with embedded firmware and continuing to practice my coding. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I don't really know is what I actually want to concentrate in - I like sampling different things and would get a little bored doing the same thing. I also have somewhat distant aspirations of moving to Silicon Valley and getting caught up in the hectic startup lifestyle like some of my friends have done. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have worries about the industry as a whole: the company had a bad fiscal year, and growth is down a lot as China and Europe slow. There were layoffs in another department as they shift (slowly...) towards EV. Automotive is really going through big changes right now and I don't know how quickly we can roll with the punches.

20,"How to improve myself for my career, communication wise?",1567643112,"  

I am currently stuck in my engineering career where I want to earn more but I can’t get the damn promotion. Probably because I am naturally lazy and don’t like to over-exert myself.

However, I wasn’t always like that. In the very early years of my career, I was enthusiastic and just want to work and prove myself. I happily worked over time and constantly asked for more. But in the end, when the time came for my performance review, I’ve found myself being considered average. When I repealed to the manager by saying I did this and that so I demand better compensation, the manager replied, that is what I am paid to do, so suck it up.

This shocked me and really woke me up on what stuffs I should be working on.

I’ve been working hard on things I’ve been given to do and have been very busy, but I noticed that most of my work were really just “busy works”. I was not involved in high importance, high visibility tasks. Instead, I was thrown into some works that were needed to be done but less important. Maybe this is because most jobs I’ve done were assigned. I never really volunteered on jobs that was not initially available for me.

I see some colleagues and they all seem so busy, because they are constantly going into meetings, talking to managers, dealing with hot issues, etc. After all the hustle and bustle, they end up finishing the hot project and always handed a prize for their hard work. They even do some presentations of their findings afterwards but really, I don’t see how they are “better” than me in terms of skills. Basically, I think I do similar amount of work as they do but my line of work doesn’t get visibility.

So I guess, all the manager sees are those people who constantly have meetings while, I am quietly just chugging away doing busy works. While, this is in part my fault. When I speak, I don’t like to over sell myself. Rather, I lack confidence when someone is asking me something. This is my bad habit, but I try to not to over promise. Rather, I would like to under promise and over deliver. But this back fires because sometimes when the time came for manager to look for someone to put out a fire, he rather pick someone over me. This is because the manager doesn’t have much confidence in me.

On top of this, I actually enjoy working on low pressure stuff. Basically, I want to just come into work, do my thing and chill. Don’t want to work on something where manager is breathing down on my neck. I am making excuse to myself, saying my work doesn’t really matter. Recently, I’ve become so lethargic so I come late to work. But no one really cares.

I think these are the reasons why I am stuck in my career. I feel very unfulfilled.

So, as I’ve been researching about this. There are number of things I can try and one of them is my communication.

Can you guys point me in the right direction on where I can improve?

Specifically, I am looking to improve on exuding confidence and able people to trust me.

I want to be “go-to guy” so that I can get more involved.

I probably also need to prove people that I have the necessary skill set. But how can I really build the skills, if I am constantly given easy but busy jobs?",AskEngineers,False,ag_silver,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cztbqp/how_to_improve_myself_for_my_career_communication/

L/360 is the minimum criteria we use as a company.  

In the past several of my superiors, including this one, have encouraged me to use more stringent deflection criteria for elements that might experience higher than average traffic, and we have completed many projects with selectively stringent deflections on certain members. So this idea that the plan reviewer will not approve the project because some of the beams are oversized or sized differently is new to me, and seems pretty inconsistent with the past instructions I was given.

During this conversation I also expressed to my boss that I thought there was some leeway given to us as designers to choose the allowable deflection, as long as we choose something that is above the limit required by the code, but I received the same answer that the plan reviewer will not accept the project.

In the past, I have used a 6-gallon air compressor with the output set to around 2-3 psi. The issue I had was that the compressor would run very frequently and overheat on long cuts.

Because of how badly I wanted to work at this place, I came in with an attitude of ""I'll sweep the floors if that's what I need to do to get my foot in the door"", and I didn't say no to *anything*.

However, it's been 4 years, and I'm no longer at the bottom of the totem pole, but I feel like I've already been typecast as the guy who takes care of all the administrative stuff.  I'm the guy in our division that makes the purchases on company credit cards, and has the reconcile the statements, and who people go to to make big purchases.  I'm the one with the institutional knowledge, so people come and ask ""Do we have an oscilloscope/function generator that can do X/Y/Z?  Can you help me set it up?"" or ""Can you send me the source code for your cool LaTeX formatting?"" or whatnot.

It feels like I spend 3/4 of my time just reacting to requests, be it emails or people just coming up to me and asking for help.  It feels like it's been forever since my last deeply focused day of pure design from morning until night.  Is this just how it is as you progress through your career?  Can I at least leverage this to aim for a manager type position, if that's what I'm doing anyway?

I feel like I followed the classic advice of ""be willing to sweep the floors to get in the door"", and I don't know how to turn that off and say ""No, that's not what I want to do anymore"".  And I feel like I stand in stark contrast to a more recent engineer we hired (who's younger than me actually).  He's definitely a character, but he seems much more able to cultivate a ""brand"" for himself as someone that is too good to be disturbed.  He regularly just ups and leaves meetings, or never attends because he has ""too much to do"".  He'll never even slow down his stride in the hallway if someone asks him ""how's it going"" or ""can you..."", he just interrupts them and says ""I have too much work to do"".  He has absolutely no scruples about passing off boring/administrative work to people even more senior to himself, with the excuse that he's just working too hard.  The guy is able to just create this air that he deserves to do all the of the fun design work, that his ASICs are the only projects that matter in our group, that all the glory should go to his paper and his patents, and he can almost make you feel bad for assuming he should do something so pedestrian as fill out a requisition himself for the oscilloscope he damn wants.

And the worst part is...it seems to work.  While among the rank and file, people say things like ""that guy deserves a slap"", the upper management loves how much of a ""go-getter"" he is, and he does have this charm.  I wish I had the balls to have an attitude like him, but I just feel like I'd be rude all day, just saying ""no"" every 10 minutes.  I think part of it is that I come from a blue collar family, and it's just ingrained in me that you never say ""no"" to a superior.  You do everything they ask you and then some, and then you find ways to keep busy, that sort of mentality.

59,Know any Filipino electrical engineers from your country?,1567598236,"Hey, undergrad from the Philippines here with a bachelors in electrical engineering and pure Filipino nationality. Want to work abroad with a working visa so I want to know the proper field in electrical engineering I should get experience in to even remotely get a chance of working abroad.

I’m eyeing Canada, Australia, New Zealand, EU, and maybe US, though I doubt US because of recent policies there. (Second option is middle eastern countries because I know for a fact there are a lot more Filipino engineers there, so I would like to know about the first few countries I mentioned because there are fewer things to research online.)

Electrical Engineering education for all the schools in the Philippines is more focused on the Power Industry (Generation, Transmission, Distribution, and Wiring Design) and HV electric machines and equipment (generators and motors) hence the job opportunities in our country are for similar fields. There are a few opportunities for instrumentation, automation and control, and illumination.

Electronics and communications, as well as computer and software engineering are distinct fields here. I’m saying this because it would be near impossible for me to get experience in these fields if that’s what you would suggest.

If possible, maybe I could also get the emails of the Filipino engineers you know so I could correspond with them directly. Is working in the countries I mentioned remotely possible? How are the logistics of getting a license to practice EE in a different country? Is there something crucial I don’t even know yet? Would like to know your input.

61,How easy is it to get fired as a Graduate Mechanical Engineer?,1567595962,"Hi everyone, I’m just starting out my career as a Mechanical Engineer and I’ve been stressing out lately about getting fired because I did mistakes that are visible to the clients.

I understand that graduates are almost guaranteed to make mistakes but my mistakes were not spotted by my supervisors and were pointed out by the clients. What’s worse is that my supervisors trusted me with some big tasks (that they preferred me to do rather than the other Graduates) and I felt like I let them down by doing all these mistakes.

To be a bit clearer, the mistakes were on two different projects but same recurring theme - my lack of thoroughness.

So that leads to my main question: will I get fired if I keep on doing the same type of mistakes?

And an additional question: what should I do to improve my thoroughness as an engineer?

62,Should I take on an engineering technician position as a recent mech eng grad?,1567594878,"Graduated in May and have been constantly applying only to get daily rejection emails. I've had 3 interviews with no offers unfortunately. Recently been offered an opportunity to work for a large manufacturing company as an engineering technician with the promise of a promotion to engineer. (Just to clarify: The ""promise"" is merely word from the direct connect who's offering me this opportunity). Now, I'm taking that with a grain of salt considering all the previous online advice I've read, but is it a bad idea to take this offer? I don't want my degree to go to waste, but I also don't want to miss out on an opportunity to work for a big company like this. 

I'm just afraid this minimum 1-1.5 years of technician experience will kill any chances of a decent engineering position in the future. I'd like to believe that it'll carry me into a higher position within the company, but there's no guarantee. Another factor is the living expenses doubling compared to my current location. Pay is actually decent despite it being hourly wage. Solid benefits package. 

Some things I've considered: getting laid off or not getting the promotion.

I need to pick some of your engineering brains. I'm not an engineer, but I'm trying to build a system for my work and I have a problem.

Basically, the system is housed on top of something that spins clockwise. I need to power that system without batteries and hook it up to a few other things, so it is has a number of cables connected to it.

Is it possible to build it a certain way/but a certain connector to keep it from twisting the wires over time?

66,How can I settle on a specific language ?,1567579908,"Hello Engineers , I am a college student (3rd year) studying Computer Science. Before getting admitted to college I was very eager to learn about technology . I had experience with basic C programming I wanted to learn other languages but didn't have an active Internet connection. But after admitting into college I had moved out form my parents house and finally had a broadband connection. So I begun learning stuffs like c++, python etc and learnt about competitive programming. I took part in some programming contests. I even got a chance to participate in the ACM ICPC regional contest . But after that I shifted my focus to explore more things in the world of programming. So I was trying to learn every language that I came across. I tried java, python, Javascript(of which  I am constantly learning about different frameworks) , processing,php. And yesterday I learnt about flutter so I rushed to learn more about it.   So now the problem that I am facing is I don't know what should I do. what should I learn ? It's not like that I don't like python so I left it and started to learn Javascript ,I still find interest  ,I still like python. I have a bunch of tutorials on my pc. The problem is before finishing one of them completely I find my self learning about another thing. Yesterday I was making a project on node.js following a tutorial then I stumbled upon flutter.

69,Civil engineering student and intern: am I over-thinking things at my current place of work?,1567574840,"First, thank you for your time, I know it's a bit of a lengthy read but I've tried my best to share what I felt was necessary for the questions I'm asking. 

 I've got some concerns about my job and I'd appreciate some input from engineers who have more job experience, especially those who have experience in the civil/construction/structural/environmental engineering fields as they would almost certainly have worked in a similar realm and would have some insight in regards to my specific concerns, but please everyone feel free to chime in. 
 I am currently in my fourth semester at a tech school for civil engineering. In my first semester I was hired on as an intern at a local consulting civil engineering firm, I didn't know much at that point and had no experience in the field but was hired on regardless; a small part of me believes it might have been affirmative action(female), another part believes it might be because few people are actually looking to be a civil PE and they liked the potential of molding one from the ground up. I was pretty hopeful I'd get to learn the how-to and apply things I was learning but didn't get utilized as I'd hoped; for several months I really just organized our archive rooms or did some very basic research for projects. There came a point where it seemed like they didn't know what to do with me anymore, there was no willingness to train me in anything, despite my verbal eagerness to do so, and they'd run out of small tasks for me to do. I wanted to start putting the skills I was learning in school to use, so I pushed and pushed and finally was put on a survey crew. I have been on the crew for about 2-3 months part time, as they are working me around my classes. I have been told I'm doing well.
 We've recently had cutbacks. 80% of our jobs come from the DOT and as I can best understand it, the DOT has tightened the purse strings. They have all the survey crews starting a half hour later than usual and surveyors don't work Fridays anymore, so that instead of the usual 50-55 hours that full-timers were usually working, now everyone really just meets their 40. There's been a few people leave(not just surveyors, but a few different positions) without any intention to replace them, people are getting shuffled around from one position to another, and a couple have been laid off because there's just no work for them (mostly inspectors). All this was very concerning to me because as I'm still the technical intern I figure if there's more fat to trim, I'll be one of the first to be let go. My concern was doubled down today as I received a text from my boss telling me that, though I was previously on the schedule, there have been some, ""set backs,"" and the schedule has been revised and I am to, ""lay low,"" this week. Meaning, I'm off the schedule completely. 
Is this just the typical ups and downs I can expect in this field? I know this work relies heavily on the economy. Should I be worried about my job and start looking for another?

I was talking to the recruiter and I think they liked my experience and projects and I think they are considering me to move onto the next step, which might be talking to the actual hiring manager. Anyways, they are offering me 50k/year to move there, no relocation costs (because its entry level position), a night shift 3/4 schedule doing EE work. I dont mind working at night if it will get me experience, the only problem I'm having now is the 50k a year salary. I did a bit of research and for Intel it seems that 80k is the starting salary there for an EE. I looked around and ziprecruiter is saying the avg. is 52k in Oregon and others list a range 65k - 100k. Theres no way in hell a recruiter, or a hiring manager for that matter, will offer me 100k so I'm not even entertaining that figure for a starting position. I'm not really sure what figure I should ask the recruiter to consider if they would like to consider me for the position. I dont want to ask for a lot, I need an engineering job and the exp, but I don't want to be underpaid either in an area that is a bit expensive to live in. Mainly looking for advice here. The recruiters might stop considering me if I'm asking for more than they want to offer (I'm unsure how recruiters actually work and what they get if they get employees in for low salaries).

86,I'm brainstorming ideas on how to extend and improve on the concepts in the Light L16. What ideas would you like to add?,1567553728,"I do artistic photography and study the technical side during my free time. I researched the Light L16 and other examples that use multiple lens and sensor combos. I also researched ideas on smartphones with optical zoom that are thin. If feasible, I would like the ideas put in smartphone cameras too.

The problem with the Light L16 is that there is no optical zoom. The ""zoom"" works by cropping and is destructive to the end product. It changes arrays for different focal lengths. The smartphone makers Asus and Oppo made models that used the periscope principle to enable continuous optical zoom in a thin device.

I know most periscopes use mirrors to reflect light. They allow people to see above a wall without raising their heads above. My concern with implementing an optical zoom on an array is that the overlap will change and cancel out the benefits of using an array to improve resolving power. An idea I thought of was to use mirrors to adjust the overlap as the focal length increases. This is to enable optical zoom on an array of sensor and lens combos, maintain the same resolving power and overlap, and deliver the equivalent of one large sensor.

Another idea is: in each lens in the array there will be an element that takes the light from a given nominal aperture (iris opening) and concentrate it onto the small sensor chips. This is to improve optical quality and resolving power for the smaller sensors.

At an optical level, I would like to have the array to deliver a maximum iris opening and design that delivers the same depth of field as f/2.8 on full frame 35mm DSLRs. The iris opening should be adjusted continuously to enable the equivalent of f/16 and anywhere in between. Would concentrating the light still be okay? The array needs optical stabilization, parfocal zoom, and the ability to adjust focal length during video without a counter adjustment as a side effect.

For the built in xenon flash, it will pass through a diffuser to soften the flash and help prevent red eye. What material is best for this diffuser that will be built in? I'm asking because there are different options.

To improve auto exposure reliability, the camera will assign regions of similarity to subgroups (it's strata, a statistics concept; the subgroups vary in size). If a subgroup doesn't reflect enough light, it is ignored. If a subgroup receives too much light, the sensor will lower sensitivity (electrical gain) by 1-3 stops. It's like lowering the ISO for a specific region.

Things that will be a given for standalone device include: using a low level OS made for embedded systems (unlike L16 which uses Android which is a general purpose OS), dual pixel phase detect, infrared based distance measurement (Time of Flight), OPF CMOS global shutter, interchangeable batteries, analog gamma compression, sensor level hot pixels detection (no more dark frames), buttons, and touchscreen. The global shutter will enable flash sync (internal or external) at all shutter speeds without leaf shutters or HSS. The analog gamma compression curve will enable higher dynamic range without punishing preemptive overexposure (side note: I found this idea in a 2014 research paper).

Target costing will be used but quality control comes first. It may mean omitting then adding later and that's okay.

There will be functions that will reduce guesswork for laymen and advanced users alike. An example is tapping specific points in the frame to select specifically what the operator wants in focus while blurring what's behind it. There will be a landscape focusing mode that automatically adjusts the settings to get what's near and far in good focus.

87,What advice do you have for an Industrial Engineering grad who doesn't feel confident in their abilities as an engineer?,1567553388,"Hi everyone,

I graduated in January with my ISE my degree with a very low GPA and it was a very rocky road. I've always felt incredibly out of place in engineering school and in my current situation I really don’t know who to turn to for advice:

I worked 2 internships over the summers and in both of these I didn't get a return offer because I guess I didn’t do a good job/fit in. I would be cooped up in my cubicle doing the tasks I was assigned and that was it... I would try to ask questions, but it felt like I would just be constrained to these (what felt like) meaningless tasks where I wasn't able to go to interesting meetings where I would truly gain valuable experience. Maybe I didn't properly ever break the ice with my managers, and this was the result of that.

After working those internships, trying to interact with managers and even my senior design group, I’ve been seriously questioning my abilities as an IE/engineer. I realized I never really say or had those engineering moments that sort of affirm to others like 'ok this guy has it, he belongs here.' I been hoping this has something to do with anxiety but now I’m not so sure it does. I like the concepts of associated with IE and they interest me, but I struggled to get C's, sometimes in not the most ethical way. I feel like if I truly belonged, I wouldn't need to do that, but then again, I've heard how little grades matter in the real world.

The bottom line is, all these feelings have left me very lost and trepidatious about applying/jumping into a typical starting IE role. I don’t see how that job will be any different from my internship experiences and I’m trying to see if there’s anything I can do now so they are far from it.

It would really mean a lot if anyone had advice for me in terms of what roles they think I should look into or anything I can do (or self-learn/gain a background) in this gray area between working that I could benefit from that would be great. I do have a six sigma green belt from 2 years ago but I’ve always had trouble in utilizing/applying the concepts. It feels like I just have this degree without knowing much of anything or having experience so if there’s anything I can do right now to feel more confident in my ability to do the work that would be amazing. I am just feeling very lost

90,B.S in Biochemistry to PhD in Engineering Discipline,1567548233,"Hello Engineers, 

Freshly graduated Biochemistry BS here. Im finding myself in a bit of a pickle of where to proceed after graduation; I originally had this grand plan to go to medical school, followed by the realization that med school wasn't for me and that graduate school/the workforce suited my interests better. After doing tons of research, and asking both science and engineering friends about their respective careers, I have found that my BS in Biochemistry is extremely limiting (both in scope of usefulness and in monetary compensation) and I think I am looking to make a pivot out of science and into engineering. I have a few questions about how and if this is possible for me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **What engineering disciplines may be plausible for me to study in graduate?** I am currently interested in ChemE, BioE, and BME, which are the only three disciplines I can see myself being successful in. Subject wise, I am mostly interested in things on the molecular/cell level, but am willing to do things on the macro level as well. **Is there any real difference between bioengineering and BME?**
2. I really love science. I have a VERY solid foundation of basic chemistry, organic chemistry, and am currently improving my biochemistry knowledge. I have a year of experience teaching my own Gen Chem 2 lab, years of tutoring/teaching, and 3 years of research. On top of this I have the best accolades my small university offered, including a prestigious engineering scholarship that I turned down after my first year to pursue science. I was hired out of undergrad to do a biochemistry/bioengineering project at a medical school in the midwest, which is where I am currently. **Will I be a competitive graduate school applicant despite my massive lack of engineering training? What skills should I expect to have to learn outright?**
3. **For those that choose to pursue higher education (PhD or Masters), which did you pursue and why?** As a scientist, I was hell-bent on getting a PhD so that I could run my own lab and not be at the bench all day. **As an engineer, would a Masters allow me upwards mobility to run my own projects? Would a Masters degree allow someone with a Biochemistry degree to gain enough engineering experience to even make it worth it?** 
4. Finally, and this may come across as shallow, but I am wanting to pivot out of science mostly due to the abysmal pay. I feel that I have found an area of study (bioengineering, BME, etc) that allows me to not feel like im ""selling out"" of science, but the romantic view of science is starting to pass and I am wanting to focus on building my future, starting by obtaining a secure job. **Is the job outlook for bioengineering/BME positive, when compared to a science analogue? If you could compare a day at work from a Biochemist to a Bioengineer, what would be some key differences?** 

To anyone that replies, thank you so much. I know this is quite a lot of questions but It feels like I am starting from nothing when my whole career in medicine felt very straightforward, now I have to find a career path that both interests me, challenges me, and pays well.

Would it be appropriate for me to bring up the fact that I want to be promoted sooner than scheduled?

97,Engineering Career Advice -- Decision to Pursue a Master's,1567536441,"Hi!

I'm currently a senior studying Mechanical Engineering, and as I begin my final year, I'm starting to look ahead to my post-graduation options. I'm currently deciding on whether I want to enter the full-time workforce with my bachelor's degree or stay for additional schooling to complete a master's degree (in mechanical or manufacturing engineering). For context, based on my credits, it would only take me 1 year to finish the master's degree, which is a plus. For additional context, my reasoning for wanting a master's degree in engineering is because I really love the field and I know that I want to work a very technical job.

I'm interested in the idea of entering the full-time workforce with my bachelor's degree because I would be able to start making a yearly salary right away. However, I'm interested in completing a master's degree because I love learning. Additionally, the only way I want to complete a master's degree is if I do it immediately after my bachelor's while I'm still in 'school mode'. However, the downside is that during that 1 year, I could have made a year's worth of salary if I just went into the workforce with my bachelor's.

To help with my decision, I'm hoping I could receive some input on the following questions:

**1.)** When an engineering company is recruiting for an Engineer I, is preference given to an applicant that has a master's degree?

**2.)** When an engineering company is recruiting for an Engineer II or higher, is preference given to an applicant that has a master's degree, or is experience in the field more valuable at this point?

**3.)** When an engineering company is extending an offer to an Engineer, does having a master's degree come with an increased salary? If so, is there an approximate dollar amount that this difference would be (for example: $5,000/year more)?

I'd also just love to hear everyone's thoughts on my situation. Will staying an extra year at school, not working, be worth receiving the master's? Thank you all for your time! Cheers!",AskEngineers,False,MechApple1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cz90hf/engineering_career_advice_decision_to_pursue_a/

  Some background: I graduated as an ME in 2017 and first worked as a Inside Applications Sales Engineer then as a design engineer. I had a lot of downtime in the Sales role, and started learning VBA and Macros to help with the job and because it was interesting. The role I'm in now said that I'd be doing some VBA, but for the past year it's been all Design work despite my best efforts, and I'd rather not do 2D cad any longer than I have to. Eventually I'd like to get an MBA, and wanted my next role to be a somewhat Business-y role and have a solid tuition reimbursement so my savings don't bleed too badly.   
  
  I've always been very interested in data and statistics, and am currently applying for analyst/data analytics roles, but have found that a lot of them are either way too advanced (ie 5+ years in analyst roles or dealing with languages I haven't learned) and tailored more for actual business majors, or that they're very entry level and would be a significant salary cut. As my title states, is there a certain engineer role that deals more with data analyzing but wouldn't be a complete restart on my career path? I'd also prefer a role that pays well and maybe offers a slight salary bump compared to my current role (When I graduated they said the average for my major was $70k, after 2 years of working I'm currently at $65k although I am in a lower COL area compared to places like California.)  
  Thank you very much for reading all of this, and I apologize if this isn't the correct forum to post in.

16,Solidworks or Fusion 360 Guide or Walk Through,1567519121,"So this is pretty humbling, but I need some help re-learning Soldworks. I have an engineering degree, and am growing tired of my current non-engineering position, as well as my company. I still have a good grasp on thermo, programming, and math in general, but due to silly union rules, I haven't been able to touch a drafting program in the last decade. 

I obtained a copy of Solidworks and Fusion 360 to start teaching myself drafting again on my home computer. I sat down to start building a couple of sprockets just to get the feel of Solidworks again, but I couldn't even define my drawing. 

I used to be fairly proficient with Solidworks. I taught it at Uni and made some really neat stuff in it like a watch and grandfather clock that had good enough ratios in them they kept time. I guess it is one of those skills that falls under, ""if you don't use it, you lose it."" I am fairly confident when I get the basics back, I will pick up and run with it again fairly quickly. I have a lot of field experience and hands on experience now that I can incorporate into designs as well, and draw upon when making drawings, so I think I'll end up being a better engineer for it. 

So, what is the best way to re-learn Solidworks, or Fusion 360, from the beginning without going back to school? Are there any great youtube channels or books or anything I can use at home? I have hunted around on youtube a little, but I haven't found any super videos helpful for beginner level yet. I remember all the vocabulary and random stuff like how to make patters and what not, but right now I'm struggling with defining drawings and even getting different parts to extrude correctly. Everything I have found so far assumes I already know how to do the most basic stuff but that's what I'm having trouble with. I'm also fairly out of touch with what has changed over the years, and a lot of these resources didn't exist when I learned Solidworks, so I don't know what I should be looking for. I just thought of it this moment, but even a user guide from the publisher would be useful. 

My end goal is I want to re-learn it well enough to start printing 3D parts for personal stuff and be able to talk about my drafting skills in interviews. I'm also ok with learning Fusion 360 if there are better resources out there for that.

when pouring concrete rather than full fluid head PMax is often used from ciria report 108.

Fluid Static head is 140 Kn/m²

i have a PMax of 100 Kn/m², due to temp and pour rate.

have had a design checked and need to reduce the uplift acting on some formwork.

have been advised to reduce pour rate, which would decrease PMax to say 75 Kn/m², to reduce uplift on formwork body

&amp;#x200B;

just dont get how this would affect the buoyancy and uplift.

as for the uplift i would calculate volume being displaced by formwork x density of the fluid

so say volume of body is 100 m³ x Concrete Density 25 kn/m³ = would be an uplift force of 2500 Kn

But I'm not getting any response. I did my Bachelor from Bangladesh. And don't have any degree from the U.S accept FE exam. I'm also a CSWA and CSWP. I've experience using various CAD software. I don't know what is wrong. Any junior mechanical engineering position would be good for me. Right now i don't care about salary. I just want to gain experience. I'm confident of getting any types of certification as i know my things. Should I wait? or it's like i'm not going to get any job. I'm kind of getting depressed. If something is wrong i can work on that. But at this moment i don't know what is wrong. As i recently immigrated here so i need a job quickly. I need some suggestion. I really appreciate your time if you can give me any suggestion.

46,How can I get the most out of my first out of school Engineering Job?,1567456886,"I graduated from Chemical Engineering in May 2019. After graduation, I decided to do some traveling which took up most of May and June. When I started applying to jobs near the end of June, I felt I was a little behind in this whole job application race but I wasn't too worried as I had about a year worth of co-op experience in manufacturing. Thankfully, I was able to find a permanent position in a small plant as a process engineer within the GTA area (I'm from Toronto) near the end of July and I started working from the first week of August.   

It is in the food and beverages industry. The plant focuses on manufacturing juices and dairy beverages. My role is focused on the dairy product line and it's closer to a production engineer role rather than process engineer (day to day operation, troubleshooting production-related issues, meeting production parameters, supervising operators, etc. It's not project-based at all). While I don't see much opportunity for career growth, I still think it is a great place to learn about the basics of the food industry. My goal right now is to stick around for about eight months to a year and learn as much as possible.  

Truth be told, the pay is very shit for the first three months (probational period). It's $19/hr and I work about 50 hours a week. When I had gotten the offer, the plant manager mentioned that at the end of the three months, there should be a pay increase. After one month in, I am starting to become more and more comfortable in my day to day role. As for the remaining two months, I want to maximize my learning opportunities and show plant management that I am worth investing in so that I can negotiate a better wage/salary after my probational period.    

So, with all this in mind, I want to ask you guys:   
* What can I do within the next two months that will allow me to negotiate the best deal for myself and how should I go about it?  
* What wage should I push for? I want to stay hourly and I don't think they will agree with $30/hr or more.

I’m an MEP engineer with just over one years experience.  I recently had my one year evaluation and came prepared with two salary reports, one from PayScale and one from Glassdoor.  Both put my current value at $58-59k.  The review was going pretty well, and I’m pretty sure if it weren’t for me bringing it up, I wouldn’t have even gotten a raise.  He offered $57k, and I told him I would feel more comfortable at $60k (the median), but I couldn’t get him to budge.

I was contacted by a slightly larger MEP firm before the evaluation and have a tentative appointment to come by their office after work.  I think an eventual offer is highly possible given them reaching out to me telling me they have an immediate need and my phone call with the CEO going well.

If I’m given the opportunity, how do I go about making my exit?  I’ve saved up quite a few vacation days, will they just write a check for the equivalent, or do you think I’m going to have to push on this?

I definitely don’t want to burn bridges because I need them to approve my relevant experience to earn my P.E.  I’m pretty sure they are fully aware they are underpaying me and even heard the word “loyalty” so I doubt they are going to pay me my market value in the future.

My goal is to bring the outside to the original condition while updating the inside with modern amenities like a TV and phone chargers. One must-have is air conditioning - if I'm camping at the beach, this thing will be a hotbox without AC. But in the interest of keeping the original look, i want to conceal the AC unit.

My idea is to get a window AC unit and put it in an old aluminum ice chest, which i can bolt to the tongue of the trailer, butted right up against the front of the chassis. I could cut off the front of the ice chest and replace it with a thin aluminum grate, so that the heat exchanger would have access to fresh air. The panel I cut off the front of the cooler could be put back into place when I'm not using it. I can run power to it in some flexible conduit.

So, assuming i could find an ice chest the right size, and the ice chest would fit on the trailer tongue, I'm looking for opinions on whether this could be done effectively and safely. Also looking for ideas on what hardware i could use to to pull air from the trailer into the A/C, and vent the conditioned are back into the trailer.

57,Magnetic fixturing tool for a production robot cell,1567433716,"I am currently assigned to a project which involves the development of a tool used to create linear motors. We are using a robot cell to automate the process of glueing magnets onto our steel backplates. Due to the restrictions of the design of these backplates we cannot clamp them from the top or in a vise like fixture, thus the idea of a magnetic chuck was born. I am familiar with workholding in the area of machining, but I was unable to find magnetic chucks/plates that are small enough to put in our tool. Most of the magnetic workholding options I found are heavy and large with huge holding forces, intended for grinding, EDM and milling/turning.  


These options are simply to large, since we also have features in the tool for locating the backplates, making space very tight. The plan is to ideally integrate the magnetic chuck into the bottom of the tool to create a nice surface for the part to sit on and still keep our locating features on the sides accessible.

Observing the system, it brings the tank up to approx. 75degC then the main control board will turn off the relay output to the heater contactor, as if the board thinks the tank has reached the set temperature, even though the digital read out reads a temperature of about 75degC. Its as if the main board thinks the set temperature should no longer be 85degC but 75degC instead, although there is no means I can see of changing the temperature set point?

78,"Dumb question about car engineering - could you use a flywheel to 'store' energy from the engine, for later use to help accelerate faster?",1567367845,"I was watching some car modding videos today when a thought struck me.  No, I'm not interested in doing this myself.  I'm not even a car guy.  More than anything, I'm wondering why this *isn't* done in racing situations.  I imagine the answer is that it would be too heavy to provide any benefit.

Suppose you're designing a racing car.  The car will be racing in a race where there are periods during which it's *not* accelerating.

 - For example - a drag race, where a car sits for *minutes* doing nothing at the starting line, before having to rapidly accelerate.
 - For example - a rally, where there are periods when a car's engine has the *capacity* to accelerate more but the driver momentarily wishes to keep the car slower for more control; followed by other periods where the driver wishes to accelerate faster than the engine can allow.

Now suppose you connect the car's engine to a flywheel as well as the car's wheels.  The engine can send the entirety of its power to the wheels by temporarily disconnecting the flywheel.  Somehow, it can also power the wheels a little bit while also spinning up the flywheel.  When the driver requires it, the flywheel can be connected to the wheels, relieving it of its own momentum to spin up the wheels even more.  

 - On a race's starting line, a driver would use the car's engine to spin up the flywheel.  The moment the lights go green, the driver steps on the gas.  The car's computer connects the engine and the flywheel to the wheels.  The momentum stored in the flywheel allows the car to accelerate much faster than a normal car, whose wheels can only be driven by the engine alone.
 - During a period of a rally race where the driver needs to control their speed, the engine might rev up faster than it normally would, for the speed the car's travelling at.  The extra power is sent to the flywheel to spin it up.  The momentum of the flywheel could be used later to help the car accelerate faster when necessary.  This would be similar to regenerative braking, except instead of using the brakes to power the flywheel the engine itself would be used to power the flywheel.  

My questions are:

 - Is this possible, or is it really dumb?
 - Why aren't these systems used in real life?  Is it due to the engineering complexity?  Due to the mass of the flywheel?
 - Are there any other places it could be used?  (For example - perhaps it's too heavy for a racing car, but could be useful in a tank.)",AskEngineers,False,Akucera,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cyeq3i/dumb_question_about_car_engineering_could_you_use/

2,Considering a Transition from MEP Engineering to Defence Industry,1567318230,"A bit of background on my story:

I'm a mechanical engineer in my 8th year out from graduating. My first job out of Uni was in MEP Engineering (specifically Plumbing), at a small consultancy. After 3 years I'd had enough and left to try something else.

I then got a job at Lockheed Martin, which I found was a great company to work for (compared to my previous small, local consultancy), and worked in a couple of different departments over another 3 years. My mechanical degree and MEP experience wasn't  particularly useful at Lockheed though, as the majority of their work in my city was in RF and electronics based projects. After 3 years I had begun to feel somewhat useless and out of place in the company, and thought I'd go back to MEP Engineering.

I left Lockheed when I found a different consultancy in my city, where I was able to get a job doing the same MEP Plumbing type work I'd done previously. I planned to build on my previous MEP experience, and was able to clearly see a career path at the firm. However after 18 months, I'm reliving and rediscovering a lot of the things about the MEP Engineering world I didn't like, and am starting to feel as though I've made the wrong decision. I'm considering getting back into the Defence world, but into a company where I could utilise more of my mechanical skillset.

I'm aware I may have to complete some additional study, but at 8 years out of Uni, would anyone really take me instead of a recent grad with a similar level of knowledge?

&amp;#x200B;

The differences seem to be slightly less emphasis on generalized theory, and more emphasis on of specific applications. That's only true for a few courses anyway. All the core stuff is the same, statics, dynamics, materials ,thermo, fluids etc.

My program only requires math up to calc 2, but I have a math minor anyway, and I didn't even start my major until I had finished calc 4.

12,Career advice- how to pitch silicon valley in the midwest,1567287571,"Hi all, I hope this is the best place to ask this!  


I'm a mechanical engineer in the SF bay area, and I graduated in 2004 from a pretty good school. I was really into design and didn't have the best grades, so I got started in tiny startups. As a result, I have worked for eight companies in fifteen years... and now that I've decided I want to move to the Midwest to be closer to my family and get away from California, I'm worried that my resume will not be very attractive to potential employers because of how things have gone for me here.

As a quick rundown, here's my resume:

* 2 years at a tiny startup that no longer exists; left because they weren't paying people and I thought it was going to fail at any time. 
* 6 months at a tiny startup that also no longer exists; left when they unexpectedly ran out of money and had to let a few people go with no warning.
* 17 months at a very large company, then the entire facility was shut down and everyone was let go.
* 3.5 years at a startup that was later bought; left when my position was eliminated.
* 4 month gap, was traveling (don't list this on the resume, and nobody's asked about it).
* 7 months working for a large university as an engineer; barely paid anything so I left when I found a better gig.
* 5 years 8 months at a startup that grew from 12 people to over 200; startup is still around. Left because new management totally changed the work environment and I didn't see any way to advance any further there. Was promoted to Senior ME after my first year. I list this as two jobs, I figure it looks good to show the promotion happened. I left on decent terms, and could get a dozen  references from this company if I asked around. 
* 10 moths at a startup that cold called me to get me away from my last company. It didn't end up being anything how I thought it would be, and I had a couple of reality checks that I'm really not happy. Rather than go to another bay area company, I think it might be finally time to go to the midwest to be around my family and get away from the craziness of the bay area.

I feel like this level of experience is pretty valuable. I've done a lot of different but related things, I'm flexible and good at learning new tech, and I've seen the right and wrong way to do a bunch of stuff. Still, I've been looking and applying online for a few months and haven't even had any responses. 

Should I cut out the first few jobs? Should I work exclusively with recruiters so that I can explain the situation up front and get past first impressions? Am I overthinking this- maybe the midwest job market is just a lot slower? In this time I've had nearly as many bay area recruiters contact me out of the blue as I have had midwest jobs that I've applied to.

He completely concocted this story. There was only one instance when I deviated from SOP and that was with the manger's direct approval. I was never warned about not following procedures at any point during my employment.

24,MS in ME better than the industry experience after graduating?,1567271613,"I’m currently in my senior year of Mechanical Engineering. A couple of days ago, I received an offer for graduate school that is essentially a full-ride. Surprisingly enough, I’ve been fairly hesitant to say yes to it. I’m having trouble weighing out the pros and cons because I’ve been lucky and grateful to have amazing opportunities with undergrad research as well as internships. I’ve read a lot of opinions online. Both sides (master’s or no master’s) seem to weigh out equally. After reading what some people think, it almost sounds like getting the master’s would almost hold me back. I wanted to give you all an idea of where I’m at experience-wise and gauge whether or not a masters will truly give me an edge (if any) when I enter the full-time workforce. 

On the work side:
During my undergrad, I’ve been working part time during the school year and full time over the summers gaining industry experience through R&amp;D, mechanical design, software implementation, and controls engineering. I couldn’t have asked for a better internship for those reasons, because my experience has not only been specialized in many cases, but spanned across all fields of engineering. Having these opportunities has already set me apart from my undergrad colleagues, and has given me the opportunity to help others learn techniques I did through my experience. 

On the research side:
Since my sophomore year of undergrad, I have been doing additive manufacturing research in FDM and WAAM processes. This involved development mainly in the realms of electrical systems and coding as well as examining micro structures and various materials testing. The master’s offer I have would be a continuation of this where I would be doing primarily microscopy-related tasks, which would likely place my specialty in the realm of materials engineering. 

On the hobby side:
There’s also a lot of projects I do outside of work/school. A lot of them involve mechanical design and hobbyist-level controls such as Arduino’s and Raspberry Pi’s.

In the end, I’m held up on whether or not a master’s would be worth it. I’m all about trying to stand out on resumes because I know how the field is extremely populated with bachelor’s degrees. I also understand that with a lot of what I do, there are other people just like me who have the same types of experiences. I am definitely torn on the decision since it is a full-ride offer and it would only take an extra year of school. There’s definitely just a lot to weigh out.

25,Will Speaker Spikes Attached to My Bed Stop Mechanical Vibrations From Reaching The Mattress?,1567271483,"**Background/Problem:** For the last 6 weeks I've been woken up every night by the feeling of my bed vibrating. The best way I can describe the sensation is a mix between the sensation of standing close to an idling diesel truck and sitting on top of a running washing machine. It's not as extreme as either, but distinct enough to rouse me from sleep, sometimes for two or three hours a night. I'm quite sleep deprived. 

During this same period of time my condo has been renovating the garage 12 stories down, using MASSIVE fans to clear the garage of dust. I'm 90% sure that the vibrations I'm feeling are the fans turning up to a higher strength during certain times. Its absolutely maddening, and will last for at least several more months (at least). It's bad enough my partner and I have talked about moving. We'd like to find a different solution.

**What I've Tried:** Sleeping through it doesn't work, it's too disruptive. So last night I bought a four-pack of anti-vibration pads\*, placed one under each of my bed's wooden feet, and hoped for the best. No luck. The vibration was as strong as ever. I had hoped the pads would dampen the vibrations reaching my mattress. 

\*Link to Pads: [https://www.amazon.com/DiversiTech-MP2-V-Anti-Vibration-Pack/dp/B01KAFG8EG/ref=sr\_1\_2?keywords=diversitech+mp2e&amp;qid=1567270159&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/DiversiTech-MP2-V-Anti-Vibration-Pack/dp/B01KAFG8EG/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=diversitech+mp2e&amp;qid=1567270159&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2)

**Proposed Solution:** In another thread on Reddit I read a proposal by someone who understood audio engineering that speaker spikes could theoretically be used to decrease the vibrations reaching the mattress. The basic principle, so far as I understand it, is to decrease to a near infinitesimal amount the surface area of the bed foot that makes contact with the floor (or whatever is directly coupled to it). The surface area would be so tiny and the pressure at that point so high, that vibrations would have a difficult time passing from the floor into the bed frame. 

**Will it Work?** Does this sound like a plausible solution that an every-day Joe with minimal tools could implement? If I purchase or buy the spikes, what characteristics should they have? If it works, how significant of a mitigation will it likely produce? Does anyone know a successful example of this solution applied to a bed? 

I don't know what frequencies are making it through to my bed. My understanding is that the speaker-spikes solution only works for low-frequency vibrations? If there is a way to accurately test via iPhone the frequency of the vibration, please post that suggestion. I'll get the necessary app and post the results here.

50,Conversation about what got you attracted to engineering careers/challenges you may have faced going through school,1567217190,"Going to write down some thoughts here since it just seems like I'm in a time where I'm not able to confidently decide on something to focus on career wise. I'd say all my life growing up (21 right now) I never liked math too much and did well in things that involved grammar and reading. I didn't love those classes totally but could do well in it, and I enjoyed explaining my ideas. After I got to college though, I pushed myself to get better at math and started with calculus. Calc 2 was a ride. I started going down the MET route, large in part because a buddy of mine was doing it. I met a couple of good friends too that were in the major so I felt pretty confident about studying it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year spring I took an array of engineering classes; statics, thermo, dif eq were the first real engineering courses I took. I would say thermo instilled a totally new perspective on problem solving and has definitely made math easier and more understandable to me. At the same time, at the end of the semester (and here's where things get off the track for me), I had to split from a girl that I really enjoyed seeing. I went in to some real deep anxiety and depression and it's been a long walk in therapy, doctors, and trying new things to get my mind off my troubles. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest part has been taking a step back from engineering. It's like I no longer had the want to do any of the coursework and even just felt contempt/confusion when I'd do any work. The anxiety I'd get was so great that I wouldn't be able to focus on anything else than just slogging through work and, for me, would make me emotionally distant from pretty much everything, whether I was doing homework or something I'd enjoy. Makes life different. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't say things are perfect now, however they're not bad. I'm just having a difficult time deciding what path to go down because it feels like my emotions have really changed things. I decided to commit myself to getting some work experience in science/engineering and did get to do that this past summer. It's exciting to feel like I'm pushing some boundaries and seeing a bit of the post-graduation world, and that's what I'm clinging on to, but at the same time, I still have anxiety and depressed feelings mixed in with the coursework/topics. I don't know if it's normal or means something. A part of me feels like I'm in deep enough to where I want to keep going, like I've already seen the worst of the coursework so it's not really a mystery to me anymore.

51,How to track the overall equipment effectiveness of plasma CNC tables ?,1567217167,"I'm a production engineer at a shipyard that is constructing a container ship.

We have 6 large CNC tables that we use to cut sub-assembly parts out of large nested steel plates. I want to track the **overall equipment effectiveness** of the table but since the nestings (part sizes being cut and cut time) vary so greatly, I can not pin down the ""ideal cycle time"" portion of the OEE calculation.

Right now we are using ""equivalent hours"" to represent an approximation of the load/setup program/cut/offload durations for plates with relatively similar nestings. Every shift has a goal of x-amount of equivalent hours. Then at the end of the shift the operator will look at the types of nestings that were cut and add up the ""equivalent hours"" that corresponds to each one, then compare it to the goal we set.

Plates with 1-19 parts = 1 equivalent hour

Plates with 20-39 parts = 2 equivalent hours

Plates with 40+ parts = 3 equivalent hours

Mildly engineering-related, but I wasn't given much to do, and there wasn't much I could find to do (My supervisor kinda fucked me here). I'm debating taking this off because there's not much I can talk about in an interview, but my professor suggested against taking off any work experience.

The other two internships were great, and I have plenty to talk about in an interview + list on the resume.

I swam for our school's varsity D1 team. I was a letter holder, I hold a record, and despite not having a great cumulative GPA (\~2.7), made the conference's honor roll last year. I am currently coaching, as our assistant coach just stepped down and I can help out.

I'm currently doing independent research, and am a teaching assistant for a materials lab. I have the research project on my resume (we're building a concrete 3D printer), but not the TA position as we haven't done much yet.

Something's gotta go. There are a lot of other things on there (skills, education, SAE, etc) that I won't get rid of, but I need to make room for this TA position. I want to keep the swim stuff on there (it's only one 'line' in the document), but do employers in engineering really care about this? I'd argue that it shows resilience, work ethic, and soft skills, but I've been told people just don't care. 

Or, do I get rid of the first internship (the lousy one at the makerspace)? Although I was advised against it, the only thing I can really talk about there was teaching stuff to STEM students. I need to make room for the TA position, and this seems to me the least valuable thing on there.

Now, I've never had to do anything like this before so my question is; how ""complete"" does an idea need to be before you would consider taking it to your employer, and in what form would you present it?

For example, would you ever go to them with just an idea itself? Or would you wait until you've been able to cost it all up, scale models, proof of concept, etc? 

In terms of presenting it to them would you want to sit down and discuss it with them? Email what you've put together? Take it to your direct superior and ask them to help you take it up the chain? Or go directly to whoever would have the final say in implementing it first?

I've mentioned an ""outline"" to a few of the guys I work with, and they seem on board with the general principle. My problem is I'm only an apprentice at the moment, so I'm worried about not being taken seriously, so I'd like to make sure I go about this the right way.

91,Mechanical Engineering Graduate In need of career advice,1567145925,"So I graduated from a well known Canadian University in May and have been looking for work for employment since the semester before I graduated. I have had a single interview where I thought I did well, but the company told me that I was lacking in experience. That kind of hurt, because I drove 6 hours there and back to attend the interview.

For my degree, I completed 16 months of work experience. However, 12 of those months were spent as a research assistant for 2 different university labs, and I wanted to work in industry instead. The only industry position I had was in the quality department of a pipe manufacturer, where I worked for 4 months. I thought I did pretty well in the position and my manager contacted me a few months after the work term ended, wanting me to potentially fill a spot that opened up because he got promoted. Unfortunately, I still had a year of schooling left at the time, but I told him I was interested in it. When I did graduate, I contacted him, but it seemed the company already filled the position.

I have probably sent out over 100 applications with only one interview. Most of the applications have been to jobs asking for 3-5 years experience, because I have only seen a handful that looked for new grads. Starting tomorrow I will be starting a part-time job in a tire shop, but I still want to look for a real engineering job.

My alma mater is hosting a career fair in a month. I have been playing with the idea of going to it. However, its 3 hours away because I moved back in with my parents. I am wondering if it will be worth my time to go. Also, if anyone has any tips for how to use career fairs to get interviews/job offers.

Honestly, all of this is getting to me as the interest-free period of my student loans is ending soon.

I feel as if many professional careers have specialized tracks where you can really develop specialized skills and even be compensated significantly more. Example: nurses can become DNP or CRNA which has increased responsibility and ridiculous pay. Accountants can become CPA's or get MBAs and become CFOs etc...

I was thinking about what the analog would be for engineers? Seems like once you're and engineer you just are an engineer. You get yearly COL raises and a bump every few years to some artificial level/title. Or you become a people manager. 

I am trying to scope out a career path and want to do something more challenging than the work I do currently, but there doesn't seem to be an obvious route to more challenging higher value work. I don't think I want to be a design engineer the rest of my life, but I also don't think I am cut out for middle management so where to I go? It's not that I don't like it, it's just that I want to have a goal and do desire something more challenging , meaningful, and wouldn't mind better compensation.

95,Moved from Operator to Engineer by taking pay cut,1567134602,"Hello everyone. Looking for a little advice to move forward in my career. A little bit of a background, I have a BS in Chemical Engineering from May 2017 and passed my FE exam but had some issues finding the right job fit after college. Ultimately decided to take a job at a manufacturing plant as an operator for a fairly large corporation. I figured I would at least use that opportunity to network and learn the process to work my way up. It ended up working out but just not in the way that I was hoping. I had interviewed for several engineering roles after a few months and received positive feedback. Unfortunately, business needs changed before they were able to make the final decision and the company went on a hiring freeze. Fast forward a few weeks, one of the leadership members in my interview created a position for me to be able to work as a process engineer for a major project and a lean engineer to improve utilization and reduce waste from the current process. There was a pretty large catch though. They weren’t able to offer me a salary role because of the freeze so I would still be getting paid to be an operator and have the same title as an operator. I took the job as I didn’t feel like I had anything to lose and was excited to be not working 12 hour swing shifts anymore and to gain some valuable experience that my resume was lacking. It’s been over 4 months now and I’m continuing to work as an engineer for multiple departments but am getting paid less than half of what my peers are and I don’t even have the title. I followed up with my supervisor and he stated that after my projects are over that I am expected to go back to being an operator unless a full time position opens up. The hiring freeze is predicted to continue well into next year so future prospects are looking grim. I understand that business needs are all about costing reduction at this time but I feel like they are taking advantage of me. If the business is in need of another engineer then they should budget for that type of labor. Just looking for advice for how I should move forward from here or how I could sell myself as a business asset to the leadership team.

2,Consequences of leaving a co-op before I complete my last rotation?,1567127111,"Hi all,

I’m a mechanical engineering student at a major US public university, with three semesters left before I graduate. I started a three rotation co-op program with a plastics manufacturer last year (for those unfamiliar with co-op, it’s basically alternating school and work semesters with the same company, so like an extended internship) and have completed two rotations. My last rotation is set to be during summer 2020. After that rotation, I’ll go back to school for a semester and graduate in December.

Here’s the dilemma - while I have been able to do some work related to my major (design involving CAD modeling), I have mostly been doing process/manufacturing engineering. I enjoyed the work, but I am not sure that I want to do it full time after graduation. It is very likely that I will get a full time offer from this company upon completing my third rotation, based on what I’ve heard from people who have also gone through this program.

So here is my question - if I’m interested in doing more mechanical engineering work (more design, controls work, test engineering, working in a different industry even), is it worth it to pursue a different internship next summer and abandon the co-op? This would likely burn bridges with the company, but I’d diversify my work experience, which I feel would make me a more attractive candidate when I look for a full time job. I’m worried that I will pigeonhole myself into a process engineer role, making my work experience not as varied as it could be.

My concern is that this plan was the main premise of me switching my major, and then when I researched jobs for the autonomous technology engineers for Tesla, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz etc. a degree in Computer Science still qualifies one for these jobs. With that said, is there any benefit to taking a harder major (Cyber Physical Systems Engineering), rather than a Computer Science degree which is much easier at my university.

15,Graduating soon. I have experience but not in engineering.,1567098688,"A little background to put things in context: 

I am finishing my Masters of Engineering in Biochemical Engineering this December. I have a Bachelor of Science with a Specialization in Biochemistry. During my Bachelors, I did a 4 month internship working at a company developing assay kits. I worked with mammalian cells and in a Biosafety level 2 environment. 

After my B.Sc. I worked for roughly 2 years at a company although in 2 different positions. This was a pre-clinical CRO doing animal testing for pharmaceuticals. I first worked for about a year as a Formulation technician, preparing dosing formulations using various techniques and instruments but I'll be honest, the job was not very intellectually demanding. I then moved departments to become a Biosample analyst, analyzing various body fluids collected post dosing. I have experience with a number of assays as well as Genetic Toxicology techniques and methods (Biosafety level 2 again). I also was the site's QPIC (qualified person in charge) for a time, being responsible for all scheduled narcotics and precursors that entered, were used in, and left the facility. This was on top of my regular duties, not as a separate position although in some companies I have seen it listed as its own job. This requires a background check and everything before you're authorized by the government. All the work I did at this facility was following Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and was compliant with OECD, FDA, EMA, etc. 

All of this is in Canada by the way. 

My question is this: How do I frame this experience in an interview or on my resume. I clearly have experience and I would argue that a good portion of it is transferable (ex: authoring and amending technical documentation). But it is not **engineering experience**. Also, if I were to include this in my resume, should I go over 1 page? Everyone tells me no more than 1 page. But I do have some experience.

I've been working for a PCB manufacturing company, as a junior Engineer, for about a year now. I graduated from school as an EE, but figured I could gain some more experience before trying to aim for a bigger and better job. So far, I've worked quite a bit with the following topics: PCB testing/troubleshooting, Boundary Scan Programs, soldering reworks, PCB Stencil Layouts, PWA Quoting, SMT thermal profiling, 3D X-ray inspection, ESD procedures/equipment, maintenance/calibration services, and with some PCB design.

23,Is this idea possible? Active tracking + directional speakers,1567092044,"Hi, this is my first post here. In the last months I've had a crazy idea and i want to ask you if it's possible.

If you never heared about directional speakers, i'll put the link here so you can read about it. Basicaly a directional speaker is a speaker that works pretty much like laser beams but instead of light it uses sound waves. If you have one of that speakers in a room and if you're in the right position only you can hear music (or whatever you want). Soundwaves enter your ears without anyone else being able to listen.

My idea is to combine this technology with an active tracking device that would, for example, emit high frequency sounds to the same room and detect the position of your ears. Just like a sonar. With these two technologies, the directional speakers would receive information from the sonar and redirect the sound waves to your hears even if you moved your head. You'd be always listening to something whetever you were in the room and noone else would.

24,Can 3D printed aluminum-filled nylon help me avoid costly aluminum CNC milling?,1567091227,"Hi there! I'm designing a desk that has a mechanism using gear-like pieces. These pieces lock when the teeth are under compression, thus becoming perfectly nested. When a handle is released so is the compression, allowing the gears to move, then lock back into place. Here's an [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/gKrbQxg) post of the part, how it is compressed, and the motion it will be making. The pieces detailed control a drafting table mechanism, so they will be compressed *and* under rotational force.

I do have my bachelor's in mechanical and have several years to go before I get my P.Eng.

This job was posted as a student position, not through any co-op program or anything, asking for at least a 3rd year undergrad student, I applied anyway as technically I am still a student.

Because I knew they were only expecting to hire an undergrad at an undergrad wage, I undersold my salary expectations in the interview (as I didn't want them to discard my application) and I didn't negotiate it when I recieved my offer. The pay is equivalent to starting office position in non-technical fields and at least 25% lower than I would expect judging by my friends' salaries straight out of undergrad.

31,Any Electrical Engineers from power industry who have switched to Sales Engineering?,1567085908,"Hello, All.  

Thank you to anyone who reads and/or replies.  Feel like I'm in a bit of a unique situation and have been unable to find someone who has come from a similar role to me and made this transition.

I am an EE who graduated two years ago.  Have been in power industry since as an electrical design engineer (mainly substation design - physical and P&amp;C). Even before I graduated, I knew I wanted to parlay my degree and technical chops into a business-related role (client-interfacing, contract negotiations, and bringing in revenue for company). I'm not an introvert like many engineers; I have great social skills and sell myself well. To be frank--I want to be as successful and earn as much as possible, and I feel being on that side of the business has a greater chance of achieving that than the technical side. At the same time, I'm not naive.  I know that a lot of hard work and effort will go into achieving that.

I've been very upfront with my company that I don't want to be in design long-term, but I understand that I need to be on the technical side for the time being to build the foundation knowledge that will make me successful.

This week, I was informed that my company has an internal job opening for a Sales Engineer. I'd be removing myself from the engineering department and switching to sales.  They are considering any candidate with two years of experience for this role.  I had thought that I wouldn't be able to look into switching into the business side for another couple years (after earning my PE, which I probably don't even need considering my career goals; just figured it'd make my resume look better), but now this opportunity has piqued my interest.

Are there any EEs in here from the power industry who made a switch like this early in their careers who can lend some insight? I've seen a lot of software guys post about this, but I have seen very little from a professional coming from my realm of power transmission, distribution, and protection.

Would I be removing myself from the technical side too prematurely? I'm competent in my field, but I am by no means an expert.  My concern right now is being in a position in which I'd be interfacing with a client and not being able to answer a technical question they have. Would I still be learning a lot while in this role to overcome this deficit? 

Is the compensation worth it? I'm making just over 6 figures already only two years out (including OT and bonus). I've seen some SEs say they're making $200k-300k, but I feel like that's not normal...or is it?

If I make a move to sales this early and stick with it a few years, would I be locking myself into a sales/business role the rest of my career. Point being, if ten years from now I want a more normal 8-5 M-F desk job to spend more time with family, would I be able to find that?

Anyway, I enjoy the job for the most part. I do work station design, make fixtures for assemblies, write work instructions, etc. on the manufacturing side and on the quality side I'm able to sign off on parts and perform inspections on a portable CMM arm on some of our parts when I'm needed to. 

So, I have an opportunity down the road to get a job with a fortune 500 company in the food industry, most likely as a process engineer. (Opportunity is through a ""not what you know it's who you know"" type situation)

33,Would Cut-And-Cover Tunnel/Viaduct Make Sense For a Freight Rail Bed?,1567082831,"Currently live and work in Atlanta, GA in a complex called Atlantic Station; every day I look northward out my office window at traffic congeal on Interstate 75/85 in both directions and wonder why Atlanta never invested in *commuter* rail. I know the historic reasons why the intraurban transit system, MARTA, failed to penetrate more counties (racism, lack of local government cooperation) but it makes no sense that there are no commuter services into the actual city. Atlanta is a city that was literally founded on being a rail hub and there are still a multitude of active rail lines throughout the city...it is just that those lines are now used for freight. Only one line allows AMTRAK to run through its right-of-way.

So, my question is in regards to what seems like a solution that would allow the freight lines to continue to use their right-of-way unimpeded and also bring passenger commuter rail service into Atlanta: cut-and-cover or prefabricated sections of tunnel for passenger service underneath the current freight bed. Unlike actual boring of tunnel, digging ditches along the freight route could save time and money which is important when considering a project like this. Also, by having a tunnel, the freight companies wouldn't have to worry about a commuter train impeding their service and the commuter rail line would be free to schedule many more runs between terminal points. Also, since Atlanta is a mature city with plenty of development in the metropolitan area, the purchase of additional land for a new railway would be avoided by using this type of method.

The problems I see for this type of method are 1. the weight of a freight train over such a large scale tunnel/viaduct system, 2. the cost of creating such a large scale railway even if it were to only go to periphery cities such as Gainesville or Macon, and 3. the freight rail companies not even wanting to cooperate in such a venture.

I know how to study and apply concepts in class, but as soon as you ask me about a more ""real-life"" engineering problem, I stutter and I feel like I need a lot more time than I should to come to a reasonable solution. This is really apparent to me as I'm on an FSAE team where you can't bs your way through engineering design, or else your part will literally fail. 

For example, this year I have a pretty important task regarding designing  a lot of the team's drivetrain components, and I feel like it's taking me forreeever to make progress. A lot of the concepts and fundamentals of how these kinds of things function come naturally to my peers, while I have to do extensive research in order to be confident in my understanding of a problem/subject. Even then, I have doubts in my self and often make stupid mistakes that I feel like any reasonable engineer shouldn't be making. It also definitely doesn't help that all my peers have  had internships/co-ops at ""big-name"" companies (NASA, Space-X), while I've only had a measly start-up job, making me feel really far behind intellectually. 


Long story short - is there hope for me yet, in the engineering world? Does being a good engineer just require a lot of experience and trial-and-error, or am I honestly just not cut out for it even after four years of study?",AskEngineers,False,brieta7,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cwshaa/how_did_you_come_to_be_a_good_engineer/

I'm seeking any advice or insight you're willing to provide about your work.  What is your day like?  What skill or knowledge has helped you the most?  What qualities do you consider best or worst in a coworker?  Which tools/techniques are essential (like, would be a dealbreaker if someone you interviewed didn't know)?  What do you wish you knew going in?

I'm sure it depends a lot on where you are or what you do, but I'm happy to hear any perspective you have on what cleanroom life is like.  If it helps, the interview is for a multiuser university cleanroom with titles of either nanofabrication engineer or equipment service engineer.

Dorian is currently forecast to hit Cape Canaveral dead center as a category 3 hurricane 5 days from now (I may subscribe to /r/FUCKYOUINPARTICULAR) -- but at least this far out, the track has an uncertainty of some 200 nautical miles, and intensity forecasts have even less skill.

There's a structure (windbreak?  shed?  barn?) that some of us have been looking at for a while.  A picture of the basic structure is [here](https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=47730.msg1978137#msg1978137).  The most recent picture shows it covered with fabric or plastic, and a door opened, as shown [here](https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=48892.msg1984787#msg1984787).  Some of have guessed that it's for future work where being out of the wind could help.

Some people have written that it will be hurricane protection.  I think that's way optimistic, but I'm not any sort of hardware engineer, I'm just going by video of hurricanes.  Personally, I suspect that the best case would be the covering ripping to shreds early, to keep from becoming a sail, and maybe the framework might hold up or maybe not.  Basically, little or no protection.

Does anyone here have experience with structures designed for hurricanes?  I know that it's unlikely that anything can be written based only on some distant aerial photos, with no drawings or sizes of any parts ... but any opinions anyway?

Does anyone know about Florida building codes to know whether they require that such a structure must be hurricane-resistant?  And what level of wind?

90,"Aeronautical Eng grad, advice needed",1566984087,"I apologize in advance for one of those another ""grad with no job"" posting. But I am truly lost at this point and wanted to get some input.   

  

\*\*Background\*\*  

I graduated from B.Eng mechanical engineering in 2016 with 3.4/4.00 cgpa, worked as a research assistant for over two years in aerodynamics and thermodynamics lab. Unfortunately, I was unable to find an internship position, so I basically do not have any work experiences in my field besides my capstone project.  

Before graduating, I got into a master's program (Aeronautical Eng) at a very prestigious university. But due to my financial situation, and others, I had to take a gap year. In 2018 (September), I graduated with a Master of Science with 4.00/4.00 gpa (Distinction).  

  

\*\*Jobs\*\*  

I began applying for jobs even before I started my master's program. Especially because U.K. has this thing called ""graduate scheme"", and the application deadlines are as early as September/October for a lot of companies.  Over the last 11 months, I have applied to over 500 positions. Some of them are quick LinkedIn easy applications, and some of them are two-hour long intensive graduate scheme applications.  

Out of those 500 applications, I interviewed for \~30. Out of those 30, I got to the final stages for 3 of them with no offer.  

  

As a Canadian citizen, I feel liked my options are very limited.  

U.S. has a lot of aerospace jobs, but a lot of them are ITAR restricted (U.S. citizenship required).  Canada has very little job openings in aerospace, I even applied to few software engineering positions (cause I know C/C++ and MATLAB), but I couldn't compete with CS grads with work experiences.  

Generally, I have been applying overseas in Europe. Mainly because there are a lot of openings in Europe for the jobs within my field. But, I do not know if any companies are willing to hire and sponsor an entry level engineer.  

That is also not to say that I have only been exclusively applying to aerospace engineer positions. As I also have a mechanical engineering degree, I have been applying to various jobs in healthcare, forensic, automotive, etc. But, I feel like due to my master's degree, I am seen as ""aerospace-keen applicant that only applied cause he needs a job.""  

  

So, basically, I don't know what else I can do at the moment. I am still applying to at least 3-4 jobs a day.  

My last interview (rejected) was \~ 2 weeks ago, so I am still getting back from companies, which is a bit of relief.  

I have also applied to few companies on behalf of my friends referral. (I haven't heard back yet, it's only been a week or two)  

  

At this point, should I just go back to school and get a PhD? (a lot of positions I seek for, primarily CFD, requires a PhD) Should I go to a coding boot camp and try to get a job as a software engineer? (I am very interested and have experience in data analysis, also applied for these positions as well)

91,How to negotiate base salary for technical sales engineer position?,1566983481,"I am currently a manufacturing engineer making around 71k. I’ve been out of college for 2 years and am looking to make a career change and try out sales engineering. 

I’m in the final rounds of interviews for a technical sale engineer position and I know that the base salary will be lower than what I’m currently making since I will get commission. The area I would be working in though, is a new sales territory so I essentially would be bringing it from the ground up, which tells me I probably won’t get too much commission in the beginning. Additionally, I don’t start receiving commission until 6months after I start. 

I was told by HR that the base salary for new territories are taken into consideration and made higher because of this but I know it’s still not going to be comparable to my current salary. Additionally, this new job would require me to locate to an area with a much higher cost of living. I’d be ok with a higher base salary and no relocation assistance (I’m not sure if they offer that yet). 

Is there any way or any tips I would be able to negotiate the base salary with this? I’m guessing they will offer around 65k (it’s what Glassdoor is showing). In all my other non-sales engineer(no commission) job applications, I was asking for 80-85k but I know that is highly unlikely in a sales engineering position. 

I would be ok with making the same base salary as I am now, given that I wouldn’t be making commission for half a year and after that, I might not get much commission either with the area being a new sales territory.

Am I asking for too much? If not, how do I go about these negotiations when the time comes? I don’t anticipate this happening in my final interview but would like to be prepared if it does.",AskEngineers,False,jki394,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cwi8g6/how_to_negotiate_base_salary_for_technical_sales/

94,Is it a bad idea to dye my hair blue in an engineering office?,1566976145,"Hi r/AskEngineers,

I am considering dyeing my hair blue, but before I do, I would sincerely appreciate advice from the r/AskEngineers community if doing so is a good idea. The color I hope to dye my hair is a deep lapis-looking blue, and the hair itself is a typical, combed, mid-length, I'm-a-guy-and-don't-know-what-to-ask-for-at-the-barber look. For context, I am a naval architect and marine engineer in my mid-20s and I work at a fairly run-of-the-mill naval architecture and marine engineering firm in the DC metro area. I have worked at my company for about 8 months, I hope to stay for several years, and I believe that I am held in decent standing by my supervisors. The company has no official guidance on dress code (other than a single line in the handbook asking employees to dress in business casual, which I follow), but no one else in the office has an unusual hair color. My job has me meet with clients on an infrequent basis; the clients themselves are split 50/50 between commercial companies and DoD clients.

In summary, is dyeing my hair blue a bad idea? My main anxiety is that my supervisors will see me as immature or brash if I walk into the office one day with blue hair. Additionally, in your workplace, would an employee's unusual hair color affect how you assign their responsibilities? Especially in regards to meeting clients and conducting field work?

99,Advice for my loony career change,1566963501,"I'm a 30yo software developer working with an enterprise cloud platform. I earn six figures and my job is okay. However, I dislike the tech industry and I find my career depressingly unfulfilling, never seeing the impact of my work and finding it difficult to describe my job to people. In my free time I've grown obsessed with the tangible, all of my hobbies involve making stuff. I want to change careers to Materials Science and Engineering, something that interests me greatly.

I have two bachelors degrees. The first was in environmental science and I couldnt get work when I graduated. I fell back on my part time work experience in IT support and kept chasing opportunities until I eventually landed a dev position at another university. I used my generous employee discount to obtain my second bachelors part time (software development). 

Right now it feels like I stumbled onto a gravy train and then got locked in with golden handcuffs. It sounds crazy, but I want off the gravy train. 

How should I approach this career change and be successful? In an ideal scenario I'd keep the same job and pursue an online masters program. However, I understand that its rarely this simple in the real world. I'm worried about having a masters with no experience, the potential necessity to pursue internships, and also my age.

12,Need advice on how to deal with my current job when it's not aligned with my long-term interests.,1566943516,"I have been working for the last few months as a project manager on a business-critical project. My background is in chemical engineering and I had no real project management experience before this was dropped into my lap (with no raise). This is a multi-disciplinary project that will cost &gt;$5MM when everything is finished. I don't like what I do, and before I was asked to fill in as a project manager I was developing an exit plan that coincided with my wife finishing grad school in May, 2020, 8 months away. At which point I will try to make a career change, we will likely move from our current town, and I will leave my company, this project, and chemical engineering behind me. 

This past month I started an online Master's program in Computer Science. This has been a pretty long process that started over a year ago. 

If I was single I would have quit a long time ago, and tried to get a job in the software world. This would likely be a paycut as an entry level position, but once I have some experience the upside is greater than if I stayed in the chemical industry. Unfortunately, I am not single, and taking a pay cut would likely mean putting savings (both cash savings as well as retirement) on hold. This is not something I wanted to do just yet, it would be much easier once my wife graduated and was bringing in income which is part of our plan. We have a lot of cash saved, fortunately. Enough to cover almost two year's worth of our expenses with no income. But this was for an eventual down payment on a house, eating into it would not be easy. 

However, each week I feel less and less enthusiastic about my job and the project I'm on. I'm stressed about the budget that my predecessor left me with. I'm stressed that we won't meet the aggressive schedule she committed to and this will have effect on other production units in the business. I am stressed that I am slowly ruining my reputation with my coworkers as a consequence of being unqualified to manage a project of this magnitude in the first place. After a few particularly bad days I have come home and submitted a few applications to some other jobs, less than 10, but I have only gotten a few responses. Nothing promising. 

I guess writing this out is therapy on its own, but I am looking for some advice. Should I stick it out for 8 more months, do what I can to stay sane, and keep saving? Should I more seriously look for entry-level or internship jobs in a different field and eat the pay-cut?

We usually have 3-4 major projects in house at a time with anywhere from 5-20 sub-projects for each project. Each of these projects can be as simple as modifying some existing drawings to as complicated as designing completely from scratch (proof of concept, prototypes, sourcing, production, etc.). Some of these sub-projects may have 100 drawings tied to the design.

What kind of system can I use to track that status of all these sub-projects, who is working on what, what needs to be worked on, things that need to worked on in the future, etc?

For example, someone may add a potential failure mode of ""Insufficient clamp load"" and add ""bolted joint calculation"" to the Prevention Design Controls. Then they will completely forget to do the calculation and the failure will occur.

What I realized a long time ago is that most people won't remember to check these items unless they are asked to go back and enter the results in the DFMEA.

Birds can hear each other, but not see each other.  I thought it would be fun and amusing to construct a periscope where they can see each other and interact.

Practical elements: I would rather not have to make a hole through the two cages.  That would be the simplest solution, S shaped periscope through the middle would work, but destroy the cages and compromise security.  Birds are messy/destructive so ideally whatever I construct would hang on the outside of the cages with mirrors oriented so they can look but not touch.

So I graduated 8 months ago as a BS M.E - Got offered a Tech PM role immediately in the food industry. /1 year. fixed term. Pay is good, colleagues are great, my boss is great and everything is actually good.   
I am 24 years old. It was a dream come true because I wanted to pursue PM/Management roles in my career - but didn't expect to get it from day 1. 

The typical task: Checking mails, meetings, follow up on projects, luckily I do some CAD work sometimes (AutoCAD, Inventor) when it's necessary, project portfolio management, Business cases and writing project applications, following up with the stakeholders etc. ressource management, SAT and FAT tests of new plants and machines etc. 

Now it seems like the company wants to make a permanent contract with me - I'm doing fine and have managed multiple projects so far with good succes. 

But...there's a but. Did I shoot myself in the foot by not working as a design, project engineer with hands on design tasks first? I feel like I am moving away from my core engineering disciplines: Calculations, FEM, Design and Drawings, Mechanical solutions etc.

90,Is A Masters in ECE Worth It For Me? And Career Help,1566780447,"Hey all,

Kinda in a dilemma here.

I'm just about to finish up my Bacherlor's Degree in ECE, but I'm unsure if I should pursue a Master's. I had planned on doing my Master's, but after having been at the University I currently attend, I've lost a lot of faith in it to allow me to follow the career path that I wanted. Before coming here, I always wanted to be doing hands-on soldering and repair (that sorta stuff), but we barely do anything hands-on here. All that we've been taught (which is unfortunately not much- one of the reasons I really loathe this University) has been prepping us to become PCB designers. I understand that knowing how the components work is important and all, but I'd like some practical skills too, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

So based on what I've been shown at the University, I don't think that's the kinda engineer I wanna be. I don't wanna be some big ""sit in his office"" designer or manager or something. I'd rather be getting my hands dirty. Honestly, I'm kinda at the point right now where I'm not even sure if going to this University, or college at all, was worth it. 

Rant aside, right now I have a job in IT at the University that pays a bit under 40k a year, but I'm not so happy at the job. The only reason I took it was because my tuition was paid for by the department, but if I'm not taking my Master's, I'm probably gonna leave. 

So this leaves me in a position of not knowing what path I wanna follow. Do I wanna stay in ECE?  Should I just settle and take an office job? Do I wanna go IT instead?  I have a side job at a VR Arcade in the area, which would pay just a little less than my IT if I worked full-time, which has been offered to me. The problem with this, though, is that it's not really a career, and I'm not sure where that would lead me.

The position is for a structural forensic engineer EIT. I am looking for advice on if this field is worth considering and what I should do moving forward. 


A little background on me and my current position. I am 23 years old. I graduated with a BS in Civil Engineering in May 2018. I have my EIT license and have passed my PE exam. I still need 3 more years experience before obtaining my PE. I am currently a civil engineer for the federal government making 58k with a guaranteed promotion to 64k next July. The benefits are amazing, the work schedule is 40 hours a week, I am on a program that offers ample training opportunities and the ability to transfer between departments at ease, and It is overall a low stress job. I enjoy my co-workers and have a great boss. Sometimes the work can mundane and slow and not fulfilling. This job is in a location less desirable than the other position.


The forensic engineer position would involve visiting damaged structures, residential and commercial. It would require day travel (up to 4 hours) 2-3 days a week and the remaining time would be spent developing reports on what was found during the site investigation. I believe this time could be spent working from a home office after the training period. The recruiter quoted the position is looking to hire for 65-75k with bonus potential based on billable hours. The travel would be with my personal vehicle and reimbursed at the IRS rate of 58 cents a mile. I have a Ford car with 120k miles I would use. The location is more desirable in a slightly lower cost of living area. The benefits seem to be average to above average, obviously a bit worse than the government. It is a salaried position so potential is there to work more than 40 hour weeks depending on workload.


It seems like a good position but It is a field I don’t know a lot about. I have a few questions and would accept any general advice:

1. Is forensic engineering a good field to get into? It seems a bit niche. If I wanted to change fields in the future would this type of experience be relevant?

2. In your opinion, do you think the improved location and increased pay offset the benefits of the government (low hours, retirement, job security)?

3. I have little experience in structures since college, but it’s something I am willing to learn. Do you think this lack of experience should dissuade me?

4. Any general advice, life experiences, or what you would do in my shoes would be appreciated!

Just wondering what good methodologies/techniques/processes that Engineers use for a design project? Theres countless quality processes around like Six Sigma, SPC, Lean etc but there seems to be no real stand out practice when it comes to designing something, particularly in the mechanical design realm.

Im currently designing and building a type of punch press at the moment just for fun and experience while in school and just doing a pretty basic *napkin sketch—&gt;CAD—&gt;build prototype—&gt;iterate design, rinse and repeat* type thing.

21,"How to transition to higher-paying job with some experience in Image Processing, C++, and Deep Learning?",1566701785,"I have an MS and used C++ for my thesis a few years ago. Since then, I worked on Data Science/Machine Learning freelance roles for a few months, and I've been at my current job for nearly 2 years. In this role, I've spent the majority of the time working on image processing, but I also spent a couple months using C++ and about 3-4 months using Python for deep learning for tasks such as image denoising, GANs, and semantic segmentation

I was thinking I should seek new opportunities because even though I get to work remotely, this is a contract role ending in a few months and it may not renew or I may not get converted to full-time. I didn't even get a raise after the first year

I figured I would have the best chances at jobs requiring experience with image processing and deep learning. However, I don't have a PhD or publications, so from what I've gathered, I would have to seek a production-side job, and those require good C++ skills. I've recently been contacted by recruiters for various companies, such as self-driving startups. But I prefer to work at a larger company

The problem is that I don't have much work-related C++ experience so I don't know much about unit testing, version control, C++14/17, etc. I've interviewed for C++ roles before and I recall these were some of the questions that I was asked but didn't do well on

23,How to approach the exit interview for a mediocre internship?,1566700162,"Hi, I’m a mechE Major entering my senior year (I’m taking an extra semester, so probably another internship next summer) and I’m just now in my last week of a summer internship with a multidisciplinary firm. I primarily participated in the group of the company that works extensively in O and G. 

For several reasons, I have lukewarm feelings about my experience. My main disappointments are:

- I felt very underutilized. There were several days that I did absolutely nothing except ask the PE’s for work and try to appear busy. Furthermore only one of the tasks I completed all summer felt technical in some way. Otherwise I was an excel slave or, once, I filled out equipment tags for a site visit.

- There was nigh zero preparation for my arrival. I came in with a mountain of motivation to learn and please my colleagues, but this disappeared rapidly in the very quiet first weeks when the PE’s scrambled to set me up on a project. 

- I went on a single site visit, if you can even call it that. It was to a site I had no hand in at all and it was a 30 minute walk-around. One of the things I made sure to ask in the interview was whether there would be opportunities for site visits. I also asked continuously through the summer o be included in site visits. 

Now I don’t want to give the impression the internship was abysmal, I just railed off my criticisms but there were certainly positive aspects as well like the work environment and everyone being very laid back (almost excessively so). I also appreciated being able to cooperate with other disciplines. I learned a lot of skills in regards to professional collaboration and how to be prepared and contribute as much as possible. 

Soon I’ll have my exit interview and while I want and need the company’s recommendation for future internships/jobs, I feel it would be a disservice to them and future interns to not raise my concerns. Additionally, they have expressed that I did a good job and many of their current employees are past interns so there might be suggestions of a job offer on the table. 

So I’m hoping to get some advice on how I can balance, during the exit interview, good vibes all around while also expressing that there were some shortcomings. Additionally, I want to know whether it’s realistic to “keep the door open,” in terms of a job offer while also not being interested in interning there a second summer.

Maybe I’m out of line complaining at all, if so, let me know. I’ve never had this one internship and only a couple jobs before this so I’m still learning how it all works. Thanks",AskEngineers,False,panda_vigilante,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cv2vt3/how_to_approach_the_exit_interview_for_a_mediocre/

27,Looking for coaching regarding duct fans,1566690294,"I'm installing an earth tube air system as the ventilation for a solar power system involving lead acid charging (makes hydrogen), and I'm hoping it will double as a positive pressure are source system for the house in the winter in MT, reducing below 0 air infiltration around doors and windows, etc.

The air will pass through about 55ft of corruagted, 8"" galvanized culvert buried about 4' deep, with some plastic culvert to make corners.  So, some resistance due to the corrugation, but the duct will be kept at or greater than 8"" diameter duct equivalent.

Here are the questions:  There are various duct fans out there, some pushing kore static pressure (e.g. 350Pa or more), and others with high airflow (e.g. 800CFM or more).  Would you be inclined to bias this fan application more toward static pressure or total airflow?

Then, I understand that using multiple fans in series adds to the static pressure, whereas multiple in parallel adds to airflow (although I assume more airflow wouldn't really make it through the corrugated pipe without more static pressure, anyway).  But, I could also use a larger diameter fan, e.g. 10"" or 12"", which have much higher airflow ratings.  Do you think that when i reduce down to 8"", those higher airflow numbers will be eliminated by the resistance?

Finally, would you say that in assessing different diameters of duct fans, that the wattage will be fairly proportional to the airflow at a specific static pressure?  That might help make the decision regarding the use of a larger fan.

57,Vacuum transport system calculations,1566625171,"Hello,

I am trying to devise a soil transport system which shall take soil from a scooping jaw and displace it elsewhere (further both horizontally and vertically). I would like to do this from scratch (mostly) by:

* Designing and 3D printing: compressor blades for the motor's shaft, soil collection chamber
* Purchasing: a motor of my own (DC Brushless?), a suitable filter mesh to disallow soil from entering the blades and motor assembly, tubing (perhaps 1/4"" ID) for soil travel

The scooping jaw would likely be [two jaws](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ynYDbbZML._SS500_.jpg) which close onto each other to form seal (with perhaps rubber lips). An orifice which interfaces the jaw and tubing would be on the lower jaw, so that soil would fall via gravitational acceleration to the bottom loop of tubing and hopefully further increasing the likelihood of a good seal. The jaws themselves may be machined or purchased, but the real purpose of this thread is to ask about how I can even start any of this.

* How do I know what motor to get? (what RPM I require?) (size/weight is a serious concern and I do not need to transfer a lot of soil per use - maybe a tablespoon's worth of soil per applied suction)
* How might I mathematically solve for the variables that I need to know to design for this?

58,"Wish to create a machine to expand aluminium honeycomb block, need advice",1566624283,"I'm helping out on a project that involves the expansion of Corex 5052 aluminium alloy honeycomb blocks, as pictured:

https://www.imgur.com/a/iaBGSm9

Our current method involves threading zip ties into the third or fourth layer, tying them to metal rods on each side, and then having four people hold one of the rods while four people pull on the other rod to expand it. While we don't mind the manual labour, we are on a time crunch and have an immense number of blocks needed to be expanded. As such, we want to create a simple mechanical machine to expand it.

The biggest downside of our current method (aside from the eight people needed) is the time taken. Most of the time is taken up by trying to insert the zip ties in because the material is packed so incredibly densely, and took us nearly an hour to insert the zip ties into. We saw videos online of the industrial machines used to expand it, and in their cases the blocks aren't anywhere as dense and the layers are easily separated to insert the puller pins into, after which the machine does the rest.

Example video: https://youtu.be/GD5ltW_rTm8

For us, even if we straight up bought this machine, time would not be saved as we'd still have to work extremely hard to insert the pins as the layers are very reluctant to separate. How should we go about approaching this issue?

I keep straying towards some sort of a suction cup system to simply bypass the need to insert pins, but I'm not sure if it's going to be effective or even do the job right.",AskEngineers,False,MyWholeTeamsDead,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cupg1c/wish_to_create_a_machine_to_expand_aluminium/

63,Finding environmental engineering jobs as a biological engineer in advance,1566613868,"Hello everyone! I'm a recent graduate from an ABET university who majored in Biological Engineering with a concentration in Natural Resources. My university, unfortunately, did not have an environmental program, however, I've noticed that all the courses I've taken are the same as most environmental majors (dynamics, water resources, hydrology, statics, mechanics, environmental eng, waste management, fluid mechanics, hydraulics, etc).

I've had problems in the past getting environmental engineering internships, and only had 1 job offer in my field beside my fellowship (which I took as it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and a very prestigious program). However, I'm a bit worried about getting a job once I return from my fellowship (I'll be abroad doing air quality testing and research for a year.) I have a 3.3 GPA, three internships (one government/field-based, two research) and several projects on my resume (I had my own independent engineering research project and a senior design project). I'm a US citizen, and have had leadership roles. I'm also currently studying for the environmental FE exam. I have basic to medium knowledge of ArcGIS, AutoCAD, Matlab and Microsoft office (excel, project, word). 

I was hoping maybe some of you could answer some of my questions, as I don't have mentors within the environmental engineering field who aren't professors. 

1) I notice at career fairs a lot of employers think I'm biomedical engineering, and try to write me off before I can explain myself and my passion for what they do. How can I avoid this from happening when applying to jobs online (I worry the automatic job filters will reject my application).

2) Air quality is my lowest skillset, so I want to learn as much as possible from my fellowship (I'll be analyzing emissions from manufacturing plants). Is there anything else employers like to see in this area?

3) While I am open to manufacturing/research environments, I really want to work for an environmental engineering firm. However, I don't have any internship experience in this industry and I don't have any drafting experience. Is there anything you suggest I could do/learn to make up for that?

4) How early should I start applying for jobs? 1-2 months ahead? Also, is it rude to contact employees/recruiters of places I want to work via Linkedin to ask to shadow or speak to them? 

5) Lastly, due to family reasons, most of the areas I am looking at are places such as NYC, Atlanta, Chicago, central NC, southern California, Boston, and Central Ohio.

69,Drilling Dead Center Holes into Tricky Plastic Parts,1566603456,"Hi everyone, 

TO START WITH: I’m really desperate for help, so if you’re knowledgeable about precise small hole (~1-2cm) drilling for oddly shaped plastic parts, please consider offering your expertise (will tip if your solution works!). 

Problem: 
I need holes drilled dead centre into small (2x2x2cm approx.) white Delrin parts with a high level of accuracy and precision. However, my Drill Press and Vice is giving me too much variation and is almost always off center. 

The reason this occurs is the plastic part is awkwardly shaped, so it cannot really be secured tightly enough in the vice (it moves around slightly during drilling process). 

If I vice the part too hard, the piece breaks since it’s plastic and some of the walls are thin. See pics (https://imgur.com/gallery/i54O3Ew) for what the part looks like before and after hole drilling; note that the larger circle hole only goes partially through the object, not all the way. 

I’ve tried using a reference hole which is also dead center but this still doesn’t get the job done because the part still moves around during drilling, as it cannot be secured properly due to its material and shape.

Before anyone asks, I cannot just injection mold the part (too expensive + is often too inaccurate for my tolerance needs) or 3D print it with the hole already done (I need a very low friction and strong material like Delrin, and so far I haven’t seen any suppliers who supply an equivalently low friction material via 3D printing). 

So far I’ve gotten by via drilling a hole slightly too small then sanding it to the required size with a dremel so that adjustments can be made when this initial hole inevitably ends up off centre. However, this requires too much focus, is prone to error, and cannot really be done if I need to do this for &gt;1000 parts one day. 

I tried uploading ads and searching for companies who can do this for me many times. Yet I really can’t find any company that specializes in something like drilling dead centre precise holes of 2cm or so in size. 

Questions: 
1. Does anyone know of a way I can do this myself perfectly without breaking the bank?
2. Does anyone know of a company that can do this for me for cheap ($1-2 per part for 100 parts or so)?
3. Alternatively, if anyone here can actually offer this service to me, I can directly compensate you instead.

My main issue is that I have no idea how skookum I need to make the wheel bearings and spindles and the walking beam pivots. Since I'm using big road wheels the biggest stress on wheel bearings is applied when turning and the bottom edge of the wheel wants to bend in or out.

Another thing is the front tensioner wheels. The mechanism needs to stretch the whole track at least 18cm since the track link pair is that long. Probably should be some sort of cam system. The track links are in pairs because I got the track style inspiration from the russian T-34 tank which uses the guides on every other track link to grab the track, also drew some inspiration from logging tractor called [DT-55.](https://imgur.com/a/MCHDcZJ).

I plan on putting a UAZ 452 body on the frame later. I expect the whole weight to be 2-3 tons but I'm really not sure. All the component sizes are approximations just to visualise it. It's getting long and I'm sure I've forgotten something. So I'm going to stop writing now.",AskEngineers,False,MrPumpkinKiller,/r/AskEngineers/comments/cueny3/help_with_tank_build/

Hello everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just graduated with a bachelors in mechanical engineering (7.96/10 GPA). I took up this course out of sheer passion. I studied at a private institute under the govt university. I had a good 4 years of college where I have actively participated in almost all the activities. I founded the first SAE Baja team from my college and was the captain. All the job offers I got so far are IT service companies. I haven't looked for jobs outside the state as I'm confused about working or pursuing masters. I always dreamed of studying abroad as exposure is unparalleled. should I start working or should I pursue a masters degree? Mechanical related companies are hard to find in my state. I know that I might sound a bit awkward but ""**what is the career path a mechanical engineer must take?**"" I believe that experience is mandatory. Should I go straight for masters and then work or is my bachelor's degree enough? I'm from India btw. What are the chances of me being able to find a job abroad in Australia, Canada or Europe?

25,What is the best workaround for your university not offering the specific degree path that will get you the job you want?,1566512745,"Hello Engineers!

&amp;#x200B;

The title question is a bit vague so I'll go a little more in depth here. Currently I am working on finishing up my associates with the intent on transferring to a full fledged Uni so I can get a bachelor's in an engineering field. I specifically want to go for ocean engineering as my end goal is to be working as a coastal or offshore engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to the current dilemma. University of Texas just announced free tuition for students that fall under a certain income amount and I qualify for that. In other words, the goal as it stands is to transfer to UT in order to finish my degree while drastically cutting down on the amount of loans I would have needed to take. The problem is that they don't offer ocean engineering as a degree nor do they offer oceanography as a degree for undergrads (that was my follow up in case they had that but not the engineering degree I am after). I am trying to go straight to work with a bachelor's for context as I already have way more loan money owed than I would like.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to the main question. Would a degree in some subfield of ocean engineering, take civil or mechanical as an example, get me to where I want to go or am I just better cutting my losses and transferring to a school that has my specific degree plan (such as Florida Atlantic University or Texas A&amp;M) even at the cost of the extra tuition?

&amp;#x200B;

Ocean Engineering combines multiple engineering fields so if I can still break into that scene while avoiding tuition costs that would be ideal. That being said if this will do nothing to get me to where I want to go (or if it prevents certain opportunities strictly due to job title) then free tuition or not, it doesn't make sense to go to that school.

29,Looking for some career advice,1566505935,"Hey all, I'm at a bit of a crossroads and am looking for some career advice. I graduated three years back having skipped on co-ops during university and worked for the family trucking business. Upon graduating it was difficult to find work and was eventually hired by a small family engineering company. The president/owner is an engineer but does not mentor in any way, shape, or form (rather the opposite), and there are only a couple other mechanical designers who are apathetic. Their engineering standards are pretty low, but I've excelled at the work I've been given, try and institute change where I can, and manage half of their projects now.

I've been busy with stuff outside of work, getting married, paying off student loans, etc., and have just coasted and remained here for nearly three years. Now I find myself in an odd spot in the job market. I have more than the co-op/intern work experience, but I'm not a professional engineer yet. I have industry exposure but feel as though I'm a little behind in professional development.

45,Professional Advice (Masters program or Switching jobs),1566476253,"I've gotten two different pieces of advice, since I've started working. 

1. Get your Master's early while you're young and it's easier.
2. Switch jobs every 2 years or so to move up the pay scale and ladder quickly.

My question is which one would be better in the short run and the long run. Two different questions.

My point of view on this is if I were to get my Master's degree, then I lock myself into a job for approximately 5 years. That's fine if I like that job, but I'm deciding whether that'd be in my best interest either way. I'm not too big of a fan of my current job, but it's been getting better. They have EdAssist here, however, if I use it and leave within two years of receiving my degree, then I have to pay back any payments that were made in the last two years. For example, I'd be home free for payments made in the first 6 months, if I left 2.5 years after starting my Master's program. 

On the other hand, I've been job hunting. It started as very casual job hunting, then it became very desperate job hunting and now I'm job hunting more casually again. I may be able to get better pay and/or benefits if I switch jobs, but it entirely depends on the job I find. My current job isn't good for professional development, when it comes to viability on any new job because of using very old coding languages and libraries, as well as proprietary software that can't be used anywhere else and the only commercial software we do use has an extremely narrow scope on it's functionality.

While the master's degree would provide me with more job credentials, I don't know whether it'll be worth it in the long run to do, due to the extra work and potentially locking myself into my current job for 5 years or paying back a healthy portion of the degree. I'm also questioning just getting my degree on my own and not allowing my company to pay for it, so that if I want to put one foot out the door there is nothing stopping me.",AskEngineers,False,shadowlief,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ctwm3j/professional_advice_masters_program_or_switching/

I'm a current medical student, 1 1/4 years from graduating.

I fell into medical school from being a top student in high school and parental pressure. But through med school I've felt like my true nature doesn't fit medicine at all.

I hate memorization. I am not someone who can interact well with people, it's very forced. I'm able to overcome these things through effort but it's not enjoyable. Other people do this so naturally and I can see them being great doctors. I know I can be a decent doctor, but I just don't know if that would make me happy. For the rest of my life?

I realized after helping my sister with maths just how much that difference was in enjoyment...how I loved to solve calculus, physics, chemistry problems. How I actually enjoyed studying once upon a time. I can't think of any studying in med that I've really enjoyed. It's alright, it's always just ""okay"".

I can get moments of satisfaction from helping people but I tire of it so easily since I'm a strong introvert (another reason why I feel like a career talking to people all day is dodgy...But I just continue on since I've invested so much in it).

I love logic and hate it how in medicine the answer is often just ""oh they have this rare disease which explains the symptoms"" and it's just that the disease has this triad of symptoms...not that there was a clear logic of this caused this etc. It just frustrated my mind.

The thing is, I wouldn't want to do engineering and find that when I graduate the work is just as boring as what I dislike now anyway. As in, you wouldn't be learning new concepts and solving equations yourself in your work.

I’m looking to model the pressure loss due to wind through a line of circular tubes (cylinders) lined up parallel to each other, orientated vertically hanging from a straight steel beam. This will be acting as a wind barrier to bring wind speeds to acceptable levels for pedestrian safety. 

I have a copy of “Handbook of Hydraulic Resistance” but the entry that very closely applies to this situation has a typo and I can’t trust it now!

Please see error here (blue is the relevant equations etc, red is the error):

I’m fairly confident they mean beta2 in the equation but given the uncertainty I need to get another source to corroborate so I’m confident I won’t specify the wrong thing.

I’ve tried looking for papers on tube banks for heat exchangers (can’t find a single row of tubes), gratings (can’t find circular cross sections), storm water trash gratings (but can’t get the Reynolds relationship).

&amp;#x200B;

I am a recent engineering grad who accepted his first job, just wanted to throw out some offers I got so you can all see how it pays and if you are getting a good first offer. I have a solid GPA from an R1 University

&amp;#x200B;

Offer 1 : Philadelphia PA, MEP Engineering Firm focused on commissioning, 62k, 1% 401k match, 2 weeks vacation did not like how the interview felt, didn't take it.

Offer 2: Lockheed Martin in rural location, 53k, seems low however due to Lockheed's benefits being so good (10% 401k match! 4 weeks vacation, can buy another or sell one) it was actually a better offer than the 62k. Did not take it because after the interview I realized I misunderstood the role. However, Lockheed really had their shit together with the interview, overall out of every job interview I've ever done, Lockheed's felt the best.

Offer 3: MEP Firm, rural location, 61k, 3 weeks vacation, 2% 401k match. This place was an open office, I refused to deal with that bullshit.

Offer 4: Major Defence contractor in rural location (not Lockheed), originally asked for 60k after remembering Lockheed's offer, and they countered my 60k and offered 68k instead after I asked for 60k. Overall I enjoyed the role and felt I understood it well and after they offered me more money than I asked for I felt like that showed something about the company. 6% 401k match, 3 weeks vacation can buy a 4th if you want. Healthcare, dental etc plus a legal plan, discounts on electronics and other oddities

I used the government's locality adjustor for pay scales to kind of estimate the salary difference between the city and a rural location.

Oddly enough, although I hate desk jobs, I have done well at school (I will graduate with around a 3.90/4.00 GPA). This is primarily due to the fact that I can take as many breaks as I want from studying and go do something active, which helps me to stay mentally alert.

I don't see this company succeeding in generating a profit for at least another two years and by then I'm rather certain someone will get hurt or worse. As much as it pains me, I have begun looking for a way out of the company, even if it means taking a job with a less prominent role.

86,Pumping water up from depth - practical concerns/thoughts?,1566406001," 

Hello experts. I'm an EE, so excuse my naivety in my question. My last fluid mechanics class was in undergrad many years ago.

I have a real world problem to tackle - I need to pump water from the bottom of a 300ft deep quarry. I need to pull water up from the bottom to a boat or structure which floats about 10 feet above the waterline. I also need to try to keep the flow as laminar as possible until it reaches the hose-end.

I'm trying to spec a pump and hose to enable this transfer. I'll need this to run continuously for a half a day or so.

I called some pump experts and so far it's been a split between them on determining pump head. Half of them say the head needs to be a bit over 310ft, the other half says it needs to be a bit over 10ft.

Obviously there is a big discrepancy there. My practical side tends to believe the 10ft number, as long as I'm running the system as I sink it into the water (e.g. I don't have an evacuated hose all the way to the surface when I try to start the pump).

I then need to determine what flow rate I can expect at the exit of the hose. I'm looking for something rather slow - on the order of 2-6 gpm at a moderate pressure (10-20psi).

I've been looking at some Red Lion pumps (for example this line:[https://www.waterpumpsdirect.com/manuals/RL\_DeepWellSub\_Spec.pdf](https://www.waterpumpsdirect.com/manuals/RL_DeepWellSub_Spec.pdf) ) but I don't need 80psi coming out the end(!). I suppose I could regulate that somehow.

Finally, assuming I find a suitable pump - what considerations do I need to...consider...regarding the hose connected to it? My initial thought was a simple rubber garden hose.

But I also wanted to have some adventure in my life, before I settled down in a 9-5 office job, so I did Air Force ROTC in college as well. I got a pilot slot and loved every minute of the next 2 years of training to be an AF pilot. The people, the excitement, the travel opportunities, and the risk all really satisfied those adventurous desires that a young guy (mid 20's) typically has, and I was really excelling in the program.
