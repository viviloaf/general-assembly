The problem is that I'm not really interested in any of them and I'm afraid it could really hurt my career in the long run because seeing how I study now, I won't try my hardest at work either. I really hate studying and at this point I do it just enough to pass the exams.

What I'm trying to get at is that my friends and other students all seem really into it, some of them are buying 3D printers and stuff, others are making connections with companies and so on. Before corona I had a design job in a fairly big sized company for my country and I absolutely hated it. The work I was doing wasn't that bad but being in the office all day was really exhausting. Within a week I was getting really demotivated to even continue my studies. Now I'm trying to decide what to do next and it's really hard because there are non engineering jobs (especially firefighting) I'd like to do but they pay less and you are considered less successful as they don't require you to go to college. I think I'd be way happier as a firefighter but it kinda closes a lot of doors if I choose that. Could I get back in engineering if I finish the 2 years, try being a firefighter and then maybe after 5-10 years get back in engineering if I saw that I really need better pay? Thing is, being in a smaller country, the difference in salaries isn't that huge (14k as a fireman and maybe 20-25k in engineering but only after 15 years if you're good I'd say, at the start they'd probably be the same).

19,"Get temperature and humidity readings, which will be used in an automated stand",1591090265," Hi! In this community, it seems, you can share your projects? So here is-himself made, himself and boasted. How to create an automated stand for measuring temperature and humidity.

**1. Structure. Connection diagram. Connection to the PC**

For our future stand we don't need to have laboratory accuracy readings. A sensor with a I2C HTU21D interface can be used to monitor temperature and humidity. It shows humidity with an accuracy of about 2% and temperature with an accuracy of about 0.3%. HTU21D is a good and cheap sensor.

Next step: we take the fork and connect PC/ plug in via Ethernet or WiFi.  
Connect the sensor as shown in the Figure.

 To read the data, we need to know the address and the I2C read commands.

• Address I2C 0x40  
• Temperature read command 0xE3  
• Moisture read command 0xE5

**2. Browser Search Bar Control**We need to set a GET HTTP request sequence to Fork with a specific query string. The commands in Fork are based on the principle «key = value» or just «key». Each query in the browser will receive a response from Fork. You can also combine queries using the &amp; symbol.

1. Start with I2C  
Provide the I\_MODE command value I2C  
[http://192.168.0.205/control?I\_MODE=I2C](http://192.168.0.205/control?I_MODE=I2C)

In the end we'll get I2C

2. Read the temperature in ASCII\_HEX format. For this purpose we will use two commands.  
*The first* G\_REQ\_RES\_FORM is to specify the format of the query and the response in value ascii\_hex.  
*The second* I\_I2C\_WRITE\_READ command is to generate a sequence I2C to the restart.  
Value - consists of a few bytes.

The result will be presented in the form of a sequence of bytes that the sensor has responded to.

&amp;#x200B;

|1 byte|1 byte|2byte|n byte|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Address byte|Number of bytes per record|Number of bytes to read|Data bytes to record/write |

 Here 's the request we got

    http://192.168.0.205/control?g_req_res_form=ascii_hex&amp;i_i2c_write_read=40010003E3  

In response to this request, we received ASCII\_HEX,69FC69

3. Let's read humidity data. Specified the format of the data and created a sequence for using the I2C. As with temperature data, but only the command for the sensor has changed.

    http://192.168.0.205/control?g_req_res_form=ascii_hex&amp;i_i2c_write_read=40010003E5  

Example of the answer of ASCII\_HEX, 2ADE29We got respond from the sensor.

Now we need to single out the temperature and humidity data we need. For temperature and humidity, the package is arranged in the same way and does not depend on the data bytes.

We will also need formulas to translate data. Unfortunately, in datasheet in formulas there is an error with the power of two, so I will write here corrected formulas.  
For temperature  
***Stemp*** \- sensor data, ***n*** \- number of bits of readings  
For humidity  
Overall as a result we received the following sensor readings

&amp;#x200B;

| 1 byte|\[7:2\] byte|\[1:0\] byte|1 byte |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| MSB|LSB|Status |CRC|

 Temperature: 25.89 ℃  
Relative humidity: 78%

**3. HTML Javascript page Control**

The actions in the previous paragraph are quite tiresome, and we don't have all day. Besides, I would like to have some interface in this case. Therefore we will make html page and automatic parsing on javascript. Here's what we've got.  
We turn on the I2C on the interface output by hitting ""init I2C"" button. And we use ""read temperature and RH"" button to send a command so we can immediately get temperature and humidity readings.  
We can also upload a page to Fork and ask directly from there. To do this, you will need to change one line in the code.

    var url_path 'http://192.168.0.205/ to      var url_path '/';      

And download the file using the file manager.

    http://192.168.0.205/file_manager  

Now to launch our interface we need go to

    http://192.168.0.205/user_example_i2c.html  

**4. Control via Python script**

Let's do the same now, but by using Python.  
First, we connect/plug in the fork module and create the target's device

    from forkapi.fork import Fork      dev1 = Fork('192.168.0.205')      

Then we also need to initialize the I2C on the interface input

    dev1.I2CEnable()      

Then give the command to our sensor and get the respond

    addr = 0x4      data = b'\xE3      res = dev1.I2CWriteRead(addr,3,data)      

As before, having carried out a number of transformations we get temperature and humidity readings. The result is displayed on the console.

**5.** **References to the code examples**

23,Electronic: making a eDP Tcon board to replace a LVDS Tcon board from old panel.,1591085413,"I'd like to use a 4:3 laptop display on a newer motherboard. (A project of building a 4:3 laptop based on new hardware)

As 4:3 screens are not manufactured since something like 2008. So there are no 4:3 display with ePD Tcon, only LVDS.

And since the current laptop do not use LVDS anymore but only ePD it seems difficult to connect a 4:3 display. One way would be to use some kind of ePD-LVDS adapter board, though I couldn't find any. So it would need to use a ePD-HDMI then HDMI-LVDS board, which would be far from ideal.

Then  I thought maybe it would be possible to disassemble the 4:3 panel to get the LCD glass, unsolder the LVDS Tcon board and replace with a ePD Tcon board.

Now this raise several questions : 

\- How the glass is actually connected to the Tcon board? As there are thousands of lines this is probably not just regular solder.

\- Can ePD controller used on older glasses or the glasses needs to have some hareware specificity to be used with a ePD controller?

\- Is there some open source ePD Tcon design somewhere?

\- ePD protocol implementation can apparantly differ depending on implementor I read on ePD presentation. Which could make things more complicated. Though I'm not sure who is refered as implementor. Is it the GPU manufacturer (Nvidia...) or the laptop assembler (Asus...) ? In the case of GPU manufacturer then the ePD protocol implementation is likely to be the same between various laptops motherboard.

Recently, my advisor had offered to bring me on as a funded Master's student, but in the Mechanical Engineering Department. With my being a CS, I was hoping to gain some insight as to what I can expect in an MSME program, how feasible is an MSME for non-engineers, and what are some benefits of obtaining and MSME (in addition to a CS undergrad)?

Recommendations and advice on how to prepare/approach this sort of program would also be greatly appreciated.

This motor is a HONDA GX200 clone and since GX200 has a charging system, you can literally just bolt it on the predator 212 as shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GGtZxy4o7U&amp;t=218s

Progress: https://i.imgur.com/6S2luut.jpg

After installation: [the setup achieves ~18VAC] (https://i.imgur.com/pHak1RE.jpg) and about .9AMPS (900mA) per coil @1700RPM idle. @4000RPM it achieves 36-40VAC (Measured with mutimeter, no battery, no load)




Today I installed this [rectifier regulator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L74Q56R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

yellow/pink wires go to each single wire coming out of each stator (stators grounded to the motor internally)

Red goes to battery + and green goes to battery -



The result at the red wire of the regulator was 9V @2100RPM and 11.9V at full throttle (I had to ground the housing of the regulator, before that it was only giving out 5VDC. Also it was 2VDC lower without floating the ground wire to the battery ground)

----
**This system is unable to charge the battery since it cannot achieve above 12.9VDC at the output**

What is the problem? Is it a bad rectifier regulator? do the coils not have enough windings or do I need stronger magnets for the flywheel? 

**Do I have to float the ground from the stators away from the motor ground?**

it seems the yield stress is about 3400 psi when loading is parallel to the wood grain

the load is transmitted by 1-1/8 “ diam holes in the wood, area transmitting the load i calculated by pi/2 *D*L where L = 4 “ (surface area of a semi-circle assuming a close fit)

Loading stress on the individual beams is calculated as sigma = F/A where F = 350 lbs and A being the area calculated above 

sigma is therefore about 50 psi 

factor of safety is therefore FS = 3400/50 = 68

81,"Could a turbine engine run ""efficiently"" on liquid nitrogen?",1590986846,"I put it in quotes because ""efficiently"" is subjective, but I mean on comparable efficiency to the thermal energy delivered by steam, just in reverse: liquid_N2 +Δt -&gt; gaseous_N2

I was thinking about methods of carbon sequestration and what would happen if you just liquefied air, separate the O2, N2, and the 0.04% of CO2, and sequester the latter. But you'd be left with liquid O2 and N2. The O2 is a thorny issue because I know LOX is an extremely dangerous substance. But what if you (somehow) safely burned it to heat the liquid N2, ran a turbine, which sucked in massive volumes of air over cold collectors (CO2 liquifies first at -78C, O2 and CO2 liquefy at almost 3x as much, which I recognize).

I don't doubt that this would take an enormous amount of energy to pump the heat out and create ~-200C temperatures. I'm just wondering how much of that could be recovered if you routed that excess liquid N2,  heated it,  and ran it through a steam turbine to make it more efficient and by using it as a ""spring"" to bounce some of that energy back into the system to improve ""moles/kw"".

85,Would you rather pick a stable but boring field or a interesting but less stable field as a fresh graduate?,1590978767,"I’m an EE with a few career options atm.

Option 1 - work in the field of Power engineering (utilities, consultancy firms doing subcontracting for utilities, power generation, and grid operators such as ERCOT). Pros: 

* one of the most stable engineering fields (Utilities have virtually done no layoffs bc people still need power during corona virus epidemic)


* excellent upward mobility due to retiring workforce


* many many job opportunities at the moment 


* very little “ageism” because the field is more 
dominated by regulations (PE License) and knowledge doesn’t require as constant upkeep as other fields


* decent salaries to be had 

* impossible to outsource due to PE Requirement, although I see many in the field from
India on work visas 

*potential innovation with solar power growing 


* have multiple internships in the field 

Cons: 


* As a 22 year old, the field is honestly very boring. Most designs are reused as there is ZERO room for making a change that could kill people (power line protection for example). Any design needs to be reviewed throughly as it could harm people or businesses. A lot of pressure (especially in consultancies) to not fuck up and shut off power by accident 


* almost zero business opportunities. No way to start your own utility. A basic utility would cost at least $10 million as well as massive network to build. A consultancy would be really expensive, as single copies of basic software cost thousands as well as hiring PEs to get a consultancy going. I’ve calculated it, to get a small consultancy going you’d need at least $500k-1m to compete in any business sense. You’d also be competing with other consultancies such as GE, SEL, and hundreds that are well established with track records. And because your design could kill people, very hard to get something started and sell a utility to use your service over a proven consultant. 


* Work culture not exactly filled with ambitious people 


* Field tends to attract stable types. As someone who doesn’t want to be an engineer at 65, not sure I wanna end up like this. Many, many engineers have been in the field and same exact company for 15 years+ (stability, retirement pensions, benefits) 


* not as high of a salary cap as other fields (tech for example) 


* not much innovation (very slow field due to regulations)


* knowledge not easily transferable outside of power


* can’t move up without PE License  


Option 2 - seek work as a software engineer towards mobile app dev, web dev, or some sort of front/backend software. If I go this route I’d probably get a masters.


Pros:


* young work culture


* potential high salary if accepted into a FAANG

* business opportunities are endless due to ease of software relative to building huge, expensive power facilities or equipments 


* huge demand at the moment 


* fast paced workplace (this can be a con too)


* innovation in software moves at the speed of light


* definitely more interesting work to be had


Cons:

* ageism if choose to continue being an engineer rather than a manager

* very very fast moving technology

* no regulation of the field invites fear of outsourcing 

* constant requirement to learn frameworks, I imagine this isn’t as fun when you’re 52 and have 3 kids

* not a very stable field (see layoffs amidst recent corona virus)

* no internships or work experience in software 


I have no idea which to choose. I’m definitely more interested in software because I see what people at google or Facebook do. Power is definitely more about seniority and licensure rather than software where 21 year olds can create Facebook. But I’m held back by the massive perks of power.

1. Being relaist dreaming of either high positions, or entrepreneurship in the very long run: Mixing technical knowledge, social skills and accountant knowledge
2. Team work with open minded people who I can learn from. And people who love what they do, have a say and a personality, besides work- NOT JUST engineering. 
People who enjoy working alone and in a crew almost the same. 
3. Working in a place where inspiration is encouraged. Not being shut down by reluctant managers or few job opportunities to pick from. I am writing this saying I love being involved and asking either dumb and smart questions to understand better. (I can invest 2hr drive or possible relocating for this).
4. Space to practice hand work, working on a product, visioning it, speculating its performence.
5. Enjoying the road and implications of basic first and second year courses to internship/first projects and so on.

More background about me and my focuses, if it may be handy:
I am 22 year old. Have learnt in highschool in a science program, where I have expanded over physics, biology and chemistry classes.
I had a strong focus on sports, gaming and socializing overall. 
I was in the navy (military is a must here) serving in a battleship, honing my skills on a daily, being good on my program, being a main firefighter and somewhat cook.
I was promoted to coaching and evaluating the training in my role in the navy, and being a oporation scenarios crew tester, besides casual sails.  
Got released early, due to knee ligament surgery (I got in a soccer game). 
Was reading few novels in my rehab, considering psychology or philosophy majors at some point lol.
Got into appliance sales role, no previous marketing was demanded. Got pretty well there, but felt I abandoned profound knowledge of how things work. 
Now I am unemployed, looking forward getting deep into  learning, and make living by teaching the things I learn, from soccer skills, dancing or high school education I recently recapped.

In it, they used a relay for a 5V water pump. The thing is; Raspberry Pis have a 5V output available on their GPIO.

(For VR locomotion principle),1590930072,"With all the lockdown stuff going on I've been tinkering with a few ideas I've been wanting to visualise, and most recently I've been working on a VR locomotion concept. I cranked out a sorta 'artists interpretation' of the idea, and I like the general premise, but I've some mechanical worries I'm looking to quell..

Disclaimer, I say all this as a reprobate *product designer* and not an *engineer* (but don't worry, I'm sure that'll become apparent *very* soon.)

[https://www.behance.net/gallery/97883283/TrackpadVR-Omnidirectional-Locomotion-Concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/97883283/TrackpadVR-Omnidirectional-Locomotion-Concept)

&amp;#x200B;

It's kinda unintuitive to explain but I tried my best.., the concept hinges around an offset foot-placement with a 'centre-foot' that is 'locked' on the horizontal axes, but can rotate and travel vertically (0.4m max height\~, 3 stage, max 50-60% travel on each, though those figures can be changed a bit). 

My issue is that the vertical movement occurs as the user lifts that foot to step forward (thereby pulling the other, 'unlocked' foot back (helped by the incline at the edges of the base), giving the *illusion* of movement; ***my fear is that this horizontal load will induce too much noticable friction into the vertical travel of this centre-rod.***

***Is there a precedent for telescopic movement under normal stress? Maybe incorperating some form of linear bearing?*** Maybe it's impossible, or maybe the issue isn't even enough to warrant that level of cost. I've absolutely no idea.

Frankly it doesn't even need to be a rod like that, it just seemed the simplest solution from my angle, maybe there's a better way to lock the foot in place.

I dunno, I think the idea has major flaws, but maybe the general spirit of the idea has enough merit to continue messing around for a bit longer with... so I've been coming back to it looking to solve solve/rethink a few of my worries with it...

I will start my FIRST (summer) internship in 2 weeks, where I will be interning with a leading international company that specializes in construction engineering management.

I was interested in going into construction engineering, but now I feel iffy about going into this route. I know someone who works for Kiewit (a Fortune 500 company that specializes in construction), and she has to wake up every morning at 3 AM, goes to work at 5 AM, then gets off work at 4 PM, plus having to travel with very short time notice, has left her with nothing. Knowing myself, I couldn't do this long-time. Work-life balance is important to me as well. I plan to have children and family in the future. Perhaps not all construction companies are like this though.

I care about having a work-life balance, good work benefits, a good salary, and a good workplace. I especially want to work in a place where they are friendly and encouraging (to female engineers). I know that companies like Southern California Edison and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power will have all this, but I am aware that it's extremely competitive to get into these companies. I know to work for the city/county/federal gov't will give me great benefits and work/life balance, despite the starting salaries being lower (but I heard the salaries DOES increase).

I am also debating if I should get a Masters in Business Administration or a Masters in Civil Engineering. If I decide to go into engineering, I plan to get a PE license as well. A Masters + PE may help increase my salary.

ANOTHER career option I have is to study for the Bar Exam for Patent Law after I get my B.S. Why? Patent Law requires people who want to become a Patent Agent or Patent Attorney to have a Bachelor's in Science or Engineering, which I will have. Most people in law generally come from humanities/business backgrounds, so people with backgrounds in science/engineering will have a better technical background within Patent Law. I don't need to complete law school to become a Patent Agent, I just need to study for a 6-hour bar exam. Studying will take 3-7 months, depending on if I prepare for it full-time or part-time. If I pass this exam, then I can become a Patent Agent.

Coming into my Master's I always knew this would be an option and something I would have to address in the future as I have worked as a researched with my PI during my undergrad, and he has always been impressed with my work. However, I have always been very industry focused and keen to start a job. I decided to sign-on for a Master's however I never had the intention of doing a PhD. From what I have read before on this thread, it is best to end it at a Master's and seek work experience if you're not planning to go into academia.

With everything that is going on with COVID-19, the job market and the economy, I am now considering the prospect of doing a PhD as it is guaranteed income for 3 more years. I am also worried that by the time I graduate, I would not be able to find a job due to the economy. I am however worried about becoming over-qualified and not being able to get a job because of it. I was wondering what your experience with hiring PhD engineers are? Are they often overlooked for being overqualified?

Here are a few extra details:

* MASc graduation: April 2021
* PhD (projected) graduation: April 2023
* Research: Wastewater treatment and membrane technology. It is an industrial research project and I am working with two industrial partners. The project has a lot of piloting work and hands on lab-scale system design and building involved.
* Concerns: Not being able to get a job in April 2021 in my field or being overqualified with a PhD in April 2023.
* I have also done co-op terms during my undergrad and have other relevant work experience.

73,"Is a dual major in CS and EE worth it, or would it be better to do CpE?",1590850945,"I am extremely interested in Computer Science, but I also am interested in the electrical side of things. My actual question appears further down, and if you just want to read that, then you can skip the next 5 sections, but here is some background in my current education/situation:

I initially started at my university with a dual major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. After speaking with a general engineering advisor, she told me I would be taking quite a lot of classes since there is very little overlap (and I knew that going in), and I would be better off pursuing Computer Engineering and pursuing a Masters, and she said there was no real benefit in having a degree in both CS/EE versus having a degree in CpE. 

At the time, I just took her word for it and switched to Computer Engineering. That wasn't too long ago, this is my third semester at university and the first semester I was taking classes for both CS and EE, and then my second and now third semester I have taken classes for CpE. All of the courses I have taken for CpE so far still also count for CS and EE, so I haven't gotten behind at all. I do plan on pursuing a Masters in CS, regardless if I get a Bachelors in CpE or one in CS/EE. 

The one thing that is really making me debate whether the dual major is worth it, is the extra time. I don't want to spend the extra time taking the extra classes if there is no benefit. As of right now, I need to take 8 more courses for CS, 13 more courses for EE, or 12 more courses for CpE (not including electives for any of them). Two of the courses in CS and EE might overlap, I'm not sure yet. It's Senior Design I and II, but they have different course numbers, I need to ask the university about that. 9 of the courses for CpE overlap with CS or EE.

Although pursuing a dual major would add a few semesters until I receive my Bachelors, it won't really place me behind my peers. I'm only 19 right now, and I spent all of high school working ahead, so I started out in some junior level classes in my first semester.

I am going to talk to a CS advisor about all of this (rather than just a general engineering advisor), but I am still hoping I can get some opinions from you guys. Also, I know having experience, such as internships, will help tremendously, and maybe even more so than adding a second major, and I am going to start applying for various internships once quarantine is up. (Also, I'm in a club that's working on sending a satellite to space, so I'm sure that'll count for some experience).

&amp;#x200B;

The above may be irrelevant, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to include it. In order to be able to work with both Computer Science topics as well as Electrical Engineering topics (with a slightly higher emphasis on the CS side), would it be worth it to pursue a double major in CS and EE, or would it be better to just pursue Computer Engineering? And I will be pursuing a Masters in CS regardless of those two options. I'm worried that if I choose CpE rather than CS/EE, some opportunities might not be available for me.

I've done a few internships there and never worked on anything that directly harms. They were subsystems or supporting systems. I've been doing research on the military industrial complex and trying to not walk in blind and naively thinking that every single thing I work on will be used justly. War in itself is already a gray area, its difficult to justify waging a war. Working for an industry that provides the tools to wage wars then automatically becomes morally difficult.

99,Balance between major interest and job security?,1590803683,"I have a few years before making this decision so I'm just mapping out my interests really. I like math and physics and engineering seems to be a blend of both those subjects. I looked it up and it seems like there are many people who over-spealized in their fields and are having trouble finding jobs.

On the other hand, there's plenty of people who've gone their whole lives working a job they hate and I don't want to end up like that. 

Now, I'm a kid. I want to make money. I do dream of having a job I love and making 6 figures. I'd understand if that's not reasonable or if my inerests naturally lower my salary. Law of diminishing returns, salary doesn't matter after you hit a certain checkpoint.

Anyways, back to the major questions. I really like physics. I'd like a job which uses the most amount of physics. I am also considering a physics major. I think that an engineering major might give me slight advantage by not having to learn concepts on the job. But still, I'd like to use physics in my job.

Job security and salary aside, I think I'd want to be a nuclear, molecular, power, information or mechatronics engineer. That's a lot but I literally just opened engineering branches on Wikipedia and said what I liked. However, I do realize that nuclear engineering will be a niche major. If I can't become a nuclear engineer, I didn't need to spend 4 years of my life with that degree because it doesn't overlap nicely.

0,Is civil engineering stupid?,1590802971,"Hi everyone,
First time posting in this thread. I’m just finishing up my first year of general engineering undergrad. At the university I’m at you don’t start your discipline till your second year. When applying to unis last year I mostly applied for civil (but I still wasn’t sure). Now after my first year I still am not sure. One guy who I was dating for a few months is also in his first year and going into space engineering. While we were dating he was very vocal about my education/career. He told me civil is the worst type of engineering to go into and he would never go into it. At the time I brushed it off and don’t care much but now 2 months later and I am having doubts about my career. I know this is all over the place but I’m just really doubting myself rn. I also don’t really have a deep passion for any of the types of engineering specifically. Another thing my ex had commented on was that  I am “not a real engineer” because I don’t really have a passion. Which of course made me feel insecure at the time but again I brushed it off bc At the time I felt confident in myself and in the fact that I was in the right program for me. But now I am really doubting myself. The past month I’ve been doubting myself and was considering geomatics engineering instead. But I soon got over that and decided to apply for civil.  It’s been 3 weeks since I submitted my form to be in civil engineering and now I am really doubting myself again and I have started considering types of engineering that I had dismissed months ago. Those being mechanical and software. So basically what I’m asking is if civil engineering is a weaker type of engineering and if I’m wasting my time on it. And if I should be doing something more like mech or software.",AskEngineers,False,Temporarycharger,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gt5r32/is_civil_engineering_stupid/
1,Have you ever worked for a 'probationary engineering position'?,1590802194,"I have an upcoming interview for a kind of offer/position that I haven't heard of by any of my peers or my professors; and was wondering if anyone here had any experience with such offers. 

For context, I'm a recent MET grad, good GPA, 2 internships, and have been working at my dad's company as a shop hand for the last 3 weeks while I apply for jobs. 

This week, I got a call from the hiring company that handled my internship hiring offering an interview at a local company (which I will have next week). As he explained it, they (may) hire me as a kind of manufacturing assistant for a ""probationary period"" for 90 days at $13/hr. Then, at the end of this period, they may or may not offer an engineering contract for $54k. 

As mentioned previously, I've never heard of such a thing from my peers or professors and was wondering if this is more industry standard that I am aware.

My take on this is that a ""probationary engineer"" or whatever is better on my resume than a truck driver/shop hand, and pays $1/hr more than I make now - however, it doesn't necessarily seem like a great deal if they want engineering work for about half as much as my internships paid.

22,Building software libraries at work?,1590776706,"(Throwaway account as my main account has too much info to connect to this)

TLDR: I don’t know how to keep coworkers safe from neat software I write.

I need help with best practices. I am a research and development engineer and programming is not my main field. I have been programming for about the last 28 years and although I am very good compared to the other people with PhDs in my field, I’m not perfect compared to a real Comp-SCI graduate or kernel hacker.

A lot of programming in my field is done in the lone-wolf script style of development where one person develops one complete algorithm for one project how ever they are comfortable and that’s that. There is fairly little reuse of code because we always find something wrong with the way someone else has done something.

Now, most of my new and novel research work requires leveraging a core framework of library to solve big problems in a more component fashion. It allows me to tackle bigger problems because the scaffolding of the framework makes certain painful recurring tasks easy to visualize and modify. I can reuse components from the library in various projects and avoid reinventing the wheel every time.

I am, however, about the only person who thinks like this. I have had success with two other people picking up my core framework and running with it to make things I never imagined, though. I don’t know if my current coworkers are up to the task. One seems up to the task, the rest are iffy.

I just want to get my work done in the most effective way I know possible using the framework. I want to solve the biggest problems I can using the best and flexible tooling I can make. But I don’t want to slow my coworkers down.

(1) The question is is it ethical for me to allow my coworkers to become dependent on my software which they might not be able to fix if I get hit by a bus? Like most modern workers, I change jobs every five years or so. They will get a few more years out of me but I’m just not able to stay 30 years like some of my senior coworkers doing the lone-wolf one project one script model. On the other hand, the alternative to not using my framework is also a problem as they are probably not going to be able to do what they want to do otherwise. 

(2) How does work on the core framework get paid for? I work in a matrix organization and the genesis of the framework got paid for on overhead but now stuff gets added only when projects need new functionality in the framework. I make the current project pay for the time that it takes me to upgrade the framework to do something that the project uniquely needs. But what if another project comes along in six month that needs that same functionality? Shouldn’t it have to pay for the privilege of using that framework code that was paid for initially by another project? Also, what should I do on overhead if anything? My current policy is that if there is something that would benefit all projects and would be fun for me to implement, I just do it on my own time off the books. It is hard for me to know when I should be asking for permission to bill a feature to overhead, bill to a project or when I should just explore idle curiosity on my own time.

(3) How/when do customers of my company get access to the framework? If we make a solution for a customer that requires the framework (python script) and distribute the solution plus the framework, how does that work from an IP standpoint? I think my company owns the IP to everything so there’s no reason they can’t just license the whole framework to the customer but this is unsatisfying. What if someone at the customer figures out how to do something awesome with the framework that my company isn’t getting paid for? Making binary only distributions is fraught with issues (see the whole open source movement of the last 20 years) and it would make it harder for me and my peers to develop.


All of these internal accounting and legal questions are exhausting. Also, the thought of leaving my coworkers potentially worse off for having worked with me is very unsettling.

In the end, I feel like canning the whole framework way of doing work and trying to keep to the one script, one project, one programmer model.

Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Aerospace, etc): 

-	More theoretical and difficult courses in schools
-	Opens up lots of theoretical jobs doing analysis, while still allowing you to do hands-on work
-	More applicable and broad to jobs after school

Engineering Technology

-	More hands-on and applicable courses
-	Generally easier programs compared to engineering
-	Mostly hands-on jobs that make it difficult to transfer into a “pure” engineering role later in career

Both

-	You wont know much when you graduate, just show passion and willingness to learn at your first job and try to soak up as much.

After about a year and a half I was promoted to being the Test and Evaluation team lead.

I generally like my work. It's fast paced, technical, challenging, and I get to work with a lot of smart people both on my Government side as well as on the OEM contractor side. There are inefficiencies that are inherent when working with Government contracts but I've always been able to shove those feeling aside.  

This month I was formally offered a position by the Department of the Navy. The offer was to do the same exact job I'm currently doing, only for the Govt. In the community I work in being a Government civilian is generally the better route to go. It offers job stability, great benefits and while no one will admit it, grants you more respect within the professional community. All of this comes at a price of a possibly more competitive salary as a support contractor.

I have also been offered, and to some extent explored other positions with other contractors over the past two years but being in a pivotal position on my team, at a very critical time in the program I decided to stick it out with my contractor and remain in this position to try and gain as much experience as I could.

Being a young father of two I chose to accept this Government position with the thought that a slight pay raise and more time off could not hurt. 

Upon telling my Integrated Product Team Lead (IPTL) about my conversion to a Government civilian, he congratulated me, thanked me for my hard work, and asked me to create a career plan as to ""chart my course so when I set sail I arrive where I want"". While this is great advice and the exercise is no doubt a good one, I am struggling because my long term plans do not include being a Government civilian working in in this area.

46,Job search with 5 years experience,1590747166,"I’m currently on furlough with my employer, but I’m very nervous that it will turn into a layoff ultimately. As such, I’m trying to do the groundwork now so that I can hit the ground running looking for a new job should worse come to worst. I’ve updated my resume/LinkedIn, reached out to local recruiting firms, and starting looking at job boards for potential positions that would match my experience.

I’ve worked for the last 5 years for a small custom manufacturing company (first and only job out of college). I spent about a year as a cost estimator and then I was moved to a manufacturing engineering role four years ago, while still occasionally doing some estimating as the backlog required.

My concern is, given that my shop is a small custom manufacturer that deals in woodworking, I have a good deal of experience with some aspects of manufacturing engineering (creating 3-D models and client drawings from quote drawings, generating BOMs from raw material quantities, preparing all of the necessary paperwork for shop production, and creating drawings for custom materials to be fabricated by third party vendors), but not with others. Our volume is nowhere near large enough for Lean or Six Sigma, and most firms use materials and create items with far more manufacturing concerns than static pieces made of wood.  We do have custom components made for projects fairly regularly, primarily metal, glass, and stone, but the extent of those is simply designing them and creating

Should I find myself looking, would it be more prudent to apply for entry level positions at larger/more technical companies, where my experience would allow me to get up to speed quicker while also learning more advanced facets of manufacturing, or should I go all in and apply for mid-level positions because I do have five years of experience working in manufacturing? I don’t want to set myself up for failure by applying to a bunch of jobs that I’m under qualified for but I also don’t know if I’d be selling myself short.

Tl;dr - I’ve worked for a manufacturing firm for five years but I’m not sure if my experience is robust enough to apply for jobs that ask for 5 years experience or if I should still focus on entry level positions at more technically advanced companies.",AskEngineers,False,OgreCountry,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gsq8oz/job_search_with_5_years_experience/
47,Looking for input for rebar scheme for greenhouse frame,1590746597,"I want to use PVC to build a frame for a greenhouse (see pics below), which will then be filled with aircrete. So the PVC won't be structural in the end, but rather serve only as a form for the concrete. There will be temporary supports to support the weight of the concrete until it cures.

I drew these hubs in Fusion. They're to be 3d printed, and serve to hold the PVC sections and rebar together in the correct orientation. Again, they're not structural.

The devil in the details is that the rebar can't extend into the hub, because then it would be impossible to slide them into position. The hubs are actually three individual pieces that interlock together, to allow the final section to be slid into place.

So I'm trying to come up with some kind of scheme to pack the hub with additional rebar after the sections have all been put in place. That opening in the top is actually just shy of 8"" in diameter, so it's large enough to get your hands in there to place short sections of rebar and tie it.

I was thinking of maybe using j hooks and hooking them around the bolt running through the middle, then having more j hooks that would hook onto those.

Details: 8"" PVC pipe, 5/8ths rebar. The shape is a regular dodecahedron. I did calculate the volume of each strut, and those 6 lengths of rebar end up being around 500 lbs per cubic yard, which is what they seem to recommend for columns.

I was just wondering if there’s a recommendation for a way to balance an uneven weight on a pulley system that is mounted in the center. 

I don’t have much room on my patio and it looks like there are three eyelets that were rigged for a previous system. These eyelets are mounted on a beam and the ceiling recesses above that beam, to the left and right of it. 

I would like to hide two kayaks to each side of the beam (recessed) and my biggest problem is wondering how to keep the system balanced when I hoist only one kayak back up (they would rest somewhat level with the  pulleys). The idea is to have both kayaks be cradled and having the pulley system in the center, wouldn’t make it possible to move the weight and store the solo kayak out of sight.

One thought, is to of course have the solo kayak strapped in from the two corners or the rail I have running alongside — to a central point where they eyelets are and prevent the side from tipping or dumping the kayak out. Or I thought about mounting each corner (maybe even one point to the ceiling above) — again preventing the side from tipping over. 

I really don’t want to drill into the recessed ceiling above, but will — if that is what’s best. That is actually what is preventing me from mounting a new rig for four corners (the wood is crazy hard and was not kind to my last bit or any nails I have tried to drill in, in the surrounding area). I also prefer to try and hide the kayaks — opposed to just attaching the kayaks to the existing beams and letting them hang together, either in separate slings on top of each other or just in the same sling, underneath the beam. That option really is the easiest, but keeping the kayaks as much out of sight seems most appealing.

In the past year, I discovered my passion for travelling and experiencing as much of the world as possible. When my contract is up in 4 years, I'm planning on quitting and going abroad for... a long time. 

The rough plan is to travel (backpacking) for like 4-6 months, then move to a foreign country and find a job, work for a year or so, then leave and travel again for a few months, rinse and repeat as long as I feel like it. The first country I want to work in is Japan, and the job doesn't necessarily have to be engineering. I actually might prefer if it wasn't engineering because I think it would be cool to work different kinds of jobs and have different experiences. I don't think I want to do engineering for my entire career, just for most of it.

I mean if I apply to an engineering firm and they see on my resume that I have 3 years of engineering experience followed by several years of unrelated job experience in various foreign countries, are they a lot less likely to hire me?

22,What's the best type of motor for a coffee grinder?,1590669982,"Hey guys,

Given that I know sweet FA about engineering but do love to build small things, I thought this was a great place to ask a fairly specific question.

I have a manual coffee grinder (a 1zpresso JX if that makes any difference) that I've attached to a standing piece of wood (using a pipe clamp) and then attempted to connect a small motor I had laying around (55rpm, very small and too slow) to it as a prototype to see if it was possible to motorise it.

[Here's a picture of the ""beast"".](https://imgur.com/DYVXTa4)

However, this motor is too slow and does not have enough torque to get the beans ground, so I was wondering what is the best motor to look for for this application? Around 200rpm (under load) seems to be a good fit, but as for what torque is required I have no idea. Probably 3nm? But that's just from what I saw on some threads that were ancient. There really isn't much to go from out there!

A 24v 3a DC laptop power brick will supply the power, as well as some connectors and a switch to control it. My research suggested that an inline planetary gearbox motor is a potential candidate (it is used in the Niche Zero, a very popular grinder in coffee geek circles), but I honestly haven't got a clue if this is the right fit. As for the classic drill option: It doesn't quite give enough tinkering freedom that I enjoy!

I soldered the corresponding +/- to the buck converter's input port and attached multimeter on the output +/- ports (so I can tune voltage down to 12V before I connected the fan).

74,Do any of you have experience with jobs that have an engineering title but are glorified operator roles?,1590603227,"I posted this to /r/chemicalengineering but I figure I would try asking here as well.


Anyone have any experience with jobs where you have the title of process engineer but really you're just an operator? 

I started this position at a plastic extrusion line about 6 or so months ago and I've concluded that this is basically a fancy operator job. I'm out on the machines all the time threading it, doing regular cleaning, performing product changes, fixing things when things go wrong, responding to emergencies, and punching numbers into ERP every time a product comes off the line. When all that is done, I'm pretty much left staring at my phone watching the line run with a technician as an assistant. These are 12 hour shifts and on a good day, only about 3 or 4 hours of that are actual work. I don't really use any technical knowledge here or do anything I traditionally associated with being a process engineer other than some troubleshooting. I'm not designing, improving, or changing anything, I'm just running a set of machines.

Also all of the machine settings are kept to memory for some reason. There is no document saying ""product X: change machine settings to W, Y, and Z"", instead it's more like ""product X: needs specifications A, B, and C"" and it's your job as an engineer to have a working memory of what you need to change to reach those specs. Knowledge of what to change and how to do it in order to reach those specs is passed along verbally. This results in every engineer here running the machines a bit different and there's really no standardized way of doing a lot of things. It also means it takes a long time to train people and when people leave a lot of knowledge goes out the door, I'm 6 months in and they only recently started letting me do some things on the line on my own.

I'm sorry if this all sounds like complaining, it's really not. The job isn't particularly difficult if you don't mind putting in a bit of sweat from time to time and can entertain yourself with your phone. I like the shift schedule with 12 hour days and I'm hourly so I get paid for overtime. It's just not what I expected with any process engineering position and I'm worried that it will end up putting a hamper on my future career and resume if and when I decide to leave here.

While my undergrad education taught me a lot of engineering fundamentals like math, physics, some semiconductor physics, general physics, fundamentals of electronics, etc., I feel that I didn't learn any concrete practical skills that employers are looking for. Pretty much no employer I've talked to even knows what ""engineering physics"" is and most of my graduating class ended up getting careers in something totally unrelated like finance or software development, and/or they had to re-train in a different program after undergrad (e.g. grad school, college, some even did a second undergrad just to get employable skills). I also had a major life disruption which kinda put my career on hold for a couple of years, and now I'm looking for something of a fresh start and to pivot into a new career.

I've always been interested in robotics, programming, electronics, and mechanical systems. I'm one of those weird autodidacts who's taught himself a little bit about a lot of different areas. I have some programming skills in multiple languages, I'm into 3D printing and machining mechanical things, I've made various electronics hobby projects over the years. I want to have a career where I'll get to use multiple different skill sets and work with people with different backgrounds. I recently started looking into industrial automation as a career path. From what I've read, people in this field tend to come from diverse backgrounds: software developers, electricians, mechanical engineers, etc. and the best people tend to have a diverse skill set. My understanding is that if you have experience / training in: PLC programming, industrial robot programming, control systems / industrial automation; then you can get into a fairly lucrative field with good future prospects. To that end, I'm looking to do a one-year or shorter program that will give me practical, hands-on skills in these areas. 

I live near Toronto, Ontario, and so far I've found two graduate certificate programs that meet these criteria: ""Industrial Automation"" at Niagara College (12 months) and ""Robotics and Automation"" at Sault College (8 months). I've applied to both and have been accepted to both, but I have choose one within the next week for the fall semester (assuming these colleges even resume normal classes in the fall, which is anyone's guess at this point). Has anyone heard anything good/bad/neutral about either of these programs? They both seem to have state-of-the-art facilities with modern industrial robots, PLC systems, hydraulic systems, that I could get practical experience with. Both programs include capstone projects where students design and implement some sort of industrial control system using real components. I'm hoping that this would allow me to build some real skills and have something more concrete to put on my resume when applying to junior robotics programmer jobs or junior PLC programmer jobs. ""I have experience programming Fanuc/ABB robots"" or ""Programmed Allen Bradley ControlLogix 5000 PLC"" sounds better on a resume than ""self-taught microcontroller programmer"".

I filled out all my employment including a job at a waterpark I had in high school and a tutoring job I had in college. This is through HireRight and I’m terrified about how I may be affected. The names I listed for the waterpark job as the company that paid me is not exactly the same as the one on the W-2 I received. Where I worked, where the HR department is , and where the payroll department is, is all in different locations. Payroll is in a different city, and the name I listed for the company is listed on Google as being in a different city than is listed on the emails I received from HR. I had to locate my W-2 for that job as, again, it was all the way in high school so I didn’t know what it actually listed as the company until I after I submitted the background check and had to acquire it after I started worrying about everything that could go wrong.

34,"If I use a square foot of tape to tape a strong, small magnet to a smooth ceiling, and then on another strong magnet attach an amount of weight- but not enough weight to pull apart the magnets once joined- will that weight pull the tape from the ceiling from the middle outwards over time?",1590519483,"Clarification below. It sounds silly but I'm serious. I'm trying to find ways of attaching things to apartment ceilings without holes and this was an idea that was thrown out. 

To clarify about the tape: I want to make a big square of tape... let's hypothetically say a square foot. And then on the sticky side in the middle I want to put a strong magnet. The ones I've been playing with are rectangle shaped, 1"" by 2"" that are about 1/2"" thick. Then, I want to adhere the tape square (with the magnet in the middle) to the ceiling so the magnet is sort-of sandwiched in-between. 

On the opposite magnet I could attach something like a lightweight hanging plant, ceiling decorations, or a support for a hanging light...etc. 

I'm thinking that if there's enough tape adhered to the ceiling around the top magnet, it will hold the weight up. And if the weight is too heavy, that the magnets will pull apart before the tape gives. But I'm worried about the pull on that tape over time? Should I be? I've briefly tested it and the pull created a ""bubble"" in the middle of the tape where the pull keeps the tape from being adhered to the ceiling, but the edges of the square stay adhered. I'm worried about the ""bubble"" growing and slowly peeling the tape off the ceiling over time.  

Also, out of personal curiosity: I guess magnetic force is holding the magnets together? If the amount of force pulling down on the bottom magnet from whatever's attached to it is less than the force that's holding the magnets together...is all of the weight from what I attach on the bottom acting on the tape? Or is it like...offset by the force holding together the magnets? Idk if that's a stupid question, no one has to answer it. :) I was just curious about how the magnetism works. Engineering is super interesting.

In addition, I also have numerous student organizations that I have been the 'officer' (leadership position) of at my University. I also had a part time job that I worked at in-between my classes.

All 4 of my summer internships are in Oil &amp; Gas. The first two I worked at an EPC firm (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) and the last two at a large Oil Refinery.

59,Reduction gear drive - where is the bulk of the pressure?,1590478316,"Hello everyone. First off, thank you for this Sub. I just got directed here and cannot express how wonderful it is to see passionate people sharing their knowledge. 

Now, to my question. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing around with reduction gear drives lately to increase torque and reduce speed. And I was wondering, where is the bulk of the pressure? 

Keep in mind, I am in no way an engineer(as probably evident by my simple question). My knowledge of math is limited, so I would appreciate it being dumbed down slightly if possible so I can understand the answer :-) 

**To give an example:**   
*Note:* The amount of reduction, force and teeth mentioned below are all fictionan as I haven't even planned my project yet. I don't want to plan too much before I know if my materials can handle it, and this question is essential in that regard.

Let's say I want to reduce a hand crank to apply a lot more torque than my measley human arms can provide. Now, without knowing the actual amount, let's just say I plan to reduce it 1:50. This will obviously mean a lot of force is needed, and that for sure puts strain on the reduction drive. Would this strain be split over all the gears or will the last one take the brunt of it? 

In other words, will it relieve my gear drive if I use more gears with fewer teeth or is it the same if I just use one larger gear with more teeth? 

&amp;#x200B;

The specific project I'm considering is if I can 3D print a gear drive to make a small table-sized silver rolling mill. I would use steel rollers, steel crank and a steel frame, but I would 3D print large nylon gears. However, if I can't somehow unload some pressure from the last gear, I sincerely doubt the nylon teeth can handle it. I haven't looked into it too much yet, but even annealed I am sure silver needs quite a bit of pressure to be rolled.

My friends and I [run trips to Socotra, Yemen](https://inertianetwork.com/engage-socotra), a really unique and remote developing island. About 80,000 people live on this island, and one challenge in particular that they face is that they have zero waste management on the island. As a result, the local populace simply tosses the trash wherever, and eventually typhoons will sweep the trash into the ocean. 

As you can imagine, this isn't great for anybody. Pic for reference:  [https://imgur.com/a/BKys5g8](https://imgur.com/a/BKys5g8)

68,How do driving monitors (i.e. Progressive SnapShot) practically work?,1590463035,"Hi all,

I recently signed up for Progressive's snapshot program to receive a discount on my auto insurance. If you're unfamiliar, it essentially logs various bits of data that indicate how safe of a driver Progressive thinks you are. There are multiple factors it considers, but one of the biggest ones is monitoring ""hard braking"" AKA decelerating at greater than 7mph per s, or about 3.13 m/s\^2.

I was curious about how external factors might affect the accuracy of the device, and this got me thinking about how it actually works. It's just a little plug-in device that goes in the OBD2 port of your vehicle. A few guesses I have (that are entirely uninformed):

1. It somehow directly reads speed from your vehicle and does some simple computations to get your instantaneous accelerations
2. It has an accelerometer housed inside of it
3. It gets a live estimate of your speed using GPS and does simple computations for acceleration

I live in an area with a lot of hills, so if the device uses an accelerometer, I'm wondering if I'm supposed to drive differently to compensate for this. Assuming it doesn't somehow filter out static forces, this would mean letting go of the gas on a hill with a greater than \~18 degree slope would immediately log as a hard brake simply due to gravitational effects.

Just something I'm curious about -- I don't think I'll practically change my driving in response to this.

The idea is not for the boat to look futuristic but having a relatively thin and aerodynamic (or whatever the term is for things submerged in fluids :P)  shaped surface to receive/react with the magnetic forces of a construction that would be above sea level (the boat) would make it safer in bad weather and much faster. (also maybe oil rigs or reactors in the sea could use that concept -just for the safety since they wont move anyway-?) 

I assume that power is not a limiting factor (if we ignore the cost) since it could be powered by one or multiple reactors. 

I assume that the submerged surface would have to be much bigger than the boat itself in order to keep it steady and dont risk the boat falling down outside the magnetic field.

0,What is the force on shock absorber for a very slow moving vehicle?,1590423992,"So i am doing a project on a robot which has to drive over a rough terrain. i have used an independent suspension on all 4 four wheels. Since the vehicle only moves at a speed of 5 kmph, i havent used a damper and only installed a spring. For my application, the suspension system needs to be quite soft to allow sufficient travel of the wheels in order to keep the rollcage as upright as posiible. SO my question is when the vehicle crawls over rocks, and a situation arises where only one front wheel moves over a rock, the wheel would naturally travel upwards compressing the spring and stop when the spring is completely compressed. At this point other wheels would start to loose their reaction force and loose contact with ground. Now lets assume that the right wheel is on rock and left wheel looses contact w the ground. and assuming weight distribution is symmetric on all 4. Would the spring of the right front wheel experience a maximum force of 50kg (500N) at this point. So i should design my spring w respect to this force?",AskEngineers,False,ADB007,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gqe18q/what_is_the_force_on_shock_absorber_for_a_very/
1,I feel stuck in my position as a manufacturing engineer / plant engineer / production manager-type role. What can I do to be more effective and broaden my skillset / experience? What have you done when you get stuck in a rut?,1590422728,"So I've been in my position for a couple years now. I can basically sum it up as a semi-technical operations ""manager"" (more like point of first contact) at a site which operates a few lines of a fairly linear process - the extent of it is a small number of reaction vessels and a packaging station. The job is production reporting, tinkering with SOCs, developing EIPs, but frankly, not a ton of process development or opportunities for robust, capital-type improvement.

I did pretty alright in school (&gt; 3.5 GPA in Chem E). The problem is, at least in my mind, that that wasn't too difficult to achieve, even without really grokking the material. I know basic principles of heat transfer, solution thermo, and all that, but I spent the bulk of my college years with undiagnosed ADHD and a penchant for completing everything at the very last minute. This resulted in me having a degree but, frankly, none of the technical know-how that comes with it. I know that in the grand scheme of things that's not really what makes an engineer.

I feel ineffectual at work. When there's a fire, I can help put it out. But as far as improvements go, I feel like I'm staring at a blank page with nowhere to start. This feeling may be a result of me not knowing what I don't know about industrial engineering concepts like 5S, SMED, and all that, though I'd be hesitant to say that's completely the problem. The process is an old and, frankly, mature one. The last major development was over a decade ago.

The thing is, I know that this is a naive point of view. Obviously no process is perfect. No plant is. But where do I begin, particularly if I've been there for sometime? What can I do that would benefit me personally if I want to transition to some other job / role / industry? How can I make a leap to say, process engineering design, or semiconductor manufacturing, if the only skills I can add to my resume are ""improved cycle times by 3%"" or ""5S'd the production floor"" (simplistic examples)?

If I somehow manage to get a professor job one day, I can hope to make around $100k as an assistant professor, hopefully around $150k as a full professor.

Why buy an AC unit for a couple hundred bucks if I can just make one myself! 

I was thinking of building a swamp cooler aka. evaporative cooler. Materials required for such a unit are: 

An Evaporative cooling pad, water w/ container, a water pump, pipes, a fan, and materials holding everything together.

As far as I know, evaporative cooling pads can either be made of Aspen (Wood shavings) or synthetic materials (Plastic I guess). The problem is that you can't find these pads here in Germany and I have no way nor time to order these from other places. And that's why I'm thinking of making my own! 

Question is how? I think making a metal cage container and filling it with wood shavings might work but I'm not so certain about that. I did some heavy research on these pads but nowhere is it listed that these can be DIYed. 

To be honest, I'm still not 100% certain how the whole process of evaporative cooling works and maybe an evaporative cooling pad can be easily DIYed at home because it doesn't require any special materials to build one. Just guessing at this point.

Hi everyone! So I've been struggling with this one and my google-fu is failing me so I'm appealing to the good

So my project is fairly straightforward. I am trying to install two hard point into my bedroom for aerial yoga and perhaps some aerial debauchery :-). The room is 11' 6"" wide by 19' long w/ 8' ceiling, built in the mid 80ies. It's on the second floor directly below the roof. Ideally we want two hard point about 4 to 6' apart. They would at most hold a collective 500lbs of people swinging around on them, think light swinging and not swing set swinging.

The challenge... As you can see the roof is made up of web trusses. The bottom cords are amazingly strong. I've been working on other projects up there and I don't think I've felt them budge once despite being comprised completely of 2x4s.

Roof Wide Frame: [http://imgur.com/LGzavFD](http://imgur.com/LGzavFD)

The trusses are 24"" oc [http://imgur.com/P1cdVnX](http://imgur.com/P1cdVnX)

My initial plan was to drop a 4x6x12 across the bottom cords, use some hurricane ties to hold it in place and drill two holes for the 3000lbs rated i-bolts. However after some searching the internet is completely inconsistent on if they'll hold it no problem or if my roof is going to cave in. So I changed my plan and decided to get two 2x12x12 beams, sister them and run them the width of the room between the cords instead of on them. One side would be resting on the 2x6 exterior wall header and the other on a 2x4 header. The problem with this plan, if I am fully on the 2x6 I'm short by a few inches.

Full span [http://imgur.com/W9juGE3](http://imgur.com/W9juGE3)

Budget is ideally not over $150 for creating the span but I am open to suggestions.

A fan from a 1 ton AC outdoor unit would be mounted to provide air exchange. All airflow is brought in/out of the box via the folded ducts on each end.

Would there be a huge benefit to making walls non-parallel? How many folds are required to provide 10-15db of attenuation? The cross section area of the ducts will be sized to the same cross section area as the fan - is this a reasonable rule of thumb?

77,Full wave rectifier causing problems,1590300436,"  This is long, but I know some of the brainacs here will just solve this as easy as breathing. I have been at it for two weeks.

I have a couple of new Kohler engines with some 20-30 amp full-wave rectifiers on them for charging. Under most circumstances it charges just fine. When I put a load on it the DC+ (B+ lead on the Kohler rectifier) jumps from right at 14.08vdc to 14.41vdc +/-. The system is charging and working well. However when I turn on one particular transformer that is 12v and 8amps the engine stops charging. If I measure the DC output when I turn on that transformer I am lucky to get 12vdc. It commonly drops to the high 11vdc range. Not until I turn off that transformer does the rectifier return to the 14+vdc as per normal and then charging resumes. 

Here is the crazy part I have this EXACT same setup on 10 other units and I have no such issues. So I wired my new engine to the transformer on my current unit and got the same problem as described above. I wired my new transformer to the current unit and it works as expected and the unit charges. So the problem has to be in the engine and it’s charging system. But aside from the transformer the charging system is behaving normally. So next I wire up another new engine and it is behaving the exact same way. It is blowing my mind. I have been doing this since 2013 I know what I am doing but this one is kicking my butt.

Here are the particulars in case it is needed or is relevant;

· Kohler CH730-3226 manufacturer in Sept 2019 (10 other units 2016-2017 same make/model)· 

\-Rectifier Kohler 25-403-39-S (20-30 amp rectifier)

· Stator Kohler 28-085-02S Stator 25 amp

· Transformer Beckett 5218303U 12VDC Ignitor 

So in my infinite knowledge of electronics (not so much) I decided I am dealing with a ""noise"" issue as the transformer is a good deal closer to the engine and rectifier on the new setups, or I am dealing with a full wave vs half wave pulse issue.

84,Help Diagnosing Turntable Wow/Flutter?,1590287001,"Hi Engineers  
Lots of career advice in here I hope you're open to something a little more specific.  
I bought a very nice turntable many years ago, essentially out of the dumpster.  
Blemished etc but has performed incredibly during my ownership.  


Some  details of its construction.  The  motor and  plattern are two separate assemblies. The motor is AC, axle up, clamped to a 4""x4""x1"" lead plate by a steel plate.  A delrin pulley is press fit onto the axle and has two grooves cut into it for the appropriate 33/45 ratios.  A nylon thread connects this pulley to the platter which drives the record yadda yadda.  


More recently, the delrin pulley has gone soft and does not hold to the motor shaft, causing the music to stop at surprise moments in the most horror-carnival fashion.  Attempts to firm it with lock-tite were effective but produced a distressing, audible ""wow/flutter"",  which  lead  me to pursue other solutions.  


Thinking this was attributable to  the part, I found a local machinist to fab a new one. Great guy, communication,  turn around. Good experience. no grief at all.  


Well the part is back and looks good.  Interference fit  on the motor shaft is good, but turntable still plays with audible bad wow/flutter.  
Now before I go back to my guy in a pleasant rage, I think I should do my  homework to make sure its his part.  Found an ios app ""RPM Pro"" (no affiliation) and on the 33rpm notch records 1.4% wow/flutter and seems to show a vibration in rpm with two close harmonics of similar amplitude (almost a sine with every other lobe being a bit depressed, not enough to recording to see how they beat).  A second run (having removed  and reinstalled the pulley) shows a tighter harmonic and a broader one about 18/1 with similar amplitudes.   Rotating the pulley 90 degrees the  pattern seems about the same.  (I am wondering if the lower frequency doesnt have a longer attack than decay but could just be seeing   
 things)  


Kissing the outside diameter of  the part with a business card I  can hear a tick per rotation very clearly. 

Found an audio FFT app and rigged a small wire to the axle and then kissed it with the business card.  and  the ticks there seem stable  (driven by  AC i dont see how they have much choice) but just eyeballing on a $2 ios oscilloscope, essentially. and hand held at that!  


Can you all recommend  some methods for me to exclude/include his part and then locate the source of the vibration?

It is made of a single piece of rubber, has an inverted dome shape, and some kind of perforation in the middle, usually either a short slit or cross shape. As pressure builds behind the nozzle, the inverted dome is in compression, which pushes the edges of the slit together, giving a tighter seal until a threshold is reached where the dome ""pops"" outward and the edges of the slit are stretched apart, allowing liquid to flow through. When the pressure is reduced beyond a lower threshold (it has built-in hysteresis between start and stop pressures), the dome pops back to its original shape, stopping the flow, resealing the slit, and pinching off the stream of liquid moving outward as the dome snaps inward, neatly avoiding drips that might cling to its outer surface.

Now I've worked at a big tech company for 9 years doing R&amp;D, my name is on 5 patents, lots of early design work all of the way to doing product ramp support in China and Thailand a few times, including cad, drop, life, and acoustics testing, very basic scripting, everything from blue sky to nitty gritty cost/warranty reductions. Im female, speak decent Spanish, and was making serious progress on Mandarin before letting it lapse and forgetting most of it. 

I will be laid off at the end of the month. 

Since ""big tech company"" is the only ME job I've ever had, my interview skills are nearly a decade old and I also haven't looked around much. Something like Boston Dynamics would be a dream job. So awesome! 

My priorities are 
1. Work hard: innovative solutions, fast paced work, brilliant teams. I've happily done a ~100 hour week in Thailand with the line down
2. Play hard: people encouraged to take their vacations or a sunny Friday afternoon off. I've happily done a 30 hour week and had drinks with colleagues for hours
3. Interesting work, particularly in robotics
4. Would definitely prefer something that helps humanity, and would at least somewhat avoid something that could hurt it

93,Education and Career advice,1590272596,"Thank you in advance to anyone taking the time to read this post and answer my questions.  

I have an unusual educational and employment history and am looking to break into an engineering career.  Some background:

When I originally attended college I was dealing with some severe health problems (since resolved) and crazy family drama so I just got an easier degree (economics) with a meh GPA in 2005 from a state university.  I am now 32 years old and have been working in the restaurant industry for the past 12 years.  I currently hold a position at a relatively high end place as a sommelier (I'm certified) which pays surprisingly well and which I enjoy. I work about 25 hours a week and have a great deal of flexibility.  However, I do not see myself remaining in the hospitality industry indefinitely and have been exploring other career options.  I have always loved math and science.

Over the last few years I have used my free time to complete the following courses at a community college:

Biology I &amp; II

Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology I &amp; II as well as an advanced anatomy course (it was a cadaver class)

Gen Chem I &amp; II

Calculus I, II &amp; III, Differential Equations and Linear Algebra

Calc-based Physics I &amp; II

Intro to programming (python), CompSci I: Object -oriented programming (Java) , and CompSci II: Networks (C++)

I thoroughly enjoyed all of the above classes and, although I certainly put quite a bit of studying in, I found the core concepts fairly easy to grasp.  My GPA over the above courses is a 3.8.  It's time for me to transfer to a 4-year college.  I live in Denver and hope to remain here for both school and, eventually, work.

Here are my questions:

Which 4-year: I'm paying for school out of pocket as I go.  I can (just barely) afford to attend University of Colorado Denver on my own.  School of Mines is another option with (from what I can tell from speaking to restaurant customers in the tech industry) an absolutely stellar reputation.  However, Mines is pretty expensive and I would need to take out loans.  My partner and I live debt-free (apart from the home we recently purchased) and I would hate to give that up.  Is an undergraduate degree from Mines worth the extra cost?  

Which program:  I want a degree with which I can find a well - paying job IN DENVER (I make about 75k now, so at least that to be fair to my partner and maintain our standard of living).  If this was entirely about what interests me most I would want to study Biomedical engineering but I'm aware that the ROI  on that is NOT good and that working on medical devices is, in general, very difficult to break into.  Who's hiring?  Should I study one of the core engineering disciplines for the sake of versatility?  I'm leaning towards electrical.  Should I double major in CompSci?  I really do like just about everything; what fields do you lovely people work in?  What do you do all day?  Is anyone familiar with the Denver job market?  What did you study?  If you could go back and change your major, would you?

2,Should I quit one week into a bread &amp; butter MechE internship to take a more prestigious technical internship?,1590264759,"I was hoping I could take advantage of the collective wisdom here to make a potentially critical (in my opinion) career decision. This will be my only internship experience as an undergrad since I am a senior next year. I am a Biomedical and Mechanical EGR double major. Here is the timeline I was/am faced with in order:

1. I receive job offer from company A, and sign it.

2. I get notice that internship may be cancelled due to COVID.

3. Another company I applied for (company B) before even applying for my top choice contacts me for an interview, and I receive an offer. I sign this one as well, because I am afraid of being left without an internship for the summer.

4. I actually start working for company B, and at the end of my first day I receive word that company A is moving forward with a delayed start date.

&amp;#x200B;

*Now either way I will have to go back on an offer, with the difference being that I have worked for one week at company B.*

&amp;#x200B;

Some info on both companies and my thoughts about an internship with them:

**Company A - Technical Intern**. I was hired as a Computational Science intern. This was my top choice internship, and definitely the more prestigious one. This is a government contractor, an employee-owned research firm. 1000+ employees. They pay the most at 25/hr. Pay is the least important consideration, but I think it is indicative of the company's status and potentially the responsibilities they will entrust me with. They hired me for two specific, well defined projects, but I am not at all well informed about what they will be. I do know there will be some data collection work, and an updating of the UI they use for FEA. Although I am an OK coder, I will need to use a language I am unfamiliar with, and I could very well be underqualified for this role. I am willing to spend time outside of the office learning stuff, but I am not a computer scientist. However, they know my majors, so they can't really be expecting someone with serious compsci knowledge. Most importantly, I could see myself having a good career at this company, and working there after graduation if they will have me.

**Company B - Engineering Intern - Product Development**. This is a small (50-100 employees) local medical device company. Judging from the other interns, they hired everyone who applied. They pay $15/hr. They seem very friendly so far, have taken the time to walk me around and introduce to their manufacturing process, made sure that I have stuff to work on, and in the first week I have heard two people say that it is a great company to work for. Additionally, they gave me their top internship role with the best mentor (as opposed to others who are also BME and landed in QA). I would get what I believe to be a bread and butter MechE experience. I would become more proficient in Solidworks, and deal with FDA regulation, design for manufacturing, verification/validation. However, I kinda wanna shoot higher than this for my job after graduation, and I definitely think I could with a double major from at a top ten school and one of the top BME programs in the country.

I am also thinking that it would be a mistake to pass up on the technical internship at Company A, because I expect that there are less of these types of internships available. I feel that I could get a job in medical device design after graduation without necessarily having an internship experience in medical devices. However, if I decide I am interested in a more technical job that involves math, coding, and modeling, it would be harder to find one without any experience. Not as important, but worth a mention: I have a one hour commute each way to Company B, while I would actually have to leave the state (but no commute then) for Company A.

Could y'all share some of your wisdom and agree or disagree with my thoughts? Am I seeing things correctly? Feel free to pick one of these internships that you would prefer to have and be able to list on resume - it would definitely help me out to see a tally!

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on a tiny house project which I almost got as a freelance project but didn't (I'm new at this and have no idea how to estimate time and costs yet). I chose to do it regardless of the lose of client and I don't want to get rusty at my CAD and architectural engineering skills while I'm looking for a job. Please keep in mind this is a hypothetical project.

The project is a 5x8m house that I chose to design in in CLT with a ventilated rainscreen cladding as I wanted to figure out construction details and to try to make it sustainable and designed for disassembly. 

I am now looking into the groundfloor construction and found screw foundations as a good option. I'm considering them because I assumed that the little house would be constructed next to where I live and there's a lot of moisture in the ground and a lot of the buildings around are done on pile foundations. 

This being said, I googled how they're connected to the building and it's fairly straightforward, but then I am thinking the groundfloor is going to be some kind of suspended floor (CLT or timberframe) which is going to be insulated.

The problem is the connection between the external wall, ground floor and foundation screw. I couldn't find anything on their connection and how to avoid a coldbridge. As far as I know, the best is to try to envelop the entire building in insulation as much as possible to avoid any unpleasant effects. Will the house need to rest on soil or lightweight aggregate (LECA)?

Another question  is if there are any products for underfloor heating that don't require wet products (ex. screed)?

What are some solutions / products that you've used?

9,"I’m a college student who just got terminated from mechanical engineering, should I leave engineering???",1590251927,"tldr: I’m worried I’m gonna be a bad engineer and that there’s no room for bad engineers in engineering. Will I find my spot, or should I leave before I waste more time, hurt somebody, get a degree I shouldn’t own, maybe even begin to despise engineering? Surely others have been in this situation?

I essentially refused to drop classes when going through my degree and lost a good chunk of GPA because of it. I did better this past semester (far better) but again didn’t drop a class when I should have and this time I got hit where it hurts. (I did a crappy job of “playing the game” that is college, apparently “C’s” DO NOT get degrees)

It just seems weird to me because I haven’t been truly upset about it. I expected mechanical engineering to be hard, and I even expected to potentially flunk out of it. However, now I am switching to Industrial Engineering, and I cant help but ask myself if engineering is the right thing to do. 

I think that hard work and determination are important values however they hold little value if you can’t solve math problems, or do physics/statics, right? Like who am I to push to become an engineer and take the responsibility of being an engineer, if I’m seemingly barely qualified? 

I’ve been looking forward to engineering most of my life so far, and I think that’s why I’m ok with losing mechanical, I just want to be an “engineer” of any sort. It’s just recently I’ve been questioning (I guess) the ethics of the decision to continue in engineering. I guess personally it’s not like I owe the world or anybody anything and so if I want to be an engineer then why not? Just, at the same time, I guess it’s hard to live with the potential of being a “bad engineer” and honestly being dangerous or detrimental to something I always really looked up to...

It’s maybe most similar to being the dumbest person on a school project, I don’t want to be that in my professional life, but sometimes it just feels like that’s what’s going to happen.

Any words of wisdom or encouragement? I’m NOT really looking for college advice, I just want to know that regardless of wether I make it in engineering or not, that I won’t feel inadequate and like I don’t belong in engineering. Or if maybe I will and that I should get out before I begin to despise the profession. 

Gonna say too that I’m not freaking out or anything, I just genuinely want to know. In my head engineering has always been somewhat “noble” or like “oiled” (I usually think of NASA and how it’s a ton of smart people coming together to better humanity, or Formula One (lol) in that it’s a big team making the best thing they can together).

Some car companies still make cars with very subpar reliability especially compared to other manufacturers.  There are certain brands that are perennially at the bottom of reputable, statistically valid reliability surveys.

Is reliability just not a business priority for these companies?  Are processes that increase reliability difficult to implement?

Another thing that is a mystery to me. Companies using the same OEM suppliers get wildly different results.   For instance Audi and Toyota both use Denso brand coil packs.

I plan on separating the two chambers (Hot and Cold) from one another so that a fan pulls in air from the room, pushes it trough the Intel heatsink (Which should be cold), and push cold air it out of a hole into my room. 

The Hot chamber would contain the high power heatsink with a fan which would then push the hot air (through, oh idk, a large tube?) out of my room.

One of my professors has offered me a few options with her lab. She is a well respected MIT grad with interesting research in the computational biomedical field. Her work is composed of using control techniques, sysID, paramID, and optimization (topics that I love). Essentially, I have the options to either do in-practicum work for her, a thesis that will run from June-December, a PhD position, and a part-time PhD position (it exists apparently...). 

Right now, PhD is not a option for me. My dilemma is whether to take the thesis to graduate as MSEE (as to MEE) or not. The reason I want to do it, is to get more experience, since my last 2 jobs have literally been paper pushing with little to none engineering. 

If I don't, I will be taking my last two courses (sysID, Robotics) and graduate. In which, will be followed by applying to jobs specific to what I studied for. 

So essentially, I'm in a position where I have the option of getting experience at the expense of research stress while working full-time or forget about a thesis and hope someone hires me as a controls engineer. Next week I have a interview with Google for a controls+ML position, which tells me that my resume comes off as someone ready to be in the field. However, in reality, that is not the case in comparison to CVs of others in this field. I've rambled on far too long...

TL;DR

Graduating MEE in December 2020, working full time. Want R&amp;D career path. Have option of completing a thesis for experience. Don't know if worth it.",AskEngineers,False,walmart_security_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gor2w5/graduate_engineer_losing_sleep_over_the_thought/
47,"Is my frustration with CAD software justifiable, or am I just dumb???",1590178887,"I'm an engineering student, which means I'll have to learn how to use CAD software at some point in my life. I've had some experience with different CAD programs out there, like Creo and Onshape, and Fusion360. But I just can't seem to learn how to use them! I've done seminars, watched tutorials, tried ""easier"" CAD programs, and everything else well-meaning people tell me to do, but it's no use. They're all so difficult and confusing to use, and it's like a big block in my path that's stopping me from learning how to use them.

I don't think I'm a techtard. I learned how to use Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel relatively quickly because all the functions are so well laid out. And if I get stuck on something, I can find the answer quickly or have someone show me how to do something once or twice, and then I don't need to ask again. I learned how to use Windows 3D Builder within a week or two because it's also a well-designed program, even though it doesn't have as many capabilities as Creo for example. But my brain starts spinning as soon as I even look at typical CAD programs that are used in engineering. Like, how do I make sense of all these tiny icons? Everything's so jumbled up, and nothing's laid out logically! And why do shapes freeze permanently and refuse to budge as soon as I click out of them?!

At this point, people usually tell me something along the lines of ""Well suck it up and learn it!"". I get that they might have a point, but how the heck an I supposed to learn something that I don't have time and money to learn?! If you've ever taken a human factors course (like I'm doing right now), you probably know that a system is most effective when it's designed for the human, not when you have to ""design"" the human for the system. And it seems to me that most CAD software is designed with the perspective of ""manning the equipment"" or ""if you can't learn it, you lose"". Maybe it's time for a complete redesign of CAD software to make it more intuitive to use and easier to learn in a short period of time? I don't know, but that would be nice.

TL:DR  CAD software is so hard for me to understand and learn. I think it's because they're not as intuitive as other software like Microsoft Word for example, but there's a chance that I'm just an idiot.

I don’t want to brake I want it to accelerate a shaft for a short period of time to actuate a pin and then it will disengage. I think friction wouldn’t be too much of a problem even at high temperatures because of the short time at each engagement but I’m not sure

I've been thinking about some kind of laser rangefinder on the ground that's mounted on a rotating and moving-up-and-down thingie.  You could combine azimuth, elevation, and range to get a lock on the aircraft.  But this introduces the problem of keeping the laser pointed at the aircraft, and re-acquiring it when it inevitably gets blown out of place.

I've also considered putting some kind of radio transmitter on the aircraft, which would sync with a ground station before launching.  Then it would emit a signal at known intervals, and by tracking the time between the signal being sent and received we'd know its range from the ground station.  This introduces problems of precision timing (both clocks have to stay exactly synced over time,) and it doesn't give azimuth or elevation.  But if nothing else it could give range, and maybe would provide a signal for a moveable dish antenna to home in on if the laser rangefinder loses track of the aircraft.  Just keep moving until the signal maxes out.

Is this a problem with a known solution, or am I on my own here?  Are there things I'm not considering that will be an important factor?

How will submerging the condenser coil affect performance of the AC unit? Based on the reduced performance of my AC unit in hot weather I assume that submerging the condenser coil should improve performance . I'm not sure however if it might cause some kind of over condensing condition which would inhibit the function of the machine or refrigerant. From some research it looks like the optimal outer ambient temperature should be 65 -70 oF. But I know water is more thermoconductive than air so I'm not sure if water at the tap temperature might chill the refrigerant too much. I believe my unit is using the refrigerant ""R32"".

Auxiliary information: To do so I would be removing the case from the a A/C unit, constructing a tank around the condenser radiator with an inlet at the bottom of one side and an outlet at the top of the other side, then using a tap connection and drain for water inflow and outflow.

The scenario: Your tasks, either as a SE/CE/EE/ME etc typically requires you to be only on your PC for most of the week if not entirely. Say you're writing code, simulating circuits, doing IT support, doing CAD drawing, MATLAB/analysis, etc for pretty much 100% of your day. 

I give you the opportunity to work for 2 companies. 

Company A: If the work REALLY doesn't require you being at office, you may work from home. And all meetings can be done over video/audio calls. If you have lab or on-site work, you'll of course have to come in - but otherwise no pressure or judgement. 

Company B: Yes, you may work from home but only on special occasions aka you're sick, have a kid to take care of, urgent home errands, etc. Too many WFH situations and your manager gets nervous, because it's fishy and not the norm in the company (think aerospace/defense or boomer-driven or beauracratic). 

Who in their right mind would ever work for company B over A? Especially 10 years from now. And yes there are still way more B companies than A companies. 

What I hope happens: 
Because of the flexibility offered with PC-only jobs, students will gravitate towards CS/CE/SW/IT majors and there will be fewer EE/ME/ChemE/Civil etc. 

Traditional engineering companies who refuse to adopt WFH will struggle to retain young talent who can score a EE/SW/IT/ME job at a more flexible tech/engineering company. (And yes, there are mechanical/hardware engineering roles at top tier tech companies). 

In a few years, a lot of the older engineers at these traditional (but necessary) companies will be retiring and there just aren't enough younger talent around to keep their business as strong as it once was. 

I hope there will be a time where these older companies have no option but to allow permanent WFH. And once its been adopted massively, the employees will finally get the flexibility they always deserved.

(robotics engineering)",1590086800,"Hey guys, I've always lurked around reddit without making an account since I've never seen the need to make one until I found this awesome subreddit, which I found at the exact perfect time in my life. I am currently starting my first internship and I desperately need your help.

Three semesters in and I have discovered what the main difference between  bachelor of science and bachelor of engineering tech and I feel like I have been misled this whole time. It wasn't after my first semester that I found out my degree was a bet and not bes. (silly I i know) but instructors left and right had always assured me of the type of work I would be going into. However, I start my first internship and ""engineering tech"" is DEFINITELY NOT what I want to do in life.

The worst part is that I love my coursework. Currently I'm working on a Robotics communication systems engineering technology bachelors. To put it simply, 1/3 of the program is electric theory, HF/RF, analog and digital... etc, 1/3 is programming and microcontrollers and 1/3 is marrying the two. With, of course, some other stuff in between. We go into much deeper theory topics than an average technician course ever would but not as deep into it as electronic engineers would. (although from what I've seen so far, it seems like electronic engineers are more industrial oriented) And call me crazy, but I love sitting at a desk designing calculating, and programming or sitting at a bench setting up my breadboard, building amplifiers, logic circuits, or just testing circuits. I could do either one all day long. 

My problem is that my internship is an engineering technician internship and it does not feel stem related at all. I love stem. This doesn't feel like stem. Tightening bolts, using drills, and plugging in wires for test equipment doesn't feel like stem to me. It feels like every other warehouse job I've worked at in order to be able to afford school so that I never have to work in that environment ever again. I feel like I'm a disposable worker that has to be on their feet all day working in labor. Working with hazardous, volatile materials and guys that call you a ""pussy"" for wearing the correct safety gear makes me feel expendable. At the very least I was expecting to work on fixing some type of circuit problem or at least using a multimeter. 

Don't get me wrong, I am ever appreciative of this opportunity and the pay isn't phenomenal but it will definitely help pay my next semester off. But this is not for me. I don't mean to sound like a pompous asshole but I feel extremely over qualified for this line of work. This type of work applies more to someone with an instrumentation degree. Which I guess makes me feel under qualified? Given that we have never worked with guages, test equipment and plc ladder logic. Under qualified or over qualified, you decide. Either way, theres no problem with an instrumentation degree but this stuff is simply not for me. I want something a little less physical and a little more mathy.

These aren't my people. The guys around me are your typical hot headed ""know-it-all"" welder types that  who, quite frankly, mostly tend to be assholes. And honestly, it's really killing my morale and attitude being around these guys. I'm getting a sense of dread knowing that this might be what my degree accumulates to and I'm kinda freaking out about it.

Again don't get me wrong, I appreciate everyones position and what they're there to do but I know what I want to do, and I know it's not this. Everything I read points to me needing to switch over to a bachelor of science degree but I don't know which exactly to switch over to.

The bad new is I love my coursework and I'm already 25 years old. I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I dealt with a lot of personal issues and depression when I was younger, that really took up a lot of my time and now I'm scared that it might be too late for me (in relative terms) to even think about switching degrees.

Our program is well known for being intensive and delving deep into theory topics. I just don't know why, then, the end goal is to work a job like this!

 Every intern I read about in their intranets homepage that is working on things that i find interesting is studying for something like a bachelors in electronics engineering or computer science. My penultimate goal is to work somewhere like Boston dynamics designing and working on projects like the quadruped or bipedal robots and my ultimate goal is working in the biomechanical engineering/bionics field involving cybernetic prosthetics and hopefully some AI design. I'm unsure of what route I need to take. In the long run, I know I'll need some biomedical and bionics related degrees under my belt but for the short term, I guess I'm kinda lost now and don't know where to start to get my career going. I'd like to finish my course as it covers a lot of useful stuff both hands on and theory. The programming courses in it really aren't super intensive but we learn a lot of VB, LabVIEW, and a tiny amount of embedded C. However, I know this course is meant to cover a broad range of topics in a short amount of time and therefore we don't delve into topics as deep as I'd like to. I've read computer engineering is where I want to start but the more and more I read, the less sure I am of the course of action I need to take. Computer science? Computer engineering? Which one should I look at? 

I know financial aid only covers up to your first bachelors degree so I don't think I want to use it on a bet degree. I just don't know what school to look at, what program, where to start? Sorry if I'm a little sporadic and all over the place, I'm just kinda freaking out and any direction from experienced engineers would help a whole hell of a lot. I would ask some of my instructors but I can't really get a hold of them during the summer and a lot of them scoff at bachelor of science degrees. Let me know if you have any questions for me. Thanks in advance.

23,What is the science behind reel lawn mowers not being able to cut weeds?,1590086670,"For those not familiar, this is a reel mower (there are many brands, most manual, but some powered):

It spins a spiral blade who's axis is perpendicular to a traditional blade lawn mower.  Traditional blades chop at the grass, while reel mowers clip them almost like a scissor.  My understanding is that many golf courses use powered reel mowers because they supposedly do less damage to the grass itself and give you a cleaner cut.  

But that cleaner cut is only with grass.  




If you try mowing over dandelions or other weeds, the reel blade rarely cuts them.  Its the damnedest thing because you can have some tall grass and one tall weed and you go over it and everything is nicely cut except the week.  You can go over it again and again and if you are lucky it might chop it down, but usually just folds the weed over.

After busting my ass yesterday this is what I’ve got now:


https://i.imgur.com/S9A3O7W.jpg 


My hope is to be fully empty and site cleaned up again later today. 

My home cabin was built in 1922, so I suspect it’s from that time or pre-dates it, although I’m not quite sure. There was a lot of moon shining activity up here and I suspect they either blew the house up with a still or it burned down from a lightning strike.

So my ultimate goal will be to turn this into a swimming hole. Up here, swimable water is non existent. 
10x12x6 is roughly 5,000 gallons. The bottom slopes from 6’ to 4’ so it’s even less water technically. 

I am thinking I have two options:

1.) put some cement footings in and create 45* supports for the walls.  How many will I need? How far apart should they be? 

2.) use the current foundation as exterior support and pour a new floor, then use cinderblocks and rebar to create a reinforced wall, making sure the corners are extra reinforced. It will reduce the amount of water, but will hopefully be so strong it doesn’t need supports.

39,"Is it possible to generate electricity for a Nuclear-Electric propulsion drive in space, using a steam turbine?",1590070571,"We are witnessing increasing interest in space technology in recent times. Power generation is going to be extremely important for space exploration. NASA has been awarded huge grants for research into Nuclear powered rockets. Now, the Nuclear electric propulsion, which is basically a high power ion drive will be much more efficient than Nuclear thermal propulsion. It uses a nuclear reactor to produce huge amounts of electric power to accelerate ions out of the rocket nozzle.

If we were to design a Nuclear electric propulsion, the best way we know to convert massive amounts of heat to electricity is by using a steam turbine running on a closed loop rankine cycle. Let's assume the reactor is producing 200MW of power. Now here is the problem. We use huge cooling towers to condense superheated steam, here on Earth. Will we need such huge expanders to condense steam in space also? Or is there some other artificial, forced means to achieve the same? 

We have the constraint that we cannot use evaporative methods of heat dissipation since that will require carrying additional water for extracting heat from the cycle and expelling it out of the rocket.

I've been working for this guy for last 8 months or so. It all started a month before I graduated, he called me and said if I'd join him working on projects (calculating heating, drawing floor heating, plumbing and water design). I don't know english teminology for it, but you probably know what work needs to be done there.

Since I didn't know much about it, payment of 200eur per project seemed fair, considering I get to learn a lot and for that time all I did was calculating hvac (and draw it in autocad), which way basically my thesis. However, I was eager to learn more and by now I feel like I do majority of work. Which is good,at least experience wise.

It seems more and more is expected of me. I like that work so I don't really mind. If I do something and I'm unsure, I point it out and ask him to check my work after me to avoid any mistakes. But quite often I get ""well try a bit harder"" response. Which is quite hard without reference of how should it be done.

Payment is in cash. I have no idea how much money this guy makes from one project, and is really none of my business. However sometimes he tells me it's about 800-1000eur per project. Problem here is, once he sent me (probably by mistake) invoice for one project for 1350eur, while saying we'd earn 1500 from this project and one other. It doesn't add up. And of course, I feel used.

I was thinking of solutions and first one was to set my price for each part of the project. For example 100-150 for per part (heating, air conditioning, water), where each part would include calculations, drawings and inventory. Other solution would be to ask for invoice and get percentage of payment he receives. 

Real problem here is I wouldn't like any conflict, but it seems it's quite inevitable. That extra money helps me a lot for paying for my master's. Additionally work is great considering there isn't much time pressure and I can work when I have time (I also have full time job). It's also great opportunity to learn something new and get experience, so one day I can do that on my own (but first I need to finish my master's and one special exam to be able to work on projects by myself).

I recently just finished my masters in mechanical engineering at a well known university in Canada after doing a bachelors in mechanical engineering in the UK. I finished that one back in 2016. The job search is rough, which I’m sure you guys are all aware of and I’m not sure if that’s what is making me think this way but I might be regretting doing ME at all.

I enjoy the subject and I’m good at the knowledge/work behind being a mechanical engineer. However, I find that the job market has been horrible in the countries I’ve lived in in Europe, Africa and North America. When I mean horrible, I mean just for ME. There seems to be a mismatch of what employers would be looking for and what university taught me. Because of that, I haven’t been able to practice the skills I learned in university. Additionally the jobs that I have obtained previously, it seems like any background from STEM could do those jobs. I have found it difficult to find a job which actually uses the core ME skills and those that I did find were insanely competitive.

Part of me wonders if I’d have been better off doing another degree instead like Civil, software or CS. Maybe it’s the job hunt bumming me out and seeing a crazy amount of software developer jobs in my area despite the downturn. But yeah, this post is a slight rant at my situation and I think the regret stems mainly from not being able to practice what I have learned.

I have about 5 years of work experience split into 4 different companies full time while finishing my degree part-time (7 years total from start to finish, 25yo now).

I worked very hard in EE and honestly loved it, I had great experiences early on, spent probably close to $20k buying equipment like scopes, PS etc to get a really good lab at home for hobby work and contracting.

I loved it but recently I want to go more into software engineering since I see the world moving in that direction (the salary definitely is).

75,Technician Looking for Electrical Help,1590004301,"Hoping to get some answers to some electrical questions. I have researched but can't find clear answers. If anyone can answer any of these questions that would be great.

I am a technician, and work with electrical systems daily, these are questions I have regarding scenarios I run into.

Question #1: Most of the cables I am looking at will be connecting a controller to some sort of actuator, solenoid or sensor. The pins might be labeled something like 12v+ and ground. So when I’m evaluating this schematic, can I treat those two pins like battery leads? Or do I need to account for the internal circuitry? I have looked at the internal circuitry and it is way beyond my knowledge levels.

Question #2: Fairly often I’ll be dealing with switches. A lot of the time a switch will be closed between a 12v or 5v source directly back to the controller signal ground pin in order to tell the controller to do some function. The crux of the matter is that there doesn’t seem to be a load on this circuit. Doesn’t Kirchhoff's voltage law dictate there must be a voltage drop around this circuit? How are we not shorting things out?

Question #3: This one is dumb, but it’s about Ohms Law. Some solenoids require, say, 2 amps of current to operate. So is the supply of these 2 amps purely dependent on the voltage applied across it, as in I=V/R? If we hook up a 12 volt car battery to that bad boy does that accomplish the same as any other 12v source? Can you just measure the resistance, plug it into the formula and say “here's how many volts we need”?

Question #4: Some outputs from the controller will be labeled “5v 50mA” or something along those lines. How can you have a predetermined current output for a specified voltage? Wouldn't Ohm's law dictate that the current is dependent on the resistance of the circuit, which is as of yet unknown?

Question #5: What’s the difference between power ground and signal ground?

Question #6: I vaguely understand Pulse Width Modulation to be a % work cycle of the period of a DC signal in order to produce a lesser equivalent voltage (generally to a  solenoid in my case). How can we measure this with a multimeter? If we measure this voltage with a standard DMM are we just going to see 12v, since that is technically the difference in electrical potential during the work cycle?

For smaller projects we have just used heating elements \[like this\]( [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0725/3709/products/aquarium-heater-titanium-heater-viaaqua-20297239240\_600x.jpg?v=1491271814](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0725/3709/products/aquarium-heater-titanium-heater-viaaqua-20297239240_600x.jpg?v=1491271814)) intended for large aquariums/small ponds along with some sort of circulation to distribute the heat. But depending on the waste stream the water directly in contact with the element can get too hot, ""baking"" certain waste constituents onto the element and fouling it, often irreparably.

&amp;#x200B;

First off I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit, but considering it's an engineering project I thought this might be a good place to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: some students at my school have banded together to build a reusable sounding rocket that can reach 100km.  As of right now this is, for all intents and purposes, independent.  Not part of any club nor part of the school.  I just finished up my first year in college, currently aiming for mechanical engineering, and I thought this might be a good way to get some kind of experience that I could put on my resume.  We're a small team, about 20 students of varying skill levels, without any professors yet.  I'm very well aware that this is a really lofty goal, but it's a project I'm interested in working on seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

The real meat of my question is based on my observation that the student who is currently leading the project appears to be far too optimistic about everything, to the point of being unrealistic.  This leader does not expect that there will need to be many, if any, design changes over the course of the project, and fully expects to go from our current position of rough ideas and numbers to an accomplished goal by 2022.  I kind of expected they would show that kind of optimism when recruiting people, but now it just seems like that is what they really expect from this project.  Some others have been showing the calculations to explain that there's a lot of work to be done, but the response from this leader has been more or less dismissive and self-sure.  

&amp;#x200B;

How do I confront this?  Now that I'm writing it it seems less and less like an engineering question, but I think I can confidently assume that some of you have seen this sort of thing before.  Between my lack of authority, the risk of discouraging people with the scale of the project, and respect for the leader's position, I don't really know what to do other than just leave the project and look for something else to do.

I also don't believe I would be paid similarly at many companies without a change in education. The best I've gotten offered outside from this current job is about $20/hour. It isn't terrible, but it isn't quite $27 or higher. 

I'm hoping to pay my way through most of the rest of school, and my employer offers reimbursement benefits for some of it as long as it's related. ($3k per year) 

My current options: 

1. Mechanical Engineering Distance @ the University of North Dakota

2. Computer Science online @ the University of North Dakota

3. Industrial Engineering Technology online @ Kennesaw State University 

To my knowledge, all three programs are ABET accredited; technically the CS degree falls under an odd umbrella, because the UND site says it's ABET, but it appears only on campus on the ABET site and that degree is 100% online. (However, I do believe ABET isn't as important for CS.) 

The degrees are most expensive for me in the order I listed; ME will take me about 100 credits from where I am now + some travel, CS is only around 60 credits I believe. Both are at $640/credit hour. The IET degree is only about $200/credit hour which is a lot better, but I've seen that ET can limit you a bit more with regard to salary and prospects. 

I'm conflicted, because Mechanical Engineering sounds the sexiest to me, but an extra 40 credits at $640/credit over the Comp Sci has me turned off. I am also trying to be realistic in that I have no experience working as an engineer, so the daily life might be less exciting than the material, which may not be worth it for a similar salary to Comp Sci. 

Comp Sci also sounds cool in its own way. While not covering the same material as ME, there are parts of CS that interest me as well. I am not very experienced in coding yet, however, so that's something to also consider. 

The IET degree is also attractive mostly for the sticker price, but I worry that if I go for that degree, my upward mobility won't be quite as good. 

Sorry if this all seems like a mess! I'm trying to balance everything in my decision. I want work that will keep me interested enough, while also make me a decent sum. The ME sounds the best, probably only a bit over CS but still sounds a bit better, but I also don't want to be trapped in paying for school that long either.",AskEngineers,False,Schrodenheimer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gndrsr/options_for_online_programs_mech_engineering_vs/

96,Catching up on electronics for as a MechE,1589985747,"Hi guys,

I'm currently a MechE student hoping to go for a Masters in Mechatronics (I'm in Germany where a masters is basically mandatory) and am wondering how I can try to beef up my circuit skills to somewhat match that of an EE/Mechatronics undergrad. I'm pretty sure I'll be taking lots of EE classes in my masters so I don't want to find myself in a situation where I'm lacking basic knowledge expected of an actual EE undergrad. Obviously I won't be choosing the hardcore EE classes like IC design and the sorts, but rather things related to Mechatronics/Robotics.

I did take two semesters of circuits where we skimmed over DC, AC, electric motors and power electronics but the lecturer was unfortunately terrible and what I've learned hasn't really stuck...

My current plan is linearly work through the book ""Practical Electronics for Inventors"" by Paul Scherz and find problem sets online to accompany the learning. I'm aware of the EE bible ""The Art of Electronics"" already, but I am under the impression it's not a book you work through, but rather a reference book.

Tl;dr I broke a brushless motor in my impact driver and want to replace it with another one which isnt 'locked in' to milwaukee kit. Pleass help me to work out what size motor i need? 😀

I have a Milwaukee M18 fuel 3/4 inch impact driver (2764-20) and all was going well. I am using it in a robot (robot wars style) to create lots of torque to drive a lead screw to do crushing things. I therefore wanted to get rid of the push trigger and use relays to operate the impact driver. This all worked lovely, but to change spin direction a reset pin needed to go to ground (all worked out from trial and error). I was then unlucky (not careful) enough to connect the 18v to the wrong bit, which was at 3.5v and now the ECU in the drill has given up (TIFU). After trying to bring it back to life and make it spin again, the magic smoke escaped from the brushless motor and now I have an expensive paperweight that will never spin again 😞.
I would like to replace the brushless motor, but the milwaukee one wont work without genuine batteries and all sort of other gubbins which reduces reliability, so i want to get a generic motor (brushless or brushed) of a similar power rating. How can I work this out, or just estimate it, to work out what replacement motor to get?

I am a new reddit user as an engineer friend has turned me onto this group as a way to do some more research as I entertain the idea of becoming an engineer. I am currently a High School Teacher with a Bachelors in Math but very often find myself wanting something else. I have always been someone who loves to build things, solve problems, and work with my hands. Is there anyone else who has made the jump to engineering with a Bachelors in math and what was your story?

The internet is great for finding information but I thrive on conversation and especially face to face communication, however with the current situation of the world and a broken leg I am soaking up the internet which is great but also has its difficulties.

I am currently pondering the idea of a career in engineering or in the energy sector or somewhat of a combination of the two.

My biggest unanswered question is how easy is it to get into the engineering career with just a Math Degree? I am more than willing to go back to school for a masters but am curious as to how possible it is with just a math bachelors.",AskEngineers,False,Mr06Sierra,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gmxxc5/tips_and_tricks_to_jump_from_a_teaching_career/

50,Am I a bad employee or just not used to Consulting?,1589915066,"Hey AskEngineers! I'm an Engineering consultant and the job comes with a lot of variety, which can be a double-edged sword because it's nteresting work but a volatile workload. Documentation, excellent work quality, and transparency are stressed highly at my job. This has been challenging but good for growth. 

My gripe is that, at times, I feel like project managers want to have their cake and eat it too. I am required to track every hour I spend and bill it accordingly (which is fine, I get the consulting work style). Whenever a task takes longer than expected due to a PM error (underestimating the task's scope or underbudgeting time) there is little accountability for them and I often find myself having to be flexible with my other work/personal time to accommodate this (often to receive just a brief thank you). However, if something takes longer due to an error on my part (inefficient methods, an error I need to correct) there is a high level of scrutiny and negative feedback. Both of these situations (my fuck ups and PM fuck ups) often lead to a micromanaging scenario for the rest of the project. I understand this is part of the job and value the learning experience but it gets exhausting over time. 

In short, I feel that I'm having to cover for both mine and the PM's fuck ups and I'm the only one with someone breathing down my neck at the end of the day. I'm curious if any of you have experience with this and any recommendations for my situation. I think it's a result of my company's culture (essentially our brand is ""excellence"", i.e. almost never an error in a work product).

70,Balancing pressure and vacuum in a mask for breathing. How best to manage this?,1589901216,"My SO is a dentist. Because of this pandemic, she's being really cautious about returning to work, but we have a plan. Obviously dental patients can't wear a mask, and drilling/etc in a mouth creates an aerosol, so the risk of patients infecting staff is very high. We are going to engineer a full-face mask using one of the [full face snorkel mask with an external supply](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-QDqMdQVL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) (and maybe return).

These masks have a supply that comes in from the top through the eyes section, then a simple one-way valve into the mouth section, then back out the top. There's only one valve (between the eyes and the mouth). So the pathway is already segregated.

Dental offices run both pressure and suction lines into the rooms (I'm not sure the settings on either, but neither should matter).

I've 3D printed an adaptor with a 1/4"" NPT fitting and thrown a pressure regulator on the supply side. Even with a cheap pressure regulator I can tune it fairly well. 

The obvious issue is that the positive pressure pulls the mask off the face (although this may not be a horrible thing since it's positive pressure), which is not preferred. I don't have a way to test suction (I'm just using my household air compressor for supply). I'm a tad worried about the suction side since I could see the mask being suctioned to the face and the air sucked out of the lungs if the pressure isn't equalized (although I think I can mitigate this). I'm thinking of skipping the suction side entirely (we could throw a filter on the outlet and it would be comparable to a mask over the mouth).

I've considered adding some kind of bag on the inlet side to act as a buffer (although I'd prefer to skip this since it's another point of failure). I'll also be adding some pressure adjustability near the mask (maybe just a sliding piece that will cover/uncover vent holes), so the incoming pressure can be tuned just a bit.

Is there something I'm missing here? Is there an easier way of going about this? Are there safety measures that I should be looking into (note the compressor will be the same as the one used for patients, so no oil, etc). Is there value to connecting up the vacuum side (I tried creating a venturi-based vacuum generator near the mask, but it's way too loud).",AskEngineers,False,GoodBadBot,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gmqft5/balancing_pressure_and_vacuum_in_a_mask_for/

The only solution I can come up with alone is to cut the tubing and somehow make them connect, perhaps via tape? This might not be 100% effective though (since the insulin won't pass), and I don't want to cut it without being sure. What tape like substance would work in this situation, if there is inded any possible way to make the ends match.

95,Normally OPEN solenoid valve on suction side of pump,1589859961,"Engineers, please read!

Howdy, looking for an answer to an odd irrigation set up, thought I’d try here! Been racking my brain.

I have a multi-station controller feeding 12 sprinkler gangs with a jet pump drawing from multiple different stock tanks that are on specific watering schedules. I have a 12 port manifold before AND after the pump, with solenoid valves on either end wired in parallel to properly suck from its tank and dispense to its respective gang (with negligible mixing between runs). 1 inch piping everywhere. The controller is commercial and will sustain the amount of valves I am running on the same station as well as a master valve.

Upon doing this I realized that after the solenoids shut, the pump remained on for a time and pressurized its discharge line and top manifold, sucking from a closed system, inevitably in MY system sucking in air bubbles through a leak somewhere. 

So I installed a NORMALLY OPEN solenoid valve on the suction side to act as an automatic priming valve, wired in as the Master Valve. Hoping it would remain open to allow suction when charging the top manifold, yet closed while drawing from each stock tank and pushing to the proper station gang.

What I’m finding is the normally open solenoid valve isn’t engaging... so I looked into the difference in Direct Acting solenoids and Pilot Solenoids. Since i have 1” pilot valves I’m assuming this means I need pressure on the inlet side of my NO valve in order for it’s closing function to work properly? Is this the same for the normally closed valves on the lower manifold before the pump in my system? Am I even able to have solenoid valves on the suction side of a water pump system?

The small company I work at is great and there is many enjoyable things to work there, but my department has a very high turnover rate and has very poorly documented processes, procedures and (software) tools. As the turnover is very high and they seem to hire newbies and often get more experienced personal as short hour contract only, the pool of knowledge is shallow. 

I've been doing okay there as my interest and motivation has been high, but I've basically been given very little training and there's no one that actually understands anything well, a lot of my questions come back with a high level answer of what result is required when I need information on the process of how to produce it. I feel I ask a lot of very succinct fundamental questions that end up being answered ""just do this"" or ""check project X"". A lot of the tools required have little to no internal documents or information, a lot of code with no comments that's very messy and is barely reusable, it's always said we will improve these but we only add more clutter.

I'm starting to get very demotivated at work which makes me sad, we are continuing contribute to the problems I mentioned and I don't feel I'm progressing at a rate I'm satisfied with. I have high expectations of my work and progression and have a lot to learn in the industry and potentially in the company, but it's just like drawing blood from a stone and I'm getting burnt out, but not from the actual work from all the hastle getting in the way.

3,Approximate output of a pressurized solar still for water desalination?,1589850454,"Can anyone estimate if this contraption would work and what would be the fresh water output? 

Given a 1000 liter plastic black water tank, we place it on it's side and gravity-feed it salt water from the top along the entire length of the container at a rate where it rolls down the sides of the container. Because of high temperature inside and direct contact with hot surface of the container it evaporates and creates positive vapor pressure inside the tank. That pressure is let out through the tube in the the middle of the container and the concentrated brine is collected at the bottom. Both water vapor and brine go through a heat exchanger to heat up the incoming salt water. That also allows the water vapor to quickly condense. Ideally the rate of incoming/outgoing water would be regulated by the pressure inside the tank, so there would be no moving parts.

The input is then salt water and the output is fresh water and concentrated brine, the last two having the same temperature as the incoming salt water as it'd ideally transfer all heat into incoming salt water in the heat exchanger. 

For a container of that size, what would be the expected fresh water output on a hot day?

I hadn't given this serious thought, instead mused about becoming a software developer or starting a business of some sort. Both options are on the table but I'm still considering other options. As a related note, I also often see a lot of advice to take a break. Right now I'm taking roughly a year break traveling the country in an RV which is giving me time to clear my head and really think through what I do and don't like.

I enjoyed engineering in school. I like problem solving, working with people, generally I like people. I would like to have more interaction with people than I had at my last engineering job. What I don't like are the politics, unrealistic schedules and budgets, dealing with multiple PMs that believe they're all top priority, rankings, being required to work standard hours with no work from home or other general flexibility. 

I like talking to people and I enjoy technical conversations and problem solving. I have a couple salesmen I've worked with recently that I have spent a significant portion of time working with. I have been thinking more and they are home based but are on the road a lot, something I would prefer over working in a cube/office. I would prefer to be home most nights but have no issue with occasional travel, within the US or internationally.

I have some concerns as well. For starters, frequently conversations in engineering involve sports. I don't give a rats ass about sports. I have my hobbies that I'm willing to discuss and generally do well at getting others to talk but sports require so much time to learn all the players and I just don't care. Is this an issue? I also don't golf, not sure if that is an issue but it certainly seems less important in this day and age. I'm not huge on public speaking but have been doing larger presentations and don't think I'd have much an issue giving lunch and learn time presentations. Presenting at a conference would be a bigger issue but that's a skill I can gain with time and practice.

Anyone have an opinion on whether I would be a good fit to go into sales at this point?

I also see application engineer as a similar but more technical career path. I'm much less interested but would consider if someone could sell me on it.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a Mechanical Engineer in training with a passion for improvement and a proven rack record of creating innovative solutions to unique and challenging problems. I am looking for an exciting new career opportunity and I believe that my strong set of core values and skills, as well as my focused and solutions-driven attitude will make me a positive addition to your team. 


Over the last 3 years I have been working on the product development team for Science Company, a manufacturer of scientific instruments. This position requires me to conduct thoughtful and precise analysis on information related to the development of new designs and methodologies and apply this analysis to create solutions within rapid design cycles. Due to the small size of Science Company and my large personal goals, I have fortunately been given the opportunity to adapt and work on a wide variety of technical and non-technical problems. These problems can vary from the failure analysis of key mechanical components and assemblies to the detailed development of project schedules and plans. 


As someone with a strong attention to detail and a demonstrated ability to solve problems I am excited for the opportunity to apply to this position. Thank you for taking the time to review my application and I look forward to hearing from you.

33,Thread Strength Calculations and Design,1589826174,"I'm working on some calculations for an M6x0.75 fine thread where the bolt will need to be preloaded around 5 kN.

Some of my questions:

1. The bolt and nut material will be the same, does that mean that I don't need to do a shear calculation on the nut threads? I believe the shear area is larger due to the geometry alone. To support that I quickly looked at the [bolt](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metric-bolts-minimum-ultimate-tensile-proof-loads-d_2026.html) and [nut](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metric-nut-proof-load-d_2029.html) proof loads for a matching grade and size and the nut is quite a bit stronger.
2. How is the proof load measured for those tables? For the bolt test is there a standard profile nut but of a much higher grade to ensure the beginning of plastic deformation is on the bolt?
3. Same question as 2 but how is the nut tested? Standard nut with a high grade bolt?
4. I'm assuming that proof load data is for standard thickness nuts. This matters because the packaging space for my nut is limited, ideally a low profile, 3.2 mm thick nut can be used.
5. Part of the problem I'm having is that an M6x0.75 doesn't seem to have proof load data I can find online, however if I plot the proof load vs nominal tensile stress area of that fine thread bolt data it's basically linear, implying to me that the threads are strong enough and the failure is tension in the bolt (which should be for proper design as I understand). This kind of tells me I should be able to extrapolate proof load vs tensile area of the fine thread data down to the equivalent M6x0.75 (data ends at M8 fine thread) nominal tensile stress area for a rough proof load.
6. If I follow [this](https://www.engineersedge.com/thread_strength/thread_bolt_stress_area_iso.htm) external thread shear calculation even a thread engagement length of 2 mm gives a shear stress of only about 289 MPa. If I take the shear-to-tensile ratio as 0.57 the tensile proof strength needs to be 289/0.57 = 507 MPa. If I take the proof strength to be 0.9 of the yield strength the min yield strength needs to be 507/0.9 = 563 MPa. I would say a grade 8.8 would be strong enough (about 640 MPa yield). However, 2 mm is not even 3 fully engaged threads, and well below the rule of thumb about thread engagement being 1xNominal Diameter. There's also a tid bit [here](https://roymech.org/Useful_Tables/Screws/Thread_Calcs.html) regarding thread load distribution: ""A study (see link 2 below) has established that for a typical grade 8 nut the percentage of the load taken by consecutive threads are about 34%, 23%, 16%,11%,9%, 7% ..."" What is the number of threads that should be engaged? Less than 3 seems like a bad design. A standard 5 mm nut for an M6x075 would tell me I probably want about 6 threads, which follows closer to the 1xNominal Diameter thread engagement rule.

I've never done thread calculations so any input would help greatly. I'm going back and forth with another engineer, I'm pushing for better thread engagement but need to support it more.",AskEngineers,False,truije15,/r/AskEngineers/comments/gm7050/thread_strength_calculations_and_design/

I have been a long time advocate of modular design in many of the things we use, may that be a phone, a computer, I've even seen designs for modular homes floating about the web.

But, I was watching one of my YouTube subs where a guy asked the question: How modular should something be? In which case he was referring to the design of a specific MacBook and how certain components like the memory are soldered directly to the board. 

But that got me thinking, at what point do we draw the line and say what's modular and what's not? I mean provided you have the skills, practically anything is modular. A computer motherboard might not be ""modular"" for the end user, but if you're good at soldering, you can replace the onboard components like the chips, the caps, etc - does that then make that board modular, but only for those with the required proficiencies? 

Because to me, it seems like the definition of modular widens as people become more skilled and knowledgeable with the devices they use every day. An end user might call a replaceable phone battery, or a changeable car tire modular, but a skilled engineer might say that even apex seals on a rotary could be replaced with the proper equipment. It might seem like I'm drifting all over the place, but I'm just trying to give examples from different areas.

Which brings me to my final point, which is to ask what level of involvement should producers of goods have in modular design? Should things be produced so that they are more modular for an end user, say being able to replace my phone's camera or speaker? Or, should people learn how to disassemble their devices and appliances so that more things become modular to them?

52,Discussion on Electric airplanes with staging,1589812647,"I have an idea for boosting the range of electric planes. As of today the major challenge of electric planes is the energy density of batteries \[Wh/kg\].

Take off requires far more energy than high-alt cruising  and landing. Therefore: **Maybe a solution could be staging  (like rockets)?** I am imagining some big electric booster at each airport  which sole purpose is to lift the airplane above 30k feet  (+ some  horizontal speed). The booster could (perhaps) completely drain its  battery as its propellers could recharge the batteries while it's  falling back down. The booster could also direct energy to the  propellers of the airplane on ascent.

Then  the airplane(motor, propellers, body etc) could be optimized to be  efficient and fast at high altitudes. This is not the case for regular  planes as it should fly decently at all altitudes.

Electric motors are probably much cheaper to build and maintain than jet engines. Lighter too. But batteries are expensive and heavy.

54,Are hiring managers going to be more forgiving?,1589811382,"Good morning, so I had a couple of questions.  First though a little background is necessary.  I have a Mech. E. degree that I got 5 years ago.  Since then I've had 3 jobs as a manufacturing engineer, and I'm a year into an MBA program at the moment.  I was let go from my last job back in late February, unfortunately this was right at the start of the pandemic, but I've been searching ever since.  What I'm wondering is how forgiving are hiring managers going to be about this period of unemployment?  With the way the job market is I could see potentially being unemployed for 6 months and in the past this has been career killing if you have nothing to show during that period.  

The other question I have is what more can I be doing on my end?  I've been told I interview rather well, I have a pretty good resume, and like I mentioned I'm in the middle of an MBA program.  In addition to that I'm currently pursuing a six sigma green belt(I'm halfway through the handbook), I'm working on my own to relearn matlab, and I'm hoping after that to learn how to work with PLC controllers.

 I've tried googling etc but can't quite find what I'm after.

95,ADVICE... Engineering or Vet School????,1589747669,"Hi, I'm a Canadian student from Ontario who is heading to university this coming fall. So I have narrowed down my offers to the following: McMaster Eng, uOttawa Biomedical/Mechanical Eng, and Biomedical Science and Guelph. I want to pursue vet school but I am worried that if I don't get in I will be stuck in the life science endless schooling system. 

If I go into engineering I know I will have a well paying job after only UG and be pretty content. I am naturally good at math but do have trouble visualizing some of the scenarios in physics. Regardless, I have shown through high school that I am able to put in the work and pull out with a slightly above average grade. 

For vet school I will need to have a 91% average (not sure what that is in gpa). I do get good grades in bio but I'm not sure it that's because of high school grade inflations or my actual understanding of the content. A bio UG is not applied which scares me because I know I will go into further debt in order to get a job that I could've have with engineering. 

I am further worried that this constant voice telling me 'what if I chose the other option' will haunt me through UG and I will feel unmotivated to achieve the grades I need. 

I already accepted my offer to Guelph but have until June 1st to change it. I just wanted to reserve my spot at Guelph since the program only takes 100 students. My backup plan had been to assess my grades after second year and if I don't have what I need then switch into engineering because my chances of getting into vet school would be very low. However, now I am thinking about the time and money lost in doing so. And if I were to switch into engineering, how much more competitive will it be for me to get the same offer at McMaster or uOttawa in 2-3 years when I am considered a mature student. 

Any advice? Has anyone gone through something similar and would be willing to share their experience? It would make me feel a whole lot better because my friends and family are getting quite sick of me being so indecisive. 

I spent a really long time trying to think of which career I would be happier in. The thing is, I think I would be happy in both. I am the type of person who likes to see results and will change the way I do things to get results, but as previously mentioned, I don't know if the stress and debt with vet school is enough motivation. 

I'm not sure if this is relevant but my average for both engineering and bio works out to a 91.3.",AskEngineers,False,kellykraftdinner,/r/AskEngineers/comments/glmt2p/advice_engineering_or_vet_school/

My background consists of robotics, homebuilt planes, and high power cars/motorcycles. I always wrench on whatever project I can find. When my prof started talking about cubicles and glorifying them, I got really depressed. Are there any jobs that will keep me in the field and away from cubicles?

98,Need help with a dynamics (?) problem for a personal project?,1589746550,"So I have the body as shown in the image that is supposed to stay upright while accelerating vertically. The body is NOT fixed. The problem is forces like winds can throw it off center and cause the object to rotate. To counter this, the force F is applied to create a torque and align the body with the blue vertical. However, this force F also drives the body up vertically. 

My question is, since this body isn't fixed like in statics, how do I know what angle the force F must be applied at to center the body, assuming F is constant? Also, I should note that the line of force F acts through a point below the CG called C.P. Finally, the angle of deviation between body centerline and the blue vertical is known as ""A"".

I know DiffEq. and statics, barely any dynamics. My issue with this problem is the fact that the entire body is moving and so appliying a torque would probably require taking C.G, and thus inertia into account. Furthermore, the torque is applied over time so I would assume that the angle would need to be constantly updated to prevent overrotation.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I dont necessarily need an answer. I just need to know  what process I would go through to find a solution - probably using MATLAB. (yes i know its hard, but as long as it isnt impossible or I dont need a PhD, I can try to look through a few books and determine some mathematical equations. I want to try this for a personal project) 

To add to that, sorry if this is long or hard to read, I've been staring at aero PDFs for a few days now and my eyes hurt.
