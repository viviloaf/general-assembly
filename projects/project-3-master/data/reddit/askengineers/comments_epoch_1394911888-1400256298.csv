Some alternative names for this are climate engineering, environmental engineering and planetary engineering. 


I am especially interested in why some projects are more popular than others. I know some of the bias is due to cost and perceived likelyhood of success, but are there other reasons too?

Looking further into the matter it turns out that spent fuel rods put off heat and radioactivity that can cause the water to split into oxygen and hydrogen.

If we have these spent fuel rods that put off all this heat and create hydrogen gas, and they do this for years after they are used, why isn't that energy put to work, for example using thermocouples to capture the energy differential, or by letting the water boil in a controlled manner to spin a turbine?

On a similar note, why do they use water to store the spent fuel rods? Mercury is a liquid, and it is denser, so presumably it would block more radiation, and it boils at a much higher temperature, so less cooling would be necessary.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/25njsz/why_isnt_energy_recovered_from_spent_nuclear/

Due to a buildup of dust in the headphone plug of my old iPod Touch, the audio started to get screwed up. I think the dust was physically separating the conductors, because the problem was binary--either okay or screwed up, depending on how the jack was turned.

What's interesting is how it was screwed up. The first thing to notice was that the music sounded very tinny--definitely no low frequencies, and a bit of distortion. But that wasn't all of it. In most songs with male vocalists, the vocals were completely absent (or nearly so), while most instruments could still be heard. This is strange--could it merely be due to the frequencies which were omitted? I was particularly struck by [this song](http://youtu.be/WG7Dwa4YSGY?t=2m40s), at 2:40--the guitar was mostly eliminated, while the (seemingly lower-pitched) horns remained. 

Additionally, there was a bit of staticky-sounding reverb in many songs, and I can't understand how a simple poor connection would cause the sound to be spread out temporally.

27,Making an ROV and need a little help (mostly ECE),1400119112,"As the title implies, I’m designing my own ROV (remotely operated vehicle). I’ve already started ordering some parts to make sure I commit to this project, but I do have a few questions so instead of winging it, maybe you guys could be of some assistance! I’ll try to stay as organized as possible.


**Overview(skipable):** I’ve done quite a bit of research for the past month and have developed a Simple MARK I design. Almost identical to [this](http://www.electronics-lab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/rov.jpg). Except the side thrusters will be more centered and the vertical thruster (not shown) should be about dead center. I’m keeping a logbook of the plans, with changes and other ideas for later upgrades, but at the moment I need a proof of concept vehicle. Once I’m finished I’ll be sure to post the building and results, maybe even some pics and videos from the depths!


**Design Details:** ROV will be run off a car battery or one similar. Initial planning is to have analog control system for the thrusters. Front acrylic dome will house a camera that will send a live feed to the surface monitor. Everything runs off batteries as to maintain freedom of exploration. Tether will include non-elastic rope, power line and Ethernet cable. Before anyone answers with this suggestion, No I can’t use anything wireless, it permeates about 5 feet of water then dies, and I don’t want a heavy battery on the ROV.

**Current Dilemmas:**

 1)webcam/live feed display *[largest issue]*

2)variable thrust 

3)Easy connect/disconnect of tether lines 

4)Dimmable LEDs 


**Dilemma Details** I’ll start with the goal then give some more info.
**1)**Goal is to display a live video feed for controlling the ROV, the video line needs to run down a 50ft cable to the display.  I need a good camera (prefer water proof but I won’t be picky since its inside the unit) and I need a way to then view that image. I first thought of using a laptop, but I’d need to buy a laptop and a webcam would need a super long USB cable, causing distortion and raised cost. Alternatively I’ve been looking into security cameras such as [this]( http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Surveillance-Security-Weatherproof-Resolution/dp/B001IB0X8Y/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400114764&amp;sr=8-13&amp;keywords=security+camera) that would connect with cables such as [this]( http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Video-Power-Security-Cameras/dp/B000P8X65S/ref=pd_bxgy_p_img_y). The issue I have with this setup is how to feed it to a monitor and power the camera.
My Final idea for the Camera was to find a webcam that could just be totally run off of an Ethernet cable to a laptop or monitor of some kind.
 For my MONITOR I’m looking into how I could power an old plug in flat computer monitor or perhaps just use  an old portable DVD player? 

*TL:DR how can I set up a live feed system powered off only a Batterie(s)?*

EDIT: i do have an old laptop with windows 95, the res is kinda bad but maybe i could use the screen?


**2)**Goal is to have [DC motors]( http://www.amazon.com/Traxxas-7075-Titan-Brushless-Motor/dp/B0027GGZYU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400112255&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=brushless+RC+motor) with a variable thrust so I can go slow or fast when needed, while keeping it all analog. The Car batt feeds down the tether to relays in the ROV that are turned on and off via a small input voltage. Only ideas I’ve had so far are to use dimmer switch for speed or sets of resistors on switches?  Anyone know a better way?

**3)**I’d prefer my tether line were detachable. I was thinking of having the ends of the lines being able to screw into the ROV with a small o-ring for a water tight seal. Any other ideas or suggestions?


**4)** The ROV needs lights, bright ones, but dimmable for different environmental conditions. LEDs are an obvious lower power choice but I’m not sure how to power and dim them off what I’d be using, I don’t want to put them in and then have them bust when I try to dim. Any help would be appreciated on this one since I have no clue.

28,Is Networking Engineering *really* engineering?,1400118237,"This is a serious post written in the hopes of inciting some creative discussion, please treat it as such.

This question has popped up amongst my peers frequently. It is a point of discussion and not of argument. I myself have been a Network Engineer for many years and also teach it, but I sometimes wonder whether I can truly label myself as such. True, I do design/build networks using machinery/devices which strictly speaking would label me an 'Engineer' by definition.


*1) The Nomenclature*

But, socially the term Engineer seems to imply that the person is a member of an established elite organisation. My father is a Civil/Structural Engineer and he studied many years and pays a fee to the Engineers Association to maintain his status as an Engineer. However, his field of engineering has been established for centuries, in which time associations have been created to ensure the quality and protect the sanctity of the label.

On the flip side, the field of Information and Communications Technology is relatively new. There are no associations which prohibit anyone with a basic certificate from labeling themselves a Network Engineer. Indeed, you don't even need a certification. You can just say you are a Network Engineer and no one can say otherwise (I am from Australia, I cannot speak on behalf of other countries).


*2) The Job*

Let's say you have earned your title of Network Engineer. You have attained a doctorate of some-such and are an absolute expert in the field. There is no dispute to your aptitude in the vocation. So, are you still considered an 'Engineer' in the social sense? Can you be compared to Structural, Mechanical, or even Electrical Engineers? or are you more of a glorified Network Guru?


Edit:  looks like I've hit a sore spot with some of you. Just to clarify, this is not an attack on the title or the right to hold it. Its just opening up a dialogue to see what others think. I teach net Eng at CISCO academy so the question of whether I, personally, am one isn't in play here.

30,I am currently a engineering student that is extremely worried about engineering jobs.,1400111829,"I am extremely worried nobody will want to hire me at all, or that I will be very very poor performance wise at a job.

Background: Decent academic skills, currently a senior with 1 semester left. 

I really feel like I've learned almost nothing. If someone where to come up to me and ask, ""how does a heat exchanger work?"" or ""Explain what a turbine does"", I am 100% sure I wouldn't be able to answer those basic questions. Most conceptual questions/ideas I would fail miserably at. I am worked up because I have a good feeling this is an indicator that I am screwed when it comes to the real world.
I'm worried that my work may ask something of me and I won't be able to do it. Or that I will be asked to recall something for example, how flow in a pipe(conceptually) works, and that I will not be able to articulate it or even understand the concept to begin with. Perhaps they will tell me to do something, but I will mess it up completely and get fired.

I am just worried, very worried that I will not be successful, let alone be able to function in a working environment.

31,For the civil engineers: Modern applications of platform mounds?,1400107815,"Hello Redditors,

I am a non-engineer with a question for the civil engineers here.  I realize my question may have a lot of variable due to state laws, local ordinances, etc., and that consulting with a local earth works firm may be my best bet, BUT I wanted to take my question to the Redditors first.

I am going to build an off-the-grid house in Florida.  I would like to utilize a [platform mound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_mound) like the indigenous people of this area used centuries ago for their homes; this way I will be protected from flooding.  But instead of a primitive house I will have a home with modern amenities.  The total amount of land on top of the mound that I need would be equivalent to one normal, suburban sized lot.  Or maybe one like [this](http://www.n-georgia.com/images/etowah-indian-mounds.jpg), or [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Town_Creek_Indian_Mound.JPG)

Will a platform mound support a foundation, and house, etc?  Is this thing sound enough to safely and permanently support a foundation and house?  Or am I barking up the wrong tree?

35,Engineer with ~3 years experience and a small particular eng degree and no job. Advice?,1400090647,"Don’t want to go into too many details, but the summary would be this:

Went back to school about 5 years later than everyone else.  Took a small, highly technical specialty (Engineering Science) because they promised jobs and the initial research I checked into showed a reasonable amount of employment opportunities.  Plus, I was interested. 

Live in an area now that is heavily oil and gas based.  Lots of jobs.  But it turns out if your resume doesn’t say “Mech E” or “Chem E” or “Pet E” (etc) they don’t really look at it because they have too many of those and they are filtering it through human resources algorithms and they just have a checklist.  

Ended up getting a job where I worked a ton of unpaid overtime for a startup for 2.5 years.  They were badly managed however (that is non-managed) and they ended up having to lay me off earlier this year after a bit of drama that I learned from.  I still have decent references from that time period.  Also, I did EVERYTHING in that company: process engineering, client/vendor stuff, Project Management, hands on design work, you name it.  So even though it was a shit show and I overworked myself, a ton of great experience.

So after being laid off, it seems that I am back to square one.  Not a lot of opportunities for people with my background.  Out of 600 crafted (yes) applications, I got one set of interviews that led to a fly out, and I lost to a Mech E because that is what they hire typically.  I’ve gotten about 60 rejection letters (my resume is very well done) saying that my qualifications are extremely impressive, but that they choose someone slightly more qualified.   From talking to people and looking into it I’m almost positive that it is because it says “Chem E (etc)” and despite all my courses and arguably even practical experience, I am not a Chem E or whatever other background they list first.

So I am getting a couple people recommending that I start going into oil and gas offices in nice clothes and asking to see an engineer.  I am just wondering if this is a good idea, and how someone might try it without seeming too desperate.  There is very little work here in the field that I have direct experience in (high tech work), and while I applied to a few jobs in other cities that matched me exactly, no response to speak of.  

My degree technically qualifies me to work in a number of fields.  It is one of the broadest available around the world, but it’s small and many people in industry haven’t heard of it.  I went to a large engineering headhunter firm for oil and gas, and spoke to a woman with 7 years experience, and she had no idea that my degree even existed.  It’s a little frustrating.  Most of the other people that I went to school with either got jobs through friends and family connections or got them through having the exact specialty that was needed for the position.  I’m sitting here with 20/20 hindsight a little bit.  

Just looking for some advice from some experienced people as to how to move forward.  My attitude is a little down at this point, but I love working and learning and I know I will pick up once I solve this.

 Anyways, I'm a student going into my second year of college trying to decide whether I want to study Electrical Engineering (EE) or Computer Engineering (CompE). I've heard conflicting things from the people I've talked to about the kinds of jobs that these fields go into. Some tell me to choose EE because it is broader than CompE, so a EE can get a CompE job but a CompE can't get a EE job, but I've also heard the opposite. I've also heard to only study CompE if I want to code all day, but CompE and Computer Science are completely different at my school. I wanted to hear from people that are actually in the industry what kinds of jobs they see people with EE and CompE degrees holding.

The gap between the trailer supports is 6 ft long.  I'd want to have about a foot overhang on each side.  Thus each bunk would be made up of two pressure treated 8 foot long 2x8s bolted to two metal brackets which would then be bolted to the frame.

**What is this post?**
***
/r/AskEngineers and other similar subreddits often receive questions from people looking for guidance in the field of engineering. Is this degree right for me? How do I become a ___ engineer? What’s a good project to start learning with? While simple at heart, these questions are a gateway to a vast amount of information.

Each Monday, I’ll be posting a new thread aimed at the community to help us answer these questions for everyone. Anyone can post, but the goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses will be compiled into a wiki for everyone to use and hopefully give guidance to our fellow upcoming engineers and hopefuls.
***

**Post Formatting**    

***

To help both myself and anyone reading your answers, I’d like if everyone could follow the format below. The example used will be my own.

Field: Electrical Engineering – RF Subsystems    
Specialization (optional): Attenuators    
Experience: 2 years

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become a Chemical Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be an ChemE. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you’ve worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We’ve gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. Just post whatever you feel is useful!

**TL;DR: ChemE’s, Why are you awesome?**

65,Busy work.,1399902788,I just started a summer internship in the industrial controls/automation industry. I have done all the training programs and courses the company required me to take and I have been asking for work to do. I will be starting work on a new project we just got hopefully within the next few days and I was wondering what I should do to keep myself busy. I don't want to continue pestering my boss 24/7 as he is the regional manager and has a lot on his plate as it is. This is a medium sized company and I am their first intern in this particular office so I am assuming having me here is new to them as well and would explain why my laptop isn't properly spec'd to run the software I need to do the job(new laptop is in the process of being shipped from our headquarters).

66,Chemistry Vs. Engineering (xpost from engineeringstudents),1399898454,"New to this reddit, hopefully this belongs here because I was looking for some in the industry insight.

In short.

My friend is graduating this month with an AAS in Mechanical Engineering. Problem is at the community college level all of his classes were Algebra based so if he wants a bachelors as an ME he will be a freshman again. 

He doesn't wanna repeat all the same classes just utilizing calc. He wants to learn something fresh.

His passion is to do materials testing so I recommended he try Chemistry with a minor in Materials Science. Combined with his MechE associates I believe that will help him.


Any other paths you can suggest? 

Did I suggest a good path for him?

Help?

Thanks :)

68,I'm building a machine to press a textured plate into a soft metal plate by dropping a weight onto them from a height. How to calculate height/weight to generate 5000 psi?,1399891367,"Hello, engineers! I'm doing some backyard tinkering. I am trying to work out the feasibility of building a simple machine to generate 5000 psi in order to press a textured metal plate into a soft metal plate to leave an imprint for decorative purposes. Usually this is done with a big press that can generate 5000 psi over an area of about 5 square inches. Alas, I can't get one. I plan to drop a metal weight from a height (guided on tubular metal rails) to make the impression.

**How do I calculate the combination of drop height and weight needed to exert 5000 PSI over a 5""x5"" metal plate?** Would anyone know the formula needed so I can plug values in to these, including a variable plate size (e.g. 10x10, 20x20)? I intend to make some tables showing practical heights and weights for 5x5, 10x10 and maybe 20x20 plate sizes. I can handle the mathematics, but I'm just not sure of the right formula for impact pressure and how to combine this with impact velocity.

71,Pressure drop in a water filled pipe,1399858797,"Hi all, I've been looking at the quality of some crimped pipe joints for domestic water systems and the potential for leaks. These are basically meant to be a quicker and easier alternative to copper piping, with PVC or similar pipes joined by crimp joints rather than brazing and welding. Much easier and could save a lot of hassle.

I've heard a few claims that they can leak, and I'm not sure if this is due to a problem with the product or if they had been installed incorrectly, so I've been doing a bit of testing to see if I can observe anything myself, and have noticed something which seems a little odd.

I've put together a simple pipe assembly with a few joints and a couple of valves at each end. I pump water in to high pressure (1500kPa), close both ends, and leave it for a while to see if it leaks or bursts. So far I have not noticed any leaks. But the pressure drops, noticeably and dramatically over time, and can get to under 500kPa overnight.

I was checking the pressure as a way to detect leaks, but with no observed leaks I think the pressure must come from expansion of the pipe. This is supported by the fact that simple PVC pipes show a much faster pressure drop than pipes with internal metal reinforcing. 

My question is, if this is the case, that would suggest a (minor) change in the internal volume of the pipes. But with water being essentially incompressible, how does it continue to fill this extra volume? Would there be a change of state for some small amount of the water, or would the minuscule compressibility of water be matched by minuscule pipe expansion?

I'm sure I'm overlooking something extremely basic here, but my rusty memory of this stuff tells me the pipe will expand, and water is incompressible, and that these two things don't match.

For background, I'm reloading my own ammunition and testing the accuracy of the loads.  To do this you get the load information for the type of cartridge you are loading from a load manual.  The manual will give you the minimum and maximum amount of powder to load for the type and weight of bullet you are firing.  In this case it was a .224 inch diameter, 55 grain weight, full metal jacket (copper jacketed lead bullet) shot out of a 16"" barrel with a twist rate of 1 revolution every 7 inches.  The target is at 25 yards. 

If you look at [picture](http://i.imgur.com/h9I20mR.jpg) in the post you can see there are 3 tests.  Starting at the left you have bullets fired with 25.3 grains of powder, 26.3 grains and finally 27 grains.  The estimate of the velocity at 25.3 grains is 3203 feet per second.  The rough estimate of the velocity at 27 grains is around 3250 FPS.  You can see swirl marks on right target and none on the left target.  The hypothesis from some of the guys in that sub for those swirl marks is that the bullet is breaking apart and that is leaving a mark on the target.  While it seems very possible that the bullet could break apart at that velocity and RPM, I would think that the bullet would disintegrate before every reaching the target and you would just have fragments (if anything) hitting the target.  If this is lead on the target it almost looks like it is particlized (is that a word?) or vaporized.  Is that possible?  Could the bullet be spinning so fast that the lead inside the copper jacket could break through and spray out and mark the target?  Woudn't the bullet just break into tiny pieces and spread out due to centrifugal force?

**EDIT:  Thanks guys.  I think I'm with you on the unburnt powder hypothesis.  This is rifle powder so it burns at a relatively slow rate (compared to a powder designed for a pistol cartridge).  I think that the higher load of powder isn't getting a complete burn by the time it comes out of the barrel. I'm going to do a few more tests by shooting at a longer distance and see if there are any differences in the target.  If anyone is interested I'll post an update.** ",AskEngineers,NoDihedral,/r/AskEngineers/comments/252wjj/materials_engineers_are_the_forces_on_a_spinning/

* In my lasers course I talked about tunable semiconductor lasers, how they work compared to single frequency lasers (DFB, DBR, etc...), and what their applications were in the FOCS industry.

* In my capstone, I talked about a system I helped design with other members of my team.



I want to use the third option because I can talk about how I worked with members in a team and how we worked together to achieve a goal however I don't think the project I was assigned was impressive enough compared to other group projects (we had to design an HD video surveillance system. It felt like we just sourced hardware and could have been done by one person in about a month) while other groups had really impressive projects that were much involved with actual circuit design, programming, and other hard work (brain activity monitors, GPS tracking collars, gesture controlled video game).

I think I have a lot to work with and the interview is for a position that seems like the perfect fit for me. I really don't want to mess this up and could use some advice.

2,What informative magazines are you subscribed to?,1399584167,"Hi, I'd like to know a little bit more about the ins and outs of conventional technology and industries.

Are there any magazines out there that teach you the basic working knowledge of a bunch of stuff? Like say, for airplanes - here's the theory used behind an airplane foil used to create lift. This design is preferred over this because of this. Here are some fabrication proccesses and challenges.

Or say, here's some aluminum. Here is how aluminum is created. Here is the casting process, and the typical challenges it faces. Here is the rolling process, and some typical challenges.

I'm sorry if this is a little far fetched, but I was just wondering if this kind of source was available. Something that's not too in depth like a paper dedicated to one process, but just a general overview about a variety of industries/technologies.

As i got older i realized what i wanted to be in more detail and i know i want to be a controls engineer. I love to create and design things and watch machinery work just the way i want and when it doesn't, i do enjoy the challenge of troubleshooting. 

I am only 20 years old. i went to a technical college and I love this area so much that I went on and now i am working on my third associates degree in a similar field. My first two are in Industrial Electronics Technology, and Mechatronics Technology. My third degree will be in General Engineering technology. I recently got a job working as an industrial maintenance technician. 

I work for a company that produces parts for the automotive industry. Since we are in startup i am working 72-84 hour weeks and i don't have time to go and get my 4 year degree and much less, i do not have the funding for it as well. 

So my question to the engineers is, with all my education and maybe with some more maintenance experience, do you think i will be able to become a controls engineer without a BA?

5,Failed-fusion versus fusion drive,1399577778,"I wish to observe a theoretical discussion on failed-fusion versus partial-fusion and full-fusion drives.  Primarily, I am interested in:

* Efficiency.  Energy in, energy out, total fuel per output.
* Thrust.  Reasonable ability to do work.  We all know Voyager's ion drive won't get you to space.
* Fuel requirements.  Can you generate feed from atmosphere?  How much bulk carry in space?
* Engineering difficulties.  Everything from flow issues to massive amounts of radiation.

I propose three hypothetical drives:

* **Failed fusion**:  A fusor intentionally failing fusion.  Ions accelerate toward the electrode and eject out the nozzle.  The voltage drop and total current flow through the fusor impart energy onto these ions, creating thrust.
* **Partial fusion**:  Almost identical to a failed-fusion drive, but designed for increased success rate of fusion.  This primarily concerns the operational and maintenance energy trade-off of increased fusion rates:  does it take more energy to run, or more energy in maintenance than it provides in thrust output?
* **Full fusion**:  A fusor or otherwise designed to fuse ions.  Identical to failed-fusion, but using nuclear fusion to produce thrust.

I don't know if a failed-fusion drive is identical to an ion drive; I don't know how ion drives work.  If so, I've just re-invented the ion drive.",AskEngineers,bluefoxicy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/252f6n/failedfusion_versus_fusion_drive/

First, a little background information about myself: a couple of years ago I graduated with a chemical engineering degree, and soon after pursued a masters in petroleum engineering with a focus on subsurface or reservoir engineering. I did a few internships in my undergraduate career but they were all done with engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) companies -- so mostly process engineering related.

I've applied to most oil and gas producers and consulting firms in my city for an entry-level reservoir engineering position, but never heard back from any of them. I have followed up, calling the recruiters when possible. I've even attempted in contacting engineering managers who were supposedly responsible for culling the candidates from the submission pool. This usually led to me being whisked away. Obviously, I didn't make the cut.

It's come to a point where I'm taking great strides in meeting engineering managers to build rapport, not necessarily aim for a job in particular. This though, is still in the works...it's been months, almost a year that I haven't heard from anyone.

Originally I thought to put an accelerometer into the punch bag and have that trigger a motor to turn the wheel. However on further consideration had concerns about power/portability. Its going to be used at outdoor events where there's no power.

My current thinking is to have the punching bag mounted on a vertical pivoting plank such that punching the bag causes the plank to fall backwards and using that power to drive the wheel.

However I have no idea what mechanical device to use that would be good for transferring the falling motion into making the wheel spin.

Ideally I don't want to have to build the wheel from scratch but can do if there's no way to retrofit an normal wheel.

I'm trying to find the best way to tamp coffee. Specifically espresso ground coffee. If you're unfamiliar with the secrets of preparing espresso coffee, the coffee is tamped flat in a metal filter with a handheld tamper, as the density of the ground coffee is important. Also the tamping force needs to be normal in relation to the filter. See picture: http://cremacoffeehouse.com.au/images/D/coffee%20tamping1.jpg

I want a way to produce a constant, but adjustable tamp.
So, I thought the best way to do this would be a small arbor press with a changeable tamper head. This would provide the consistent downward force. I was thinking of a two-gear system, one vertical gear and one circular. And a lever, of course.

The problem is that I don't know how to make the press so, that the pressing force could be set to a specific amount. And changed easily.
I'm guessing it needs some springs and the downward vertical movement needs to be restricted to a level.
I was hoping to make it 3d-printable + the necessary metal parts, but if it can't be done properly without some electronics or whatnot, then that's what it is.

In any case, I got an offer at a very small consulting engineering firm (&lt;15 employees), and I said my salary expectations were around $40k-55k even though I felt it was still a bit low.

Previous threads are linked at the bottom.

**What is this post?**
***
/r/AskEngineers and other similar subreddits often receive questions from people looking for guidance in the field of engineering. Is this degree right for me? How do I become a ___ engineer? What’s a good project to start learning with? While simple at heart, these questions are a gateway to a vast amount of information.

Each Monday, I’ll be posting a new thread aimed at the community to help us answer these questions for everyone. Anyone can post, but the goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses will be compiled into a wiki for everyone to use and hopefully give guidance to our fellow upcoming engineers and hopefuls.
***

**Post Formatting**    

***

To help both myself and anyone reading your answers, I’d like if everyone could follow the format below. The example used will be my own.

Field: Electrical Engineering – RF Subsystems    
Specialization (optional): Attenuators    
Experience: 2 years

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become a Civil Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be an CE. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you’ve worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We’ve gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. Just post whatever you feel is useful!

**TL;DR: CE’s, Why are you awesome?**

Ideally I could use this to coat the needle, and then pot the coiled structure to further facilitate the heat transfer. 

Unfortunately the manufacture isn't sure if it will tolerate working at this scale. In such a tightly wrapped coil, the thermal expansion characteristics of the coil become pretty extreme and will very ~~possibly~~ probably crack the coating. Normally I would just experiment and find out for my self, but it's &gt;$90 for the smallest quantity. 

I don't mind spending the money, but i'm weary if i'm not sure it's going to work.

She has this Braven bluetooth speaker that she can play her music when she's around the house and she loves it. What im trying to do is create a system that will hook up to her bird feeders outside and play the bird sounds through her speakers when the birds land on the feeder.

I did a little bit of research and bought this bluetooth transmitter:

And figured I could hook up the microphone to the bluetooth transmitter, mount it to the birdfeeder and then it would transmit the bird sounds to the speakers. The bad thing is IT DOESN'T WORK.

I know that once air is inside a pipe it must speed up if the cross section of the pipe gets smaller, because of a pressure differential.

But, If you somehow managed to control with piping and ducting, a large fraction of the air hitting the front of a vehicle and then duct it out the rear does this still 'count' towards the frontal cross section of the vehicle when examining the production of drag? I understand friction of the air inside the ducts still counts towards the air resistance.

I'm curious as to the best way to produce a minimal drag design, where instead of barging the air out of the way as it hits radiators and engine bays, it is moved in the lateral and vertical planes as little as possible, while still being moved fast enough to ensure that it doesn't add to the work the car has to do to move through the air.

81,"I made a thing, but I'm not sure what to do with it.",1399184488,"I write embedded software. We have this program today that runs on production hardware to do some specific work. As existence of this software on the hardware prevents it from performing its key function, this software has always been outside of process.

The code is a mess. It has useless artifacts from previous programs everywhere. If you turn the power of for 5-7 seconds after starting it, it becomes very difficult to make the hardware useful again (requires disassembly and addition of new cabling). This happens regularly. In some versions of this software it uses a completely different build environment than we generally do.

So, I rewrote it. And it works. The window for corruption is now 200ms instead of 7 seconds. It uses our current build environment, and is structured in the same way as the rest of our code base. It re-uses proven code rather than the previous ad-hoc cobbled together mess. 

The problem is nobody asked me to do it. I didn't do it on company time. I got the whole thing done yesterday (a day off). Part of me wants to just throw it away. It was fun to build. It is better than the current software that does this job in every way. I'm concerned about how my boss will react if I try to use it though.

82,Calculate Velocity of a fitting with small hole of bleeder,1399175697,"Hello, everyone. Here is a newcomer for both AskEngineers and the industry. However, I always get myself off track when I analysis a problem. Regardless to this, I am grateful for anyone who can help me to solve this simple problem. 

I have been working on a project that relates to air flow rate of a compressor versus 1/8 MNPT fitting with a small bleeder hole. 

So the situation is like this: An air compressor is rated 0.5 CFM at 10.6 PSI and its outlet is attached with a 1/8 MNPT fitting and a 1/4"" hose. On the fitting, I have drilled #63 (0.037"") hole as a bleeder to reduce the pressure, which is 8.3 PSI. I have calculated the cross section area of 1/4"" hose and #63 hole. In order for me to determine the velocity of the final velocity from the hose, the equation I am using is Flow rate = velocity x area. Using law of conservation mass, I get Q_inlet = V_in x A_in = V_#63 x A_#63 + V_out x A_out. However, both outlet velocity remain unknown. 

This is where I am not sure if I am in the right direction. For me to find one of the outlet velocity (whether it's from the bleeder hole or the outlet), I can use bernoulli's energy equation. Since there is no height different, I have an equation of delta_P = 0.5  x Density x ((Outlet Velocity)^2 - (Inlet Velocity)^2). Rearrange the equation for outlet velocity, I get Outlet Velocity = ((2 x (delta_P / density)+inlet velocity ^2)^0.5.

This confuses me because the pressure decreases due to the bleeder but the outlet velocity is greater than the inlet velocity? I think I am doing something wrong or logically wrong. 

I hope no one gets abused by this and I am absolutely grateful for any help and information from engineers in this ground. Once again, Thanks for all the input and helps",AskEngineers,MechWill,/r/AskEngineers/comments/24o61y/calculate_velocity_of_a_fitting_with_small_hole/

91,"Will it float? .5 Meters wide, 5 M long, and .28 M deep",1399120009,"I'm building a shallow rectangular boat with a friend to float in the canals in Berlin. It's a catamaran design. The dimensions of the boat are .5 Meters wide, 5 M long, and .28 M deep (edit: see update below). It's a long narrow boat, almost a raft. Total weight of materials and passengers are 601 kilos (edit: see update below). 

The wood is very thick, accounting for so much weight.

Will the hull displace enough water to float? Or should the hull be be deeper? Are we building an elaborate anchor? 

**edit: updated description and dimensions, as requested.**

* The overall design is a catamaran
* Box-shaped main hull has flat sides and bottom: 6M long, .75M wide, .28M deep
* Buoyant outrigger made of 16cm dia. thin-walled PVC.
* Weight: 435kg all materials and passengers

The main concern I was trying to address was if the main hull would float, and how much freeboard would be above water. The estimate is 16cm freeboard with the above dimensions.

Our current plan is to build two catamaran boats, each has one hull as described. The hulls will be built today. Myself and the guy I'm building this with are both experienced builders designers/artists, so we're taking an iterative design approach. If the hull floats, that's the element we'll build upon. If the original design doesn't work, we could use two hulls for one boat, extend the hulls upward, increase the size of the outriggers, etc. There's an overall aesthetic my friend is trying to achieve, and we can accomplish that in a variety of ways.

Maybe most importantly... We're ok swimming :) learning and iterating.

Additionally,  I'm very concerned about climate change and I have a B.S in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in physics), so I'm considering transitioning into a career in renewable energy, where I know EEs are needed.

I'm favoring solar energy over other types of renewables, as I think it has the most potential (decent Wattage per square meter, lots of growth in past couple years, solar cell prices keep declining, etc).  In terms of solar energy, I'm aware EEs often design solar photovoltaics (PV) systems (i.e. system level design, component specification, power output optimization) for residential and commercial applications, or do more tangential work, like inverter design or embedded systems/controls work.  I'm interesting in doing any of those things.  I think I'd rather stay away from material science stuff related to photovoltaics though, as I'm under the impression most solar cell manufacturing has gone to China and I'd need at least a master's to really do anything in that field anyway.

My first choice is to find employment in the solar energy field.  My second choice is to go back to school and specialize in something related to solar energy.  My first choice is preferable not only for financial reasons (i.e. student debt), but also because I'm not that familiar with the solar energy field, so I feel like I should learn more about it before I try to specialize in any EE subjects related to it.

The problem is I don't really know how to get my foot in the door.  Additionally, it's been four years since I graduated with my EE degree, and my masters career path is not applicable to EE stuff, which I'm sure is a negative, but I don't know how big of a negative.

60,[electrical] How will a power supply fed by dual sources that differ in voltage distribute the load?,1398733691,"I have a model train with a DC-DC converter in it that feeds the wireless controller. There are two power sources available. The rails are powered by 24VDC or 12VDC, depending on where I'm running my locomotive. The second is a battery pack with an output of 7.2VDC. The converter supplies 10VDC to the controller regardless of source voltage. 

I put a bridge rectifier on the track supply line to eliminate the possibility of reversing the polarity. With the bridge rectifier in place, I know for a fact that the batteries do not back feed to the track (I have tested this). Additionally, I have a diode protecting the battery output from being backfed and toasted by the higher track voltage.

Now the actual question, if I have the track powered and the battery pack switched on at the same time, how will the load be distributed? Track is 12V rectified, so actually around 11.3. The battery is 7.2V behind a Schottky diode, so really 6.8ish.

When I say flex ducting, I'm referring to [THIS] (http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/01/01320a0c-e964-4554-a0f3-984756960ffc_400.jpg)

I'm currently a self employed engineer and have recently gotten wind of a new career opportunity for myself as a Deputy Grading Inspector.  However, I will need to pass an ICC Card Certification as a Special Soils Technician.

So ultimately my question is what can I expect from the exam? I have the references for the exam listed on the site but I am quite unsure of what I should be studying.  The guide lists general topics but they are very broad and non specific.

I have my BS in Civil Engineering and I have covered various disciplines of Geotechnical Engineering as well as experience working with a Construction Testing company.

64,[DC Motors] Overshoot Problem,1398723222,"The company I work for has been doing testing for several years. Recently we started getting into some larger equipment which required us to use our motors at a higher speed. While our testing equipment had no trouble at the slower speeds, increasing the speed has caused a drastic increase in over-shoot. We use a PLC system to signal the inverter forward, reverse, or stop. However, the inverter we have has a manual speed dial, so controlling the speed isn't a viable solution without purchasing new equipment. We have a Sumitomo CNMS3-6135B-AV-B35:1 with a FB-3D brake, and using a HF3214-2A2 inverter. We use a proximity switch as a counting method, and at maximum speed (50 RPM) with no load it overshoots about 1/2 revolution. This overshoot causes an additional false count to be added when reversing direction.   

Primary question: is it possible to limit the overshoot to approximately 5 deg. using only the supplied motor, brake, inverter, and PLC? If so how? If not, what are the best alternatives to limit overshoot and/or prevent the double counting overshooting is causing?",AskEngineers,blackfang542,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2483fz/dc_motors_overshoot_problem/

72,AskEngineers Wiki - Mechanical Engineering,1398697588,"Mechanical Engineering this week!
At the moment last week's EE post is linked in the sidebar. Hopefully by the time I make the rounds through the big disciplines I can set up a better home for all the links/information.

**What is this post?**
***
/r/AskEngineers and other similar subreddits often receive questions from people looking for guidance in the field of engineering. Is this degree right for me? How do I become a ___ engineer? What’s a good project to start learning with? While simple at heart, these questions are a gateway to a vast amount of information.

Each Monday, I’ll be posting a new thread aimed at the community to help us answer these questions for everyone. Anyone can post, but the goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses will be compiled into a wiki for everyone to use and hopefully give guidance to our fellow upcoming engineers and hopefuls.
***

**Post Formatting**    

***

To help both myself and anyone reading your answers, I’d like if everyone could follow the format below. The example used will be my own.

Field: Electrical Engineering – RF Subsystems    
Specialization (optional): Attenuators    
Experience: 2 years

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become a Mechanical Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be an ME. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you’ve worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We’ve gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. Just post whatever you feel is useful!

**TL;DR: ME’s, Why are you awesome?**

73,Am I under-achieving in my job choice related to my education? I need help and advice. I'm so lost.,1398696756,"So, I have an EE degree and a master's degree from a tier-1 abit accredited decently-praised university (not MIT or anything crazy like that but pretty well recognized). I specialized in signals for my masters.

I recently got a job out of college. The position is in a small telecom company doing performance engineering, specifically RF/RAN performance. I don't to any design and I barely use any math in my job. 

Most of the people in my team have a low education compared to mine, like online technical degrees or an associates degree or community college, !!**Not that there's anything wrong with this**!!, I have high respect for my coworkers, but it does raise the question if I'm taking a career path that's... lesser than what someone with my education should be aiming for? Also, a lot of my college classmates have ended up working for like defense contractors or large well known companies doing FPGA design engineering or things like that. 

I guess it's just need advice on direction. I just feel so disillusioned. After 6 and a half years of school and doing really highly technical awesome things I guess I just expected to continue doing things like that, now most of my day i end up processing a shit ton of sampled data on excel sheets and graphing stuff and looking at trends and adjusting parameters...

So please help, should I just keep going and try to be the best I can at my job? Or is this a situation where I should get out as soon as I can and find a job better suited for my future. I understand that this should be a ""if you like the industry keep doing it"", but i just need to know, I don't want to look back in 20 years and think to myself that I underachieved.

76,Advice regarding leaving a job in the middle of a project,1398690871,"Hey there, I hope this is a good place to ask this.

For background: I graduated with my BSME in August, and due to some circumstances, had to move to a new city in October where I didn't know anyone or have any connections. Since I was still new and jobs we're a bit slim at the time (people don't seem to hire much during the last few months of the year) I ended up finally taking the first engineering job I was offered in January. Unfortunately, the job is far from where I live currently, and will be living for the next 2 years due to these circumstances (approx. 70 miles each way). It takes about ~1.5 hours w/o traffic to get there every day, and as much as I do to not let it affect me, I think my bosses have noticed that it has taken a bit of a toll on me. It's a very small engineering company, where the only other engineer on staff is the CEO, so I'm left to do basically all of the drafting and design projects for the company. 

Recently though, I found a job much closer to where I live (about 20 min away only), and after interviewing, was given an offer for more money than I'm currently making here, as well as the work being much more interesting than in my current job. I'm planning on taking the new job, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to break the news to my boss. A lot of their projects hinged on work I've been doing for them, and since I'm the only engineer they have, their work will most likely stagnate until they find/train someone else. It's a good company and they're nice people, but I realistically can't see myself here for the next two years. I plan on giving my two weeks today, but does anyone have any advice on what to say aside from 'I will finish as much work as I can, as well as make sure that the next person who is hired will be able to easily catch on with what I was doing and progress'?

87,Switching Engineering Majors CE -&gt; ME ?,1398634228,"To give some background info,
 I'm about to finish my third trimester and I’m beginning to question if I want to stick with my choice of Computer Engineering as a career due to my school’s Software Engineering backbone to the curriculum/program. I love the Computer Engineering side of things getting A’s and B’s in those courses and not so much the Software part...  After struggling for these three semesters in the SE side of things I'm questioning whether I will be able to finish this degree in the next three years. I'm honesty worried about my GPA the most, since employers do take this into consideration when hiring for Intern/Job, but I’m also involved around campus being in a few leadership roles and fairly known around campus.  My other concern is that I don't find coding to be something I will do in my leisure or really can see myself working in the future. I really want to be in some sort of program where I can excel and enjoy what I’m doing. 

Before applying for college I was interest in both CE and ME, I spent an enormous amount of time in a metal and auto shop. I have two examples of reasons why I want to switch to ME, the first one being my senior year in HS I blew the motor on my car and managed to swap motors and do a transmission rebuild successfully within a span of less than two months while taking classes in a community college plus working on another project at school. The project I was working on was a Baja style go-kart, built almost entirely of scratch, and as a team we designed, cut, and welded everything. We started the project first semester, and finishing it the second semester right around graduation. I really I find my passion in motor vehicles like my car and the go-kart, and really could see myself working in the auto industry.

I’ve talked to my advisor and really haven’t got much out of that conversation; I’ve scheduled an appointment with my department head to discuss this situation week. I transferred over quite a few credits before coming to my school and would be able to graduate within four years by the looks of it. 

Any suggestions or comments would be highly appreciated!  What would you do if you were in my position?

The sensor has to work for at least 60-80 psi, meet potable water standards and I'm still working out its flow rate requirements. The current debate is whether I should have a low level sensor and then a large sensor or if I can find one that works around 0-15 gal/min (this is the looser constraint atm since different setups are resulting in varying capacity flows).

I've been using sap2000 to design a curved truss roof. The loads are applied on the top chord, but for some reason there doesn't seem to be any load transferring to the vertical and diagonal members. There are shear forces showing so something must be applied to the members on the top chord, but that's pretty much the only results I'm getting from the entire analysis. I've been using sap2000 for a while now and I'm still finding it extremely confusing in terms of displaying information on the model so I have no idea why it's not transferring the loads. I've set the vertical and diagonals to be released for moment (Moment 33), but that shouldn't affect the axial loads.

Also, why is it that that I can't see the self-weight loads after analysing? I know this is possible with other programmes, but does sap2000 not have this option? I can't actually tell if the S/W is being applied or not, aside fro having set a loading pattern with the self weight multiplier to 1.

28,Bypass Loop - Pump Startup,1398397791,"Hey guys,

I posted this in another area but didn't really get the answers I was looking for.  I'm hoping someone can explain this to me in laymans terms what is happening.

I'm a bit confused about the purpose of a start up bypass loop. These are centrifugal pumps that start against a closed discharge valve to prevent run out conditions. However there is also a bypass loop that will begin to close once the discharge valve is fully open.

Can anyone explain what this is achieving? I've never seen this before... someone has mentioned that it helps prevent deadheading but the document I'm looking at says it prevents cavitation.  What is the role of this bypass loop?  

I originally thought it had to do with keeping the suction pressure high while the pump started but maybe it has more to do with decreasing the system curve a bit so while that discharge valve is opening the pump doesn't deadhead as much.

Here is what I'm talking about. I've excluded the suction valve but there is one. You can see there is the discharge (closed when starting) and then the bypass valve (open when starting). Once the pump starts, the discharge opens. Once fully open, the bypass valve closes.

I think I would enjoy the work more at the defense contractor, since it's more broad and systems level, and there's a better work-life balance. But I'm nervous about being pigeon-holed into defense contractors (especially with a physics BS) and developing a background that's too broad.

How safe is the defense industry right now, relative to tech? 

Is it possible to move back and forth between the two?

tl:dr: Should I accept the offer at a tech company (much better pay and advancement)  or at the defense contractor (better work-life balance and more interesting work)?

67,How to build a heating mantle? + Material/foam questions,1398225178,"Sorry for the vague topic name + long/possibly confusing post to follow, I didn't really know exactly what to say; I'm a Physics Honours student and I need to construct something for my research project, unfortunately my supervisor is generally really busy and I have practically 0 engineering/building experience and feel like I've been dropped in the deep end a little.


Basically I have a cylindrical glass cell [PICTURE/DIMENSIONS](http://imgur.com/U4JQkBf) , it will be placed horizontally with the exit nozzles facing upwards. I need to heat its contents up to ~200 degrees while leaving the circular faces unobscured, aslight will be passing through one side and needs to be measured coming out the other end. The contents of the cell needs to be in an ~uniform magnetic field, so the whole thing will be placed between a set of magnetic field coils, so I will need to minimise the amount of metal used for building the setup - essentially the cell needs to be suspended somehow, likely with some sort of stand, and have some way of applying heat to it - the cell will have gas pumped into it, ultimately I'm building a larger-scale optical pumping setup that you might see in senior physics labs.

So I'm not quite sure of the best way to do it, I have literally no experience with this kind of thing; my first thought was using bifilar heating wires, which I believe should not interfere with the magnetic field significantly? My supervisor is worried that the glass will be damaged by direct contact with hot heating wires, I'm not sure what type of glass it is but I believe it was made to be somewhat heat resistant... so he thinks there should be space between the cell and any type of heating element. So far I've thought of a couple of options:

1) Wrap the bifilar heating wires directly onto the cell's outer surface (assuming it won't damage the cell... or will it?), and then cover it with some sort of insulating foam, with some sort of plastic cover around the whole thing

2) Put a thin layer of some sort of thermally-conductive foam around the cell, and then wrap the bifilar heating wires around that foam with a layer of insulating foam covering the whole thing, with some sort of plastic cover around the whole thing

3) Abandon the heating wire idea all together, and make a sort of oven using 1-3 purchased ceramic heating elements [like this](http://www.hotco.com.au/images/ceramic-heating-element-208-275-logo.jpg) , and having a type of support/frame made to hold the elements close around the cell - this seems the most complicated idea and I think it wouldn't be very efficient since it wouldn't be able to be closed off, also I'm not sure if I would need to fill in the air-gaps with some sort of foam or not.

All the above setups would leave the top funnel things open and sticking out of the 'oven', which makes option 3) slightly more difficult to build as well.
Additionally I need to pick a material to build the stand/magnetic field bobbins out of, that would be strong/stable + easy to shape and heat resistant.

I really don't know much about what kind of materials are out there, so there are a couple of questions I definitely need help with:

*Is thermally-conductive foam a thing? Won't they melt/be damaged by the heat?

*What are the best types (also considering cost/value) of insulating foam to use?

*If I tightly wrap bifilar heating wire around the cell, will the wires damage their neighbouring coils due to the heat?

*Any advice on materials for making the stand/bobbin out of? Brief research has let me find bakelite, novotext/tufnol (phenolic resins), or 'vectra' (liquid crystal polymer) might be suitable, any comments?

**What is this post?**
***
/r/AskEngineers and other similar subreddits often receive questions from people looking for guidance in the field of engineering. Is this degree right for me? How do I become a ___ engineer? What’s a good project to start learning with? While simple at heart, these questions are a gateway to a vast amount of information.

Each Monday, I’ll be posting a new thread aimed at the community to help us answer these questions for everyone. Anyone can post, but the goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses will be compiled into a wiki for everyone to use and hopefully give guidance to our fellow upcoming engineers and hopefuls.
***

**Post Formatting**    

***

To help both myself and anyone reading your answers, I’d like if everyone could follow the format below. The example used will be my own.

Field: Electrical Engineering – RF Subsystems    
Specialization (optional): Attenuators    
Experience: 2 years

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become an Electrical Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be an EE. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you’ve worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We’ve gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. I know some of you may be a little unsure of the direction of the entire project. Just post whatever you feel is useful, once the first entry is added it will give everyone a bit more to work with in future threads. I will also be making a generic “Engineer” section so generalized answers will also work.

89,"I'm thinking of moving on, but I'd like a quick survey to see what positions others are in first to get a feel for the market.",1398092554,"Right out of college, I was hired as a mechanical engineer to a small (~20 people) DoD/DARPA contractor.  I really enjoy the work and all of the people I work with are super swell.  However, my salary has stagnated.  I'm barely making any more now than I was 5 years ago, and the company has had 50% layoffs in 2013.  Things are looking up the past few years, and I believe in the company, the products they produce, and I'm close friends with all of my coworkers and my boss.

When I was hired, I turned down several higher-paying jobs because I liked the environment of this place more, and was told by several employees that there is room for growth.  So far, the numbers say that the longer I stay here, the less I'm making, and with a marriage next month and the expectation of having kids fast approaching, I'd like to increase my salary, even if it means taking a hit in overall job satisfaction.

I've already tried talking to my manager (and even the VP of the company), but to no avail.  I'm preparing for an ultimatum, but would like to know what the market is currently like in the Northern VA area.

I'm making about $65k now, and I'm doing the jobs of a ME designer/drafter, ME FEM analysis, ISSO, IT manager/entire IT department, project manager, and Systems engineer.  I don't think it's unreasonable that I should expect an increase in salary when they add a new full-time job to my responsibilities every year, but what does /r/askengineers think?

.

Deets: Turned down higher-paying jobs for higher job satisfaction.  Salary has not increased at all in 5 years (inflation adjusted), despite the fact that I'm now doing 3 or 4 full time jobs worth of responsibilities (routinely working 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week).  Talked to management; no dice.  About to issue ultimatum, but I'd like an idea of what the market is like nowadays.

.

TL;DR: Love my job, but they pay me less than I feel I deserve/need with no foreseeable chance to advance.  What is the market like right now for mechanical engineers in the NoVa/DC area?





EDIT:  ""Ultimatum"" was a poor choice of wording.  I'm not looking to hold them hostage for my help unless they leave me no choice.

But there are some problems with this. Like the reference object would need to have the same adherence to the coating as your skin, and you'd need a very uniform coating. Not sure how accurate it would be.

98,DIY AC and payoff - Is it $0 or are we asking the right questions? Start w/ some parameters in comments. (xpost from r/frugal),1398034070,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/23hnzm/how_to_make_a_454_homemade_air_conditioner_for/) thread started the discussion of whether the net savings exist for making your own ice-powered AC. I think we need some constants here for us non-sciencey folks to grasp why there is no apparent gain in energy savings (Comfort? That's another story.):

* Being truly frugal, one sets the whole house cooler/thermostat to, say, 86 to cool the *whole house* (1500 sf) all day/nite (usually bearable for most non-nocturnal activities)

* freeze enough water to cool the air around a significantly smaller area of a sleeping human (3x5x8 ft-ish comfort envelope) for 6 - 8 hours for a lower/more comfortable temp to sleep in
    
**Consequently**, for us liberal arts majors, the gut assumption is that money is saved by only focusing real, heavy duty cooling (the ice jug production in freezer) on a smaller area (the 120 cu/ft comfort envelope) for a lesser time (sleeping hours) while keeping the rest of the house at a lower energy cost/higher temp for the majority of the time.  
 
**ERGO** the further conclusion made by some psych majors is that the cost to cool the heat produced by the ice jug freezer is less than the savings generated to keep the whole house at a higher temp most of the time and, again, in most of the house.  
 
*Let's assume we have a chest freezer located within the cooling envelope of the whole house.*

1,Chemical Engineer Considering a CS Masters (x-post cscareerquestions),1398020108,"I have a degree in Chemical Engineering, a year of grad classes revolving around CFD in Mechanical, and a few years experience.  Around the end of my undergrad, I found that I really enjoy programming and seem to be very good at it.  Hell, I taught myself C for fun, and program for fun sometimes.  When I graduated, I couldn't get a job so I took graduate classes in CFD and applied math.  However, I got a job in another field and my school didn't have online or night classes to allow me to finish that degree.  That job I got was in semiconductors, and was hell on earth.  It was hell because of the company, not because it was in semiconductors.  Ultimately, though, it's just not a good industry for my degree as far as working conditions and it doesn't interest me all that much.  While working there, I'd looked into PhD programs in applied math as it applies to computational science, but decided that I didn't want to be six figures of debt.  I got out of that job semiconductors altogether after a couple years (recently).  I am now working at a relatively easy job that isn't very technical in another field.  I am overqualified.  The downside is that after a couple years it will be almost impossible to get a more technical position again if I stay here.  However, the upside is that the hours are nice and it isn't hard so online classes are definitely do-able.

I am considering a Masters in computer science to make a career change... and hell, I'd probably enjoy it.  However, I don't want to have the same thing happen twice; I don't want to get a degree just to find that the jobs that it leads to aren't what I want.  That in mind, I have a few questions:

-  Given my background, what jobs can I expect to get?  Will this open up markets for me due to that experience, and if so, what?
-  Will my background make employers think twice about hiring me if I decided to completely ditch my previous experience in engineering and go with something more strictly CS related?
-  In a more general sense, does this seem like a good way to get where I am heading?  If not, what would be a better way?
-  For someone who may not be as familiar, some advice on the job sectors would be greatly appreciated.  I probably don't know about all the things I could/would do with that degree.

Any other advice, suggestions, or things I should know are appreciated.  I am trying to get all the info I can to make an informed decision.

**TLDR:** I am looking to change from engineering to something closer to CS because I like programming and my career doesn't seem to be what I thought it'd be.  Help my make an informed decision.  I have some questions, but add anything you think I should know.

7,Can I still use my motorcycle helmet?,1397998131,"Hi!

I just bought a new helmet and I'm worried I might've already broken it.
I was walking up some stairs and then I hit it on an edge. The surface i hit it on is parallel to the floor.

The helmet has a little scratch, a little less than an inch long and as wide as a hair. I can sense it with my finger nail but not with the top of my finger. I can squat about 75kg and I weigh 80kg. I was climbing the stairs at normal speed (don't know, 1m/s?). The angle between the stairs and the floor is about 41°.

This was on Snells homepage

&gt; ""I dropped my helmet! Do I have to go buy a new one?""

&gt; Generally the answer is probably not.  Helmets are one-use items, but are quite durable otherwise, at least the ones we certify. Frequent dropping or spiking   a helmet on the ground, or other hard surfaces may eventually degrade the helmet's performance.  Similarly if the helmet falls to the ground at highway speeds unoccupied, the owner must be aware that some degradation may have occurred.   In general, the real damage comes when the helmet contacts an object with a head inside.  The Foundation recommends that if you are participating in an activity that requires that you wear a helmet, you avoid hitting stuff with your head.  It can be difficult to readily determine if a helmet has been damaged, and the protective capabilities compromised without a thorough inspection by a trained professional.  Some manufacturers may provide this service or direct you to these others that can perform these inspections.  The Foundation recommends that if you suspect your helmet may be compromised, then replace it. If the helmet has been involved in an impact while in use, replace it.

Any help you could provide would be appreciated.

12,What's the best cleaning solution and drying method for this situation? (Details inside),1397966907,"Where I work, we have strong concerns about inhaling beryllium dust due to potential health issues.  Recently, our Health and Safety department has started to implement new rules and procedures because some people have gotten sick.

One of these new rules is that when people transition from certain areas to others, e.g. from Cast Shop to offices, they must wear booties to cover their boots to avoid tracking in any beryllium into ""clean"" areas (areas where people don't have to wear respirators or gloves or other such PPE).  There has also been discussion about people having multiple pairs of boots for when they transition between areas.  This would mean that some people could have up to 4 pairs of boots that they might have to transition between over the course of their day.  Most people would have at least 2 pairs.

Taking the booties on and off is kind of a pain and can be pointless at times since they eventually rip.  The issues with having multiple pairs of boots would probably be worse.  I've been working on an idea to make a washing basin that cleans people's boots while they're wearing them before they transition into a clean area.

The basic concept is that, before transitioning into the other area, a person would step up into a basin that's maybe 4-6"" high (used for one person at a time).  The basin is filled with a recirculating liquid that cleans debris and dust off the boots.  The person's next step takes them onto a vent that is sucking air to dry off the boots.  The person then walks into the ""clean area.""

There are a couple of issues with this that I can think of offhand.  First, I'm not sure what cleaning solution we can use to clean off the boots that would dry quickly, not pose a significant slip hazard, and whose fumes would not lead to any health effects.  Second, due to the concerns about inhaling beryllium dust, I'm not sure I like the idea of moving air to dry the boots.  Depending on the volatility of the cleaning solution, we might not need that strong an air current, but I'd like to see if there's another way to dry boots while someone's wearing them that is quick and safe.

16,Chemical Subdisciplines,1397958113,"Hi engineers - long time reader, first time asker. Hope this is a good question to put here because 'makemychoice' wouldn't really be up to the job I imagine!

I'm just coming into the Master's year of my four year course and have to decide which options and research project to take before graduating. Basically, I feel this is deciding my future career path as my specialty basically locks me in. I'm still undecided about which field to take forward - and am hoping your answers might help me. My department has quite good researchers in most of these fields. In order of my current preference:

Oil / Hydrocarbons - Good money, but seems very inaccessible. They seem to insist on experience, and I've been having no luck with applications. I've known several people graduate, spend a year or so applying - and ending up working in safety for reasonable money. But they say it is very boring, and HAZOP from my experience is soulcrushing. Despite this, the rest of the third year design project was very enjoyable, and in this field.

Pharma: I've had excellent feedback from those working in this sector, but I worry that a/ my degree hasn't really prepped me for it and b/ there seem to be far fewer opportunities, and lower wages. It seems interesting and I'd feel I'm part of something good, which is a big plus.

Biotech: From what I hear, this is an expanding field where I could become involved with new and interesting technologies, but it is still quite small so seems to be taking a risk. 

Nuclear: This looks like a very interesting course, but the main concern remains limited job prospects.

Other fields - chemicals, food, water, waste, etc. seem less interesting, and I've not found many internship openings compared to the big two (pharma and hydrocarbons)

I don't mind where in the world I end up working - I am from the UK but I know several languages quite well and adapt fine to new places.

I have generally very curious and enthusiastic to learn in the various places I have worked. The exception is when I have been in workplaces where people were unchallenged and uninspired (a mechanical shop floor) - it was terrifying. Hence this decision is rather overwhelming me right now. I worry I may have to pursue a PhD if I find no internship this summer and no work out of school - worry is never useful but I find myself worrying nevertheless.

TL;DR - Should I specialise in Hydrocarbons, Pharma, Biotech or Nuclear? If you work in any of these fields, would you recommend it? Do you find your job interesting/challenging or boring/mundane?

24,Current Junior without an internship and worrying about prospects when I graduate,1397941853,"To start off, I rarely post on reddit and have never started a thread before, so I apologize if I am unintentionally posting this in the wrong place / breaking any rules.

I am currently a Junior with one year left before I graduate with a degree in Aerospace engineering.  It is now April and I have either been rejected from or not heard back from all of the internships I had applied for over the past months.  I wouldn't say I am a bad student (3.3 GPA), but I am definitely not a top of the class one.

If I were to graduate now, my main selling point will be a team undergraduate research project about wind energy with the university's honors program which includes design, experimentation, and a trip to an international research conference.  The only problem is that I am not sure how much employers care about research as an interviewer last year made my project seem almost useless to him.

Right now, I also essentially also have zero work experience.  During high school and my first summer in college, I spent my time in the Baltimore Ravens Marching band, which is technically a volunteer position and not a job.  Last summer I was working on my research project and spent a few weeks going to Amsterdam for a research conference.  This upcoming summer, if I do not get an internship I will get a job, but it will be something that is unskilled most likely.

My main reason for posting is that I am wondering how I will be able to get a job when I graduate.

So I'm a noob welder but an extremely technical kinda guy and I work in failure analysis. My crappy house (built in 85 by a known hack job artist and got it's certificate of occupance in 98 just prior to when i bought it) has 2x12 floor joists 24 inches on center for an 18 foot span. So yea, I've got two floors of lovely indoor trampoline. As luck would have it, I need to replace the sub-floor and was thinking... ""Hey, while I've got that all exposed I should throw in some Pratt trusses for the missing joists""
I was thinking I'd build them myself in two subsections and weld/bolt them together in place that way I don't have to open up an outside wall to slide then in. I will need to leave 1.5 inches for the nailing strip lumber leaving only 9.75 inches of height for my 18 foot truss. My goal would obviously be for these trusses to support at least as much load as the adjacent 2x12's with an at worse equal sag under load.
I'm currently able to make some ugly mig and tig welds. How crazy am I got even thinking this? Also, any idea what size steel I should be using, spacing of the verticals/diagonals etc? My WAG would be to use 3/16 thick web by 2 or 3 inch wide T-bar (or perhaps 2 inch square tube) for the compression members and 3/16 by 2 or 3 flat stock for the tension members. But maybe that's a huge amount of overkill and cost. If I can get away with thinner metal that would be awesome!

Yea this is load bearing shit best left to professionals but as long as what I add more than supports its own weight I think I'd be improving the situation.

I have finally got time to start a side-project I've been cooking up for the past year or so - **a motorised camera dolly** - but appear to be stuck at the first hurdle...

[Here's the sort of thing I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH94S__Ajhg). The idea is that the camera will be set up to take pictures at a pre-defined interval, and that in between these the camera will shift ever so slightly to the side. These already exist commercially, but I really want to build my own on as small a budget as possible.

Now I'd really like to build as much of this from scratch as I possibly can, because where's the fun in buying everything pre-made?!

I have no worries about fabricating the dolly itself, but I **do worry** about the mechanical part.

Preferably I would like this thing to be battery powered, with no outside connections to a laptop/PC if possible. Perhaps there is a way to pre-program the information, and simply press 'go'?

Firstly I believe I would need a stepper motor of some sort. I won't need anything fancy, just with enough power to pull a DSLR camera from side-to-side, and with a small step angle. [Would this do?](http://bit.ly/1f1AT56)

Secondly, this stepper motor will need some sort of motion control. I have a background in programming, so pre-bundled software isn't **too** important, but it might help. [Here is one](http://ebay.eu/1f1yZ4F) that I've come across after a quick search.

55,Does this exist: very thin sideglow fiber optic cable,1397785289,"Hi all,

First time posting here so if there's a better place to ask - please let me know. Thank you.

I'm looking for thin sideglow fiber optic cable. Details:

* you know the ""regular"" fiber optic cable you find in kids toys? About the width of human hair or so - that kind
* the entire cable must glow, not just the tips. I find a lot of thick cables that do this (1/8"") which is way too thick for me
* must be lit with a cheap flashlight/LED rather than those huge battery packs
* must be flexible like the regular fiber optic cable as opposed to a straight wire
* cheap is preferred

Does anyone know of a product that does this? I'm only able to find either the typical fiber optic cables where only the edges glow or the very thick cables that often require a heavy light source as well.

Working on a project involving a venturi to aerate water and a cooling coil to cool water.

First question: How much would putting the venturi after the cooling coil affect the rate of dissolving oxygen? I expect a temp drop of about 5 degrees C through the coil. Room temp to five degrees below room temp. Will those five degrees majorly impact the rate of oxygen being dissolved?

My next problem is that if temp does impact oxygen dissolution dramatically, I will have to put the venturi on the hot side of the loop. The venturi puts bubbles in the water, and we need to remove them before they go through the cooling loop. How can I remove these bubbles and keep the line pressurized enough to send it through the loop?

Inspired by this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/22rhi5/what_is_a_project_i_could_attempt_that_would/cgpqgh0

Engineering is a broad subject with many individual disciplines. On the engineering subreddits, we all see the same questions popping up in /new:

Is Engineering right for me?

What should I do to get started in engineering?

What's a good project to learn about ___ engineering?

The wording varies, but the meaning never changes. People want to be engineers, they want to learn and they want to explore. We've all been in that situation before, hunting for the answers of what we really want to specialize in, where we want to go with our work, and how to best get there. This post will hopefully be the first steps to helping these hopeful individuals start their journey.

I propose the following: A community wiki dedicated to strong, detailed answers regarding the individual disciplines in Engineering. Entries will be divided by major discipline: Mechanical, Electrical, Aerospace, etc. Within these divisions, we can define common specializations that are pursued and the general expectations of those specialties. We can include the uncommon, the unique opportunities, and how to reach those fields. This allows them to read about the individual details of each field and hopefully find something they are interested in. Sure, the common information is available on Wikipedia and any normal Google search, but we're going to go deeper. 

Which brings me to my next point: Community involvement

What makes this community special is the vast collective experience we all possess. We have thousands hours on the job each year, we're young and old alike, and we have information that can be shared. We span several generations, disciplines, and specializations. We have anecdotes, failures, successes, and all the time between. A single person can't write a catch all guide to Engineering. We need everyone to help.

So how do we get the information to fill a wiki? Peer reviewed posting! Every Monday, we can make a (hopefully stickied) post calling for all information regarding a single discipline. If we call for Electrical and you're an EE, get in there and share some knowledge. Individual details regarding the posting can be added to the actual thread, but the end goal is to have everyone post what they think is best for the request at hand. At the end of the week, sometime Sunday, we'll collect the information and update the wiki page. From there, any errors or problems can be addressed by the community as needed.

This first post is for discussion of the original idea. Improvements, adjustments, etc. It's a big goal, We'll need to work together, and right now I'm the only person working on it. If anyone wants to volunteer to help, send me a PM with your discipline and anything you might think relevant. I'd like to have at least 1 person from each discipline for quality sake!",AskEngineers,nosjojo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/239qp1/askengineering_wiki_community_answers_for_common/

74,Laser Doppler Vibrometer (optics people?),1397712105,"Hi AskEngineers!

I humbly come to you working on my senior design project where we are supposed design a system to measure the frequency content of some mechanical vibrations using an optical system.  I hope this doesn't qualify as a homework question but I'll take the bullet if it does.

The toy problem consists of a reflector which we expect to translate back and forth - by applying an input light signal to it and measuring some characteristic of the reflected light signal, we hope to deduce the frequency of the reflector vibrations.

Main problem: $300 dollar budget.  This seems a bit low.  Also, my optics knowledge is not great.

The peak mech. displacements we expect are in the 100's of um's at best.  This and the budget has gotten me feeling like the walls are closing in:

(DC light source ---&gt; looking for intensity changes in reflection) seems like it demands too much sensitivity in the receiver circuit, along with a scary potential dependence on lossiness of the intermediate medium.

(~MHz pulsed light source ---&gt; looking for phase / frequency changes in reflection) seems intractable, since the high speed of light and small expected displacements nets tiny input-output phase differences (sub pico-seconds), leading me to think I'd need much higher speed demodulation than I could afford:

Laser Doppler Vibrometry systems seem to accomplish exactly what I need to do, but they are insanely expensive off the shelf.

Unless I missed another obvious method, my question boils to this:  is it even conceivable to build a barely functional laser doppler vibrometer within our budget?

Sorry for the giant wall of text and thank you in advance for any comments or advice.  All of it helps.

This is very confusing to me. I understand why DU is used in armor piercing shells: it's 68% denser than lead and it's pyrophoric, so it stays sharp at the impact point instead of flattening and it puts flaming shrapnel into the interior of the target when it penetrates. But while the density would be an asset in armor, the pyrophoricity seems like it would be detrimental since it would catch fire as soon as the ceramic is broken. I also know that U metal is notoriously hard to machine because all the tools need to be operated under oil to prevent scraps from catching fire.

Meanwhile, the [British Challenger 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_2) has essentially the same armor system, but uses tungsten instead of DU. I read somewhere that another part of the reason DU is more common in shells than W is cost, but I find it hard to believe that the DoD would decide to use an inferior metal just to save a few thousand dollars on a multi-million dollar main battle tank!

Is there some other reason DU is used instead of W, or is it just as a combination of cost and the general desire to use up the DU stockpile?",AskEngineers,xrelaht,/r/AskEngineers/comments/233hjv/why_is_depleted_uranium_used_in_armor/

Hey everybody,

About a month ago, I was really happy. I was offered a job with a company I love, in the field that I love, and a couple of buddies got offers there too. The compensation was out of this world good. Somehow, someway, something got messed up in HR, and even though an offer was extended.. I never got the job. A contract never arrived, and HR didn't return my calls.

My problem is I let other opportunities go, and I had many to pick from.  Great academic record in my double major of Industrial &amp; Manufacturing Engineering and Chinese Language. Multiple strong leadership positions, great research track record, leadership in community service, started some successful short term companies and saved up a good chunk of coin, multilingual (4), and generally tried to have a hand in everything.

After I realized that I was never going to get my call returned from HR, I realized it is time to start applying to jobs elsewhere. I've sent out more than 40 applications, mostly to mega-corporations, and I've gotten nothing back. Only 1 (Top 10 Fortune500) got in touch, and they wanted to hire me into a senior (5+yrs experience) position.. as a manager. People working under me would be 10-15 years older than me. No thanks!

Am I screwed? Should I try to just continue my research over the summer, and wait for the next big hiring wave in the Fall semester?

Would appreciate any advice",1397504812,"I worked for a little under 3 years at this company doing design work and 3D modeling. Very computer-oriented position; I did spend some time overseeing fabrication or visiting customer sites, but 90% of the time was in front of my computer.

I spent more time than I care to admit on reddit, news sites, car forums, etc., and my boss formally talked to me several months ago about staying focused work and being sure to give 8 hours a day of work, which he felt I was not doing at the time. So I cleaned up my act for a while, really dove into my work, and did pretty well for a while.

I don't know why I found myself so easily distracted again. I'm good at the work when I take the time to do it, and I really did put in a lot of effort a lot of times, it's not like I didn't get things done. But the way we scheduled work there lent itself to allow me to easily slack off rather than doing more and better work. We had many concurrent projects going on, and a fairly small team, so the engineering manager (my boss) would tell each person what to work on based on current priorities, then when you finished that up he'd tell you to start or continue something else.

Instead of going to him and figuring out what to do next though, or maybe making sure what I just finished was truly excellent and as good as I could do, I'd go on reddit real quick to check a couple posts, give myself a break. I guess over time breaks became more frequent and longer, and my productivity had noticeably fallen. Boss apparently got fed up with it, called me down to HR and gave me the boot.

I know I have no one to blame but myself, but I don't know where to go. It seems like I don't work well in environments like that with minimal direct oversight, and I feel like sometimes I need prodding to keep me focuses and working, which certainly doesn't seem like a good trait in the professional world. I don't try to slack off and not be focused, yet it continually happened at work.

My worry is that I'll have difficulty finding another job -- being fired from your first ""real"" job surely doesn't look good -- and that when I do, I won't have the discipline to do any better. I mean this is a serious eye-opener for me, and I'd like to think I'd be smart enough to not make the same mistake again. On the other hand, I thought that when I was written up *that* was a serious eye-opener for me, and yet here I am.

I guess all of this is to say, I'm highly upset with myself and with the situation, and not sure what to do. I thought I was good at what I did and never would have imagined being fired.

I don't want to turn down the project, since it might look good for future employers.  However, I don't want to accept, since if I do leave, I would be leaving these people high and dry.

29,"If I modify the tip of one of those Butane Gas cans used for portable camping stoves, could i use it to refill my gas jet cigarette lighters?",1397433640,"Hi :)

Got the feeling I already know the answer but I'm living on a constrictor tight budget, so thought I'd ask anyway, a dollar saved right? ;)

(Yes, it does say 'do not use with any other devices', but I figured a bunch of complete strangers on the internet would know better than the manufacturer ;) ) 
(relax, my best friend is an engineer, just not the right kind).

So, the refill gas can for lighters is about half the size of the camping one, and about 6x more expensive.

I'm going to climb out on my ignorance limb here, wearing only my underwear, and posit that the lighter stuff is more refined/pure/better quality? 

Or are they the same, and the pressure of the can is all I need to worry about?

Would love to know, because I have a pile of full camping cans, and a very empty lighter can. :D

Any info would be appreciated!

So it would be a flared cap that rests on the top of the 44mm head tube much like a normal headset cup would, that would taper down to a 1.5"" diameter shaft that is there split in half and threads into the other half of its self or threads into the bottom or upper cap. this tube would have an internal diameter to accept a 1 1/8"" headset cup.

41,Can you help me understand power loss in Fiber Optic cabling?,1397406345,"**I have posted this same post in /r/askscience.  I wasn't sure which subreddit was better suited for this question.  Thanks in advance!**

I've worked with fiber cabling for years and I thought I understood the readings I'm looking at, but I feel absolutely lost right now. So here are a few questions I have.
  
  1. What unit of measurement is db loss? Along with that, what unit of measurement is db µm? I understand micrometer is a unit of distance, and I believe db is a unit of Power. In this case db would be Recieved(returned) loss, so a difference of power. That would mean that db µm is a loss per micrometer I'm guessing?

  2. I understand the methods you use to calculate the loss of a specified medium, I do not understand how the readings I am getting correlate.

This is what I mean, I think....

  * **Point A:** Physical things such as, splices in the medium, impurities, dispersion over distance, connector interfaces, all cause a direct loss of signal strength(ie. power, db). That makes sense, I understand. This loss is measured in db.

  * **Point B:** In that same line of thinking, I would think that a transmitting device would send at a certain power level(db) and the receiving end would only be able to read the received signal if it is within a certain power threshold (-1db to -5db). Meaning, if you lost too much signal (-6db), the receiver would not be able to understand.

  * **Point C:** But, when I test something using a power meter, it is giving me a reading of db µm, which I believe is a loss in power relative to the source power? Also, charts specify a loss range of (0 dbm to -17dbm), I don't get it. Why do I care about power per meter, vs transmit/recieved power.

I feel like I'm missing something overly obvious and I'm going to facepalm as soon as it makes sense, but I can't wrap my head around it. Does anyone have a way to explain this in a way that would make more sense? I would greatly appreciate it. I labeled the different points I felt like I had in this post so you can better reference something I specifically have wrong or am misunderstanding. It's probably not formatted the best way possible, but I tried.

42,Thinking about changing paths to be an electrician. What are you guys thoughts?,1397404199,"Now I know what this sub is and the relevant bias that might come with it but I was just asked a pretty big question I want to hear some thoughts on it.

Basically, my dad just offered to get me a job in the electrical workers union which is REALLY hard to get into unless you know someone and even then it can be difficult.  After the 5 year apprenticeship program I'd be making $48/hr plus time an a half for over time.  I understand 60 hour work weeks aren't terribly uncommon for engineers so if I assumed the same work work for an electrician the money would be ridiculous about 175k/year and that doesn't include the awesome benefits package that all union electricians get.  Also, I'd be able to travel just about anywhere and get a job.

I'm 28 years old now and a sophomore in the engineering program I went into.  Right now I'm just finishing up classes at community college but if I went to the school I want to I'd be paying about 30k a year minus any financial aid and scholarships,  I figure that number would go down to about ~15K-22K a year so if I stuck with engineering and did the accelerated masters program, I'd probably graduate in another 3-5 years and making about 65k-80k a year and have some pretty mean student loans to pay off.  Student loans that wouldn't exist if I was an electrician because I'd be making apprentice wages that start off about about 35k/year for the first year apprentice.

Obviously it's not just about the money for me because I'd be making around twice the amount of an engineer  as a union electrician but I just don't know if it'd be worth it.  Like I'm a lot of people here, I'm sure I'd be enjoy the work of an engineer a lot more than being a construction worker but then again, I'm 28 already and the idea of being piss poor for the next 5 years is really unattractive to me.

2 Companies/Locations (Under the same branch of the DoD) We will call them Alpha/Bravo.

I applied to a few DoD civillian jobs last year/this year. Maybe 16 months ago, I had a phone interview with Location Alpha. Alpha wanted to hire me and they were pushing to get all the paperwork through before deadlines hit (due to sequestration, they had to refile the job under a different proposal or something) but were unable to do so. I was bummed and didn't hear anything back for about a year.

A few months ago, both Location Alpha and Bravo had new postings up and I applied. About a month later, I had a phone interview with Bravo and was offered a position. I thought about it, and accepted. Then about a week later, Alpha contacted me (the same HR rep) and wanted to interview me again via phone for the position. I told them I had to respectfully decline as I had just accepted a position with Bravo. She says thank you, and to remember that it's easy to move within the branch to other locations once I'm in.

About a week and half later Alpha calls me and explains that she knows I had already accepted a position, but she wanted to extend an invitation to fly in and do a face to face interview with everyone there. She reasons that since I am not starting my other position until later this year, if I was to decide to switch to Alpha then it wouldn't be too bad for Bravo and in the end I should select where I think I would be the best fit. 

After thinking about it, I accepted her invitation to interview as it would at the very worst, be a good experience to interview with military personnel and learn more about their division. I did however, express that I am concerned with accepting an offer from them because I did not want to be ""blacklisted"" or have a negative mark for backing out on an agreement.

I believe both positions are part of a new program, which takes new engineers and progresses them in a 2.5 year program from GS-7 to GS-12 at the end of the program. 

My question is, what should I do if I am offered a position with Bravo? They clearly stated in the 2nd phone interview invitation that the starting salary is XX. Is it possible to negotiate anything in government positions as far as salary or sick days? How will backing out on an accepted offer affect me?

Everything is telling me not to accept no matter what, as I like to be a man of my word from my response on the first offer. Alpha is offering more, but I feel like the difference in pay would barely cover the difference in rent in the 2 areas.

First, the model: http://imgur.com/8i1EBo3

Quick question for anyone who uses sap2000. I have an AutoCAD model of an ellipsoid, and I don't want to import it into SAP2000 before I'm sure that I can convert the model properly because I've already wasted so much time on other problems I've had with this model. Currently the model is made of lines in AutoCAD, which the CSI website says will convert to frame elements in sap2000. I am trying to model a concrete shell, though, so I would need these frame elements to convert to shell elements. I am currently trying to figure out how to get AutoCAD to convert lines to 3dfaces (Which would then mean the input into SAP2000 would already be shells), but it's proving to be difficult (converting individual areas (around 400x5 models) into regions, then regions in mesh, then mesh into blablablabal). 

So basically, what does it take to convert a frame into shells on SAP2000? Is it going to be a tedious manual labour thing, or is there a quick option? Because if so, I will just import the AutoCAD model as a frame and then transform it in SAP2000.

I am sort of stuck in between choosing so I was just wondering if anyone had any insight from a professional standpoint such as:
* What type of jobs would each focus open up?
* Would one take me to better standings in the workplace?
* In general which one do you think is better applicable to the workplace?

12,Implications of combining multiple microwave ovens into one,1397062987,"I want to try building a more effective microwave oven. My idea is this: buy three identical devices, dismantle two of them and put their magnetron assemblies into the third one.


[[basic schematic]](http://imgur.com/f1RHmwV)


Thus, I:

* decrease cooking time by tripling the energy that is put in my food - at least on its surface

* reduce cold spots by evening out the energy distribution inside the cooking chamber 

Now I have two questions:

* Do I have to take anything regarding the radiation into account? Specifically, will the wave seals still keep it inside the machine? I'd hate to build an oven that heats up my corneas.

* Should I expect any major drawbacks except vastly increased power consumption and uneven heating of bigger food chunks?",AskEngineers,HandfulOfSalt,/r/AskEngineers/comments/22mc7m/implications_of_combining_multiple_microwave/

19,Transitioning from School to Work: Engineering work in fast-paced tech company,1397022544,"Hi there, I currently work in a fast-paced tech company in Silicon Valley working on hardware/electronics. I had a talk with one of my colleagues about career objectives and things I could improve on. One of his concerns is my speed of getting things done. Ever since I was little, I felt like I've always done things at a slow pace, but I would pay more attention to detail and make sure it gets done correctly. I feel that this trait doesn't mix well in the place I work at, where everything is pretty fast paced. In school, sometimes we would have about half a term (~5 weeks) to complete a project and demo it to the professor/TA, but in the workplace, I would have to complete the same project idea (working prototype) in 1-2 weeks.

Overall, is this a good approach to doing things? I feel like if I don't pay much attention to detail, I'm prone to making more mistakes which would use up more time debugging when I could be doing something else. It would also help me understand the problem so that if there was a problem, I would be able to quickly identify the problem, and spend less time on debugging. I guess it's easy for them to say because they have years of experience and they can identify problems and think of a solution a lot quicker than someone fresh out of school with hardly any experience. There was one class I had in school where the professor emphasized designing before doing saying something like ""the more time you spend designing the solution (on paper), the less time you spend debugging the code."" 

In terms of learning, what's the best way to learn something new, for example, a new design software or programming? How do I dive right in and learn as I go? For example, development boards - I always feel like I should understand all of the hardware before interfacing it with other things or writing code. How do I break out of this structured style of learning, become a fast learner, and learn stuff on the fly? For example, if you're presented with a design problem and you're expected to get results in 4-5 days, do you spend your time putting together things together OR do you try to get familiar with the design software (if you never used it before)? I feel like if you spend time to get familiar with all of the features, you'll fall behind on designing and presenting the results. Since I'm a detail-oriented person, I feel like I write (or document) more in my notebook than actually doing the work. A lot of times, when faced with a design problem, I begin to wonder where to start.

24,RS485 Wiring - Commons?,1397001004,"My issue comes down to wiring concerns for RS485. I've read quite a few stories where drivers can be fried if the common mode voltage between RS485 devices begins to exceed a certain level (I think it's 7V or something). I guess what I'm confused about is what is the common of an RS485 driver? A lot of devices I see have three wire (SIGN+,SIGN-, and GND) so the commons of my differential signal is pretty much the same between devices (I'm assuming that for these types of devices, the signal GND is my circuit common?) But then I get into issues when there is no GND port for an RS485 device... what then? How I determine the common voltage between devices at this point? Is my source GND at that point my circuit common? But then that adds more questions: if that source is isolated from the others RS485 drivers, then I have zero relationship between commons.

I'm just really confused as to how the signal is measured between RS485 devices when there is no common. And more generally, what is the circuit common of RS485 drivers. I've definitely had one experience where I was using an RS232-485 converter and it ended up frying my PLC because there was a signal ground unconnected.

Sort of a throwaway here, as its my first post to AskEngineers on this topic. I just wanted to get some advice from people in different countries and work out what my options are.
I am 30 now, and just kinda tired of living in the same city for the last 830 years* of my life, so I wondered what my options would be for working abroad, and from people who have done it, how easily are qualifications converted.
For reference, I am from South Africa and I did all my studies part time, so I have 2 diplomas in EE (one focused more on CS and the other more on industrial stuff), a BTech in EE, and this month handing in my MTech dissertation. I am not a terrible student, and from the calcs I did my GPA was 3.7 in my Bachelors (hopefully not worse on my masters), so I think a phd would be an option as well, but otherwise, I focus mostly on embedded product design and then on manufacturing tests (using NI stuff with labview and teststand). I have been in the field now for just over 10 years.

How transferable are my skills, and where should I be looking. I am not really in a rush as such, so I think if there are things like the TEFL english tests and the Labview CLA that would simplify moving I would be keen to hit those, but just wanted to ping people and find out how hard a process it would be.
Country wise, I am not particularly Picky - I have always liked the US and Canada as options, but if there are other places that are easier, I would totally look at that as well.

55,Graphic Designer Looking for Advice on Career Options in Engineering,1396890545,"I'm looking for advice on the practicality of going back for a BS in Engineering. I'm thinking Mechanical/Product Design and Development/Manufacturing. 

I'm already able to draw and design on a computer with Adobe Creative Suite. I've fiddled with AutoCAD some and think I can get it down pretty quickly. My main concerns are: 

A) If I'm going back to school for another 4 years, I HAVE to be sure this is the right career. How did you know this was the right career choice for you? Are you happy doing what you're doing? How over saturated is the field and which fields have a better outlook in your opinion? Areas of the US that are really needing engineers currently? I'm doing the research on this myself, but if you have first hand knowledge, I'd love to know. Opinion on Tech Engineering degrees?

B) I've never been challenged by any of the classes I had in college. I flew through the math classes I've had, but I never had calculus, physics, etc. I've only had statistics, algebra, accounting, chemistry, etc. I want the challenge and I want to meet my potential, but how crazy is it to consider a load like this without having had those higher level math courses yet?

C) I hate being a graphic designer in some ways, but love others. I'm good on a computer, but I can't sit still all day. I don't want to change careers into another desk job. I love working with my hands and cutting, building, drawing, putting things together, etc. This is a really important aspect for me that I really need in a career. I'm good with computers and technology, but I don't want to work with them constantly (&lt;50% of the time would be great). Problem solving and idea generation are my absolute favorite parts of being a designer. I used to joke with my classmates that we were really getting degrees in problem solving. I want this part of design back. I think there's a potential to do this on a larger scale with actual products or packaging. I've also been reading that in some ways being able to design and be  creative are lacking and needed in the field now. Do you think that's true? Does engineering seem like it would feel this need of mine to work with my hands and being able to be creative as well?

D) Is it possible to get into product design with just a mechanical engineering technology degree or is the BSME critical to those kind of positions? Is there another kind of engineering I should be looking at? I'm thinking it would be smarter to stay as general as possible for this round of education so that I am more employable, thoughts?

I know the job market sucks for everyone right now, but realistically... is engineering becoming way too over-saturated? That's the really problem with graphic design and I'm trying to avoid it. Any career you research, there is someone telling you to jump in and someone telling you to jump ship. It's really confusing and it makes it near impossible to find something you want to do and something you can find a job doing.

I graduated college in 2008 with a bachelor's and master's in history.  I had been on track to get my PhD and teach at the university level, but I decided that I couldn't stand academia any more.  Since then I have worked as an adjunct professor of history and a tutor at Arizona State, and also a brief stint as an EMT.

I got the idea to go back to school and major in a science, with an eye toward either engineering or medical school.  I've taken my basic sciences (e.g., physics 1 &amp; 2, organic chemistry, calculus 2) and I have been studying for the MCAT this semester.  But I'm still very much in doubt as to whether medicine is something that I want to do.

I've found that I love the sciences and I want a career that allows me to apply what I've learned to the real world.  I enjoy physics, math, and chemistry much more than the biology I've taken.  I'm set to take more organic chemistry, calculus 3, and an intro engineering course next semester.  I have been accepted to the BME undergrad program here at ASU, but I've been told by the advisor that I would be better off going straight into their master's program after I take a few more deficiency courses.

My problem is that my indecision on careers is killing me and I can't stop thinking about it.  I have begun shadowing physicians to see what their work is like.  I've watched a lot of videos and read a lot of posts about the ""average day"" for an engineer, but I'd really like to experience it firsthand.  Is there a way to shadow engineers?  

Salary is definitely something that I have to consider as well.  I'm not a greedy person by any means, but I don't come from a very well off family and I'd like to be able to help my parents and siblings out one day.  What kinds of promotion opportunities are there for chemical and biomedical engineers?  Is the majority of this work for large corporations, or is there a chance of becoming an entrepreneur?

I am wondering if this is something that's echoed across the HW community and whether we can make a compelling argument and get this message to SW? i.e. for small start-ups with low revenues, allow them to use SW for a reduced price (not as reduced as the student version but reduced enough that it wouldn't hinder the start-up's success).

I'd love to use it but I ended up getting geomagic which is more affordable and now I'm not sure I'll be switching back to SW. And I wouldn't pirate it. I think that they may be losing customers by not providing a small start-up option. Thoughts?

Basically I want to try to model a cylindrical rod that has been initially heated up to 40 degrees C. The heat source is then removed and the rod is naturally cooled from 40 degrees C to 20 degrees C. The cylindrical rod is 75mm long and has a diameter of 2mm. The material is Nitinol.

Here is my setup, sorry for the crappy cut and paste. http://imgur.com/lALtjJ0

My friend in the lab told me that these things should cool fairly quickly, but it looks like the way I set it up it only cools 6 degrees over 2 minutes. Am I doing something wrong? I have a feeling its the way I set up the initial temperature. Can anyone please advise? How do I set up an initial temperature of 40 degrees for the rod?

EDIT: I've made some changes since ood_lambda's post. Currently I've changed my conditions a little because I would run into errors when I try to solve with a wire diameter of less than 0.75mm. (Ideally I would like to try to run the model at 0.3mm, but I have no idea how). I am currently using Stainless Steel, as material properties, and will change the material after I figure out how to work this thing. I've also changed my initial temperature a little, basically I just want to see how long it would take wires to cool from 83 degrees C to less than 75 degrees C.
I've added radiation to my model, as well as another wire. I was hoping to include the radiation between the two wires as well, but I don't think I am inputting the settings correctly.
Depending on the time I have left, I may or may not be looking into conduction.

Secondly, I'd like to improve the position awareness.  I find that automatic homing is inconsistent - the machines thinks it is in one place when it is actually slighty off and that leads to large errors when the arm is fully extended.  I believe the problem is that the switches are very close to the fixed end of the arm, but I have no way to mount them out near the elbow.  I'm looking into moving the sensors to the finger tips.

I've looked into gearboxes (too expensive) and hall effect rotary encoders (still searching).  I tried adding bearings at the elbow and wrist, with no appreciable improvement in quality.  Software speed ramping is in the cards and will take quite some time to implement.

2. perhaps be expandable (if this goes cattywhompus and I end up building a longboat, having lots of people and perhaps a small engine) 

I am trying to avoid having the effects of one person pedaling very strongly, and ""Carrying"" the other while the second set of pedals spins freely, and just reduces inefficiencies, as well as making sure that if the stronger peddler gets carried away the second set of pedals does not force the second peddler's legs to move uncomfortably quickly.

When I was spraying the foam into the mold it almost instantly began reducing into liquid, very similarly to when you use acetone to clean up. The PVC does not have any acetone contamination. 

The foam refuses to expand when sprayed into the PVC (I've checked 24 hours after the pour). I've checked the can to see if it was defective and it expands fine on other surfaces.

29,Career Path for Electrical Engineers?,1396403843,"Hi. I am 3rd year electrical engineering student and want to ask electrical engineers about career paths for EE majors who are actually in the fields out of school. As I only have a year and a quarter to graduate with a degree in EE, I have been thinking a lot about how EE career will be like after I graduate. 

When I was a senior in high school, I was good at math and physics so I decided I want to be an engineer. Then, I looked up types of engineering and, at that moment, I had absolutely no idea what each fields were about and which one would be best for it. I ended up choosing EE because I thought it would be most essential field in engineering career. I read so much about being an electrical engineer in US online which sounded very promising and hopeful. I'm from a family with a single mother who supports entire family, so could not go to 4-year university that I wanted to go when I was admitted after high school graduation. Instead, I went to community college for 2 years, did prerequisite requirements for transfer admission for same university and got in. After this spring, I will have one more year remaining. 

From my experience so far, I love/enjoy EE. It is really fun studying, designing, testing circuits and also learning about other cool things we can do with electricity such as signal processing, nano-technology, and so on. I am doing power concentration because I want to work with efficient energy technology. In particular, my dream job is to work on hybrid vehicle technology such as Tesla motors. 

One problem is that I keep hearing people talking about how tough it is for EE graduates to build career after they graduate. Unlike what I've heard before, everyone I talk to tells me that EE is no longer a field that can grow any further and I should change my career path if I can. I also talk to a lot of senior students in laboratory who tell me of their struggle to get a job or even an internship when they are about to graduate. If that's not enough, people tell me power concentration sucks compared to other EE concentrations. I really don't want to change my concentration because I am really interested in this particular area. All this really put me down and make me feel worried about my future. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to ask anyone with EE degree out there for opinions. Is EE really a bad career field that no longer expands? Is it true that it is extremely difficult to find EE jobs these days? Should I consider changing my concentration area to something other than power, or is power concentration really worth it?

I don't know if this is important, but I had nearly perfect GPA(3.97) for first two years before I transferred, and about ~3.7 GPA, currently at UW in Seattle. I'm doing three electrical power/energy concentrations(descriptions copied from department website below) at the same time, as well as a minor in mathematics. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power Electronics and Electric Drives: 
Power electronics is among those areas of electrical engineering whose importance is expected to grow dramatically over the next years and decades. Whether one considers hybrid car technology, power supply solutions for data storage centers and high-performance computing, energy efficient technologies, or renewable energy - state-of-the-art power electronics is central to all designs. Electric drives provide important solutions to electromechanical energy conversion and control in broad areas such as transportation or robotics, but also in applications as diverse as hard disks or wind energy conversion.


Sustainable Electric Energy: 
The scarcity of fossil resources, high fuel cost, and environmental awareness are important drivers behind the strong interest in renewable energy. In the USA the capacity of installed wind power converters has increased by 50 % in only one year. Solar energy conversion and fuel cell technology also receive a lot of attention. This track is centered on the key contributions of electrical engineering to the area of sustainable energy.


Large Scale Power Systems: 
This area prepares students for careers in the electric energy industry with utilities, manufacturers, consulting firms and government agencies, and for graduate work in power systems research. Large scale power systems are the largest capital investment industry in the United States. The power system itself has been described as the largest man-made system in the world. Large scale power systems are fundamental foundational infrastructure for the high technology society in which we live. While the problem of efficient generation and delivery of electric energy is as old as the light bulb, the power industry is an avid early adopter of advanced technology to better solve the continuing problem.

I graduated about a year ago with a bachelors in civil engineering and went to work full time right away for the construction company I had already been interning/part-timing for. I started in the office and then was placed as a field engineer on a specific project. Since then, the project has ended and the company has placed me in a MUCH MUCH less demanding/challenging position that basically entails me answering the phone all day and dealing with paperwork.

This has now led to me becoming frustrated with working here, especially considering the future of the company isn't looking too bright because jobs are getting harder and harder to bid successfully. We actually just finished another project and I'm just waiting to see who will be part of the next round of layoffs.

**Current Situation**

I've already been applying for other positions since January (entry level design engineer and field/project engineer) and out of the nearly 20 applications, I've been called back for 3 interviews total, 2 being with the same company who just notified me yesterday they were going with someone else. The other interview was actually through a connection and hasn't really panned out. I've asked anyone else I know or graduated with that is already working and not much luck there either.

What I've been considering now are other career options outside of engineering. My state is opening applications for the state police at the end of the month and I've been giving that serious thought since law enforcement was always something I saw myself getting into if engineering fell through. Other than that I also have a teammate from my amateur hockey league who has mentioned possibly working for his   market/trader/broker company because they actually prefer people with engineering backgrounds due to our ability to problem solve and analyze and that any necessary training would be done in house.

For those of you in these disciplines of engineering, what's your job like? What do you recommend I do? What other areas besides space and energy do you recommend? If I major in nuclear what kind of jobs would I be offered?
Which major I choose will affect the school I go to, particularly for nuclear engineering as there is only one school near me that offers it.

45,Is Mechanical Engineering the Right Career Path for Me? I Have Questions + Bioengineering &amp; Computer Science Career Related Stuff,1396342563,"I have to first say I'm 22, 23 soon. I spent four years in community pursuing bioengineering in order to transfer. Currently I have a 2.5 GPA. The reason for the low GPA is that I was in real depression. My depression held me back from achieving any real success. After four years I decided to drop out and do absolutely nothing. I needed time to heal and time to think about who I am and what I truly want for the rest of my life. That's where I am now a year later. It's time I finally go back to school. I plan on seeing a therapist regularly so I don't fall back into depression and who also makes sure I'm managing my time effectively and keeping up. 

I found out that I'm someone who has always loved to learn for the sake of learning. But the bad side to that is I always develop new interests that I get heavily involved in until I find a new thing and I leave that first thing unfinished. ""Jack-of-all-trades, Master-of-None"" I hate that about myself but that's basically me. I remember I never knew what I wanted to do but whatever it was I wanted to be the absolute best at it. I've learned now that that will probably never happen. I'll never like only one thing for the rest of my life. But hopefully I can be close to being the best at one thing and that's ok, I'll try to be good at one main thing and be not so good at others. Or concentrate on being really good at only like 2-5 things. I have a list of things I always thought I could be, and although for each one I think I have what it takes, I think they'll always be other things that attract me too. I can never just do one thing. So even if engineering isn't the perfect fit, because the perfect fit for me doesn't exist, it's the best fit I think. But still help me decide and see what you think. I've decided to go for mechanical now because at this point I just want to get the fuck out of school and bioengineering will take too much time. I've been through a lot of pain/heartache/stress in my life. I didn't have that teen life, I didn't have that college experience like everyone else ""the best times of your life"", all of that is gone and all I was left with was a lot of sadness and tragedy so if you could help me out now I would really appreciate it. Plus **I've put about 24 hours of thought into this post.** I revised/started over like five times. I thought about separating the questions out and into another post but it didn't seem like I should. 

I didn't want to ask a single person because I thought my questions didn't apply to one single person. 

**(1.) How much of what you learn in school will you have to use in your career?**
 
I liked basically the first physics class (kinematics, projectile motion, newtons laws etc.) but not so much afterwards. Magnetic fields? Fuck that. I would be fine if I never have to use and apply physics in my life ever again. But I suppose if I can use it to make things then that won't be so bad. I really like learning more how things work not so much doing the math for it. But I like math by itself.

**(2.) How much free time do you have? What are your work hours and do you work weekends?**

I read that engineers have 9-5 workdays. I'm constantly finding new things I like to do/have many hobbies. I want to produce music. I write poetry. Haven't drawn in a long time but want to pick up again plus learn to paint, I want to create mods for skyrim, I've done some before but left incomplete. Code. I want to learn guitar, piano, new languages. I want to write short stories. I love reading history. 


**(3.) What are some common traits of all engineers?**

It would be helpful so I could compare this to myself. In fact a whole separate thread for this would be a good idea.

**(4.) How much independence do you have in making your own decisions?**

I kind of like doing my own thing but I can also work with others. I'm gonna be scared shitless first day on the job so I want help but after that..yeah. 

**(5.) Will I have the chance to be creative?**

I like to create if you haven't noticed. Usually I drop one thing and pick up anther creative thing, drawing, photoshop, create my own levels/house mods, poetry, create my own music. Write my own short stories. Cooking. These things aren't exactly the same as using science but I suppose its similar. I know being a engineering major is tough in school and pretty much takes away your free time. But I hope after schooling that I have more free time open up so do the things I like to do?

**(6.) If I ever lose interest in my job, how tough will it be to switch careers in related fields?**

I've thought about it and if I don't like being a mechanical engineer I could go back to school to study bioengineering, but how long would that take would I have to do four years all over again? I think I would like working on medical devices or prosthetics. Or just go into research.

Although I'm not so sure, I might possibly want to go into computer science and write code. I remember I hated learning code but it was ok doing it. The only thing that appeals to me with that is I get to create (it's not art or poetry but ok) and solve problems. I like solving puzzles, which i hear is a trait of programmer, but I don't love them really. Also I like math a lot and I'm good at it. 

Or perhaps eventually I might just go to law or med school (which I really don't want to do right now). Or maybe I will become an architect. 

I've been looking around for many careers and the things I came up with were Architect, Video Game Designer (level design or programmer), Medicine, Law, Researcher (Biology). But in all these careers I'll either not have a good chance of getting a job afterwards, spend too much time in school (I want to get out already), the career will take away my life leaving no time for my other interests. 

My favorite classes in high school/college were: Biology/Psychology, History, English, Math in that order. With Biology and History fighting for the 1st spot, and with English and Math fighting for the 3rd spot.

**(7.) What are some things you love about what you do that you really enjoy doing, what are some things you hate and could do without?**

**(8.) Would YOU consider switching careers if you had the money and time?**

**(9.) Would you say that everyday feels like play and not work? Is this a bit complicated question?**

**(10.) What does being a manager entail? Do you have the same work hours?**

I think if I don't like being an engineer I could be a really good manager. I'm really good with people. Good at communicating what I have to say. I have a wide array of interests. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why I think I should be an engineer**

* I get to solve problems, which I like but not love necessarily. 
* I get to create things. Seeing that final product and knowing I made it would be a great feeling. I just hope I like the process enough.
* I like working on the computer. CAD, and solid works looks really cool to me. I loved creating things in photoshop so that seems similarish.
* I like technology. When I was little I was always the person fixing the things at home. Mostly computer/electronic based things. Nothing too deep just plug this wire here and there type of things and googling how to get rid of this spyware etc. 
* I like being on the cutting edge of something.
* Although I haven't done many things. I think I really like making things with my hands. I'm planning on making a workbench in the garage. Maybe work with some wood.
* I think even if I don't like it, it can lead me into something I will like. Like biology, computer science, or perhaps a managerial position or sales. 
* I like having time for other things like my many interests/hobbies, which I think this job will allow me. 
* I'm a really good writer. Like seriously pretty good. I'll capitalize and everything. 
* I'm really good at communicating and working with people. I've worked off and on at a convenience store since I was 11. I worked like two or three full summers. 
* I really like math and I'm good at it. It's fun to solve math problems. I'm very stubborn trying hard to solve problems when I can't get it. Sometimes it would stop me from finishing the other problems but I learned to move on and come back. 
* I'm a really good test taker if that counts for anything.
* I'm a real perfectionist if that counts for anything. I'm super detailed oriented. 
* I like to occasionally watch science/discovery channels and modern marvels when balanced with other shows.
* I think of the show Lost and if I was stranded on an island. It would be so cool to have an engineering background. I watch survival shows (Bear Grylls/Les Stroud/Dude You're Screwed/Naked and Afraid) and I think about how cool it is they use what they have and find ways to make things to help them survive. Like how they make fire. Or collecting water by evaporating the water out of the salt water to drink. Or making an axe out of a golf club. 
* As a kid I remember thinking whatever I did. I wanted to change the world. Not in a small way but in big way. This could help me do that.
* I fucking loved legos as a kid. I didn't have many because we were poor but it was awesome.

**Why it might not be a great fit for me**

* I will always have other interests. I love learning and I always want to learn new things. 
* I'm a very creative person, I love to create (but I also like science and math). I love anything creative like I've stated above. I love breaking down books, movies, music and games. I love ""talking dead so much"" I wish they did that for Game of Thrones. I like watching cooking shows. drawing, poetry etc. I think i'm 65% creative 35% into science and stuff
* I love Biology way more than Physics, which I can't even say I love, I kinda just like some of it. I just like learning information more than actually applying like it like in physics. If I never took another physics class ever again I would be fine with it. Not learning more biology however saddens me. Like I will crack open a biology or psychology textbook just for fun. It's not likely I'm going to open that physics textbook, if I do I'm skipping the parts with the problems. I do actually really like math though, I think that's weird. 
* I don't think I could be stuck making some boring machinery that cuts plastic straps off of boxes. I want to make things that I like or I think are cool. If I have to do some boring stuff sometimes but also get to do some cool stuff than I could be fine with that. 
* I've always wanted to write a book one day, before I die. 
* I do have a history of doing bad in my classes but it was only the depression that held me back. But it's important to acknowledge that. Organizational/managing time are not my strong suits but I do think i'll get over that hurdle and once I do I'll be fine.

After writing all this my perspective is I think I should become an mechanical engineer. If for nothing else I think in the process I might discover I like programming and perhaps do that instead. Or perhaps later I can go back to the bioengineering side of things or go into research where I'm basically a scientist in the biology field. Or If I really feel like having no life ever again, go to med school. 

If you read through all this thank you so much. I'm truly grateful you took time out of your life to help me, it means more to me than you will ever know.

50,American entrepreneur needs your help. Would this be a product that you or your company would use?,1396307077,"Hi ""Redditors"",

I appreciate your feedback and discussion regarding a software product that I am considering developing.  I'm trying to validate if it is useful in the manufacturing industry.
It has to do with automating and simplifying the burdensome RFQ process.  Engineers and estimators at CMs and manufacturers in general often have to send out a bunch of emails to many different suppliers for many different parts and then recompile it all for analysis.  It's very inefficient at my company, so I decided to create some software that would automate it, from BOM entry to RFQ send, to compile and supplier selection to export.

The offering would be SaaS based, online, and simple to use.  It would be a monthly fee service.

If so, can you recommend features?

52,Let's say there are two engines that operate at different speeds.

71,"According to our calculations, increasing the thickness of the middle of an i-beam counter intuitively makes it MORE prone to buckling. Is this an artifact of our math, or what actually happens in real life?",1396192602,"Details.

We are applying a Johnson-Euler Buckling equation to determine the maximum pressure per square inch of cross-sectional area before buckling is experienced.

The [equation](http://www.engineersedge.com/column_buckling/column_ideal.htm) seems to indicate that maximization of the radius of gyration would increase the failure point, to a point, and increasing the thickness of the i-beam, *specifically the middle section,* should intuitively resist buckling further. 

The math somehow says otherwise. If I had value for you, I'd offer them, but the conceptual level is more important.

Is it possible that thickening an I-beam would make it more prone to failing under compression?

72,Dehumidifiers for Africa !,1396189912,"I recently noticed that some of the metal objects in my room that were not coated in some sore of sealant were beginning to rust a bit so I bought a dehumidifier and a mains timer so that it comes on for 6 hours when I am out and then turns off. After a week of coming home and emptying it I noticed that I was getting on average 3-5 liters of water every 3 days or so. I then started using the water I collected on the plants outside instead of using the mains water which tends to get low on pressure as I am at the end of the line. I then had a passing thought and wondered if it was feasible. 

Ok so we all know that many regions of Africa have a hard time getting clean water and even if the situation has improved in some parts it is still a major issue. Africa has a lot of sunlight/heat but not a lot of water so I wondered if it would be possible to harvest water from the air using power from solar panels and try to do it on an industrial level if not implement such a system in a home for a family.

One of the problems I'v read about is that there is water near by certain villages that is contaminated and therefore not safe to drink so if there was some sort of passive filter in the system it could be very beneficial. 

Obviously there are some issues that automatically present themselves such as cost of the equipment and the dry nature of the air wouldn't yield as much water but assuming the equipment was funded by external sources and they devices were implemented near contaminated water sources to have a high enough moisture content in the air to collect and filter, I'm asking if it is technically feasible or even possible to do something like this from an engineering standpoint and to also be beneficial enough to try ? 

My gut tells me that there is some technical issue with this idea as I have never heard of it being done so I'm expecting to be told that I have overlooked some major issue but I thought I'd ask to get an opinion all the same.

73,Does the current from a 9-volt battery emit radiation which can significantly increase the risk of cancer or cause it?,1396176389,"So my buddy an I in college decided to mess around with some schematics, a Transcranial Direct Stimulation (TDCS). 

TLDR: we are scared that the current from a 9 volt battery that we put(not sure if thats the correct term) in our brain emitted enough radiation to significantly increase our cancer risk (brain cancer) even thought we didnt feel any side effects? (this happened more than a year ago)

We made 2 using 2 different schematics (although I dont think you can call the first one a schematic)

**1st Implementation:**http://gizmodo.com/5882754/how-to-electrify-your-brain-to-be-smarter-with-a-9-volt-battery/all

I know, how dumb are we that we would resort to trying this.. but realizing now how moronic it would be to try it means it could have actually made us smarter lol! (kidding aside, im actually quite scared right now) 

we followed the exact thing on the picture however we connected the wire from the battery to a square metal we cut of from an altoids tin and connected them to cut off pieces of sponge instead of the red and blue stuff.

now after trying our creation a while it actually made minor burns on our foreheads. so we googled an actual schematic this time.

**2nd Implementation:**
http://www.diytdcs.com/media/go-flow-tdcs-schematic.jpg - from the GoFlow TDCS website

We asked an electrical engineer buddy of ours to help this time; we paid him a few bucks. I believe he followed the schematic quite accurately and we bought actual parts. Instead of a sponge and altoids tin he bought disposable electrode patches from the local drugstore (not sure if thats what you call them)

He said it was dangerous since it could kill us if it exceeded some sort of current (not good with electric terms; but you get the point); we ignored it and tried it for a few weeks. 

Now we didn't feel any long term side effects or any at all (1 year has passed). However we're scared we might have given our future selves brain cancer from the radiation it emits etc? or is this not possible? or if it had any radiation at all that it would be insignificant or just increased our risk by . 0001 or something like that?",AskEngineers,bilbuthehobbit,/r/AskEngineers/comments/21qmgi/does_the_current_from_a_9volt_battery_emit/

Let me know if this belongs elsewhere.*

I'm a recent ME grad (~1 year since finishing undergrad), and I'm looking at Product Design as my career path. I know the ME/Industrial Design/Product Design question is one of the most common ones, and I've seen it pop up in various forms multiple times on reddit. I'd like to approach this question from a slightly different angle to what I've seen so far:

Lately, I've been doing some research on [product design firms in CA](http://www.designdirectory.com/search?phrase=California&amp;specialty=17&amp;countries=217&amp;page_no=1) (since that is where I am). Now, while I'm greatly interested in the design aspect, I'm also very interested in the engineering aspect to product design. I've noticed some firms tend not to deal with the engineering aspect internally, whereas some do (I recently got lunch with a founder of a semi-small product design firm, and he told me how they don't do any engineering in-house mostly for liability reasons and that is what got me thinking about this).

So I was able to find a number of firms that have mechanical engineers on their teams.

My question therefore is, are any of you mechanical engineers who work in a product design firm? If so, honestly, I have a number of questions for you but my main one is what I put in the title but if possible could you also cover the following in your answers:


As a mechanical engineer in a product design firm what do you do?

**1.Do you just CAD?**

**2.Is performing an FEA common?**

**3.Are you just told what to model?**

**4.Do you have creative input in the design of the product?**

**5.What engineering knowledge do you use/rely on (for example faliure analysis/structural analysis/materials science etc.)?**

**6.What are your skills that you consider the most important?**

**7.What is your interaction like with the designers?**

**8.What are some misconceptions that outsiders have about your role?**


I realize some of these questions are probably related/overlap but I just wanted to number them to make it easier to reply to an individual question.

Thanks in advance, I know I've asked a lot of questions but I would just like to get an inside view of what it is like to work as a mechanical engineer in product design. Also, if any of you are willing to continue this conversation via PM or email, that would be extremely helpful to myself.

What pieces of information/formulas do i need to use to solve this thing?? How many times its wound? the coefficient of friction between the film and the reel and the film and itself?

I was looking to buy a portable tank for compressed air [like this](http://i.imgur.com/1Q84OfF.jpg), but since i have a reverse osmosis tank lying around ([like this](http://i.imgur.com/vdZm5BE)) i was wondering if i could turn this thing into a compressed air tank so i don't need to buy a new one.

Now, i know that an osmosis tank has a membrane inside: would it be wise to just reach into the tank and puncture it so i can fill both parts with my compressed air (and use its space completely)?

Also, on my osmosis tank it's written that it can hold a max pressure of 125 PSI. I would like to fill it with my compressor which is capable of 8 bar max (slightly less than 120 PSI). By doing this do i risk to see my face sheared from flying metal parts of the tank exploding for the too-close-to-the-limit charge?

-Edit: Thanks for all the answers. You guys are right, actually it was built to whitstand standard domestic water pressure and the fact that upon failure the water would loose pressure instantly would have made the designers of the RO tank to not take into account any safety measure in this direction.

Started studies in mechanical engineering where I did:

-Applied advanced calculus
-Applied ordinary differential equations
-Statics
-Thermo 1
-Engineering management
-Drafting courses
-Materials
-Circuits
-Dynamics

I'm interested in reservoir engineering. The school I applied to said that I could either transfer into their co-op program in petroleum engineering OR if there isn't room I could start all over (re-do cal 1, liner etc).

But I was wondering if it would make more sense to apply for the masters program directly (I'm not sure if I qualify). I would really like to work in the O&amp;G sector.

Would I be limited in jobs considering I wouldn't have gone through the co-op/bachelors route and didn't get any real world experience?

45,"Does anyone know how to build a ""domination cube""?",1395773836,"Hello, /r/askengineers!  I was directed here by my boyfriend, an avid /r/askengineers reader, when I approached him with this.

I work at an indoor go-karting, laser tag, mini-golf facility that has an 8,000 square foot arena.  We've noticed that, when we don't have the arena packed with players, 15 minutes of game play gets tiring.  We've decided to integrate a new system for playing with the introduction of a [""domination cube""](http://battlelux.com/Props/DominationCube/tabid/86/Default.aspx), which acts as a second layer of cooperative game play.  Basically, two teams have to not only kill each other, but throughout the game, they have to illuminate the ""domination cube"" with their team color by pressing a button.  The button will start a timer for the other team.  Once the other team presses the button, a timer will start for the original team; whoever has the most time on the clock by the end of the game loses.

However, purchase of a ""domination cube"" is well outside of our budget; a whopping $2000 for **one**.  We were wondering how much of the total price is for the components and how much is for the cosmetic aspects of the cube?  Is this something that, if we purchase the materials, we can assemble with little to no experience?  Would specialized tools be something that we would need to factor in as well?  

We've watched several YouTube videos of people building their own, but it seems those that build their own are also using their own programs that they've written for the ""cube"".  We just don't have the man/brain power for a job like this.  Does anyone have any advice that may be cheaper than the $2000 alternative?  Thanks!

55,How do I separate soybean seed from large chunks of treatment without restricting flow?,1395725037,"My father and I run a seed sales business that also deals in treating soybeans with inoculant and fungicide.  However, we have a dilemma with the treatment process.  The treatment and treating system we use tend to produce large chunks of dried treatment along with the treated soybeans.  The large chunks have a habit of plugging farmers' planters.  Apparently there have been people that have tried to solve this issued by sieving the grain.  I'm not entirely sure what methods they've tried but they have problems with the outgoing treated soybean seed restricting flow causing the beans to plug the treater.

The treatment system consists of a hopper that weighs the amount of grain to the point that we define via computer.  After the proper amount of seed has been weighed, it is transferred through an inclined conveyor auger to a slightly inclined spinning drum.  Before it enters the drum it is sprayed with the treatment and is tumbled (or at least I think with my minimal knowledge of seed coating physics) to coat the seed more completely.  During the tumbling process it slowly works its way to another conveyor auger that transfers it to a portable hopper (essentially the final destination) in which we dump into the storage containers.

I want to design a sieve system that keeps these large dried chunks of treatment passing through the treatment process without hindering flow.  The only idea I've had so far is constructing a sieve that is set at a very wide angle to the grain coming out of the final auger.  My thoughts were that the increased surface area combined with a wide angle would allow maximum grain flow while still holding back these harmful ""chunks"".

The instrumentation unit has a delrin plug at either end and each plug has two O-ring grooves.


The O-rings will have compressed (30PSI)  air on one side and salt water at up to 25PSI on the other depending on depth.

I used the Parker handbook to design the grooves for [342 sized O-rings](http://www.mcmaster.com/#9452k212/=r8hf1w) and ordered some in Buna-N from McMaster.

I put the O-rings in my plug, used a little grease I had laying about, and slid the plug in with a moderate amount of pressure. Everything was looking great. A few minutes later I tried to get it out and it would not budge. It took a **great deal** of beating on it from the other side to get it out. Once it's full of electronics, I wont be able to do this. It's not something I need to open often, but I sometimes may need to replace a battery or make a repair.

I suspect the pressure rating of my design is WAY over the 30 PSI I need. I tried a smaller (341)  and nitrile O-ring and it was about the same. I'm about to order some size 340 nitrile O-rings, but I thought I'd ask some advice.

Should I keep going down in O-ring ID? Should I use a harder material? THe buna-N seemed to be soft and sort of sticky. Should I use a special lubricant?  I may just use one of the two grooves.
I can also make the grooves deeper, but this is really guesswork. All of this is now outside of the Parker tables.

[X-post from /r/diy],1395527155,"Hey guys, I make [rain barrels](http://imgur.com/a/YpzbC), and have enough water that it now exceeds the needs of my garden. It is not looked upon kindly in my area to use city water to water a lawn, so I would like to use my excess water to give my lawn a little help.

I have entertained the idea of using a portable, electric sprinkler pump, [like this](http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/product_200311411_200311411?cm_mmc=Google-pla-_-Water%20Pumps-_-Booster%20%2B%20Sprinkler%20Pumps-_-109258&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=109258&amp;gclid=CN_B9KGJp70CFYt9OgodPTQALQ), but it would be awesome if I could power the pump with my bike! I am in need of exercise anyway, so it would be cool to be able to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak.

There are so many pump designs available I have no idea where to start. I assume that I will need at least 20-30 pounds of pressure which is similar to the pressure of my city water. If I modified an electric pump, how would I go about figuring out the gear ratios needed to achieve the correct rpm for the pump shaft? Am I right in assuming that I could simply weld a sprocket onto the pump shaft and use a set of gears/chains connected to my bike?

Most of the pumps I have seen deal with ""head"" rather than pressure and solve the problem of pumping water over distance, or up a shaft (to a water tower for distribution). Is it realistic to achieve sustained pressure in the neighborhood of 20-30 psi with a bicycle?

**Edit:**  I actually have no idea how much pressure I would need.  What I should have said, is that I need enough pressure to use [this type of sprinkler](http://img.rakuten.com/PIC/28945339/0/1/500/28945339.jpg).

Here's a quick diagram of what I'm describing:

http://i.imgur.com/RQTdVjA.png

The large black cylinder is a 55 gallon barrel that will be filled with a compost-water slurry. We hope that we'll be able to input unprocessed food - that means banana peels, apple cores, chicken bones and other junk.

This slurry will need to be mixed, and large solids will need to be ground/blended/pulverized into smaller pieces.

The yellow shape at the bottom of the barrel will be formed out of Great Stuff and will serve as a funnel to collect settled solids around the blades.

The gray rod extending down will be a pipe or rod connected to a motor on top (an old 600-watt power drill, plenty of power) and the bottom will have blades (I have an old blender we'd like to salvage, or we could make our own from sheet metal) to break up and agitate the solids on the bottom.

The rod will be fixed at the top by the drill, which will be bolted to a frame and immovable. **The bottom of the rod needs to sit inside a cup or socket to prevent it from wobbling laterally.**

I drew the socket being supported by some wires, because I need to allow sludge the pass down - the bottom of the funnel will be where we drain sludge out.

The socket needs to be corrosion-proof (it will be sitting in compost slurry 24/7) and handle the grinding/rotating force of the rebar rod that sits in it.

The goal in this type of exchanger would be to maximize the heat diffusion while not incurring uneven cooling, as if one end of a CPU die were to be hotter than the rest, that core would likely fail first unless the entire die were well below limits (including the ""hottest"" parts).

Bonus question: I recently read an article that having a water pump flowing too fast means the CPU heat exchanger doesn't have enough time to cool the CPU. That doesn't make any sense at all unless the corresponding liquid-air radiator cannot keep up with it, as the diffusion of heat is always proportional to the potential temperature difference. But I want to confirm that with engineers who still remember their energy equations. So the question is: (Ignoring the water-air radiator) Can you ever have too ""high"" a flow rate as long as the pressure is within limitations?

What prevents analytical solutions to turbulent regimes on a fundamental level? How can there be sudden forces that perturb the flow so much? Is it a culmination of stochastic differences in pressure, temperature, surface textures, etc that cause them? Is Laminar flow really just a very good approximation in which analytical solutions work, and that's why there's so much grey area in transitional Reynold's numbers?

We have switched from a normal 5Mhz .5"" diameter transducer, to s ceramic one, which in my opinion suck. I UT mostly metal castings for my job, and with the new ceramic ones, there is a lot of ""noise/grass"" on the machine, and I cannot get a good reading no matter what setting. Have any of you used these ceramic transducers, and if so how did you like them? Is there a certain setting I need to change, or maybe just get a lower frequency one.

These curved steel supports are found in several Chicago train stations.  Does anyone know more about them?

**How were they made?**  Were they custom-ordered from the rolling mill?  Every beam is curved differently, so I can't see how they could have possibly been mass-produced like I-beams are.  Or did the end-user shape and weld steel plate?  Both seem rather expensive.

**Are they very common?**  I'm guessing they're older, because they always seem to be attached with rivets.  Were they more common at some point in the past?

**Are there structural benefits?** When computers do simplistic [topology optimization](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvf6Dm_HF4A), they usually come up with structures that are much more organic than traditional designs.  Partly this is because the simpler computer models have no knowledge of construction costs, so their structures end up being impractical to actually build.

I'm having a bit of an issue with an IO module.  If you look at the attached picture, I'm having a hard time determining what could be busted.  

Basically, when I set up the module as an output (lower schematic), I can turn on the green LED.  HOWEVER, there is no voltage between the DC relay terminals.  I'm having a hard time understanding how anything could really be broken since there is a fuse in this circuit, and I definitely don't see any blown fuses or red LEDs.  Moreover, there is an optocoupler in this setup.  

The main problem I'm having is that I can't seem to get the input to work.  Like I said, I can turn on the output (green LED turns on), but there's no voltage at its terminals.  And when I try and apply an input, the device does not sense it (green LED doesn't turn on).

Could anyone point me in the right direction here?  I've tried the same setup with other inputs/outputs and they all seem to work fine; it's just one is acting strange and it's either wiring going to the board, or the board itself.

Here is the new opportunity: My friend and classmate called me yesterday about a start-up he recently started working for that is doing some pretty exciting stuff with rotary engines. This company has invested a great deal into industry leading equipment and software. 3D printers, massive and extremely accurate CNC machines, Solidworks (multiple modules), ANSYS. It would be a great opportunity to learn, a huge resume builder. Here is the downside: they have not started generating revenue yet and starting salary would be somewhere in the $35K range, a big step down from what I am making now (almost $65K).  

They know that this salary is garbage, but its all they can afford until they start making money. I am leaning towards taking this job (which is back in my home state as well, something my wife and I miss). I think it would be a great opportunity to learn a lot about manufacturing and real mechanical engineering.   

Are my fears of not being able to get back into engineering at some point founded?  

Is the salary cap for an ME much greater than a salary cap for an HSE professional?

With the experience I am likely to get, will it be worthwhile career-wise? Even if this start-up fails?

Sorry for the text wall, but I would love to hear the opinion of some of you seasoned professionals on this type of career move. Thanks!

63,"Settle a bet about stiffness, solid vs. hollow",1395138190,"So my dad and I got into a discussion tonight, where I mentioned I was using a certain 20mm thick plate to test deflection.  

""Why don't you use a hollow section? It'd be stiffer"" asked my father.  I said I didn't see why it would be, since the solid section is basically the hollow section with extra material inside it.  This is backed up by my understanding of the calculation of I values for cross sections.  I understand that it's not a huuuuge amount stiffer, and the stiffness to weight ratio is better for hollow sections, but my father still insists a hollow section is harder to bend.

Some background, I'm an engineering student so I've been studying cross sections and stiffness calcs.  My dad has been working in the industry for ages, but hasn't got any formal qualifications, so he's talking mainly from experience than theory.

70,20 year old who needs advice on getting into the space/engineering industry (X-post from /r/careerguidance),1395089753,"Hey, so, let me start off with this: I freaking love space and I love the idea of working on projects that further our exploration of this final frontier as a species. Now, like every middle schooler with these interests, I toyed with the idea of working at NASA. Like, that would be sweet right?? Well, soon enough, high school came around and I suddenly lost interest and motivation in everything (I think that's a talk for a different sub, however). The only thing I enjoyed in high school was physics. I loved it and it seemed I was really good at it, or at least good enough to piss off my teacher, who thought I must be cheating to get A's on these tests without ever doing the homework. Math doesn't necessarily come naturally and easy for me, but I can do it and applying it to a physical interpretation makes it easy.

Anyway, I was kind of a crap student, graduating with a 3.2 or something close to that and literally no extracurriculars. Needless, to say I didn't make it into any Ivy Leagues, or MIT, or even my local university. I didn't even apply. I went straight to community college, without a single clue as to what I wanted to do. However, my childhood dream is slowly creeping its way back into me. There is a snag though. My practical 20-year-old brain is thinking long-term: I want a job that pays well. I'm not a super spender, but I'm not super frugal either. I would like to have the security to do what I want, when I want comfortably, and I'm not entirely sure which route, within the ""space industry"", would allow that. So, now I'm lost. I am about to graduate with an Associates with about a 3.7 or so in mostly engineering prereqs, and hopefully get into the best university in my state. But I know I need to do more than that to get into my dream job, which I'm still not entirely sure what it is. I'm a physics major, right now, so I have up through Calc III, Diff Eq, Chem 1 &amp; 2, and Calc-based physics 1 &amp; 2 (mechanics and EM). I hope to also maybe get a minor in physics (remember, I always loved it) because that theoretical particle physics is interesting as hell! Then, as my main job, I would hope to have a relative ""space industry"" engineering job, preferably testing and designing the rocketry or capsule (not entirely sure how specific the jobs get).

So here's where I need the advice: How do I get to where I want to be with my given background? I know internships and co-ops are important, but I've never really looked into it. What do I do? Anyone in the field that can give me some insight? Instead of just NASA, I'm thinking maybe SpaceX is the most promising (and most desirable) company to work for in the industry. And thank you so much in advance. You might practically be saving my future. I know this is probably a FAQ, but I feel like there's more to it than just ""do well in school"", as I'm already halfway through college, and I'm still not sure how to hone in on what I *really* want to do, or how to do it.",AskEngineers,SquirrelicideScience,/r/AskEngineers/comments/20ns2s/20_year_old_who_needs_advice_on_getting_into_the/

Personally, I think this is rubbish.  Yes those skills are important, but I don't think that is how employers decide who to hire.

I believe that in all of my past jobs, the ONLY reason any employer was willing to look at my resume, was because I had *relevant prior experience* in what they were working on.  I knew how to program for the web, I knew how to use PIC, I knew how to do *insert thing here*.  They were wiling to look into me because I had already done a little of what they were already doing.  What really wowed them was my completed work.


But then again, I haven't had the best luck finding a new job lately. 

My resume currently highlights the important technical work that I've done over the past few years (briefly), with mention of some awards.  Will I seriously start getting more offers if I put ""problem solver"" &amp; ""critical thinker"" at the top?  Do I really need to put buzzwords?

I do minor design/redesign, update drawings (with stuff like ""make wire 6"" instead of 4""), author engineering change notices, write other documentation (work instructions/documentation/etc), talk to vendors to source cheaper versions of existing parts, create unique configurations of our appliances for certain vendors (we don't sell directly to customers), write test plans, nag the testers to complete the testing, and then do a bit of code writing to play with the accounting database to make sure that we have the right amount of everything for each configuration.

Unfortunately I'm not very happy with my job. Our company is a bit of a revolving door - I think like 50% of the engineering department has been replaced (quit or fired) since I started. I end up with half-completed/half-baked/undefined-by-management projects that have been languishing for years in the hands of multiple of engineers and am unable to complete them since I've already got plenty of my own. We're asked to set monthly goals for ourselves, but I'm unable to meet them half the time since circumstances change (ie: project gets put on the back burner, parts don't come in on time for new configuration build) or I'm assigned to do something new.

Worst of all I'm not picking up any marketable skills at work - I feel that as an engineer I'm only picking up skills useful to my employer and nobody else. Who else would care why assembly X is put together in a certain way anyway? I've gotten some experience with solidworks and design, but only at a very minor level - certainly nothing to write home about. I've seen senior design projects that are more complicated and have more engineering thought &amp; design behind them than what I do.
