0,Could A Hydroelectric Dam Distill Water Cheaply?,1569885598," I listened to a Joe Rogan Experience a while back with a scientific guest (I think it was his recent one with Tyson). Anyway, they were discussing hydroelectric dams to distill salt water to get both salt and water on a massive scale. Tyson said something like the only reason we're not doing this is because of the cost. How much would it cost to do this on a grand scale? Could it work in theory and execution? How would this work? Are there better ways of doing this that save both energy and money?

7,"Are the emissions for Volkwagen's ""fixed"" diesel cars truly ""fixed""?",1569874625,"Due to stricter NOx and soot emissions standards passed after 2010, most diesel vehicles now require usage of DEF [(Diesel exhaust fluid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_exhaust_fluid) sprayed into the exhaust to reduce excess NOx compounds created by [lean burn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean-burn) engines. A big part of the dieselgate scandal involved ""defeat devices"" that would use higher amounts of DEF/Adblue when detecting the vehicle is under an emissions test. In reality, these cars were found to emit 5-10x more NOx than allowed on average, although this depends on driving conditions - highway cruising on flat land at warm temps result in almost nonexistent NOx and hilly, frequent stop and cold temps being particularly terrible. After the scandal, Volkswagen was ordered to fix non-compliant diesels if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

According to [Car and Driver](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15070079/volkswagen-tdi-diesel-fix-performance/), among the fixable vehicles were some of the third-generation vehicles. The main fix being ""increased usage of DEF by 14%"". Although there are no sources for this figure, perusing some TDI forums suggests around \~20% by various owner's personal reports. Meanwhile the emissions standard for the fixed vehicles were set to Bin160 instead of Bin125, indicating \~25% more emissions than originally claimed.  To me, the chemistry stoichiometry doesn't seem to add up. How can using only 14% more DEF reduce NOx by 4x-8x? Why not increase DEF usage by even more to bring the emissions down to Bin125 as originally promised? Increasing from the current baseline usage of 2.5 gallons of DEF for 10k miles is not a particularly onerous burden. Commercial truck drivers need to use [1 gallon for every 200 miles](https://www.discoverdef.com/def-overview/faq/#consume).

I'm new to electrical engineering and am currently in the process of modding a custom electric scooter I've built. But I need your help.


**Goal:** Be able to turn on/off my electric scooter wirelessly (technology doesn't matter, wireless, blutooth, RFID, something mechanical like a magnet?). Ideally -- it's a passive switch (no power draw from battery when it is off), and more importantly, it HOLDS it's state. So I don't need to hold a magnet to the switch constantly to have it turned on but just need to tap the magnet once to turn the switch on, and tap it again to turn it off. Something like that. I don't want a physical toggle switch because of security issues (don't want some random person to turn on my scooter while I'm away).


The other important parameter is that because this electric scooter will go over unpaved roads and high-vibration environments, it must not just click on/off easily if you hit a big bump.


Finally, the switch will be connected to a 42v lithium ion battery (10 cells) which is then connected to a Flipsky microcontroller. So the switch should be able to handle 42v / high current because presumably the direct drive motor might take in a lot of current?

21,Should I go into Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering?,1569860312,"Hi all,

I'm currently a first semester undergrad, and I'm in a difficult situation right now with deciding whether to go into EE or ME (we don't have to declare right now). My parents are slightly pressuring me towards Electrical Engineering, because from what I've heard them tell me, the job prospects of EE are better than ME.

22,Salary pertaining to what I believe is a unique situation,1569858194,"Hello everyone, I'm new to the group and I'm sure I'm about to ask a common question. The reason why I ask, as opposed to searching through past threads, is because I feel like I fill a pretty unusual role at my company. So, that being said, I will begin my question: What should I be getting paid?

I have been working at a mid size (about 200-250 employees) manufacturing company, based in the Chicagoland area, that has a annual revenue close to 100 million per year. The company is kind of unique in a way because we have 4 total subsidiaries; two that are our own proprietary products (industrial/consumer,) one that is pretty much just a distribution center in Canada, and then a custom manufacturing company that services a lot of pretty large companies. I am responsible for all the engineering throughout the entire company. I design and develop new products for both product lines, I also consult with OEM manufacturers and their engineering teams for DFM on their products, as well as, design for a couple of the smaller ones. I design all tooling, that we build in house, for plastic injection molds, blow molds, and extrusion dies. I also create jigs/fixtures for the plant, supply shop prints for our tool shop, and even write toolpaths for the tool shop for the CNC's. I also deal with foreign tool shops for when we build overseas and review tooling designs, etc. I wear a lot of hats around here and fulfill a lot of responsibilities, as I'm sure some of you do as well. 

I have been involved with molding/manufacturing for 11 years now. I started working for this company a little more than 5 years ago. When I started, I joined a small engineering team (3 people + me) and stuck to tooling. I showed my skills off right away, mainly because I was the most well versed in Solidworks, and was used to a high volume job shop environment where I had to work fast and churn out tool designs. I found myself fulfilling my responsibilities much faster than the rest of the team and so did my superiors. I began taking on a wider array of projects because of my ability to get the work done efficiently. Shortly after this all took place, two of the engineers left- never to be replaced. It left me and the chief engineer to fulfill the companies needs. After about another year, they let the Chief Engineer go due to poor work performance and unwillingness to learn new technology. Only being with the company for about 2-2.5 years, I was told that I would assume all responsibilities but that they were unwilling to give me the ""Chief Engineer"" title. I understood this; I was only 26 at the time and knew that I took an unusual road to get here. I don't have a bachelors in ME. I have two associates, but a hell of a lot of work experience. My father owned the tool shop I worked at prior to working here, and I started working with him-in a limited role- from the age of 12. I typically just begin my relative work experience from the age of 18 (I will be 30 in a couple months.) 

When the Chief Engineer was let go, I was ""promoted"" and given the title of project engineer. I was told that he didn't want to constrain my skill set to just one area of expertise and that this title was broad enough to throw me in to any meeting with clients/customers and have ""legitimacy."" I.E: he didn't want me to carry a tooling engineer title into a meeting to discuss product development. 

Anyway, I feel that it's time to at least establish that I am the Lead Engineer here. I don't feel that I'm over reaching for that title considering a pretty strong background, as well as, just the simple fact that I am the only one here providing this service and have been for about 3 years. Searching the typical sites to see what my salary should be around, I feel like I'm extremely underpaid, depending on what one's definition of underpaid would be. I'm seeing average ""Lead Project Engineer"" base salaries in the Chicagoland area reported at about $90k +/year. I am paid far less than that. I also don't receive any bonuses, the medical here is trash, No 401k matching but every other year we get profit sharing, and I get 2 weeks vacation with another 5 sick days. 

I apologize for the long form question here; I wanted to provide as much information from the start to provide the context. Let me know what you think. I realize it's just opinion, but I will be entering salary negotiations soon- I haven't received an increase in about 2.5 years- and some confidence on where my position stands or a slap in to reality would be beneficial. Maybe I'm wrong and overvaluing myself. I don't see that being the case, but hey, we're all guilty of that from time to time.",AskEngineers,False,sbucaro89,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dbdfrv/salary_pertaining_to_what_i_believe_is_a_unique/
23,Could moving walkways realistically be used for public transit in a city?,1569857831,"In your opinion, would it ever make sense for a city to leverage a series of moving walkways through tunnels as part of a public transit system?

-  can be put in smaller tunnels
-  having multiple parallel walkways in a tunnel would allow for the direction to be flipped based on demand
-  can still function as walkways even if not running 
- continuous flow would avoid bunching if a train is delayed 
- removes danger from people being hit by trains or third rail, etc 


Cons: 
- slower than a subway train
- would require tunnel or other enclosure 
- not feasible for long distances 
- would require a solution for differently abled riders
- would require patrolling and enforcement to avoid people traveling on bikes through tunnels or otherwise disrupting the facilities.

25,I have ideas on how to improve all types of digital cameras in low light and/or high dynamic range scenes. What are your thoughts?,1569856294,"I do photography and teach myself technical stuff on my own time. I use it for problem solving and looking for opportunity. I oberserved problems digital cameras have in low light scenes of different types.

For candlelight scenes with candle flames, there are extreme gaps between bright and dark. The flames and the areas reflecting off the flames matter. The black areas don't. It's nearly impossible to capture the two that matter without clipping the flames. Black areas that reflect almost no light mislead auto exposure systems. My solution is to have the AE system assign similar areas to subgroups (strata). If a region does not reflect enough light, it's ignored. If it emits light rapidly, it will tell the camera to lower the gain applied to that region. The calculation of the scene is based on the subgroups instead of the whole.

To handle the gap between bright and dark, analog gamma compression will be used. I got this idea from a 2014 research paper published in a journal. It is to fit a high ratio between bright and dark into a reasonable number range (10 or 12 bits per channel) without punishing intentional overexposure. To raise the gain and number values of what's reflected off the flames, the analog gain will be reduced for the flame regions while it stays the same everywhere else. The gain reduction can go from one half to one eighth. It's like having an ISO of 800 except for the flames which is reduced down to 100.

For moderate dynamic range ultra low light, analog gamma compression will be used too. This is to reduce downstream noise. The size of the recording area and photon count are less important than lowering the proportion of random fluctuations know as noise. It's why the Red Helium 8K has better performance at ISO 800 than the Phase One IQ4 150 MP at ISO 35. If the Red Helium is exposed for ISO 35, it'll just go to white.

The sensor will be the Organic Photoconductive Film CMOS sensor designed by Panasonic. The current applied to the film layer influences the analog gain. The charge storage is separate. This combined with analog gamma compression will help lower downstream noise.

For the RAW format, push/pull factor can be applied on camera and/or in post while in RAW mode. This raises or lowers the output number values before the profile/LUT gets applied. The profile/LUT will be used for preview only unless it's exported. After demosaicing, the gamma compressed numbers get converted into a 32 bit linear curve in the memory. The 32 bit values are not in storage but are instead used in the rendering stage. The RAW processor can also show what colors will get substituted when a specific profile/LUT is used. This will thus rely on analog gain and post conversion exposure value adjustment.

Ideally, I'd like the camera to blow the ultra low light multi-purpose Canon camera out of the water. I'd like for it to have APS-C/Super35 type sensor dimensions instead of full frame. This is to get more depth of field. Again, the electrical design influences noise more than photon count and recording area dimensions. The 8K resolution would be great too.

It essentially takes a magnetic stirrer and turns it horizontally and has more of a propeller shape to create a current in my fishtank while having the electrical components on the outside of the tank. The product exists but they're pretty expensive. I am wondering how easy it would be to create an electro magnet that creates a circular current? Are there any household items I could use and repurpose?

What we cant seem to figure out is why the ""long"" faces in this four-lobed profile are not completely flat? They have a large radius curvature, but for manufactuability it seems that making the long faces perfectly flat would be much easier (cheaper) to machine. We are tempted to just use the profile as inspiration and just make the faces flat anyways just to keep the machining cost down, but as we cannot afford to machine these profiles twice, we wanted to make sure there was not some obvious reason that the long faces are curved in the first place. I'm sure there is a good reason, but we can't seem to reason it out. If someone has an idea and could shed some light, that would be greatly appreciated.

62,Can an electric motor create eccentric overload during flywheel rehabilitation?,1569784702,"Biology student interested in some engineering... This is not a class project. I recently learned about fly wheel training for rehabilitation. The basic idea, a person does a squat on a platform wearing a belt that's attached by a cable to an axel with a weighted disc... as the person stands up, the axel turns, and creates force (torque)... the faster the person stands up, the more force is created. When the person reaches the top of the squat, the cable is completely unwound from the axel and is then wound around the axel in the opposite direction, as the axel continues to turn, pulling the person down... generally, a therapist may pull up on the cable as the person does the concentric phase of the movement to add force, that the person will have to control during the eccentric phase of the squat... It's my understanding that the main reason the training is effective is because of eccentric overload. The next repetition, the wheel rotates the opposite direction. I'm curious if we could build a flywheel platform that would have an electric motor to add resistance to create a consistent/adjustable eccentric overload, instead of needing the assistance of a therapist. I would like to have an electric motor increase the speed of a flywheel. Is this practical? I have access to a shop and tools. I think I can make a flywheel platform with rock climbing webbing, go-kart axel, bearings, and a metal platform.  I have a friend that can help me run the platform with an Arduino/RaspberryPi. Any idea of the type and cost of the electric motor? How would you setup the motor with the shaft? It's my understanding that I can't connect the motor directly to the axel, because the motor will only assist the movement... but maybe I could use a differential, or something similar?

67,Input Lag/Display Problems Related to Power/Electrical issues?,1569780752,"Figured I would give this a shot here.  Well here goes, Ive been dealing with this issue for awhile so hopefully I can get some advice.

Symptoms:

Input lag across the board in both games and windows, both mouse and keyboard inputs are inconsistent and change over time. At times the dpi increments on my mouse hardly change the sensitivity, other times it adjusts a ton. The monitor display suffers hitches, and micro stutters, of the same varying consistency. Makes game play at 140fps and below look and feel like 60 or lower. Internet webpages load slower, you tube videos and twitch buffer at random times with no packet loss. At times the lag is minimal at times its unbearable. The input lag and video hitches seem entirely inconsistent however I have found that nearly any hardware state change/software change can affect it to varying degrees. This is 100% not a software problem as I have seen this across multiple versions of Windows, games, a Nintendo switch as well.

Things I have tried:

3 different PC's (completely different specs) 3 different monitors (120hz, 144hz, 240hz) 5 different mice (Logitech G-Pro x2 models , Razer Deathadder x3 models) 3 different mousepads 3 different keyboards Using different circuits and configurations around the house. (some work better than others, however input lag is still present) Different power strips, power conditioners Tested for outlet grounding with 3 pronged tester.

Things that change the mouse/keyboard behavior and monitors display quality:

Moving the monitor/router/modems/pcs power cord to different outlets, different power strips etc. Note: My Wi-Fi does not even work if my router/modem are on the same outlet/power strip- the signal shows up but no connection. Changing which USB ports the keyboard/mice are plugged into. Applying tinfoil to any power cord, or mice/keyboard USB cables. Applying Ferrite beads to any of the above cords. Changing nearly any BIOS/Windows 10 settings. Adjusting GPU fan/power settings. Adjusting nearly any settings in NVIDIA control panel change the mouse behavior. Adjusting/propping up the GPU (seems like the positioning changes mouse behavior heavily). Changing case fan profiles- usually lowering fan speed/power is better. Monitor settings (brightness, color, resolution). Placing phone onto the PC case (doubles mouse sensitivity immediately). Changing where the router/modem is or moving the power cords. Separating all cables from each other.

Other things of note:

Nintendo Switch controllers have the same input lag. PC hums when its plugged in but not on. Sound quality on headphones/speakers is occasionally better or worst. Speakers have an audible hum.

So I am a bit at a loss, it has to be something with my houses wiring or a ground loop being created somewhere, raising the noise floor in the system which in turns causes data loss? There seems to be others out there with nearly the exact same symptoms but none of the solutions they have given so far seem to solve the problem indefinitely. The input lag always comes back and mouse/keyboard behavior is totally inconsistent. At times it operates nearly perfectly but not for long.

I am considering purchasing a double conversion UPS as some people recommended that if it is power related, which I do not see how it couldn't be. Anyway if you have any thoughts/advice it would be much appreciated. There seems to be more than a few people out there with this problem or close to it. A few of us cross referenced symptoms and affects and found nearly the exact same things. How can I fix it if its a ground loop or other power related issue? Thanks if this is the wrong place to ask point me in the right direction.

I work as a robotic integrator, basically, I program and design cells and robots, vision systems, and what not to automate a task. It can be fun sometimes, but so far at my job management and sales have dropped the ball and messed the projects up so much that at this point of 1.5 years there I can't state I've had a successful project as to date. For the first year, there were no paid projects outside of the first one which I was told was to be a learning experience, and it was with an aerospace customer. That project took far longer than I can admit due to the equipment my boss procured not meeting the demands and customs parts being 3d printed instead of machined and having very poor results. Hell, halfway through the project I found we promised things that were not possible to be repeatable with the robot, and even once sold the results were barely repeatable because of those limitations.

I had a partner to assist in automation, my original manager but he hated every aspect of the automation department and now has finally was able to not be associated with automation and just do his projects. My salesman was a fresh college graduate that had 0 experience with sales outside of sucking up to management, so for a whole year we got 0 sales from him but often he would be complimented due to his work ethic or something, (honestly him I don't like because I've lost count the number of times he became buddy buddy with the boss and would take credit for things the automation team did.) He finally started getting sales as of late so now I have projects to work on that are being funded, but I only found out that the goals tasks he stated for me to do and what is really needed to do were often two different things and this has resulted in several times the floor manager of wherever we were doing an installation stating where was this and that and why doesn't the light tower have the color blue? I've raised my concerns and issue with my boss but he's told me not to worry that sales know what they're doing and that I should just keep doing my job.

The weirdest thing I have is my boss, doesn't stay focus on any given task and often tells me to jump on other tasks when I'm already in the middle of a task and then get mad when the previous task wasn't finished, causing me to work holidays or weekends to meet deadlines that he has yet to acknowledge and even condone me of not working late every night like his other coworker that would send him to work emails at 3 am. I also found out he thinks I bring little value of the company and am lazy (was denied a raise, I make nothing close to a mechanical engineer, especially one regarding robotics, vision, programming and so on). 

&amp;#x200B;

With all this I would think at least I am learning engineering standards and such because we work with aerospace and we're technically an ITAR facility. But we even fail on that ground with security, employee selection, and using any proper engineer methodologies. Though we work in ITAR and are supposed to have only US citizens working in our labs and have some sort of security so visitors can't just enter and SOMETHING to be secured, but in our lab there's nothing stopping people seeing high-security equipment we're working on and a good quarter of our staff are not born from this country and handle sensitive equipment, along with visitors and so on completely ignoring security standards. I have no issue working with people not from here, but I also take security and safety seriously. Again I raised my concerns about this and was told ITAR and that was mostly just a name, but whenever any government/military customer comes we have to hide or foreign workforce for the day, usually at a local Starbucks or something or just told not to come in that day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't mind getting a new job, but this is my second job as my first one was 10 months right out of college just to not be homeless lol, but it had nothing to do with robotics.

So what is the software you use with some measuring system like metric system, etc., to plan, to having it made first digitally, so it could more easily be simulated out to real world 3d-space.

If you strongly disagree with the following, you probably got experience only with bad software or very old primitive software:

The point of using 3D software as a planning tool, makes sense if the software is being substantially easier/faster to being building with, than trying to building straight into real word 3d-space using only software in your head with pen and paper as output, as pen/paper sort of more primitive tools of extension of mind, being less useful when comparing to what a great 3d software can do, to speeding up the process enabling you to do a lot more, to become aware of details and how they fit together, etc. So with that said, a really bad 3d software I imagine possibly being worse than making it on paper due cluttering up with unnecessary steps in such way slowing the process down.

So interesting to know what others like you use and more interestingly why they use.

78,Shifting from MEP Engineering,1569740479,"As a preface, academically I'm a chemical engineer who entered the industry mainly due to the proximity to where I live and because of the convenience of living that came with this particular job. I can't definitely say at the moment whether or not this decision was a mistake, but I'm asking for advice and guidance.

I started working at an MEP firm straight out of college (at this point over two years), and I've read all the complaints about the MEP industry. However, I feel like I've been treated relatively well; my salary isn't as bad as I thought it would have been, and I'm given many responsibilities at work (I do all trades, be it calculating heating/cooling loads, electrical loads/conduit sizing, controls sequencing, hydraulic calcs, etc. and I'm also given project management responsibilities).

I don't hate my job, there's enough variety, and I get to surprisingly get to use many of the things I learned from my time in college at work. But that's my issue, I'm just content. While I don't hate the field, I don't love it either and would like to shift industries, possibly something related to chemical engineering, but I'm pretty open.

Is it possible to still shift industries at this point or am I too entrenched in the field? I'm around halfway to being able to apply for the PE, is it worth obtaining that first prior to shifting industries? Would the PE help in shifting to a non mechanical engineering industry?

And there's no convincing them with engineering principles, or manufacturer manuals.

I don't know how to make that go better. To get these people to work with me, and be less combative.  How would you all do it?

______
I posted on /amitheasshole earlier.. so here's my post from that.

I've worked at this place for 7 years now. It's always been dysfunctional. It's a young company, most the original employees are still running it. Everything is a silo, if you get along with this employer #1-5 person, then they'll support you, and get people to help you. If you don't play that game, and just do your job, then you aren't a friend and they tend to gang up on you.

Because of this, a lot of friends get hired. But they may only do 2 of 5 tasks for a job. They'll claim the rest isn't their job. That tends to leave me doing a lot of things that aren't in my job, because they impede me from getting my work done. Worse, certain people will purposefully do things wrong to fuck over my work.

I've got strong moral support from the CEO, but he doesn't put the other people on the same page to stop being dicks to me.

We had several meetings and documents created for a project last year. Things got delayed, and we never executed the project. Finally did it this month. And a bunch of those guys spent Thursday just ripping into it, ""this isn't how this is done... and I'd never do this.. and you did this wrong.""... funny thing is. We refurbished a machine, and it mostly met the plan discussed and approved a year ago. All we did was change 2 components to get it ready. The rest of the ""mistakes"" belonged to the guys criticizing it because they built it... not me.

I was getting bombarded by 4 people picking on me.. and I argued back.. pointed out what errors were theirs, etc... answered/explained some of the concerns they had. The conversation didn't go well.... how would it.. they ganged up on me and made me defensive. This isn't the first time they've done that type of stuff to me.. It's incredibly backstabby.

So I went to my CEO and told him what happened, and that I was going to use a week of my 5 weeks of PTO to take some time to cool off because I didn't care to keep arguing with these guys. They're purposefully doing things wrong and making it harder for me and I've been putting up with it and soldiering on for YEARS. He said he understood, but he couldn't fix those people, and that I just had to hold on for a bit and things might improve.

He's the CEO.. and the owner. It's really simple to make those people improve, or FIRE them. He's assigned those people tasks recently and they refuse to do them even.. and he's letting it go. We've had a lot of decent people quit in the last 2 years... and I'm on my way out too. He asked me several times to not quit or look for a job (he brought it up, not me)... sure.. boss. I'm not leaving. But this shit needs to improve.

Going to take a week off.. I've got projects and things running that need my attention.. but fuck it. If they fail, not my problem right now. I know I'm letting some other decent people down too.. but what can I do? I'm tired of being beaten like a dead horse with all this dysfunction and cliquishness at work.

AITA?

Edit: I have been looking for a new job for the past few years. It's a part time hobby to look. I work in a specialized area, and jobs in that come up rarely. When they do, they're based far from where I currently live. I already live far from my parents. They're both older, and have some health issues, so I don't want to move further away. Thursday night I applied for 10 jobs in unrelated areas, but my degree qualifies me. So we'll see how that goes. My plan is to keep applying/updating my resume to fit some other jobs in my general field. At this point, I am very willing to switch industries. Moving out of town would be a bitch because I signed a year lease that states I need to pay out the whole lease if I break it, but I did have them add a provision to let me out if they can sublet it...so I have some support/break there.

Edit 2: This is a 200+ person company. I report to the CEO because my Director quit 2 years ago and he was never replaced. I manage the day to day of my team, but I don't have full control over their employment. I can't write them up for being slackasses, or hire new people. We've got no one advocating or representing our dept overall in mgmt or the company. So just constantly get screwed over because of that. Certain things were moved out of our department to others (which makes my job harder like dealing with those 4 guys) because we didn't have a manager to run those things. My team used to be 8 people when I started. Currently we're down to 4. We hired 1 new person, and he quit in his 3rd week. He's incredibly talent..he realized how fucked up things were, and one of the toxic VP's got mouthy with him and was being terrible. The guy just said ""Fuck it, you can't talk to me like that. I'm done here."" And 2 days later he had a job at a better company related to his passion/skill.",AskEngineers,False,govt259,/r/AskEngineers/comments/danxbf/how_do_you_deal_with_a_toxic_workplace/

I have three issues with my past and current situation that make me worry about qualifying.  I have no idea if these things are automatic dealbreakers, or if they are no issue as long as I am upfront about them:

\+ The biggest worry I have is that I have a misdemeanor DUI from 5 years ago.  I have been completely sober since that event, but I doubt that makes a difference.  I went to court, paid my fine, was on a few months of probation, and sought counseling for my drinking problem on my own.  I wouldn't have any issue explaining it, and I completely own up to my past there.  But it's not the most comfortable thing to lead with in an interview, if it affects a clearance.

\+ During my academic background, I had three research trips to Beijing.  Two for three weeks, and a third for three months.  I had a visa to work at a research lab there that was collaborating with my (American) University.  The project was a large, multinational collaboration involving dozens of universities in countries around the world.  Could this be an issue?

\+ Finally, I've struggled with depression on and off since college.  I've usually been in therapy, and I've had it under control for the most part since taking medication.  I still keep up with occasional therapy and psychiatry visits for maintenance.  

With these three issues, should I even apply for positions where they will eventually want a clearance?  If they are major issues to me receiving any clearance, is there anything else I can do to mitigate the problems?

Hello Guys,

I'm a mechanical engineer and working as a transmission design engineer. This week, I'm invited to job interview by AVL for ev battery pack design engineer position. Even though I haven't experience about ev battery packs in my CV, they wanted to employment interviewing with me. Then i've received a case study that asked to design a conceptual battery pack for a global OEM customer which will be implemented to a SUV segment vehicle.

I want to make presentation even I don't have knowledge about this topic and I am making my own studies. So I need some help until thursday. Theese are boundary conditions of the package and cell details:

**i) Cell and Busbar Details:**

   o Cylindrical Cell: Diameter: 10 mm, Energy Capacity: 35 Wh

   o Pouch Cell: Dimensions: 80\*10 mm, Energy Capacity: 140 Wh

   o Busbar dimensions w/o isolation 15x3 mm (Isolation 1 mm for lateral faces)

**ii) Battery Pack and EE Unit Boundary Conditions:**

 Maximum Pack Volume: 1200\*1700 mm\^2

 EE Unit Area: 300\*350 mm\^2  

**iii) Minimum Clearances:**

   o Module configuration: 6s1p

   o Cell to cell clearance: 0.5 mm

   o Cell to enclosure/housing clearance: 2 mm

   o Busbar to busbar clearance: 7 mm

   o Busbar to other components: 5 mm

   o Module to Module clearance: 3 mm

**With the given information:**

**1)** Compare the cell types by volumetric efficiency, specific energy and their thermal management capabilities. Select a cell type, explain your decision.

**2)** Determine number of cells in one module, and number of module for the pack. Design an «one type module» for the battery pack. (Determine cell stack and HV terminal locations only). See appendix for battery module examples.

**3)** Develop a cooling concept to keep thermal balance between cell and modules. If liquid cooling concept would be needed, how will you draw the cooling channel route and locate the coolant input and output connectors? Explain your design and compare its advantages and disadvantages.

**4)** Complete the pack design with optimum module stack, busbar routing and EE Unit arrangement. Explain your design by considering volumetric efficiency, specific energy and thermal management capabilities. See appendix for battery pack

**5)** Please make a short BOM (Bill of Material) list of your battery package. See Appendix for an example.

**Notes:**

   o Do not use any 3D modelling software, try to create your design as rough 2D sketches by using PowerPoint tools. The important thing is way of your thinking.

   o Do not consider the Z dimensions of the components. Create your design on XY plane as 2D dimension. See appendix for vehicle axis system.

   o The busbar with the given details is to be used only for the connections between modules.

   o Do not consider any electrical boundary conditions (max voltage, current etc.). Create your package only with given mechanical and thermal boundary conditions.

Now every meeting, when systems input is needed, everyone looks at me because my lead isn't there. After every meeting I'm shocked that people take my word seriously.

36,What is the best subject to study to effectively combat pollution?,1569613408,"Hi r/AskEngineers, just to elaborate on the title a little bit, the area that I have found that checks the most of these boxes so far is contaminant hydrogeology as it involves the study of the flow of groundwater and the fate and transport modelling of its contaminants. However, most civil engineering or earth science programs that I know of do not involve the study of inorganic and organic chemistry that I assume would be needed to determine what remediation methods are necessary to deal with a contaminated site. If I were to want to deal with pollution directly, would engineering be the right path or should I focus more on environmental chemistry? Are there any engineers reading this that work on contaminated sites that could shed some light on the work that you do?

I recently purchased a Roomba E6, and it’s inconsistency and random patters are driving me crazy. I want to it to clean in a smarter pattern. 

I started doing some research and saw that, in very old Roomba models, people hacked them to do just that. They put an IR sensor, along with other components, and basically created a decritized mapping program. SOUNDS NEAT!

Rather than spending $1000 on a new Roomba that can do that, does anyone know how I could begin doing that? Or does anyone have experience “hacking” their Roomba? I heard they made recent models hacker-proof since iRobot made an app....

Current situation: The lead ME (~150k salary) resigned last week leaving the company in a tough spot. So I’ve been offered a promotion to corporate engineering to help quickly fill the void. This means additional responsibilities, increased work load, and around 50% travel.

Considering the situation, what would you guys consider to be a fair raise?  Also, what are some tips to countering an offer if I feel the raise is not worth the additional travel, responsibilities, etc?

What I mean are guns that 

* Can evaluate a situation whenever a shot should be fired (e.g. don't fire when many unarmed people are around, don't fire when the target is an unarmed human and too far away to be a threat, don't fire when the targeted person is running away) 
* That can sense each other (e.g. signal when a person with a gun is near you, don't fire when a gun used by the police is pointing at you)
* Maybe even help firing a saver (non lethal) shot (e.g. show you where you would hit your target when firing in the position you're currently holding your gun, sensing shaky hands and stabilize a shot although I have no idea if that's even possible)

Is it possible to design a gun like this that is actually usable and affordable (now or in the near future)? Or would you end up with an expensive brick nobody would use?",AskEngineers,False,srln23,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d9szga/are_intelligent_guns_possible/

However, the broiler function consistently causes the circuit breaker to trip in a few mins of switching it on. I gave up after a while.

I love solving problems and creating systems. Not remotely as complex as the systems you guys create/use (are there definitions? Categories?), but I love putting things in order, and *not* in the ""I'm so obsessive I sort my skittles"" kind of way. At work I was asked to tidy up the room where we keep our marketing materials: basically a bunch of ""metal skeletons"" that each had 1-3 ""fabrics"" with different messages on it. I spent three days organizing and loved it! I created a spreadsheet so all my coworkers could tell what each set contained (Set A has an X, Y and Z) and also which fabrics were available for each skeleton (Skeleton X has fabrics available from set A, B and C). Each item also got their own bag with a tag showing the name, size, set belonging and a tiny picture.

I did a stint in retail for three years and while working as a cashier, there was a tiny shelf where returned items would sit and wait for someone to put them back on the shelves, or throw out. The problem was that since everyone was moving, like going on breaks, the information regarding which items were supposed to be thrown out or put back was lost. So I made two arrows - a green one saying ""return"", pointing to one end, and a red one pointing to the other saying ""throw"". Problem solved, and I am still so proud of this achievement but I've yet to find someone who agrees with me, haha! I also designed another spreadsheet (big surprise) helping new cashiers get an idea of where hard placed, returned items would go. This sheet had information on where to put back the item depending on coldness (frozen, cold or non-applicable), and what each department roughly contained.

I'm betting this is a weird question, but I've been told by people in the past that ""this"" is what ""engineers"" does. I'm not looking to change careers but I would really love to read more about systems and maybe how people act when using them, but I have trouble defining it. I've scoured the web and found terms like ""sociotechnical systems"", ""system engineering"" and even tried the wikipedia page for ""industrial and organizational psychology"". Maybe this is more an IT/data thing?

I grew up artsy in an artsy household and have a learning disability with numbers, so nothing besides the organizing part comes easy to me. (I ended up reading about graph theory and nearly had a heart attack!) Basically, I'm trying to find out if this is something I can low key study, or if I have to accept my new identity as one of those neat, organized Pinterest people. :-)

15,Any advice on deciding between Astrophysics/Physics or Electrical and Electronic engineering?,1569485451," Hi there and sorry for asking something which has probably been asked a million times.

I'm a student applying to uni in the UK and am struggling to decide between the two subjects stated above. I have a love for physics and really enjoy learning about it, especially learning about space. Therefore, I originally thought that Astro would be a good degree. I find that kind of stuff fascinating and have a desire to understand the amazing thing which is the universe, I just find it so incredible to look up at a night sky and just let myself get lost in awe at its scale and beauty. However, what put me off this was I was not sure I wanted to work in research or academia. Further, I wasn't sure I would want to stay in education for that long. The job market is also apparently very competitive in astro. My other worry was should I decide not to pursue an academic career I may end up in a software or data analysis job which doesn't excite me, I would prefer a more technical/engineering job.

Therefore, I decided that EEE would be a good fit. I'm still very interested in this (although not as much as astrophysics). Things such as semiconductors, photonics, high voltage and power engineering, RF, etc all seem really interesting. Also, learning how things work and how to create them does appeal quite a bit too. However, one of the main reasons I changed to this was the greater career prospects in fields I'm interested in compared to astro. Things such as the electrical grid, RF, Optical communications, engineering spacecraft, railways and public transport, etc all fascinate me (aswell as engineering things such as the LHC or telescopes). Also, these do not require a PhD (with the exception of the LHC maybe) unlike astro jobs and if I were to want to go into physics PhD opportunities are available in Optics or accelerator physics and similar fields.

Although I've mostly made up my mind on EEE I still do have this nagging desire to ignore careers and just embrace my pure interest to learn how the unverse it self works. This, however, would worry me with regards to finding technical, non-academic careers, should I decide not to do a PhD.

17,Agreed to help an acquaintance with a job reference. Realized later she probably won't make a good employee...what do I do?,1569483485,"Sorry if this isn't an appropriate post for the sub. Please lmk and I'll post elsewhere.

Someone I went to school with and is moderately close to asked me for a referral for a job at my (decent sized) company. I agreed on the spot without really thinking about it, since I knew she really needed a job and the position she's interviewing for is at a department I don't really interact with. However, as her interview day approaches I started thinking about how I'm going to tell the hiring manager about her, and quickly remembered/realized she doesn't really fit in here. Reasons include abrasive personality, general inexperience/incompetency, thinking everything bad that happens to her is because of racism/sexism/etc, and so on. To be fair, she did allegedly have to deal with some racism and sexism which is why she thinks that way. She's not a bad person, just unpleasant sometimes -- especially when working together on a project. 

I have already told the hiring manager (who is aware of us knowing each other since she told him I'm her best friend, lol) I'd happy to have a chat regarding her potential employment at the company. Well, I have no idea what I'm going to say about this person. Honestly, I think the company can do better than her; that said, I'm a junior guy myself and still have lots to learn. My real concern is her impudence. If she pulls her usual crap on the people around here she'll get fired before Christmas and it'll be at least 1/4 my fault. 

What's my best course of action here? Should I be honest and tell the hiring manager she may not be a good fit, or do I give her a chance and pitch a generic praise?

26,Shifting from MEP Engineering,1569466472,"As a preface, academically I'm a chemical engineer who entered the industry mainly due to the proximity to where I live and because of the convenience of living that came with this particular job. I can't definitely say at the moment whether or not this decision was a mistake, but I'm asking for advice and guidance.

I started working at an MEP firm straight out of college (at this point over two years), and I've read all the complaints about the MEP industry. However, I feel like I've been treated relatively well; my salary isn't as bad as I thought it would have been, and I'm given many responsibilities at work (I do all trades, be it calculating heating/cooling loads, electrical loads/conduit sizing, controls sequencing, hydraulic calcs, etc. and I'm also given project management responsibilities).

I don't hate my job, there's enough variety, and I get to surprisingly get to use many of the things I learned from my time in college at work. But that's my issue, I'm just content. While I don't hate the field, I don't love it either and would like to shift industries, possibly something related to chemical engineering, but I'm pretty open.

Is it possible to still shift industries at this point or am I too entrenched in the field? I'm around halfway to being able to apply for the PE, is it worth obtaining that first prior to shifting industries? Would the PE help in shifting to a non mechanical engineering industry?

28,Should I quit my first job out of college with nothing else lined up?,1569466107,"I've been at my first job out of college working as an engineer for 8 months now, and my boss is going to make me drive into a lake. 

It's a small mechanical engineering company, under 5 people in the office and over 10 in the metal shop. 2 of the people in the office work on a product line that's been around for 25 years and basically perform the same tasks over and over each day. 

That leaves my boss and I to do everything else. And when I say everything I mean everything. It's a 2 man dog and pony show. I feel so overloaded its ridiculous. My boss basically spends his whole day hustling me around. If I am not at the edge of my seat or running around the shop, he thinks I'm slacking. I'm basically working in a state of perpetual anxiety. He's in and out of my office basically every 10 minutes. It's extreme micromanagement to the core. Here is the amount of time I've spent with him this week:

Monday: 7 hours and 52 minutes out of 8 hours (yes you read that right).

Tuesday: 3 hours and 50 minutes out of 8 hours

Wednesday: 6 hours and 10 minutes out of 9 hours. 

He admits I am doing the job of 3 people, but its more like 5. I am basically our company's: 

1. Mechanical Engineer (It's my responsibility to manage our entire company's 3D library (1,500+ files), make 3D designs, handle drawings, and deal with all the revisions associated for multiple $100,000 projects that come through the pipeline every 60 days). 

2. Project Engineer (It's my responsibility to manage the product procurement, bill of materials for projects that have hundreds of parts and assemblies, work with fab workers to manufacture my 3D designs, track and arrange the order and shipment of inbound parts and outbound products, etc.) 

3. Sales Engineer (Handle sales calls and emails for separate accounts. Process these orders, build these orders myself in the shop, and ship them out myself.)

4. Manager in training (Basically be my bosses lap dog and spend all day with him learning how to do his job.)

5. Safety Manager (Learn OSHA safety standards enforce safety rules, and prepare and give presentations to shop workers).

He's basically setting me up to fail. He gives me all these responsibilities and prevents me from doing them.

I consider myself an extremely competent person and capable of figuring out almost anything, but I feel like what's being asked of me is insane. It would take at least 60 hours a week to do all this stuff, and I'm not allowed to go into overtime. I have to stay at 40 hours. Part of the problem is also that my boss won't let me do any work on my own. He has to be there to supervise. So he makes me responsible for all of this, and hounds me if it isn't done, but gets upset if I do things without him there. He has a very short temper and gets upset all the time about silly things. He basically started yelling at me yesterday when I didn't understand his explanation of something (he's all over the place with his explanations), and yelling at me today when I couldn't directly recall the minute details of something he basically scribbled on a piece of paper yesterday. 

I tried to discuss this with my boss on several occasions, telling him how overworked I am and there's no way I can get all this done. He basically just laughs at me and tells me to ""learn how to manage it."" He tells me to get used to it, and that this is my life now and I have no choice.  Even though we are in record sales and profits (he said so himself and showed me the data), he refuses to hire more people to help. 

This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if I had friends at work or liked my boss. There are no young people at my work and my boss is absolutely despise-able. He has extremely low emotional intelligence. He's the definition of how to lose friends and alienate people. He criticizes, condemns, and complains to all his employees. All the shop workers fear him and I can see it in their eyes. He has them running around like lapdogs, and the only reason they stay is because none of them have degrees and probably couldn't get hired somewhere else. He's constantly talking about himself and what he likes all day long. He drones on and one about things I don't care at all about and doesn't register any of my body language cues that I'm not interested. He says how much he likes me and says how good of a worker I am but doesn't realize how much I despise him. 

Last week I took 2 days off work and couldn't get out of work because of stress. I've been applying to jobs in my free time the 2 weeks but haven't heard anything yet. Him and HR giving me the Safety Manager responsibilities is what I really feel like is gonna be the straw to break the camels back. I have anxiety disorder and I don't deal well with extreme multi tasking. This is something I work on with my doctor. According to him, having anxiety disorder can make you a good engineer because it allows you to anticipate problems that others may not have anticipated. However, your brain basically freezes up when you have too many tasks to do. It's like having a computer with too many tabs open. 

I tried to tell him I am much better at focusing on problems and getting them done and then moving onto the next one. He then told me he's going to pull me in 16 different directions with a big smile on his face while staring me dead in the eyes. He seems to get a lot of pleasure when he finds out I don't like doing something. When he gave me the title of safety manager, I told him I'm really uncomfortable with doing it, given all that I already have to do, and don't know anything about the subject. He got a huge smile on his face and said loudly ""Oh you're doing it!"".

31,"Engineers of reddit, how do you retain your textbook knowledge while in the field?",1569464674,"Graduated in MechE and have been in the field for 3 years now as a quality engineer. I’m realizing that I’m starting to forget a lot of the deep theory from back in school and it’s really starting to bother me. Earlier this year I opened my systems dynamics textbook, which I got an A+ in, and I was shocked to see that I was struggling to even draw a free body diagram. I read through my notes and picked it back up relatively quickly but after about a month of leaving it alone, it began to fade again from my memory. It hasn’t really impacted my performance at work in the sense that my role is not as technically involved as say a design engineer developing a new product from scratch. But I do think that I could bring a lot more value to the table by staying on top of my textbook stuff and I’ll definitely need it if I ever decide to pursue a much more technical role like design. 

My plan is to “re-visit” all of my college textbooks, maybe two at a time, and pull only the core/key concepts and write those down in a separate notebook. I want to make a formula sheet for each subject containing formulas applicable to those key concepts. And then from there, I want to write problems on note cards for each subject &amp; concept, shuffle them, and pick two note cards at random per day to work through. The idea is to force consistent exposure to a broad range of subjects and problems so that they are always fresh in my head. I’m hoping that I get to a point where it becomes so repetitive that this information stays in my brain forever but I have absolutely no clue if this will even work or if this is the right way of even going about it.

Hello all,

I am coming here in search of advice and some guidance. I am a freshman and currently a Construction Management major at Wentworth Institute of Technology and I have come to the conclusion that this path is not for me. My family is involved in the construction industry and I tricked myself into thinking I enjoyed it more than I really do. I've been back and forth because I couldn't tell if it was my poor mental health getting in the way, but that is not the issue.

I have always been heavily interested and involved with technology and vehicles as those subjects are what fill my hobbies. I am now thinking of joining the Mechanical Engineering program here, but there is no real gear towards the automotive industry. I understand that is how it is pretty much everywhere that offer this bachelors degree, so I have considered looking elsewhere or finding a masters program in automotive later on to focus on my true desire. What I'd really love is to skip all the bullshit as my core ""fluff"" classes are supposedly geared towards my major, yet they are not whatsoever; for CM at least... yet i've talked to a lot of students and they have similar complaints.

So reddit, whats my best option? Electrical engineering? mechanical?

My main goal would to be involved with a performance car company. Most hands on experience the better.

Wentworth offers amazing job opportunities as that is one of the main reasons I'm here to begin with. From what I've learned, getting involved in CO-OP/Internships is key to success in this industry and this is definitely the place for that.

53,"Torn between genetic counseling and engineering, need advice...",1569442167,"I graduated from college with a degree in molecular biology and while I love the field deeply and the subject matter comes easily to me, I have always had an interest in engineering. I was in an engineering magnet program when I was younger and was also involved in robotics club, and the whole process, from designing, to building, to programming (in certain cases), was just so interesting and exciting to me. Even now, I am always building things using random parts I find around the house and I consider myself very resourceful and creative in that sense. I also really enjoy math and calculus, which is pretty common with those in engineering.

My main hurdle in being able to decide is that I don't have that much formal experience or any higher education in engineering, so I'm not sure if I would truly enjoy it in terms of a job. I have heard of people who thought engineering was their dream only to get into the field and find it is nothing like they expected (i.e. they just sit at a desk all day, it is boring, there is little to no math involved, etc.). There are some people I know, who after years of being unhappy in the field, decided to make the career change to a completely different field instead. But, I have also heard that if you find the right position it can be a very fun and rewarding lifelong career. 

I think, from what I have seen, there is just so much variation in job satisfaction within engineering that I fear I won't be happy or be able to find a job I enjoy if I decide to make the switch. Whereas with genetic counseling, job satisfaction is very high and I feel like it would be hard not to love what I would be doing. It truly seems like the perfect career for me; the only thing holding me back is my curiosity in engineering, and the ""what ifs"" lingering in the back of my mind if I decide not to go this route.

I am torn between these two fields and am currently not getting anywhere career-wise because I cannot seem to choose between them. I *have* looked into biomedical engineering, as it combines both of these fields, but from what I have read it doesn't seem like something I would want to pursue. I still need to do more research on the specifics, but the types of engineering I think I'd be most interested in would be either robotics/programming or renewable energy.

I have 1250 mbara in the autoclave and atmospheric pressure after the exchanger. It is again because the pressure drop(loss)?

63,"I'm watching ""Inside Bill's Brain"" and they're going through all of these complex ideas to fix toilet / sanitation problems in third world countries...and all I can wonder about is why don't they just use fucking SAWDUST?",1569420235,"Hear me out. Several times over the years I've spent upwards of a few weeks to a few months in ""forest communes"" where there's no running water and sometimes hundreds of people living together, growing their own food, and living very ""primal"" -- cooking everything in a cob oven and so on. 

And what was common to all of these is the way toilets and sanitation was handled. Basically, there's some kind of sawdust / wood chips / sawdust and sand mixture and so on inside the toilets. You go in there, take a shit and a piss, you have a little rake and you rake over the sawdust and it covers it up. This eliminated the smell (the smell was always very nice and earthy and woody like a woodshop).   


Then every couple of days the sawdust was scooped up or whatever and then it was used to create mulch, which fed the garden.

So I'm watching this documentary and Bill's over here in front of a white board talking about toilets that turn poop into fuel and all this other crazy space-aged shit.

But the basic problem seems to be that people have a hole in the ground that is so gross and so stinky they go outside and piss and poop in the drinking water. 

Well it seems like the most cost-effective thing to do would be to create a sawdust mixture of some kind locally, you give it (or sell at a small cost) to communities and families, then when people come to collect the ""sawdust waste"" they can turn it into mulch, sell it to local farmers who use it to grow food and of course sell that produce back to the community. In fact, I'm sure you could create an entire business just creating mulch and fertilizer out of that human waste mixed with those wood chips and so on. 

That eliminates the smell, it's cost effective, takes little to no infrastructure changes. 

So my question is -- what's wrong with this idea? The more I sit here thinking about it and the more I see Bill up there talking about these insanely complex phantom solutions with all this money, I'm just like...what the fuck? Why not sawdust?

- battery for measuring  
- some kind of component that will cut the circuit when there is less Voltage than X  
- a proper bulb or something that spends a lot of energy, so the battery will only last 12-24 hours  
- a mechanical battery clock, without a battery, connected to the circuit, so it stops when the battery dies, so you know how much time has passed.

The gauge is only used to measure force forward and back on the aluminum bar (in and out of the screen from the pic perspective). No torsion or anything else weird.

All four grids are oriented the same direction. Each grid is 960 Ohms. There are five solder pads and one is not connected. The pic isn't great, but the wires from right to left as labeled from the PCB: S- (green), E- (black), S+ (white), E+ (red), last pad is no-connect.

Here is the physical layout in [schematic form](https://imgur.com/uiBnwr1) (flipped from pic of gauge, sorry).

I assumed that this would create a Wheatstone bridge config when I took off the encapsulation and looked at the [circuit board](https://imgur.com/e6bFJP1), but that doesn't seem to be the case. There are some small SMD caps for power and signal conditioning. The MCU is providing 2V power from an GPIO output as far as I can tell. The MCU is mounted chip-on-board and covered in encapsulation and I haven't removed that yet. R2 and R3 flex about the same and S+ seems to always be 1V as expected. S- always seems to be at 0V. To be fair, I haven't scoped it, so it could be doing something fast enough not to register on the DMM.

Q1) Have you seen an a grid configuration like this? It doesn't seem to be common from looking quickly at a few popular sources. One of the grids has tiny lettering (backwards) saying ""G22"" or ""C22"". Another grid has a ""GW"" label - again, backwards.

2,Recent Graduate: Project Management vs Electrical Engineering,1569353742,"New user but have a feeling I will be on here given I spent the past hour reading through these posts for advise. 

I am a recent college graduate with a degree in electrical engineering and currently hold a job as PM in a small, family-owned electrical contractor.  This company initially hired me on as an electrical apprentice when they learned I was studying for my degree.  I was in the electrical field for roughly a year and a half before they promoted me to PM after I graduated.  I currently have about a year and 3 months in the role as PM and am having my doubts about the position, and my abilities.  I took the role on the basis of what the senior project manager told me; it is difficult to come across a PM position straight out of college (maybe for a reason) and that I would be creating a great network of contacts.  Now, I am wondering if I have enough field experience (apprentice level) to successfully manage/understand projects, and whether I took this position too soon in my career.  I understand that PM skills in a potential hire makes that candidate valuable but if I continue to hone my PM role, I feel that I am getting further away from actual engineering work (no usable experience towards my PE).  The question I have for the engineers of Reddit is did I start backward?  Should I have first worked my craft before stepping into a management role?

That being said, I could be wrong about different manufacturers and some type might have a slow fuse and suddenly goes into a fast reaction.  
 I could of course pour it in 5cm batches and then apply the next batch while the epoxy is still tacky, but that will probably not be as strong.   


I am open for any feedback or advice. I am an engineer myself, but I never worked with so much epoxy before.

Hey guys so I'm working with a Biorad BioLogic BioFrac Fraction Collector right now and I need to reprogram it so I can have the head move a specified distance.

Leaving my desire to serve/give back aside for now.  I suppose some of you may be engineers who served or are currently serving.

This is a long one....

Hey y’all, I’m not sure what I should do, and I would really appreciate your advice. First I’ll write a few paragraphs about my options, and I’ll put some bullet points below that.

I have well over 100 credits to go until I finish my electrical engineering B.S., which is going to take a long time considering I can only take one or maybe two classes at a time (4 credits each). I’d like to do more, but my full-time, compressed nightshift job limits me. I’m fairly smart, but the constant drowsiness from nightshift slows me down tremendously. Plus the full-time work gets in the way. I gotta work night shift because it’s the only shift that allows me to attend classes I need. On the bright side, I have all my general courses out of the way from my B.G.S. (waste of time, I know), and my company reimburses my tuition. But it’s going to take a long time, and that entire time I’ll be on the night shift, impairing my health and withdrawn from the social world (I can’t manage to shift my sleep to nights on days off).

I’m considering joining the Navy or Air Force instead of sticking to my current civilian path, because it seems I could get schooling done even faster, and I wouldn’t have to be on the nightshift for years to get there. Plus I would enjoy the comradery, the pride from undeniably meaningful achievement, and seeing the world (Navy). I also heard from the Navy recruiter that my 91 pretend ASVAB score and the large size of San Diego’s base would allow me to choose to go there right after the first couple years or so of Navy career training/schooling. Living in San Diego would improve my quality of life quite a bit considering it’s where I grew up until my parents split when I was a young teenager. Haven’t had the opportunity to go back since. Some close family friends are still there, and I don’t really feel much connection to anyone around me where I am currently.

Air force would be great, too, since I would get to apply my technical aptitude. It seems much more competitive, though, so I’m not sure whether I would achieve as much as quickly. I’m also afraid of getting stuck somewhere landlocked, particularly the Midwest (I lived in IN for 10 years, I know what it’s like there…). Whether I do Navy or Air Force, it seems either one will have excellent benefits that could actually get me my Electrical Engineering B.S. even sooner than the civilian track I’m on now. AND I could keep studying martial arts (BJJ).

So what do you think? What would get me to a point where I’m doing some engineering work soonest? If military actually wouldn’t get me to engineering sooner, would it get me there soon enough? And would it be worth it considering I would be ACTUALLY LIVING while I advanced toward that goal?

Details about myself:

· 27 years, 5’8”, 135 lbs.

· 3.28 GPA in Bachelor of General Studies degree

· 4.0 so far working toward Electrical Engineering B.S. (Pre-calc 1 and 2, Calc 1 and 2)

· A.S. coming in a few weeks—happens to be part of my path to B.S.

· Semiconductor technician experience

· Nothing disqualifies me from anything (I suppose I couldn’t be a pilot because of my age).

Perks of Navy according to recruiters and some of my own perspectives:

· Starting at least as E3, likely E4 because of schooling and ASVAB

· Potentially starting as O1 with B.G.S.—Program called dual enrollment

· Continue school while serving as enlisted if my leader allows schedule adjustments, for free (Likely would remain in military after school and promote to officer status—engineering in military would be awesome)

· After serving 4-6 years as enlisted, I would get free tuition AND ROOM AND BOARD to finish bachelor’s degree or even continue on to master’s degree

· All the other military perks, like free housing and food

· Likely opportunity to live in San Diego again

· See the world

· Night shifts (watches) are way shorter than 12 hours and won’t continue for years

· Build bonds with other driven individuals

Air Force perks are similar, but I’m afraid I would have a harder time ranking up, and I’m afraid I wouldn’t get my pick of where to be stationed (Miramar would be my choice).

Perks of staying where I am:

· No risk of starting something I could potentially regret—and not be able to just walk away from

· I will EVENTUALLY get my degree and the dayshift engineer job I want

· Freedom for creativity—music studio, garage

· I suppose that even though I’m on an isolating shift, I still have more opportunity to meet women than I would have on a Navy ship/base (could be wrong about that)

Lot of software jobs as well but I still need a lot of practice and build my portfolio. To add info, I am considering a software job because it looks to me that it is easier to break into the entrepreneurial career if you have an app or something (high level info for context).

Problem is, after talking to my professors, TAs and higher level classmates who have interned, I think aerospace may not be what I was looking for. I think space is really cool but I have no real interest in working that sector, but the course work is incredibly space-centric (aeroSPACE should have given it away lol) and not incredibly focused on in atmosphere engineering. The outlook for aerospace engineers on employment also seems very narrow, which I expected, but even more narrow than I thought.

I guess my question is, I have an interest in aircraft structures and propulsion, would I have a better chance landing a job as a mechanical engineer?

46,Salary for an Electronics Engineer?,1569280638," 

Hello,

I am in my last round of interviewing with a company in the Helsinki area for the position of Electronics Engineer. I have an onsite interview scheduled soon. The salary talk would come up during this interview. As of now, they seemed to be impressed with my performance in the technical interviews. I will soon be graduate with an [M.Sc](https://m.sc/) degree. My internships, master thesis, and activities in University teams are very relevant to this job. Apart from that, I have no work experience. The job advert asks for 2+ years of experience, however.

I know for a fact that an Engineer in the same company (not in electronics) is getting paid 3.5K. But he did not try to negotiate and that was their initial offer. He also does not have experience with the exact activities of his position. Apparently, they also told him that the 3.5K is pretty standard in the company.

I found mixed recommendations on the salary:

1. TEK recommends 3850 EUR ([link](https://www.tek.fi/en/services/salaries/salary-recommendations-0)).
2. Insinööriliitto recommends between 3000 - 3500 EUR ([link](https://www.ilry.fi/palvelut/henkilokohtaiset-palvelut/urapalvelut/urasuunnittelu-ja-tyonhaku/urasuunnittelu-ja-4-0)).
3. TEK survey says the mean is about 3373 EUR for Electronics/Electrical Engineers in Finland ([link](https://www.tek.fi/en/cmis/browser?id=workspace%3A//SpacesStore/4ab203fb-b1bc-46e5-9917-dba1c45fcabe&amp;filename=cmisattachments/salaries_by_field_of_study_2018.pdf)).

With these mixed numbers, I am quite confused about what to ask. So I turn to this subreddit. How much salary should I start with/settle at? If not about Finland, I also appreciate any general advice regarding this situation!

I don’t really like the CS classes at my school bc the teachers kind of teach by throwing students in head first into CS languages, and assume you have some kind of background in CS even for the classes where they’re not supposed to assume that. The homework’s also take hours every week since CS programs always take so much time to work.

I’m a little bit worried about taking CS classes at my school bc of these reasons, and with these stresses on top of EE classes and clubs like theater and other required classes I’m worried I’ll be too stressed. 

For example right now the EE classes I’m taking in addition to other requirements in addition to theater and applying to internships are really taking a toll on me and I feel so stressed and sad and tired. 

However I know that CS classes will be useful for me in the future no matter what field I go into. I’ve taken one CS class freshman year and it was awful, we learned Python and I feel like I didn’t really learn anything. But there are other classes that teach C and C++ and Java which I know would actually help me bc EE majors will use a lot of C. I think if I time it right I may be able to handle another 1-2 classes of CS, but not sure about a minor yet which of course requires more than 1-2 CS classes. 

However I don’t know if there’s a difference between writing you have a CS minor vs writing you know these CS languages and have done these CS projects.

55,How to improve solar pool heater?,1569268695,"I've actually already built a solar heater for my small (\~3700 gallon) swimming pool.  I'm hoping I can get some insight as to how to improve the design.

I've taken a 4'x8' sheet of plywood and rimmed it with 1""x3"" trim to frame and hold things in.  I placed 1/2"" styrofoam insulation within the frame.  Coiled in ovals within the frame is \~140' of 1/2"" drip system tubing/pipe.  There is \~10' outside the from for influent/effluent plumbing.  Volume of water actually in the heater is \~17.2gallons. 

A 12volt 14.4watt submersible pump provides flow to the system and is powered by a 25v solar panel.  

I had some old metal cabinets in my garage that are sheet metal and the cabinet doors are probably 28""x14""x1/2"".  I had 5 of them that are underneath as much of the coiled tubing as I could manage.  The tubing coil is spaced apart as best I could manage on top of the radiant surface. I'll be looking to place more material underneath the tubing for greater heat capacitance.  

Everything is painted matte black with high temp black spray paint I had left over from a smoker build.

I have a piece of black weed cloth that is currently covering the whole frame/heater.  Fuzzy side out/shiny side in.  I'm not sure if it's helping or hindering.

As it stand I seem to be getting about 6-8 degrees F differential out of the heater.  79-80 degrees going in, 85ish coming out.  Ideally, I'd like the pool to be right about 85F.  I think that is probably beyond the capacity of the heater I've made 

Questions:

Is that weed cloth blanket beneficial/neutral/impeding heating?

What other materials (preferably cheap) can I source to improve heat capacitance.  I thought about adding small rocks from my yard but they didn't seem great.  I also thought about pouring in a bunch of play sand but that isn't great with the proximity to the pool. 

Given that flow is only 163gal/min (max, lower in morning, late afternoon and less-than-clear sunlight) and I have \~3700 gallons of solution, I'm only turning over maybe one third of the pool through the heater.  Is this a reasonable volume or should I change to a higher capacity pump?

A, B, S1, S2

L1, 1, 2, 3

On all of the forward speeds, terminals B to S1 connect and A to S2 connect.

On all reverse speeds terminals A - S1 connect and B – S2 connect.

Then whether it’s forward or reverse the following connections happen on the different speeds.

Speed 3: L1 and 1 (L1 goes directly to one of the wires on the power cord)

Speed 2: L1 and 2

Speed 1: L1 and 3

The other connector from the power cable goes directly to the capacitor then into the motor. 

The label on the motor has the following info on it:  

General Purpose Motor.

Model No: F-500      Pole: 6

HP: 1/5       RPM: 1050

Volts: 120       Amps: 1.85

HZ: 60       Date: 1986-12

Capacitor: 350V 8UF

Insulation Class B

Made in Taiwan.

I can’t figure out how it is set up. It seems like the first terminal groupings must reverse which wires go to the capacitor and I would think that the 2nd set of terminals switches which part of the coil it connects to to get different speeds. That seems to be consistent with a 2 or 4 pole motor, but how does it work with a 6 pole motor? Any help figuring out what is happening or how to test would be great! I’ve been racking my head trying to figure this out, but I didn’t know much about AC motors going into this.

82,Which waterwheel configuration would be the most efficient?,1569225083,"Hey r/askengineers

Hobby machinist/hydroelectric enthusiast here with a question that's been on my mind the last few weeks while planning my second 'powerstation' build.

Say we had a waterfall which had a drop of exactly 2m to the water level below. This distance cannot be changed for the purposes of discussion. If a waterwheel were to be designed to fit that drop so as to convert as much gravitational potential energy as possible into kinetic energy(and thus into electricity via brushless generator) would it be more efficient to have it an overshot wheel or breastshot?

An overshot wheel whereby the water is dropped at the top or near the top of the wheel and allowed to 'ride' the wheel all the way to the bottom, would need to be a smaller diameter wheel to fit entirely under the 2m fall, and so less torque would be applied to it's shaft.

But a breastshot wheel where the water hits the wheel at or slightly below the middle(and so creates reverse rotation to an overshot) would enable a far larger diameter wheel to be used which means more torque can be applied to the shaft - but the water is in freefall for nearly half it's journey and so is wasted energy. Or is it accelerating and hitting the wheel harder, meaning it's freefall was not wasted?",AskEngineers,False,disfigured_shithole,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d83dtp/which_waterwheel_configuration_would_be_the_most/

Currently, at Compwin's(Plastic recycle company in Korea) recycle site, go through two rounds of crushing, weight screening, and cleaning processes to recycle the plastic.

Hello! I am part of my university's autonomous rover team looking for advice  on how to improve our localization precision. I have been reading about RTK GPS and was hoping some of you would be able to share your experiences using this technology, and whether you were successful.

A  bit of background on our application. Our Rover is to be deployed in  the desert (with good sky visibility) and expected to be able to  navigate through a course of GPS waypoints without operator intervention. We already have a decently fast connection to the rover  from our base station capable of carrying video feeds. Our current GPS solution is provided by a LG Phoenix 4 Smart Phone and leaves a lot to be desired. There are no public base stations in the area where the rover is to be deployed so we must deploy our own. Cost is a significant factor, as we are limited to a budget of $18,000 for the rover and base station.

We are already in possession of a S2525F8‐GL‐RTK receiver from a failed previous attempt to implement this technology by a member who is no longer on the team.  And I personally have been considering purchasing the NEO-M8P-2 from  Sparkfun.

A bit of background: I graduated with my masters in engineering-physics recently. It was a research-based masters with about 3 classes with most of my days just looking like 9-5 lab time (researched some aspects of graphene growth). When I had originally applied to my masters I had applied through the physics department as well and had gotten accepted to both. The decision was a bit arbitrary since my project would have been the exact same thing. 

My main point: Because of the nature of my project and classes I didn't really explore the more ""engineering"" (in my eyes) side of the coin. I'm finding out that a big big thing they're looking for in anything related to semi-conductor manufacturing is six-sigma type of approach. In a sense, I've been exposed to this type of thinking in that, as you do research you inherently conduct it in a similar way as a six-sigma approach but I obviously don't know it as in-depth as someone who studied it explicitly.

I'm trying to see if anyone has really good resources to learn more about this? The deadline I have to send my resume in by is the 29th of September. I'm not looking to bullshit my way through but maybe hone in more on aspects i didn't know about or was exposed to.

It entails no loss in driving pleasure, as a matter of fact Methanol engines actually produce more power so taking up methanol will actually make cars significantly faster or alternatively more efficient- you could do with a 1 litre engine instead of a 2 litre engine.

Since I'm not an engineer I decided to ask you guys on how to approach this problem. I tried to do a little bit of digging on the internet but found no answers or maybe I just don't know what to search for.  


So I am currently trying to build an automatic wine bottle opener that would screw out the wine cork. The only problem is I have no clue how to make the necessary calculations. I have thought of the design but am having trouble doing the math behind it. It would be approximately the size of a pint-sized beer can maybe a little bit taller and would be controlled with a programmable chip.  


So my question is - how do I calculate how much force I need to apply to the cork to screw(not pull) it out. And then using that information how do I pick a suitable motor to do the work.  


The neck of the bottle would be up against a metal part and the mechanism should remove the cork using just the screwing motion.

2. Swollen looking wheel arch/headlight areas
3. Pointy, triangular front ends. (I had thought this was due to the the 1999 incident but they had pointy  front ends before this so this couldn’t be the whole story)

My first thought was that these make the car faster somehow but then I remembered that one of the more famous Le Mans cars in recent memory, the CLK GTR/LM which had the fastest lap in qualifying in the 1998 Le Mans, didn’t have any of these features, looking quite a bit like a normal road-going sportscar, and it’s performance didn’t seem to suffer from it at all.

I have been an EE for 3 years and still feel the same. Both managers and coworkers have commented that I am doing well, I know that I haven't. I am constantly making mistakes and not learning as quick as I should. I have lapses in judgement, unable to make decisions, easily forget things, and sometimes losing sight of big picture thus causing mistakes in the low level design. My quality of work is also poor. It's difficult to compare with others in my group due to experience gap and their work quality is much better (some have been here 30+ years and next guy with least experience has been here 10ish years). I'm extremely lucky to be in the group that i am in (R&amp;Dish kind of group) because i know if i were in any kind if group, i would have been fired pretty early on due to the lack of production. 
I will admit however that i cause this to myself by working slow, procrastinating the more important work needed to be done, and lolly gagging around so it may be morecof a discipline problem throughout my internships and job.

The tub I am looking at is 72"" round x 28.4"". My math estimates 205 gallons or roughly 1700lbs. The unit itself weighs roughly 90lbs. Rounding up, call it 1800lbs. My girlfriend and I together would weigh 300lbs for a total operational weight of 2100lbs.

My building is approx 40 years old and wood construction. It is a bi-level with my unit being on the second floor. The balcony itself is 6' deep by roughly 25' long. It does not have visible bracing but is reinforced on each end with a major tie in to load bearing framing.

Based on my construction/framing experience and the geometry of the condo I am in, it's a safe bet that the balcony is tied into the condo with 20' x 2""  x 12"" joists. 12' of the joists are supporting interior living space and tied into the structure.

The hottub would be placed on the end of the balcony closest to the load bearing supports and would occupy roughly 36sqft. My math suggests the load would be 60lbs/sqft. 

As far as the rest of the balcony, it's sparsely decorated and anything of substantial weight would be on the complete opposite side of the balcony. The side the hot tub would be on would be barren.

Final notes: Yes my condo is governed by strata and they have some overbearing policies. Nothing about hot tubs but I do not wish to contact them on this matter as they will surely ignore my requests even if all numbers check out. I cannot afford to hire an engineer to come assess the feasibility of this. I understand I would be running a risk and I accept the consequences of it so please, no moral lessons.

I especially enjoyed the electricity and magnetism unit, which seem to be the very, very, very foundations, and I joined my school's robotics team this year, where I plan to do the programming, but I can dabble in building too. I definitely have interest in electrical engineering, due to the physics, circuits (yes I know the science is tough), and also doing some programming, satisfying a lot of the tech aspect I'd like in a future career.

However, I thought back to when I had lunch with my mentor, now in university studying CS who is a very smart guy, where he somewhat laughed at me when I mentioned my interest in EE. Basically mentioning about how tough it was, even much more than other disciplines, which I am aware of. It wasn't malevolent, but it just seemed like being condescending unintentionally due to our age difference of ~3-4 years, him thinking that I was naive and possibly thought that I thought ""Electrical engineering, what a rad name!""

So, am I naive for being interested? I have a family friend who's studying it, so I am aware of the accompanying difficulty and pain but that doesn't scare me off much.

The owner just bought the company, worked there 2 years, has 25 years in that industry. There are 2 other engineers, and about 20 other employees. If get to help estimate for contracts, practice quality inspections (CMM and others), design fixtures, help troubleshoot manufacturing, a little fanuc robot programming, and a little design work.

It's intimidating, but the owner seems to really want me. The building is a mess and flow needs to be re-designed, as the new owner has stated.

I'm not sure why I'm nervous, I suppose I'm not confident in myself but he seemed to be after talking for a few hours. I feel like this at the very least would expose me to a lot of different things and look good for other employers someday. And the products seem really cool, being for the DOD and all.

We have taken temperature readings inside of the hot isle of a 2600 unit rig and it seems as though the temperature ranged between 140F and 160F. We took these readings with a cheap laser thermometer gun. 

We have yet to take accurate measurements of temperatures in the hot isle of our larger system being built (70,000 units)

45,CAREER ADVISE: HVAC Design vs. HVAC Contractor,1569112739,"I am currently a mechanical engineer with 2 yrs experience in HVAC design, but I just got on offer from small mechanical contractor for an APM position. 

Why I am stuck:

The design firm I work at doesn't have interesting projects to work on, they are fairly simple/repetitive and it is rare for a complex project to roll around. It is a velvet coffin. The mechanical contractor does a wide variety of interesting and complex projects (4-pipe) that I am very interested in. It has a highly experienced team of PMs that will be retiring soon, so there is room for advancement and lots of knowledge they can share (folks with 40+ years of experience in HVAC/Plumbing).

It seems that engineers on the design side always end of getting priced out of technical roles, and end up in project/people management eventually. I don't really mind not doing design, I just appreciate the systems and providing a quality product. It seems like I would enjoy both sides, I see myself ending up as a PM or as a facilities/owner's engineer at some point in my career. 

My questions: Is this a move that would be ideal mid-career, maybe after I get my PE license? Is this a good time to get into contracting while the design-build market is growing?

51,Is possible to make a supersonic passenger plane that is as efficient as an equal size subsonic plane?,1569099644,"Well, there it is, that's my question. I was looking aeronautical stuff lately, and old aircrafts projects, specially the Boeing sonic cruiser which would have been able to travel at Mach 0.98 and offer similar economics to a Boeing 767 of roughly the same capacity, at the end of the day boeing ditched the idea and started the 787 development, so my question is....  


Is even possible to make a Mach 1.25/1.4 low Supersonic passenger plane that uses around the same fuel in a trip as a subsonic plane, with similar maintenance costs? More specifically a supersonic plane with a size similar to the Boeing 777-9x with has a outside diameter over 6 meters and a length of nearly 80 meters, and a 3-4-3 seating configuration in economy class.   


My idea is that if the Sonic cruiser which was seriously considered by Boeing was possible, why not a low supersonic passenger plane? i read the drag and stresses on the wings and fuselage at transonic speed is higher than at supersonic speed. And it seems that mach 1.4 could be a good compromise since is pretty fast, offering a lower drag than transonic speeds, without the surface heating problems or the stresses that high supersonic speeds cause, which would require more complex and expensive cooling systems apart from a lower seating capacity  


My clueless idea for an uninformed guy would be that the requirements for a 777-9x or A350-1000 sized plane that can go at mach 1.4 would be:  


1-A high bypass turbofan with an inlet spike and outlet spike that resembles a venturi tube, the job of the inlet spike would be to convert high speed supersonic air at low pressure into low speed subsonic air at high pressure that can be moved by the fan, and the outlet spike would do the same but in the opposite direction converting high pressure low speed thrust into low pressure high speed thrust. The Aerion AS2 will use 3:1 bypass ratio GE Affinity engines   


2-A fuselage with a sears hack body shape which can provide a somewhat low surface area relative to the volume of the aircraft, over that i could think the fuselage would need a swordfish like extension at the nose to reduce the sonic boom and the diameter of the shockwave  


3-Laminar flow wing with leading edge extension, antishock bodies, and sharpened edges, i was looking a lot about laminar flow wings that the Aerion is supposed to have, the benefit would be a more uniform flow around the wing further reducing drag caused by turbulence of mixed flow, the antishock bodies and leading edges are supposed to have the same purpose (i think)  


4-A high wing position with a wasp waist shape between the fuselage and the wing, with the same purpose of reducing area and wave drag at supersonic speed, and i think the wing should be high mounted to have the engines aligned with the fuselage and not creating another shock area outside the main one created by the fuselage going at high speed.

I am a physical product designer and making a personal hobby project (a small culinary hose smoker, much like the Breville Smoking Gun).

I have worked with Mechanical Engineers to design plastic parts in the past, but have never done anything with fan designs, and could not really find anything online that seems to help. A lot of the stuff is very specific, such as how to place a cooling fan in your PC, or how to design for HVAC. 

Essentially, I would like air to be sucked in by a fan through the top hole on the right, and be blown out through the top hole on the left in the images below. If it helps, the outer cube shape in these images would be about 3""-4"" (75mm-100mm) on each side. The air power doesn't have to be especially powerful or efficient, either.

Please see the images at the link below for reference. These were some initial ideas I had, but I have a hard time evaluating which might be realistic, or if another design entirely might be better.

I got a 37/100 on my first EE test this year and honestly feeling really bummed and stressed out. Labs are going fine, maybe high 80s to 90s, but homework’s I’ve been getting 70s on.

I feel like I need to have a one on one tutor with me at all times in EE, bc there are so many small things I don’t understand immediately, and then suddenly the professor’s moved on and everyone else seems to have already understood. And there are so many of those small things I can’t keep track of them so it’s hard to ask the Prof Qs in office hours. And then during help sessions or labs when I ask TAs for help it feels like I’m asking the most basic Qs, one time at a help session the TA literally asked me, do you not understand this at all? And basically I was thinking YES but didn’t really want to say that.

I know engineering is hard and that there are other people also don’t understand things, but everyone else is getting 60s and 70s on their exams and I have a freaking 37. (our prof sent out a histogram of the class grades)

I really don’t want to tell my parents about this bc while they have been and are so supportive and care for me in many ways, they would absolutely freak if they found out I feel like I don’t understand anything and got a 37 on a test. This is also why I don’t want to ask EE Qs to my mom. my mom’s an electrical engineer and she felt like she could understand everything EE in school and I think assumes I would feel the same. Or at least feels like I have the capability to understand. Which honestly I think kind of do, but i just need a one on one tutor with me at all times. Which in college I know can’t happen bc there’s no hand holding. I’m starting to lose hope bc I feel like I just make a mess of everything in EE, and that in labs so many things my partner is annoyed at me for for asking so many Qs or doing things wrong.

I’m also worried about changing majors bc I’m a sophomore and I know i need to declare a major very soon otherwise I won’t be able to graduate on time.

If I do change majors I’m considering being a math major bc math seems to be the only thing I’m actually pretty good at, and when I took the math prerequisites I rather enjoyed them. Calculations aren’t so bad. Engineering is just such a different way of thinking and I feel like I’ve been thrown in so suddenly with absolutely no background. I was considering being a Bio or Environmental science related major when I was in high school so I didn’t focus that much on engineering. I decided to do engineering bc ES and bio had so much memorization and not as much problem solving like math that I got sick of them. 

I’ve also just been having a bad time managing everything bc I’m doing theater and we all know how much time that takes. So the Bio class I’m also taking (EE has a bio requirement at my school) is not going so well either.

(notice im using a wand barrel not a wand disk for tangental reasons I can't change).

The cartoon posted above is from a design I printed last night. But I found the slope of the funnel to be too aggressive in my makeshift wind tunnel. So I'm looking to redesign it with the ideal funnel slope. 

Previously I had a 3mm i.d. exit spout, I'm expanding that to 10mm.  The length of the funnel does not have to be 20mm, but around there would be great. Also, my enterance port diameter currently isn't a circle, that isn't fixed requirement... I was just trying to fit it in the space I currently have set, but it can be rearranged as this funnel has a higher priority.  This ideally will use open air environment for the intake, but the exhaust will be sheltered.

 - Anything beyond a 45degree angle of attack is too aggressive and becomes a wall/eddies/wake/turbulence.

Internship 1: Mining Internship  
This is for an internship at a large copper mine with one of the worlds largest mining companies. It would involve myself having to remote Queensland for 12 weeks (the middle of nowhere). Although I have never done any work in mining I do find it really interesting and is something I would like to experience, especially when I am young. I also feel that working on-site would be very beneficial for me to develop my technical expertise. But my fears with this role mainly revolve around if I end up hating it, it could just be a waste of time  


Internship 2: System Engineering Internship  
This is for an internship at a Tier 1 Engineering consulting company in Australia, working as a systems assurance intern within the rail systems team. I had a really good time already in the rail industry and is something I really enjoy. I do believe I have the mindset to do well with systems engineering too. I also think that this company would provide really good networking opportunities, being a consultancy, would involve staying in my hometown (Melbourne) throughout the summer and could be a good chance of being able to work part time as a finish my studies next year.

79,"Is it unethical to hide from our customers, certain modifications in the process that has been defined and documented?",1569055249,"In the manufacturing industry that I am working in, we have a ongoing project which deals with reducing raw material consumption by using scrap (generated while a different larger part of same raw material is produced).

The ""scrap"" is nothing but raw material of a certain shape generated internally and fit for use. Since we understand the ""scrap"" is of high value, we store and preserve it in the same way as raw materials are.

I will reiterate if it isn’t already clear, the quality of the product IS NOT AT ALL affected by the use of scrap, since the material is exactly the same, but of irregular and uncontrollable shape. We can’t really design the large part (from which the scrap was generated) to obtain a desirable shape/size of the scrap.

But we have challenges while trying to maximise our utilisation of scrap. One of them being -  not able to accommodate the scrap in the tool designed for fresh raw material sheets.

To get around this, we make certain modifications to the tool to accommodate the scrap. Sometimes, we end up increasing the cycle time of the process in doing that, but the raw material value saved is way higher, and enough to compensate for the higher processing time. Again, the modifications DO NOT compromise safety or product quality in any way.

According to the rules laid down, we are obligated to inform our customer for any tool changes that we do. The modifications should warrant strong reasons for it, and the customer is also required to conduct an audit of the new tool (lengthy and consumes time and resources)

The only problem with informing our customer is – the customer will ask for price reductions after considering our reasons for modifying the tool. After all the brainstorming and hard work we put in to maximise scrap utilisation, it seems very unfair to give the benefit from it to the customer (since we are already operating on razor thin margins). So, our final stand is - we do not inform our customer when we modify the tools for scrap utilisation.

Recently, I’ve questions about this practise in my mind, but not sure where I can ask with anonymity whether this is right or wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

97,Wind Loading Weak Point,1569027199,"The concrete contractor I work for has a customer that we recently poured a waffle slab for, on which he stick framed a metal building on top of.

Now him and my boss have gotten together and agreed to add on to the side of it.

The existing conditions are a concrete parking lot  that has about 4 feet of slope away from the now existing metal building.

They have agreed to pour a 10"" thick concrete wall on top of that paving, with the top of this wall being the same elevation as the existing bldg floor, then building a new metal building on top of that wall.

That wall will be 80 feet long x 10"" thick and simply dowels into the existing paving with #4 or #5 rebar every 12"" OC. Drilled in with no epoxy. The wall will be over 5 ft tall along the back side.

I am trying to convince them that such a wall, with no pilasters will be fairly weak against lateral movement in the middle and could be fairly easily pushed over. Especially when you consider the wind loading that will be on the 25 ft tall R-panel metal building wall that will be built on top of the wall. 

I've tried to explain to them that the existing building is stronger because the older buildings walls are anchored at ground level into a monolithic structure that will not give under wind loading, but the bottom of the new metal buildings R-panel wall will transfer the wond loading to the top of the concrete wall, and could cause it to lean or fall over.

They look at me like I am insane.

I'm not an engineer but I have been doing construction work for over 30 years, and have build enough structures over the years to sort of visualize structural loads. 

Am I wrong in worrying about this, or if I am right can you help me find away to convince these guys I am right.

..... I know the correct answer is to tell them to get an engineer to look at the design or to pay him to design a proper foundation, but neither my boss nor the building owner will consider this option at this point.

I just at least want to tell them this so when / if it fails I can tell them I told them so.

0,What is it like working for a bigger engineering company?,1569026068,"I'll try to make a long story short. One of my old teachers whom I still keep in touch with knows a guy whose company was bought out by an engineering consulting consortium. They turned it into their office in the city, specializing in process control optimization and advanced control strategies. They're looking for people and my professor asked me whether he could forward my name. I agreed, mostly out of curiosity, things happened and now I find myself invited to dinner by the executive manager, so I have to sort out my feelings quickly before I'm put on the spot to make the decision officially.

Thing is, I'm already employed by a small integrator outfit (about a year). I do not hate my job, much to the contrary. I'm generally happy with my job as it stands, which is making this less of a no-brainer than it seems like. On one hand, I would feel bad leaving so quickly after my current employer spent time developing me and training me, I enjoy the small business tropes of having to do more with less and wearing many different hats and I very much feel like I can still grow in this role. 

On the other hand, I do have a few gripes : I have little benefits (no 401k for instance) and the compensation is on the low side without accounting for OT pay (I am paid hourly as is common in controls), and 90% of the work is local. I've always wanted to live out of my suitcase and as a single young man without children this is the perfect moment to do it, and the job at the bigger company would see me sent out on travel in remote locations and foreign countries to assist in the implementation of new strategies and optimization of old ones. The opportunity to see many different processes, different mentalities and ways to do things, use different equipment and perfect my controls knowledge is extremely tempting. I think I would have opportunities to grow and do things that I could never have in my current role, including having further education and training paid for.

My friends tell me I would be one stupid mother to turn down this opportunity, but I'm stuck hesitating. Most of all, I'm scared of the shift in scope and culture and feeling like a number, and I've heard big engineering companies are prone to cyclical layoffs, though a specialized office such as this one might be a little more safe on that front I'd think.

I'd like to hear from people who have done a similar jump, from small local to big international player. Was it hard to adjust? To what extent are the tropes (feeling like a number, inflexibility) true? Do you enjoy it more in the bigger company or do you wish you had kept going with the local guys?

28,How does the diameter of a steel rod change the tensile strength?,1568986796,"Hello fellow engineers,

Lately, I have noticed that some steel suppliers provide a different tensile strength value depending on the diameter of their steel rods. My understanding is that tensile strength is not dependent on diameter, I also understand that larger diameters are more likely to contain defects which will cause a different failure, but I'm not sure if that is the real reason. We also thought that it might be due to heat treatments that become less homogeneous among the entire rod as the diameter increases?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an example of a specification that has different mechanical properties values depending on the rod diameter: [http://www.fuhongforge.com/products/aisi-9840-steel/](http://www.fuhongforge.com/products/aisi-9840-steel/)",AskEngineers,False,Albrechtl,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d6v2ki/how_does_the_diameter_of_a_steel_rod_change_the/
29,What can I use as a cheap counterweight? 4 25lb weights.,1568986423,"  I made a lofted bed frame for my room months back but then got tired of sleeping next to the ceiling fan and having my girlfriend sticking her head in it while it spun at several 1000 rpm. So, I decided I would make the mattress frame independent of the bed frame and then use pulleys and counterweights to raise and lower the bed so it could be down to sleep in and up so I could use the space below when I want. 

 Well after much trial and error it works but it needs about 25lbs of counterweights on each of the 4 corners. The trouble is I can’t think of anything to use other than used free weights that would weigh enough and yet occupy a small enough amount of space. The problem is most people want 70¢ to $1 a pound for used free weights and I really don’t want to spend another $70- $100 on counterweights.

Most companies tend to be pretty tight lipped (or even misleading) to prospective employees about how common solid challenging projects, raises and promotions are.",1568941836,"This is not necessarily important to answering the question but it would be cathartic, here is my context:

I am at something of an impass. I want something to change but at the same time I have doubts I can actually vet employement and come out ahead. 

I am an EE grad with about 6 years solid design experience and I work in programming and CAD based design of digital things. There are electrons and stuff. I guess I am something of a specialist.

This large company is rather broken. There are all kinds fiefdoms and people defending their technical territory. I realize now that we are something of a leviathon and its not important for most parts to be doing top tier work, what is needed are bodies in chairs slowly, inexorably moving key projects forward (for most positions). 

While we are on occasion pressured to put in raw hours, nobody is facilitated to operate at peak ability, and few people try, most are stuck in a stable low-middle gear, which is so common the many people who have been around 10+ years can’t even see it. So many meetings. The pay is decent but far from great. There are rarely any raises, blanket policy across the board that there are no raises most so far. There is never any upside for doing anything exceptional. Rarely any downsides for failure as there are lots of institutional factors or other groups to blame.

Suffice to say about 20-30% of our working hours are wasted, more if some considers dead end projects. The everyday stuff is due to IT issues were just everything we do hamstrung. I probably spend about 30 minutes a day just logging into different system for example, reopening sessions when they crash. It is death by a thousand cuts. 

Some years ago I left a company that was a high functioning pressure cooker (and stressful) and when I think about what we used to accomplish, it makes me well, somewhat concerned for my career going forward. 

Where I am now, albeit stymied by the lack of IT/equipment resources I get a lot done in a relative sense to others.  I know without a doubt I could be doing some really exceptional work somewhere. I am doing some exceptional work now but things are not structured that I will see any benefit from that. For example when I have done good/interesting work we don’t proceed with what has been developed for institutional reasons, many others have had similar frustrating experiences and joke not to get wrapped up in that. Other companies would make products of these things but not the Leviathan.

At least its largely a stress free existence (besides having to watch bad policies being rolled out by HR/corporate, benefits slashed in creative ways and that kind of thing).

Here is the thing; I had no idea what I was getting into. I like to think I will ask better questions in an interview but how much can you ask before you torpedo your chance of being hired?

What would the differences be between getting direct admittance and not getting direct admittance into the School of Engineering? Would it make graduation delayed?

People say electromagnetism is the hardest class here but I am finding it easy, whereas in differential equations for example I am scoring average compared to the rest of the class.

So I can’t decide if I’d be more happy in an applied science or staying in math (I do find pride/enjoyment in taking something challenging).

Maybe I would be a good computer, mechanical, or electric engineer? And find that career / work more enjoyable/stable?

56,What is “r/h” supposed to mean wrt an “immunity test” for a low-intensity vibration plate and what if I don’t have a “power frequency magnetic field...typical [of a] commercial or hospital environment”?,1568927022,"Hi, I am an electrical engineering dummy. But I am a pretty good technical writer, so when I opened my manual for a low-intensity vibration plate, which I bought for my home use, I was pretty confused about the manual and its reference to an “r/h”—I can’t figure out what that is supposed to stand for. This is on a page for “Guidance and Manufacturer’s Declaration-Immunity,” which stipulates that “[The product] is intended for use in the electromagnetic environment specified below.” 

One of the specifications is that the floor on which the product is placed “should be wood, concrete or ceramic tile. If floors are synthetic the r/h should be at least 30%.” I have synthetic floors. Is r/h supposed to be relative humidity? I thought maybe so, but customer service had absolutely no idea, and in fact told me the operations manager read that statement as saying that the relative humidity should be *less* than 30%, which is not how grammar works. Needless to say, that response didn’t instill in me a lot of confidence about the company. I then spoke to the CEO, who said he “thinks” it’s supposed to be relative humidity, parroting back what I had told the sales person (“If it refers to relative humidity, that means you need an environment of greater m humidity than 30% when the product is placed on a synthetic floor, so that you don’t generate a huge static charge”). Then he got kind of rude because, silly me, I want to know what these things actually do mean since I paid thousands of dollars for this product. 

He said this all refers to technical specs that have no application to this product, which has lower voltage outputs than the products typical tested. He said these specs are relevant to life-saving devices. (To me, this is akin to contractors saying that all the work structural engineers do is just overkill.  As someone who experienced a collapsed roof from work done by those kinds of contractors, I can say that’s just not so.)

Anyway, there are a couple other aspects of the table and its recommendations that I’m a little bit worried about. For instance, the table states “power frequency magnetic field should be that of a typical commercial or hospital environment.“ Does that simply mean that, as this is an electromagnetic device, its use could be interrupted by other electronic medical devices, and since I have no other such devices, I should be fine?

62,Any advice for a hopeless aerospace engineer struggling to make career progress?,1568923062,"Hi all, I apologize in advance for the long post. 

I graduated engineering back in May 2017. Shortly after I received an offer with a large aerospace company. It required a government security clearance to start, and I didn't think it was a big deal at first, but then several months went by without any progress. I continued to apply for other jobs, and got two more offers, but they also required security clearances, so I couldn't accept them. A year had passed since graduating and I still hadn't started a job.

I took the first job I could get in April 2018 - a mechanical engineering position in the rural Midwest. Starting pay was well below what you'd expect for engineers. But I had to take it because I had nothing else. I also started a masters in aerospace engineering at this time, to increase my job prospects.

Now it's September 2019 and I'm almost done with my masters. I've been at the same job ever since, and I hate it (combination of bad work environment and bad pay). I continue to apply to aerospace jobs because that's my passion. I've had 2 more offers, but they also required security clearances. Their job descriptions didn't state the need for a clearance initially, but when I got the offer all of a sudden I was told I needed one. So I had to decline those offers as well.

In conclusion, it's been 2 years since graduating, and I have two aerospace engineering degrees with zero field experience. I've had 4 solid offers but have not been able to start any of those jobs because of the pesky security clearance process. I'm stuck at a low-paying job that I hate. My career has gone nowhere due to factors beyond my control and my mental health has deteriorated. I feel like a failure.

93,Should I be declining interviews?,1568863895,"I am a senior and accepted a dream job offer for full-time. Since then, I have declined 4-5 interview requests and stopped job applications for the following reasons:

- The university career center does not allow you to keep job searching after offer acceptance so if they figure out, I'd be in a bit of trouble (a lot of my applications/job-search/interviews is through the career center). Although all they would do is bar you from their services and since this is my last year, it's not a huge deal.

- I am wholly satisfied with the offer so all those interview requests, applications, etc. were not offers I would accept.

- I'd much rather use the free time I have now to focus on school and other activities.

- also, FWIW, I understand it's considered unethical. But I've also seen a lot of advice around the web to do what's best for you especially since companies would probably drop you on a dime.

However, I was reading some advice threads and people were discussing continuing to interview/job search for what I gathered to be two main reasons of 1) providing more leverage in negotiations and 2) nothing is guaranteed until you have started your first day.

I wanted to focus on point 2 since the offer really checks all my boxes and given I've already accepted the offer a while, I feel like the negotiation window has passed.

Therefore, regarding point 2, would that be applicable in my situation? I don't think so but I wanted to get your thoughts. 

I understand it's important to always have a plan but I interpreted that more as continuing to keep grades up, network, not just coast, etc. But if I were to continue interviewing, all the jobs would still require a response in the next few weeks so if you really wanted to have that insurance due to the fact that nothing is guaranteed until you actually start, you would have to simultaneously hold onto and accept multiple offers for many months while going through pre-employment stuff (drug test, background check, etc.) for both and that just doesn't seem practical?

There are probably temp/contract jobs that aren't that much slower to get that would pay better and would use at least some of my technical knowledge/skills. What kind of options are out there for that?

Quick bio: I have a BS and MS in mechanical engineering and was in a PhD program for 3 years that I recently left as I decided that I didn't want to be a professor (which was the main driving reason for the PhD). In addition to my degrees I also have 5 years of engineering work experience, and a couple published conference papers in my field. My background is in mathematical modeling, so I have a diverse mix of engineering (fluid dynamics, CFD/FEA, automation, etc.), math, and CS (Python, MATLAB, C++, Fortran, etc.) skills.

I have no particular qualms/ego about what I do in the meantime until I find a permanent job, but it would be nice if it was engineering related so I could at least list it on my resume alongside the trickle of small freelance consulting jobs so I don't have a large gap in my employment.",AskEngineers,False,MyFirstThrowawayCool,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d683r4/unemployed_after_leaving_my_phd_what_are_some/

31,Negotiating salary with my employer following my graduate scheme,1568816880,"For reference, I am based in the UK and currently work as a Mechanical Engineer. This might be a long post, I just want to provide as much context as possible.

My situation is this: I have degree in BEng Mechanical Engineering and am currently working for a large international Manufacturing company as a Manufacturing Engineer. I am currently 12 months into my 18 month graduate scheme with the company. I also interned here during uni for a period of 15 months.

I am also on a permanent contract. Note: this department historically has had awful retention (something that has been noticed at a higher level). When I came in for my interview for the position, the UK Chief of Operations grilled me over describing myself as “ambitious” on my CV - they didn’t want some star-eyed grad to take advantage of this scheme (which included a desirable 3-month overseas placement) to leave as soon the 18 months were done. My point here is that the department is low on staff and I would think that it would be somewhat of an embarrassment for them to lose a grad immediately after the scheme.

I am currently making approx £22k under the grad scheme. As far as I am aware, this is the base salary they give to anyone on the grad scheme, regardless of department. Industry-average wise, it’s on the lower end of what other companies pay (22-28). I didn’t negotiate or mention the salary whatsoever when I started - my priority was to get into a job.

One colleague, let’s call her Hannah, recently joined the company and was offered £33k with 3 years out of Uni. I will be 18 months out of uni when I finish the grad scheme and feel that I should be offered a similar salary for doing the same job as her. Also, note that industry average is 30-40k.

I’ve never had to negotiate salary before so I’m really nervous the closer this gets. I especially need a higher salary for a mortgage as I will be looking to buy a house as soon as I’m done with my grad scheme (I will have saved a decent deposit by April). I am fully committed to leaving if the salary is not matched, as I don’t feel that I can continue to work with someone on a higher salary with similar experience doing the same job - it feels unfair to me. Id just rather stay because I hate interviews and I’m not particularly good with them.

43,Need an advice for my career as an electronic engineer.,1568792395,"Hello all, as the title says I need an advice.

My area is southern Europe - Italy.

I'm an electronic engineer who just graduated in April, and now I'm currently doing an internship in a local (yet international) company - automotive sector. My internship ends in December, and from what I've gathered they'll probably keep me. Consider that now I have at my disposal a flexible working time, the company canteen ...and it's like 10mins by car from where I live, which is nice. My salary isn't that great though, but it's my first real job so I can't complain much about that.

Now, so far so good right? I mean, my colleagues are good (except one but that's fine, I can live with that) and I'm learning many practical things. And yet, I'm not satisfied at all.

My work is basically an electronic designer - R&amp;D... and while I appreciate it, I've found that it doesn't interest me at all. I've also found that the automotive industry is like a jail (I'm exaggerating of course): once you begin workin in it, you'll probably do that for the rest of your life with little chance to change sector.

I've been searching online about different job descriptions and yesterday I've found one that was basically perfect to me: the Sales Engineer. I'm a guy who wants to travel a lot, and I think my english is good (...I probably make some mistakes but I'm practicing). I also like talking to people about products and with a good mentor, I think I could manage to become one in the future. I've tried to look for open positions and it looks like I could find something in the bigger town (which is 35mins away from where I live).

So here's the problem: I've tried to talk about this to my parents and my close friends. They basically said that I should be grateful that I have this job which is comfortable because it's near home... and if they were in my position, they'd just continue to work where I am. I think they lack a bit of a open mind, but of course I respect their opinion.

You guys think I should continue here or try to have some luck as a sales engineer?

57,Am I being unreasonable and/or unfairly treated?,1568770433,"Am I being unfairly compensated &amp;amp; treated?

**Context for my situation:**
I am a young professional at a small company. I took this position right after college (almost 2 years ago).

**My Problem:**
My company has a no-merit system for awarding promotions and bases it on work experience solely. When I began, I was informed that Internship experience did not count towards said work experience so I began with 0 years. That was ok with me, but after speaking with other people within my company, I learned that some other employees without relevant work experience began with a much higher salary due to being awarded the promotion when they were hired based on their Internship experience. 

I do not want to make this about race, but in addition to unfairly counting internship experience, I have noticed throughout separate discussions with employees that people of color were routinely paid or titled much lower ($10K) difference than their non-person of color counterparts. I am a person of color myself and the majority (+90%) of the company is composed of white employees. 

Next, in terms of my own performance at work, I have routinely been directly involved in projects that received extremely positive feedback from customers and have been explicitly told by other senior employees I trust, that my work was a major driver in the success of the projects. Recently, I felt like I was finally getting more recognition at the management level and was being given the opportunity for more responsibility on various projects. However, as soon as I attempted to take an active role in the management of the project, I have been (without being told) pushed aside and taken out of that position of power. I was in the middle of a project I had been working/managing by myself when I was assigned another employee to be the lead on the task when I have experience equally suited to the task and better experience managing tasks and communicating with customers. The reasoning was that I was one level below this person and therefore they were more suited to handle it (we are separated by a few months of experience). If it was an attempt to get this other employee managing experience, I do not feel that it is fair at the expense of my own professional development. 

Finally, my concern is that I have been ""putting up"" with things as I was not really aware of the greater context for promotions and salary increases. I am due for my own promotion shortly and I am not sure how to approach negotiation of my salary. I truly feel that I play a very important role to the projects within the company, but I am routinely overlooked and repeatedly placed in positions where I am starting at a disadvantage. I would greatly appreciate advice for how to approach salary negotiations and general advice about my career development. I very much enjoy my work and many of the people. I do not believe that my company in general underpays, but that I am one of a few that get the short end of the stick.

58,How can you fully deplete a pressurized can into a pressurized system?,1568770367,"Context:
The A/C in my car was not blowing cold air the other day, so I purchased an A/C manifold gauge to check the pressures on the high and low sides. In doing so, I realized that I pressurized the hoses in the gauge and they became an extension of the system. I didn’t want to discharge the r134a to the atmosphere, so I tried to understand how I could depressurize the hoses back into the system. 

I thought that since the high pressure side had more pressure than the low that could send some back into the system through the low side. I opened the valves to allow air to flow between them and the high pressure side successfully began to depressurize by reentering the system on the low pressure side. This worked until the pressure on the high pressure side reached that of the low pressure side and it quit flowing. I couldn’t figure out how to depressurize the remaining pressure in the hoses as the hoses were now at the same pressure as the lowest area of pressure in the system—that I knew how to access, at least. 

So, that got me to thinking about the cans used to add r134a to the system

My question:
If you are adding a liquid in a pressurized can to a pressurized system, I believe the pressure in the can must be greater than the pressure at your entry point to the system for it to go in. If so, as the can is depleted of liquid, doesn’t the pressure continuously drop; isn’t there a point where the pressure in the can is no longer greater than the pressure at its entry point, even though liquid remains in the can?

63,How to Discover a Transmitter (possibly FM/infrared) too Small To See,1568761957," 

I am going to post the entire story, but the main question is what is the best manner to find a transmitter that I believe to be FM radio and infrared on a medium sized plastic fan? A Gauss meter maybe, but I have been robbed and destitute and do not want to go to the local University and ask when my story is completely unbelievable. Intercepting the signal may be useful, but discovering it to show the FBI is paramount.

I will post the entire story now; as finally I get to reveal the entirety of what I am dealing with as I cannot tell anyone in person this insanity.

Tldr; I have been bugged; I need help in discovering them to show the FBI. A Gauss meter may work, but the story sounds impossible though I have corroborating evidence. Epilepsy and the placement of the bugs are a concern, so I am focusing on the bug on a medium sized plastic fan. Intercepting their signal may be helpful, but I would think presenting the bugs to the FBI and attached a power-source would make that unnecessary. No, I am not diagnosed with any mental disorder (except now I am being told by doctors I have PTSD but I have not yet been able to tell anyone the whole ordeal) and have been taking medications that would disprove that in court (at the detriment of 84 lb gained). Local police gave me brain and spine damage while in a seizure and have ignored my call to investigate my rape and the rape of children. How do I approach this legally? No firm is going to believe this until I get the FBI involved.

This is an unbelievable story and long, but please sustain the suspension of disbelief as this is the first time I am telling the whole story (excepting how I intimidated murderers while acting like a homosexual in Memphis, Tennessee jail). I am writing this as a summary of what to inform the FBI field office in Memphis, Tennessee, but I do not declare this to be a testimonial and let me say with some irony this is fiction and I do not sustain this to be an accurate account of what has occurred to me. I am currently on clonazepam and Lyrica for seizures and Seroquel for schizophrenia, though it was given for sleep (which caused me to gain 84 pounds in 3 months). Two doctors have told me I have PTSD, but I am reluctant to go further than this until I am able to prove my case. I have no mental diagnosis and only chronic condition is idiopathic treatment resistant seizure disorder.

This is the information I have gathered on my own after 11 months of torture and interrogating my rapists, so my information not be entirely reliable; but I cannot depend on the local police after kidnapping, false imprisonment, personal injury, medical malpractice, and torture.

I moved to an apartment complex next to the University of Memphis. I was spied on by neighbors opposite by balcony with binoculars for 3 years. My door-lock was broken for 3 months and my neighbor informed a group of people it was broken and asked them to rob me so I would move out. I was robbed over the course of 3 months and sexually assaulted; I have nearly no material possessions left to my name. This neighbor was having sex with a dog and on methamphetamine. A meth-whore informed them who I was, being angry at me for refusing to have sex with her.

The neighbor is 28, the others are 27, but younger children as young as 12 and 15 have been raped and drugged and prostituted. The main culprit has admitted to raping a 7-year-old and has been raping elementary school children since middle school. The Memphis police hung up on me.

In November of last year, they raped me and bugged my apartment and my very person. I was evicted in May by the landlady, mainly because I embarrassed her in front of people. She and the handyman man also spied on me, took methamphetamine, had sex with these people, and evicted me illegally. She told them never to tell me of this. These people were dealing methamphetamine. I know of child rape, pedophilia, incest, impersonating a police officer, mail fraud, smuggling drugs, identity theft, prostitution of children and themselves, solicitation of children, bestiality, incest, imprisonment, drug dealing, sodomy, and attempted murder, and hate crime. There may be more; I am not a lawyer.

How do I know this; the first question that should come to mind. This is the unbelievable part: The person spent thousands of dollars on bugs, which I believe to be FM radio and infrared. They placed them in the apartment (which I no longer live at, but I am still within the 40-mile radius of their reception). They placed receivers in my left ear. They placed transmitters on every part of my body, including the bottom of my feet, inside my rectum, and even in my right eye. They tell me of my twitches, they have video of my penis they masturbate to. They have told everyone in the apartment complex and its bottom-floor bar, which has no bouncer which is how they lured children in with alcohol and methamphetamine and a video of my penis. The knowledge is widespread, and no one has gone to the police because they told everyone I was crazy, my own Mother allowed these four random people access to my apartment to bug my genitalia (she was not on my lease and never had a key), and my brother posted their broadcast onto the internet. So many people robbed me and sexually assaulted me and have knowledge of this, but they fear going to the police because of their inactivity.

They are saying I am part of a terrorist organization simply because my family is powerful in a small Levantine country, and they believe that I will murder their families because another Arab living in the complex explained we think in clans, and apparently, I am part of a militia that is quite powerful \[completely fabricated\]. They are telling people I fought in Syria.

I have been taking schizophrenic medicine, an anti-depressant, and benzodiazepines. I have no mental diagnoses, though now I am being told I had PTSD; but I am epileptic. These are people who went to middle school, high school, and even rode the same bus as me living down the street; yet I have never spoken to them but know where they live, their names, their physical descriptions, and even their sex acts while on methamphetamine after listening to them for the last 11 months. They have prostituted themselves and children as young as 12 (her brother having sex with her when she was 11). They have been on methamphetamine for 3 years.

They’ve stalked me for 4 years now; planning to murder me in my sleep in the last 11 months. I’ve lived around these people nearly my entirely life without knowing them. Apparently, they have sex with three self-declared homosexuals while looking at a video of my penis and masturbating to it. They even allowed themselves to be urinated and defecated on because I said they might like it. This person has taken video of having sex with 14 women who have remained there constantly only having sex with these three because they used binoculars to spy on me, though the number fluctuates as prettier girls come to take meth and the video of my penis but refuse to have sex with them. Apparently, one was a 27-year-old virgin, the other lost his virginity at 26 having sex with his 11-year-old sister, and the other has been raping children since middle school. Apparently, it costs $20 to sleep with a meth-whore and $10 to sleep with the 15-year-old sister of a meth-whore.

After being evicted, I had a seizure (which they witnessed and caused from the stress and torture of the events this being the very night I was forced to move back in with my parents due to them) and woke up in Memphis jail naked having daily seizures with no medication covered in bugs without running water or toilet paper or personal hygiene products and no human contact for 2 weeks, as well as lying to my Mother saying they were giving me seizure medication. Six police officers beat me while in a seizure giving me brain damage and spine damage and neck damage. I wrote many grievances and told everyone I could and never received seizure medication nor any recompense towards the beating while I was in a seizure. I had gone to the Collierville hospital twice while in a seizure and am continuing to have new ones since this. I am idiopathic treatment resistant.

While there, they never told me why I was there nor had anything in their computer system as to why I was there for 45 days. All charges were dropped. Apparently, my Father and I argued, and he assaulted me while in a seizure and I was arrested (We are Arab and hot-blooded, I will not charge my Father with a felony.).

I have informed everyone possible. The Memphis police have not investigated my rape and dismissed me when I informed them on child rape when I called the police investigator when my memory was somewhat restored. Obviously, I cannot go to the Memphis police. I cannot tell them my physical person was bugged, as obviously, that would be taken as a sign of insanity. However, I have physical evidence. I have made sure to keep all items I have remaining untouched for fingerprints. I know of where several bugs are placed on my property. One of the women involved messaged me on tinder with a unique and specific phrase I only ever uttered while in a cell alone in Memphis jail (I took screenshots). I have a list of all items stolen, and know which dumpster they disposed of them in. The computers stolen should have GPS of their last physical location. Obviously, the financial transactions and the logging into of my personal accounts are there as well as their text messages and Facebook messages and whatever else social media they have used. They have created so many witnesses against themselves.

However, I have been monitoring the lifespan of the receivers. From the audio quality in Memphis jail, surrounded by steel, and by the change in reception due to distance, I believe it to be FM radio (which is federally illegal to broadcast on), and since they are able to see in the dark, it must be infrared. The receivers are dying, the last one barely audible today as two died earlier today \[as Jung said: “I am doing a schizophrenia.”; thankfully mine is ending now\]. The transmitters are still working, presumably having a longer-lasting battery due to the need for visual transmitting.

I never knew these people besides two I took high school classes with, but never talked to. I played World of Warcraft with two of them, a third also on the same server (what are the odds). Now, I know where they live, and so much information about these people.

I’ve waited this long, despite the torture of meth-addicts talking 24/7 in my ear to gather information. They have watched everything I have done and know all about my family, as I previously said, we are a powerful family in my Father’s country. From 7 years of clonazepam and Lyrica withdrawal covered in bugs in Memphis jail with no memory to the DMV to doctor visits to hospitalizations for seizures, they have been in my ear. I have stacked felony upon felony upon them, and made sure to cross into Mississippi to make sure this was inter-state and therefore FBI jurisdiction (and I am sure the Memphis police department will be investigated).

While in my last seizure, I saw sound (synesthesia) of them telling me to die, as they have during every seizure I have had since they have bugged me. They planned to murder me in my sleep saying they know where I live, when I sleep, and I heard one trying to gain accomplices. They are observing all I do on a laptop on a screen. They have stolen money from my Mother’s credit card, stolen Bitcoins, logged onto my University account, and basically every online account I have as I allowed them to see my password manager with all the passwords the same (a little trap for them). All of which is traceable.

I do not think they are recording all I do, only taking screenshots of what they think is relevant to them, and video of my genitalia, but they have recorded their sex acts with these meth-addicts and children, which they plan to destroy the evidence of.

I have witnesses, called the police while there, I know the physical bugs exist (they even installed one that makes a honking noise which he played again while I am home which I remember from when he played it in my apartment.) They are still spying on the people in the apartment I was in watching them have sex. They do not even know how to remove the bugs they placed in the bedroom to record their sex acts with each other and minors.

I believe I have done this as best as I can with brain damage and spine damage and seizures while being psychologically tortured for 11 months after being raped, evicted, and imprisoned. I was able to interrogate my torturers for this past near year, and now that the receivers are dying and I have specifics, I need now only to present the bugs on my physical property to the FBI field office.

Their transmitters are working still, and they are reading this as they placed on in my very eye (they can tell me when I roll my eye with my eyelid shut, this being the right eye). I could have been blinded; I will need surgery to remove all the bugs, which are on the bottom of my feet, inside my rectum, hands, inner elbows, ears, eyes, penis, thighs, etc. They have caused me brain damage and spine damage due to causing the seizure. I have a case against them, the apartment complex, the bar, the Shelby County Sheriff’s Department, the Memphis Police Department, and even my former neurologist who thought having been stomped on by six police officers damage my neck, head, and spine said, “Go to a psychiatrist.” before walking out.

The only time I left my apartment was to go downstairs to get food from my Mother as I cannot drive due to seizures. The apartment complex refused to fix my door-lock for three months, and they have complete knowledge of this and are doing methamphetamine. The video of my penis is quite widespread now (apparently it is the largest they have ever seen, though it was flaccid \[slight brag there as I am a grower not a shower and can change its length and girth (Jail was so boring, I learned to master my penis and found all 17 muscles in isolation in the top of my hand.)\].

So now, that the last receiver in nearly dead and I will no longer be able to gather any more information, I want to ask advice on what to do from this point on. The transmitters are working so they can still see and hear all I do (They even looked upon my Father’s penis.) but let them log into more of my accounts as that is easily traceable. I posted an anonymous tip to the Memphis police and I believe they posted on it that it was false lead, but I have yet to check.

Now here is the advice I need: I did electrical engineering until this occurred. I believe I could use a Gauss meter to find the bugs. The issue being they are so small that they are in my eye. X-Rays and MRI did not find them as they are so small (though I felt the heat during the MRI as the magnetic resonance heated the metal). They are physical circuitry but are water resistant to some degree. That is the crux of the issue: they are so small, this sounds unbelievable. I texted my mother the first they informed me they were attempting to murder me in my sleep, so I have left written records. Obviously, my own Mother thought me crazy until I went to the hospital for an oncoming seizure, which now, thankfully, she thinks it can all be chalked up to a seizure.

They have tarnished the reputation of my family, degraded my modesty as a Moslem, and have insulted the honor of my cousin. I care less what they did to me, as I found the torture quite fun to train them as dogs to repeat sentences by name, creating new identities for them which others call them now, and to have these women urinated and defecated on by “limp-dicked 5 inch homosexuals”. They now have STDs and have gotten these meth-whores pregnant, which I am sure the children are addicted to methamphetamine and deformed and will be taken by CPS if they are not miscarried.

They are going into methamphetamine withdrawal, the receivers are dying so now I cannot gather any further information, so I believe now is a perfect time to walk into the FBI field office and have these criminals, pedophiles, prostitutes, drug addicts interrogated. I would think with all they have done, they will never leave administrative segregation and have psychological torture of this degree and planning to murder me (they also stole all my seizure medicine), raping children, I will push for the death penalty if that is an option, but life will suffice.

They are correct, we are a rich and powerful family, and Arabs do think in clans. That is no threat, only an explanation as to why I care less about my own rape and torture and burglary than the insult to my cousin’s honor and my family’s reputation. They also declared takfir on me (which is a death sentence to declare a Moslem an apostate), which I told the police. When I was on the roof contemplating suicide looking over the edge, they told me to jump; which prevented my suicide as it angered me.

That is my story, and I will not swear by it until I have a lawyer present. This to the best of my knowledge, as I had a seizure a week ago and am still recovering, but the timing is right. The receivers are dying, the statue of limitations is nearing, and I need to have true medical help for my physical injuries (Schizophrenia for 11 months was interesting and fun, I will write a book on their psychology; I am stronger than meth-addicts telling me to kill myself 24/7 in my ear.) I need to move with my life.

With all the lawsuits, I am set for life, though my family is more than well-off. I have single-handedly broken up a child porn distribution ring while being tortured, jailed, destitute, brain-damaged, spine-damaged, and undergoing seizures and benzothiazine and gapentenoid withdrawal while incarcerated. Excuse me for being a bit immodest here.

Now that I have finally told someone what has being happening to me, rather or not it is believed, let me ask for practical advice: I cannot go to the Memphis police. I have stacked so many felonies on them as possible and made sure it was FBI jurisdiction.

My knowledge of electrical engineering is limited. I fear shorting the transmitters on my body due to the epilepsy and that it is literally on my ear-drum as they have informed me and on my pupil. This person spent thousands of dollars going into debt to buy these because “I wanted a closer look at his penis.” His ex-girlfriend of one week, who would rather fuck a dog (she chose a black dog thinking it would have a bigger penis (Apparently, black men having bigger penises is a myth, and I believe these whores as they have slept with all my brothers and everyone else in that apartment complex that they now resort to homosexuals to masturbate to a video of my penis begging for me to impregnate them.)

I don’t want to cloud my judgement with my limited knowledge. I would like practical advice from technical experts on how to proceed. I believe them to be FM transmitters with infrared. Obviously, they are physical circuitry and can be discovered. They are metallic but not magnetic as they only heated during the MRI. There is a plastic fan of medium size on which there is a bug. Since it is plastic, I believe it to be the easiest one to find and present to the FBI, so that they may then sweep the two apartments with bugs in them and my property which also has their fingerprints. A means to capture the signal would be useful, but I would think simply setting a power-source to the dead bugs would prove their intent as transmitters and receivers and not so relevant; please inform me if I am wrong. The bugs are so tiny I cannot see them, but I have physical evidence of people I have never spoken to, and all my accounts have been logged into and passwords changed as well as money stolen. I cannot walk into the FBI field office and tell them this and say there is a bug on this fan, find it. There are plenty of bugs on my person and my property, but the fan would be easiest to have the FBI investigate a child pornography ring and my testimonial to their confessions will be enough to send them to federal prison for life if not until execution (inshallah). Yes, I will sue them in civil court to make sure they cannot afford a defense attorney for the criminal trial. I want them to endure methamphetamine withdrawal in Memphis jail while being interrogated by the FBI to do to them what they did to me. The last receiver is so faint and nearly dead, and I care not that they are observing my life, as soon theirs will be over.

\[Bragging here, as I believe I did this to the best of my ability and acted in the good in destroying pedophiles.\] I believe this will be quite the national news. And I will be sure to tell everyone I can in Europe and the Middle East what Western society is like, as we are moving from this country. I will be testing out of electrical engineering, chemical engineering, computer engineering, petroleum engineering, mathematics, chemistry, geology, and philosophy (and possibly other liberal arts like German and Arabic and very likely psychology and history). That is no exaggeration. I am writing a dissertation on Plato’s Unwritten Doctrine Via Hegelian Dialectic Based in Physicalism \[a working title.\] While being tortured by my rapists, I have all their confessions and am set for life despite never needing to work a day in my life anyways. I will destroy this apartment complex and possible live in it for a year after rebuilding it then converting it into an orphanage or masjid.

11 months of meth-heads in my ear whispering in my ear as I sleep, and I still gained their confessions, humiliated them, and trained them like dogs while they declare their love for me (and my penis). Seriously, I must ask, what the hell is wrong with Western society to rape children, incest, prostituting sisters, raping and robbing a stranger, torturing them, planning to murder him, sodomy, and bestiality.

The firm I passed my qualifications with went into administration and ended up being bought out by a guy who employed alot of his friends and it became a "" who not what you know"" sort of firm. I changed jobs to a smaller firm and learnt to programme on fanuc with both milling and turning and furthered my experience as a manufacturing engineer. The second firm I worked with had a sister company on site that designed and we made their own underwater ROV and auctioned it to the royal navy for minesweeping work out at sea. I loved making all the parts, assembling them and being given the approval to come up with my own designs for modifications and improvements to the product. Unfortunately the path to the future looked bleak at the second firm I worked for due to the boss coming up to retirment and wanting to liquidate the business for it's assets to help his son in law start a new venture with the sister company, again the bosses two sons were employed with no previous mechanical knowledge and put straight to the top of the tree in the sister company (family first and all that I get it).

99,Quickly switching a 6kW generator's load on and off --- huge mistake?,1568723055,"Hi all,

I am a technician at a geological research facility that monitors ice in Greenland. I'm currently designing a 6kW heating system that needs to run on a generator, as it will be in a very remote location. I've never worked with generator power before, and the technical staff of the supplier's company has not been responsive.

Basically, I'm aiming to set up a variable power system that allows the operator to set a percentage of power (rather than a target temperature). My thinking was to implement a large relay controlled by a very slow PWM control signal, where the duty cycle determines the heating system's power. This means the system will be running either at 100% or 0% at different times - sometimes switching quite quickly, sometimes slowly.

I can't imagine this is good for a generator - 6kW turning on and off completely. The relay's datasheet implies a switching time of 15ms to turn on and 10ms to turn off, for the record.

So, engineers - what's your take on this? Should I install a dummy load to simply pull the rest of this unused power when the heater is off? Will this damage a generator if one of the relays breaks down?

Thanks for any pointers! I'm enjoying the challenge but don't want anything to explode in the field.

4,I am 26 year old. I hate my Major and I am afraid to change it,1568715583,"Hello Engineers of Reddit,

I am a 26 year old guy with a Masters of Science in Mechanical engineering. The only reason I got into engineering was to work in the automotive industry, particularly to be a car designer ( it was a kid's dream, so in hindsight, laughable and naive)  . However, that option isn't available in my country.  I tried applying abroad but nothing is working. 

The only work available for me is construction work, which I can't stand. To me, having a job as a site engineer is a nightmare. I tried it, and fell into depression and had my anxiety levels turned up to 11. 

I'm hoping for some advice, because I feel lost. I hate my major, and I hate the fact that my friends are doing great at their jobs while I'm running away from mine. 

and the thing is that I love writing. I love writing fictional stories and be creative. But I can't find time for that when I have a job in mechanical engineering.   I want to be a screenwriter. I believe I have what it takes but I just need time to write. That's all I ask. But  I'm afraid it's a pipe dream and that I'm deluding myself. 

The idea that I'm 26 years old and dont have my life figured out by now makes me anxious and depressed. I can't get out of bed because I don't want to and I can't sleep because my thoughts are always on repeat telling me I'm wasting my life away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not looking for pity. I just need an objective ,reasonable, voice.  

So far my plans are either:

1- continue doing the work until I find another work which gives me time to write

2- change majors: either in journalism, english literature, psychology , or computer science( and enter the video game industry)

3- apply abraod and do a masters in automotive engineering and hopefully get a job in the car industry.

4- give up on writing and just find a way to love my work.

Since Friday, I have been working on a design, which requires me to work with curved surfaces in solidworks. And it is giving me a really hard time, none of my attempts so far have been successful, and the resources are lacking, there's a hard learning curve, and every tutorial I find leaves me asking more questions because they either lacks instructions or doesn't show every step.

The best I can achieve is 90 procent of what I am trying to do. Solidworks is really bad at telling me why a surface won't thicken or why a boundary surface can't be created. Either I am stuck with an almost shape, which has an unintentionally bend or curve, or I have the perfect shape, which I can't make into a solid, thicken or mirror.

It's like pushing a rock uphill only to have it slip and roll down, everytime I'm almost at the top.

It's really frustrating, because on one hand I keep telling myself that I am learning a new skill and that I am only an intern, but on the other hand I am loosing faith I my own ability and I am starting to feel a bit like an imposter, because I got the internship with the requirement that I will work for them in the future when I get my degree, now I'm not sure I can deliver what u promised during the interview.

I am currently in my second year of bioengineering major and I like it thus far. However I do not know if it will translate. I want to invent medical devices and apps for improved medical care and medical assistance. 
Originally, I was planning to be premed but am debating on that due to work life balance, years of schooling, and work experience but that’s another topic.
I have recently gotten really into the world of tech and read books about artificial intelligence and app development over the summer and really think I would like to work in app development. In my first year at college I took coding classes for the first time (public school system isn’t the best in my area) in c++ and matlab and arduino. I really liked coding and easily got As in both classes, to be fair they were beginner courses but covered things like if, for, while loops file inputs/outputs.
While reading up online alot of people say getting a bioengineering degree isn’t the best choice as it is too broad etc. 
I am really having trouble with choosing a major as I am so unsure about what the future will hold. I don’t have any mentors, and my family doesn’t care. If I try to confide in them, especially my parents they just throw their own experiences in my face and leave me feeling more hopeless and sad then before. 
I also am going to a slightly below average state school because I did not apply to any out of state as I did not have anyone to advise me and did not know better. (My senior year was my high school “counselor” ‘s last). I feel like I missed out on the opportunity to apply to better schools and kind of want to try to transfer to a better school.

15,Axial vs. Centrifugal compressors in gas turbines: why the dichotomy?,1568696322,"Everyone with an interest in Second World War aviation knows that German turbojets used axial compressors, while the Anglo-American designs used centrifugal ones.  This is often taken as a sign of the German designs being more forward-looking, since most modern jet engines use axial compressors.  


But people who know a little more about jet engines know that what matters is the performance of the compressor, not how it compresses air.  And in that respect the German engines were not at all superior.  In fact, a lot of helicopter turbines still use centrifugal compressors.  Horses for courses; there are times when an axial is the better choice (total OPR), and there are times when the centrifugal is better (small form factor, more compact, better debris resistance).  


But... why is the discussion always about the relative merits of centrifugal vs. axial flow compressors?  There are a lot more types of compressors than just those two!  Thermodynamically, as long as the air gets squished it should be sufficient to run a Brayton cycle engine.  


Is there a reason that positive-displacement compressor types like screw compressors, scroll compressors, or even piston compressors aren't suitable for compressing the air in a gas turbine?  


And to be clear, I'm not talking about Hyperbar engines, which are low-compression diesels where the turbocharger has developed megalomania, and I'm not talking about turbo-compound engines, which are piston engines with a partial Brayton bottoming cycle.  I'm talking about a Brayton-cycle gas turbine engine, just with literally any compressor that isn't axial or centrifugal.",AskEngineers,False,carnal_disgust,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d5c9de/axial_vs_centrifugal_compressors_in_gas_turbines/

33,"Stressed, overworked and no idea of what to do next...",1568664004,"TL;DR: Hate my job working as a materials as chemical engineer. I love to code and want to switch fields. Advice needed.

Hello my fellow engineers,

Writing this from a throwaway account so that my colleagues do not find my real identity.  I am an engineer in my early mid-20s working in a small startup (5 people). We are energy and materials company which has been around for \~ 7 years focusing on the development of thin film solar cells. I am underpaid, overworked and I really don't have a future with this company. Things really suck at work for me and I really need someone with experience and has been in similar shoes to offer advice.

Before I start discussing my issues with the company, I wanted to give you a quick background about me so that we are all on the same page. I got hired about 6 months ago, right out of school after getting my masters in materials science. I decided to go for an advanced degree right out of undergrad and in retrospect, I regret doing so. While I love learning about materials, physics, chemistry and all that stuff, I have come to realize that I hate working in hard core engineering. 

 I think I may have adult ADHD (only a speculation at this point) because of my inability to stay focused on tasks for extended periods of time. I also perform very poorly when I have multiple, unrelated tasks to complete - which is exactly the case at my work due to the small number of employees. I have come to realize that working with hardware and equipment is really hard for me because of the long lead time on equipment and wait time for experiments to be completed. My brain simply cannot wait that long and stay interested. 

In school, I got into programming and I love to code, especially when I code to solve an engineering problem. I am no software developer for sure, but I can think my way through a programming problem in chunks. Occasionally, I get to code at work to automate some of our processes and those have always been my favorite days at work. I have also completed some pretty interesting coding projects at school (mostly applying machine learning to engineering problems), but since starting my current job, I don't get to write or practice coding much at all. The thing about coding is that it pairs well (or so I think) with the way that my brain works. I can break down a large problem into chunks and work on each piece individually. The feedback from coding is instantaneous and all small efforts developing one part of the program quickly snowball towards the completion of larger task.

My company is diverse in terms of skill set and everyone is extremely talented and hard working. However, there is no united vision as to what we are doing or why we are doing it. Everyday is a new task/challenge to solve and I really do not think that these daily efforts moving towards anything. I guess the best pieice of evidence for this is the fact that my company has not secured any private funding in the last 7 years. 

Due to the small size of the company, I (and others engineers who work here) have to manage my own department (which consists of only me at the moment) with minimal oversight from our boss (the company CEO). In my opinion, it was a mistake to pass on this responsibility a new graduate without any prior experience. To make sure that everything gets done, I usually have to pull 10 - 11 hour workdays with an uncommon 15 hour workday sprinkled in between. I do no have any share in the company (which is okay I guess considering my short tenure here) and really shitty salary (&lt;60K per annum). Since I am staying so late in the company and working, my social life is non-existant. The worst part is that I do not fell like any of my contributions to the company amounts to anything. Since I have my hands dipped in 50 different tasks at the same time, whenever I ""complete"" anything, it is done so unsatisfactory (everything is v3 at most) and there is no one to supervise my work or check if what I am doing is correct.

My boss likes things done a very specific way and most of the time, they are unhappy with the way I get done. More than anything else, this has been messing with my morale and qustioning my capacbilities as an engineer. All of this paired with lack of sleep, exercise, and the stress is starting to eat away at my mental sanity. I do not want to work like this anymore and I have considered switching jobs multiple times in the past 6 months. My questions to my more experienced engineers are:

1. Is 6 months a really short time for to have formed an opinion about my company and job?
2. I really, REALLY want to work in software. Will my materials science degree be a hinderance for this?
3. How do I even apply for a job while spending over 11 hours at my current work?

40,Help Me In Choosing An Engineering Major: Mechanical Or Electronics,1568651343,"One of the most important decisions if not THE most important decision in life  in your career choice. 

I am currently torn between choosing Mechanical Engineering and Electronics Engineering.

I am currently enrolled in university in an Industrial Engineering degree program. However, I realized I have chosen the wrong degree program. I chose Industrial Engineering because its versatility and ""jack of all trades"" concept appealed to me at the time I was deciding. I chose my degree program by considering its practicality instead of my interests and that was a big mistake. I now wish to shift to either Mechanical Engineering and Electronics Engineering as I have passion for either. 

Electronics Engineering is appealing to me because I enjoy studying about the electronics concepts, components, and circuits and because I enjoy tinkering with electronics. I have been tinkering with electronics since I was 12 and I have since taken up electronics as a hobby and I have assembled little electronic devices such as audio amplifiers and lights. I believe I have more knowledge of electronics than of machines/mechanisms.

On the other hand, Mechanical Engineering is also appealing to me because I have been fascinated by cars and airplanes for as long as I can remember and it has been a childhood dream of mine to design cars and airplanes. The only actual experience I have with machines/mechanisms is fixing up my mountain bike which I do enjoy. 

I am currently leaning towards Mechanical Engineering, but I do not want to make the same mistake twice, so I need to think think this through.

Thing is, from every job I've ever worked at I've always been able to do the work, but this is the first time that a job is asking me consistently to work 60hrs a week to meet expectations and deadlines.

61,"No engineering background, looking at an HFC Designer position.",1568615831,"I work in customer service for a cable company. There's almost a certainty that either you or your grandmother have called me something terrible over the phone. My only experience is in customer service, and I'm dying inside.

Our offices work at a national capacity, which means we're relatively specialized and there isn't exactly room to break out. There are a few exceptions, but these are highly competitive and awarded to people with backgrounds I can't compete with. I recently sat with somebody who got a ITT Tech degree in some kind of engineering/design field. This wasn't much of an aspiration, but more of a fond memory, something she could hardly recall. It came up when we were looking at an outage map which contains HFC Plant symbols and she was vaguely able to identify them. To be frank, she was one of the dumbest people I've come across in the position. She would ask questions that practically answered themselves, and more than once. I remember this was during the last presidential election, because I recall her saying she would vote for Hillary because she wants a female president, but then pausing and saying ""we haven't had a female president yet, have we?"" Anyway, she couldn't figure out how to set up a Set-Top Box, but here looking at this map, she was dropping random HFC terminology to demonstrate she had, at least at one time, had them in her vocabulary. She absolutely wasn't cutting it answering phones at a billing capacity, but when the next HFC Designer position opened up, she got it.

At some point in her life, I'm willing to bet money that this woman has paused for 2+ minutes at a McDonalds drive thru before asking if a double quarter pounder weighs two quarters of a pound. And we all watched her pack her things and move into an office of her own, where her pay probably doubled. Most people aren't petty bitches, so they moved on with their lives. But I found this very inspiring. Please note, I have no experience in the field and mean absolutely no disrespect to the profession. I just found inspiration in the fact that this person got the position. Maybe I could.

I used a free trial for Lynda.com and watched the full Up and Running courses for AutoCAD and Bentley Microstation. It looks very straightforward, and I've quickly taken to many other programs like Illustrator, InDesign, Flash, PhotoShop, etc. After 10 hours of tutorial videos, I have a reasonable idea of what it looks like, and I'm conversational in how HFC Networks work.

After all that, what I came here to ask is: 

Would it be a waste of time to pursue an entry level HFC Designer position with no actual background or education in the field? I'm technically inclined, conversational in the content, and have a desperate need to break out of customer service. Is it crazy to expect that I can fill in the gaps with on the job training?

Glass lathes are very expensive (shipping alone to NZ is thousands), even for small ones, and I thought it would be fun to make my own. About a month ago I asked for input here on ways to drive both ends in sync. I have decided to go with a pair of stepper motors so I can run the two ends of the lathe in sync. I was recommended either this option or to use a spline shaft, and at this point I am interested in learning some basic circuitry and have most of the control gear ready. I have made a 3d mock up of my design and was hoping I might get a wee bit of input here in case anything I am doing is unnecessary, likely to be structurally weak etc. Bolting the whole thing to a desk or similar is on the table too, if that will drastically reduce any wobble. There shouldnt be any pressure (force?) on the lathe like you would get on a wood lathe, most of the tooling is heat and air.

Everything red is aluminium extrusion 2040/60/80. This is all staying where it is in the picture  
Green is 2080 aluminium as well, but it has bearings to run along the linear shaft  
Black is linear shaft, the ones at the top will probably be hollow  
Pale blue is lead screws (one on each side of the center)  
Dark blue is some sort of bearings - I assume a nut welded to the green extrusion? This is only true for the 2 attached to   
the green, the part in the center attached to the red will be some kind of bearing that doesnt hold the lead screw. I   
would love some input here on how to attach these so when I turn the wheels the green will move smoothly.  
The rings are wheels attached to the lead screw  
Stepper motors will be attached to the shafts (on the lathe heads), likely via a belt, so that I can use hollow shafts.  


The idea is for the two heads(?) of the lathe to be able to meet in the middle, and for me to use a wheel on each lead screw to move the heads with precision.

I  was thinking to use sleeves over the shafts that either fit the internal dimensions of the glass tube I am working, or fit inside the shaft to hold smaller rod (the glass I use at this point is from 4mm up to 40mm ish, though I probably wont use anything much smaller than 8mm). This is so I can vary the diameter of glass I use without needing metal chucks, and for when I need to use a blow tube so that I can put one through the whole shaft so as to be able to introduce air. Im not sure how I could secure the glass so that it wont slip or pull the wrong end out of the shaft etc.

Where the rods appear the go through the solid blocks, I will most likely be screwing linear bearings to the bottom of the green extrusion unless this isnt a good idea.

The base is 14mm (2060\*2 + a 20mm gap). Would it be sensible to have an additional vertical piece that I can use to support longer pieces of glass, attachable to the (red) piece of extrusion at the center of the base? It probably isnt very likely that I would be using pieces of glass that would require this. If I was, skateboard bearings attached to a piece of extrusion that was set at the right height might do the trick.

I'm currently a junior studying environmental engineering on the pre-med track and I've come to the realization that I don't want to just jump in to more schooling once I graduate (December 2020) I've taken these past couples of years to really grind down, graduate, and try to enter medical school by Fall 2021. 

I've recently had the thought of working as an engineer before trying to go to more school to at least save up, take the FE while the knowledge is fresh, and gain experience in the field I've been predominantly studying for the past 3 years. These past two summers I've just been taking a buttload of classes to try to graduate and I feel like I've missed out on the opportunity to study abroad and apply for internships (studying abroad was quite expensive and couldn't meet my needs for the past semester and didn't apply for internships because I thought I was solely on the medical route). 

I'm now trying to kill two birds with one stone and try to find an internship abroad. Of course, googling 'environmental engineering internships abroad' hasn't given me much direction so I was wondering if anyone in here has had experience trying to find programs similar. 

Any sort of direction or recommendations would be greatly appreciated for I'm trying to find this opportunity for Summer 2020! Thanks!",AskEngineers,False,jgsabio,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d4v7hs/environmental_engineering_internships_abroad/

69,Is it possible to create airbag modules for hot rods?,1568601018,"&lt;edit: my original post was deleted for lack of a descriptive enough title&gt; 

I have just enough knowledge of auto engineering to know that I don't begin to know what I'm talking about. But I am curious about something:

Would it be technically feasible to design a completely self contained air bag system that a custom car enthusiast could add to their hotrod/Kustom Kar etc? By which I mean, the owner can give a supplier the type of chassis, total weight and distance from steering wheel to chest and get a package that only needs to be hooked up to the chassis electrical system. That means that the only place for an accelerometer would be inside the housing of the airbag.

I know that proper deployment of an airbag requires activating within a extremely narrow time window. A few milliseconds too soon and it won't provide full cushioning, too late and it could end up shoving the driver backwards, greatly increasing the risk of whiplash. But if you know the mass of the car and the driver to wheel spacing can you get close enough to improve the odds of survival? For the vast majority of hot rods you can ignore the actions of crumple zones since they don't have any.

The reason I ask is that I have a ""if I ever win the lottery"" dream of building a wheelchair accessible car inspired by the gorgeous cars made by Figoni et Felaschi and the 8 door Packard cars used in the late 30's and early 40's as tour buses. But I'd want it to be a safe as possible for my family so i could use it as a daily driver.",AskEngineers,False,barbarian818,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d4ui2g/is_it_possible_to_create_airbag_modules_for_hot/

The one obvious loss is that I️ will be producing more steam per unit water overall but I can just require overfill initially that will be lost to steam.

My instinct is to trust the thermo in that no matter how I️ deliver 1800 W, no matter how efficient the heating mechanism, the best I️ can achieve is 3.3 minutes.

I think the root cause is that I’m not motivated. I’m working on a project as the antenna design lead, but it feels like the chief engineer is tasking the guy that reports to me more than me. We’re in a rush to get some drawings out, and these tasks were all given to him; it was envisioned that I would continue on with a parallel design path, but we’ve put that on hold for now. So I kinda feel like I’m in limbo. Also, I can’t STAND this other guy. He’s very wishy washy, arrogant, and not dependable. And yet, I feel like he’s getting to increase his skill set over me. It’s been bumming me out. When I bring it up to my mentors and even the chief engineer, they all tell me that “if I can make so-and-so look good, it’ll look good for me”.

78,Software vs Mechanical Engineering,1568589834,"Hi, I’m a mechanical engineering student from the UK going into my second year of university. I chose mechanical engineering because I enjoyed physics, maths and problem solving at school. I also liked the supposed breadth of the degree, I liked the fact that it was still possible to transition into software or finance. I also thoroughly enjoyed my first year of mechanical engineering, particularly the fluid mechanics, mechanics of materials and pure mathematics, (if I’m honest I kind of suck at CAD though and for that reason I dislike it). However I have recently been having doubts about a future career in mechanical engineering and would like some advice on what action to take. I think a lot of my apprehension stems from not knowing what a mechanical engineer really does. 
     I have been programming for a hobby on and off for a few years now and I really enjoy it. I am also a bit in awe of job positions at the likes of FANG. Of course my awe of these positions is mostly financially motivated and driven by the big bright cool hip side of google as an employer that we are often presented with but nevertheless I really enjoy programming and when given the opportunity to code on my MechEng course I love it.  Lately I have been trying to sharpen my coding skills and possibly begin building a portfolio. 

My question really boils down to what do you think I should do. I could finish my mechanical engineering degree and become a mechanical engineer with some coding skills. I am currently on course to pursue a masters but I could instead graduate with a bachelors in my third year and pursue a masters in CS or software engineering. I could also possibly transfer into software engineering or CS now. Or I could finish my masters in mechanical engineering while building on a programming portfolio so the option is there, possibly pursue a job in mech and then make the transition into a software engineering job.

21,I'm brainstorming ideas on how to improve on the concepts in the Light L16. One is a periscope based zoom and softened xenon flash. What ideas do you have?,1568515266,"I do artistic photography and study the technical side during my free time. I researched the Light L16 and other examples that use multiple lens and sensor combos. I also researched ideas on smartphones with optical zoom that are thin.

The problem with the Light L16 is that there is no optical zoom. The ""zoom"" works by cropping and is destructive to the end product. It changes arrays for different focal lengths. The smartphone maker Asus made one that uses a periscope based continuous optical zoom to keep it thin.

I taught myself how a periscope works. In this device, it will have one rear side element as usual then 45 degree angle mirrors/prisms to direct the lights through a motor controlled zoom lens with an adjustable iris, then another 45 degree redirect to the sensor. If a good idea, an element to concentrate the light onto the small sensor may be used (focal reducer). I'm concerned the overlap may not stay the same without a solution. Would using mirrors/prisms be a solution to this? At an optical level, I would like to have the array to deliver an iris opening and design that delivers the same depth of field as f/2.8-f/16 on full frame 35mm DSLRs. The iris opening should be continuously adjustable. The array needs optical stabilization, parfocal zoom, and the ability to adjust focal length during video without a counter adjustment as a side effect.

For the built in xenon flash, it will pass through a diffuser to soften the flash and help prevent red eye. Red eye is caused by eyes reflecting red and absorbing other colors. What material is best for this diffuser that will be built in?

In simple and industry terms, what are your solutions? What are some good online research papers worth reading? What specific sources do you recommend?

I go to Houston Baptist University. There are physics professors and students at my school.

29,Need help with/opinions on career decision.,1568497518,"Hello everyone,

At the moment I am stuck between a decision which I struggle with. I would like some advice from you.  
The situation is as follows:

I am a mechanical engineer who wants to become a software engineer within industrial automation, preferably in motion control and robotics.

I have two job offerings lining up, each their pro's and cons.

Job one: Kind of a start-up company and enviroment. Awesome people there to work with. I will be working on a totally new project for the company where I will work with robotic arms an let them perform large-scale 3D-prints. I will be responsible for the setup of the robotic arm as well as programming them. First they will perform what is called more 2.5D-prints but after that they want to continue to real 3D-printing. This is quite an unique opportunity to work on in my opinion.

Job two: Traineeship to learn how to work with ISA-88, ISA-95, PLC-programming, Siemens TIA Portal and TIA WinCC (all new to me). The traineeship will consist of about four months of extensive inhouse training and then work on projects for 3 months with close guidance by a more experienced engineer. It will teach me how to be become a software engineer in a very structured way and I think this will give me a good headstart into the field of software engineering. They will aso help me with my future goals through training etc. The catch is that I have to sign a study contract of 3 years of each course I take. If I leave early I will have to pay the leftover money, the dept declines every month.

The catch here is, that my girlfriend wants to move back to the USA in 4 years (she's American). I think job number two will give me a better resume for the USA (I only did internships before this because I just graduated). Also is it common to take over left over depts at previous companies from trainings in the USA? Talking about roughly $10000.

The next day, the report was sent over to us and there was foundation damage. Structural engineer recommended 13 piers along the left side of the house and along one of the back walls.

My concern here is that if you stabilize only one side of the house with piers, the other side of the house is still ""unstable"" even though it hasn't shown any signs of foundation damage (yet).

UK Automotive engineer here, let go last September as part of industry wide cut-backs after 5 years working in a variety of Project/Applications engineering roles at a major OEM. With this cutbacks came a saturation of the market with Engineers looking for work, making it incredibly difficult to find work, particularly when the majority of the industry was reluctant to hire.   


With 12 months out of the industry approaching, I am concerned whether I will be able to get back into it, or if the tech, particularly surrounding EV projects has evolved to the point where a lot of what I knew was now irrelevant. I've had several interviews but almost all result in a rejection in favour of someone with more experience in that specific field, rather than the wide range that I have.

I have internship experience in the aerospace/defense industry working in a manufacturing environment as sort of a data scientist/programmer specialist. I also have done a variety of IE related projects for companies that have partnered with my school. When I graduate, I am confident I will get offers from two different Fortune 100 companies, and perhaps elsewhere if I apply.

My problem is, I feel like I chose the wrong major. After seeing the spectrum of jobs I can get with this degree, I do not feel like it is the path I want to stay on for my career. IE is not a very technical discipline, but I am very technical, which is why I have gravitated more towards data science. I chose this major in part because I was not confident in my ability to do a more difficult engineering program. Those doubts have subsided now as I have developed a work ethic and am more productive than ever. 

I am fortunate enough that I can afford a masters degree without having to take out any loans. Over the last couple years, I have developed a great interest in materials engineering. I bought a textbook on the subject and I am very fascinated with it. I get excited thinking about doing a masters degree in this field. What are your thoughts on the overlap between these subjects?

76,How can I get non-software oriented engineers to follow better practices on software development?,1568407577,"I am currently working on a simulator project that is split across several different subprojects with members from various other disciplines (mostly electrical and mechanical).  Right now, I'm pretty much the only software guy on the team.  People come and go from this project all the time.

At this time, we're doing development in MATLAB, Simulink, and C++ via Visual Studio.  All of these projects are maintained in a single branch in a single Git repository.  We're tracking issues and work via Jira.

Thanks to a lot of trial and error over the years, I've got a decent amount of experience in what works and what doesn't when it comes to keeping a project maintainable in the long run.  Standard practices, common understanding of the tools, general procedures to follow, et cetera all seem to help (if they're followed, at least).

The problem I'm having is that our current way of doing things... well... leaves a lot to be desired.  We have processes and procedures for doing things, and no one has a problem following them.  However, whenever someone new joins the project, it'll usually take a month or more just to figure out where to even begin.  Like I said, we've got six individual projects sharing a single branch (master) in a single Git repository.  If two people change the same Simulink model, the procedure now is just fetch, rebase, and hope the models are close enough to each other.  One person's change can and often does remove someone else's work in progress.

All that being said, I have tried to talk with my team about fixing it.  Everyone on the team just follows what the project manager says.  I try bringing up my suggestions to the project manager, his standard reply is that ""many of our contributors are not professional software developers,"" as though they are incapable of doing anything that is generally associated with software development.  Yet at the same time, this whole thing is being done with Agile/Scrum methodologies with the goal of producing simulator SOFTWARE.

How can I try to get this project onboard with doing things a little better?

Am I wrong to think that a software project should be maintained like a software project?

Is there a magic combination of words that I can say to get my PM to handle software like the rest of the company does?

Is there something about basic software design and version control which makes them impossible to understand unless you've been doing that for years?

I apologise in advance if I'm coming across as arrogant or rude or something.  I just want things to be better than they are, and I don't really know how to do that.

I am visiting some german online forums like cartalk etc. And what bothers me is that most people don't ever cite any real sources. Like: you'll get a dozend different comments on how to best change a timing belt, each of which describing their own makeshift process and none of which citing some official instructions from the manufacturer. Most of the Talk is just canonical knowledge that is repeated over and over until everyone thinks it is true.    
    
In this case I got around those problems by just downloading the instructions from the manufacturer, but there are other cases where this just isn't possible.

I  am thinking about buying a used motorcycle from a driving driving school. They sell extremely cheap because no one wants them, since they were driven by inexperienced drivers. I tried to dig a bit into that topic and tried to get an idea on how much additional wear a bike like this might have, but every comment online on every thread on this topic just repeats the same canonical ""inexperienced driver make motor go bad"" over and over. Except from those few comments where one actually bought one and say they were fine...    
I am starting to guess that some of those common known facts might actually be a bit  overstated. If you kill an engine this will of course cause additional wear on the crankshaft and on its bearings, but would that wear actually be that bad?

In May I graduated from U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which has a really good Aerospace Engineering program. During my undergrad, I tried for the first three years to land an internship for the summer, but I could never get any companies to reply. I did probably fifty of these each year and didn't get a single email or call back aside from rejections. After graduating, I'm having a similar problem. Since then, I've completed several hundred job applications, and had even done a couple my senior year before graduating. I've gotten a handful of interviews, around one per month, but they ended up either being crappy offers that were way too low and/or not really in my field, or not giving me an offer at all.

13,I'm at my first job out of college. The company is sinking and I barely learned any engineering skills. How do I exit?,1568337908,"I graduated as a MechE late last year. After dozens of job applications and 3 interviews, only one company gave me an offer, so I took it. 

It's a hardware startup of several hundred employees. Our last venture capital round closed several months behind schedule and short of our goal. Due to lack of money, development activity pretty much stopped a few months ago. Our product launch keeps getting pushed back. Because of this (and many other reasons), there's been a steady stream of people quitting. Not just engineers, I've seen managers and group heads leave too. Hiring was frozen right after I joined, so the company hasn't filled the empty spots to save money. 

My job title is ""Mechanical Engineer,"" but I don't really do any engineering. My job description was pretty vague and has sentences like ""assist in development cycle by analyzing design to ensure product robustness"" and things like that. I think my position was created as part of a bulk headcount package by some executive and dumped onto my boss. Mostly, my boss will give me a bunch of excel files and ask me to compile the data into powerpoint charts to show trends and stuff. He sends the powerpoints up the ladder and that's the last I ever hear of it. He occasionally sends me to interrogate other coworkers he's emailed but gotten no response back, as sort of a human ""as per my last email"" messenger. From these activities, I've been able to get a broad, shallow knowledge of how our product works but nothing super technical. I've repeatedly asked my boss for more substantial work to do, but he usually is unable to find any (also because of how our development has been paused). One time he was able to give me task of going into the company CAD files and take measurements of certain parameters. I was pretty engaged in that for a week before the company slashed CAD licenses down to the bare minimum to save money and the project became a dead-end. I've asked around with some other engineers that I'm friendly with and they don't have any entry-level tasks I could do.

Should I just try to start over and apply for 2020 new college grad positions? Can I still qualify for those even though I graduated last year?

15,"My coworker is having trouble with a difficult colleague who tries to manage her work, despite being a peer. Advice?",1568334018,"
I know ""Julie"" from work, we both are engineers, she started a while after me and is newer to the industry than me, and I've been trying to help her do well professionally. Teach her the ropes and all. Up till she was hired, I was the only woman in a team of 20 and I've had to work though some difficult stuff. And if I can help make things easier for women who enter the field, after me, I sure want to. Along with work stuff, we've also become pretty good friends.

She came to me with something she was having trouble with at work. During her internship with our company last year, her manager was ""John"" and her peer mentor was ""Dan"". She didn't tell anyone at the time, but Dan wasn't too good of a mentor. He actively discouraged her from going to other people for help or guidance, it seemed like he had a bit of an ego and wanted to be the only one guiding her work. He also talked down to her a lot. (Side note, none of this surprises me, I have worked with Dan as an equal, and even then he has an abrasive and domineering personality. In my experience, he is a poor communicator, and does not understand what the team is doing as a whole, while the rest of us communicate a lot more closely, and ask questions about what we don't understand)

Fast forward to this year, she's been hired full time. John as her direct manager. She's no longer mentored by Dan, they're on the same level in the company. 

This was about the time we started becoming friends, I didn't know her well when she was an intern because she really kept to herself then. This year, she told me about her trouble with Dan, and said that even now, he's being a pain. He seems to be telling her what to do, on parts of the project that she is in charge of. He went over her head, and over her manager John's head, to talk to the top boss at the office about the timeline of her work. And he is still being domineering about the work she is doing, even though it is her work and not his. He has his own totally separate tasks.

Julie went to our manager John about her role in the company, asking him to clarify if she was supposed to be managed by him or Dan. And he said in no uncertain terms that he was her direct manager, and she and Dan were peers.

But even after that, Dan is still acting like he is still her superior, trying to manage her time and her work. Sometimes his instructions conflict with John. And she wanted advice from me about how to resolve things. 

I want to tell her to go to John and tell him ""Dan has done XYZ relating to my work, those all seem like management tasks. And as he is not my manager, you are, could you please clarify his role on the project with him, so there is no further confusion? I understand he may be in the habit of managing my work, as he did when I was an intern, but now it is difficult having two people giving me conflicting guidance on XYZ topics.""

But... I know I have a bit of an overly direct bordering on confrontational way of addressing things. And I don't want to give Julie bad advice just because I'm annoyed on her behalf. Can I have some input on whether my advice is good, or if there is a better way to resolve things?

These sheet metal components first go through a roll forming machine to give them a profile. They are later joined via spot welding. They want us to automate the spot welding portion.

They have 2 requirements: 1) that the machine cannot be copied/replicated easily and 2) that it can be patentable. I mostly have a consumer product developer background; an area where patenting is much more straightforward. However, I am completely ignorant about industrial machinery being patented and even how to design it so that it cannot be copied. 

My perspective on industrial equipment is that you want to design it in a way in which the end-user can see how it works so that components can be swapped easily (like if a relay is bad, you can look up the specs and replace it). Am I wrong in assuming this? Do you know if manufacturing equipment is sometimes designed in a way that makes it hard to be copied?

42,Stack help with hole pattern datum,1568307419,"This is going to be a bit lengthy as it’s a little in the weeds, but I’m looking for help determining whether I’m misunderstanding how allowable datum shift is determined when referencing a hole pattern as the datum, whether the stack method I’m using has an oversight in its methodology, or if this is just one of those in the weeds examples that is an exception to the general rule and just wasn’t covered in the book.

Stack and toleranced figure here: https://imgur.com/gallery/yqrKrd7

Not shown is a note for profile to A, then B at MMC for anything untoleranced.

The stack is looking to determine the maximum/minimum horizontal distance between the edges of the two holes. This is just an example of the concept for an actual much larger study, not something I actually care about.

TLDR up front: if the holes use any of their bonus for individual position, that bonus takes away from that available for shift, so in the case shown, there should be either less bonus shift or no bonus position tolerance, as the bonus position reduces the availability of bonus shift. /tldr

The conflict is between my understanding of how bonus datum shift is reduced by variance from MMC of the reference datum vs that reduction not being taken into account in this analysis method.

My thought process:

-As the 4 holes in the hole pattern (datum B) grow from their MMC, there are two places that can gain bonus tolerance from this growth.

-The first and most straight forward is that each individual hole can move from its true position diametrically by a bonus equal to the amount its size and form departs from MMC. For the stack method, in each column you list the amount of bonus used (vector #4b) based on the size of the hole used (vector #5) in that column. Straightforward and no problem here.

-The second place bonus tolerance can occur is the shift of any feature/pattern referenced to -B- at MMC, such as the center hole in this example. The allowable shift, per the spec, is equal to the difference between the diameter of the Actual Mating Envelope (AME) of -B- and the diameter of the virtual condition of -B-. The way allowable shift is determined in theory for a hole pattern datum such as this is that 4 variable size gauge pins located at the true position of each hole are expanded until they constrain the part as described by the datum. The size of the gauge pins at this point are the size of the AME. The MMC is deducted from this to determine the allowable shift. 

-The stack method instructs one to subtract the virtual condition of the datum feature from the material condition used in each column (vector #5) to find how much shift is allowed (vector #2c) in that column. It does not take into account the position of the holes, which does come into play for calculating allowable shift with the methodology from above.

-My crux is that I can not conceive of a set of actual sizes and positions of -B- datum holes, where one hole is at LMC and shifted to the extreme side of its allowable location tolerance, including bonus, that would allow for the maximum allowable bonus shift. I believe that the only place that max allowable bonus shift can be achieved is when all 4 holes that define -B- are at LMC, perfect form, and perfect true position. I believe this is due to the stack methodology not taking the relative position of the datum feature of size to the datum feature axis into account. This would normally not come into play as they are usually centered with one another with a datum determined by a signal feature, but with a hole pattern datum, the referenced datum does not move with the variance in location of a single hole. 

Am I getting this wrong somewhere? Do I misunderstand how bonus shift is calculated for a hole pattern datum? Is there a group of actual sizes/locations other than the one mentioned that gives max bonus shift at the same time as max hole shift?

My feeling is that, in each column, I should be deducting the variance from position (vector 4a and 4b) from the allowable shift in that column (2c). In the specific example of the minimum calculation column, if all the holes not being used in the stack are assumed to be at LMC, perfect form, perfect location while the one described in vectors 4 and 5 is at LMC and shifted left -0.5, and this time was put in a gauge, there would be only 1.1 units of actual horizontal shift, .3 of the item moving to the left and limited by the out of position hole, and 0.8 to the right, limited by the other 3 holes.

50,Changing major vs. sticking to mechanical?,1568301024,"I'm currently in my first semester of college doing a dual degree program for mechanical and aerospace engineering. Recently, however, I've been having some doubts about this and been thinking about switching to electrical, computer, or the dual degree program for them. 


In my senior year of high school I had the opportunity to work on a year long capstone project, which I enjoyed very much. I was responsible for all of the programming and electrical components of the project (several Arduinos, LCDs, lots of wiring, soldering, and wire diagrams, some basic networking, and probably some other stuff). I was a critical part of designing the mechanical aspects of the system, and I enjoyed doing that, but I didn't actually 3D model anything or do anything a traditional ""mechanical"" engineer would do e.g. stress analysis, drafting, manufacturing, prototyping on that end. My partner handled most of that with me overseeing it and providing design input. For reference on the scale of the project, we applied for a US patent this June and took 5th place in a national engineering design competition with it.


Furthermore, my senior year I was a part of my schools FIRST Robotics team where I... you guessed it... programmed the robot. I was the only person legitimately interested in doing it so I kinda jumped in and learned some Java. It was a lot of stress and responsibility but I actually loved the experience because I was such an important and relied-upon member of the team.


The only reason I haven't really switched already is that I really do enjoy many aspects of mechanical engineering. I like the physics, the design, the iterating, even the documenting. I'd probably be a mechatronics major if my school offered. I think computer engineering has a mechatronics focus, though. In addition to that, I took a digital electronics class in high school where we were using logic gates and using a program called NI Multisim. I absolutely hated the class but I'm not sure if that's because the teacher was brand new and pretty clueless or because of the content itself. I was pretty interested in the inner workings of electronics on my project so I'm conflicted. I think the coursework of mechanical interests me more as I'm excited for fluids, thermo, materials and things like that. I'm really not excited for the electrical/computer coursework.


How common is it for a mechanical engineer by degree to find themselves in a more electrical/programming oriented role? I think I might enjoy something like controls engineering but I'm afraid I'd need an electrical major to do it. I'm really writing this because for the longest time I've thought of myself as a ""mechanical"" engineer but the more I look at it I feel like I'm not. If it helps, changing major wouldn't actually set me back any because the only major specific class I'm in is VBA programming (kind of ironic now that I look at it) which is helpful in its own right.


I think the thing that appeals most to me is the integration of mechanical and electrical components (hence the interest in mechatronics) but I guess I'm just not sure if that's even a thing people do outside of small research labs. Would it be possible/reasonable for me to tailor a career in this direction with a mechanical degree? Does anyone have any advice as to how I might begin doing that?


Again, I do enjoy mechanical. I think what I really love is bringing the electronics and programming into it, though, rather than solely mechanical.",AskEngineers,False,Wildcatter93,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d39afw/changing_major_vs_sticking_to_mechanical/

62,Is prop/rotor 'Jesus-nut' torque necessary?,1568265198,"Hello enginerds! I'm a long-time enthusiast, may join the dark side of engineering some day, but for now, I'm a prior aircraft mechanic and current career pilot. I have a question that's been bugging me for a bit. It has to do with the ""Jesus-Nut"" on aircraft. 

&amp;#x200B;

 (For those who don't know, it's quite common to use a single, very large, nut to torque large propellers or rotor-heads on. It's colloquially called a ""Jesus nut"" in this application because it's such a critical point of failure that if it falls off, you're going to meet Jesus). Simple concept. I'm just geeking out on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

 In a C-130 airplane I used to work on, the propeller is centered on the shaft via a rear split-cone (sitting on a flange machined on the shaft) and a front split-cone, with some drive splines in the middle. A big 'Jesus-nut' squishes the whole thing together with somewhere around 2,000 ft/lbs of final torque. My understanding is that this doesn't cause any bearing preload, so it's just stretching the prop shaft. The propeller itself goes through positive and negative torque situations in flight. After personally removing the prop, you can see that there is ZERO fretting of either front or rear drive cone, leading me to believe that at least a portion of the torque load is taken up by friction between the drive-cones and the shaft.

&amp;#x200B;

The S-61 helicopter I now fly has about the same method of attachment (the whole rotor head sits on some drive splines between an integrated cone on bottom and split-cone on top) 'Jesus nut' is applied and torqued...by hand...until it stops. Yes. 0-torque. My understanding is that the head in this situation is also NOT pre-loading any bearings.

&amp;#x200B;

 My question is this: Why would one scenario require a torqued Jesus-nut while the other scenario doesn't? Wouldn't an un-torqued fastener allow for the possibility of slop (if even a few thousandths axially/radially), causing unnecessary wear on the cones, an off-balance condition of a 2000+lb rotor head, etc etc?",AskEngineers,False,ariawater,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d335fv/is_proprotor_jesusnut_torque_necessary/

73,"Declining offers, do you tell them who you accepted the offer for (or will accept)?",1568251047,"I guess this is more of a social convention disagreement I have with my parents but I'd like to get your input.

Here's the scenario (details are made up):

Let's say I interned at Google this past summer and have been hoping for a return full-time offer. In the mean time I search for other full-time jobs.

Today, I receive a phone call from Google HR that gives a verbal offer and the written offer will arrive through email tomorrow. I fully intend on accepting the offer when it arrives.

At the same time, I also receive a voicemail from company XYZ asking me to interview in two days. I don't plan on pursuing the interview with XYZ; it's just not comparable to Google.

I plan on calling XYZ back and letting them know I plan on accepting another offer so they can move on to the next candidate (also, even if I accept the written Google offer first and then call XYZ back the situation/question below doesn't change).

If I call XYZ to decline the interview and XYZ asks with which company the offer is for, I wouldn't be afraid to mention Google. A similar situation happened last year where I had already accepted offer A and then received offer B and when declining B, they asked ""just wondering, who did you decide to work with?"" and I told them company A. I thought nothing more of it then and think nothing more of it now.

My parents believe that I should not, especially if I haven't accepted the Google offer yet since the written offer hasn't arrived, tell company XYZ that the offer is with Google. Their reasoning is that the person from XYZ might have a contact at Google and could go and badmouth you or say something like ""That guy you offered to is real rude"", etc.

I disagree with that reasoning because why would someone who does not know me make up bad stuff about me? And I am not saying they're not badmouthing out of the goodness of their heart, but the fact is would XYZ recruiter not be in deep shit if Google told me what XYZ said and I ended up reporting that (it reminds of the /r/TIFU post where the guy unfairly badmouthed a former coworker which lost that former coworker a job offer and the former coworker sued the guy and their previous company)? Is there not too much liability for actions that would benefit no one?

I had not even begun to treat the issue this deeply (to me, if someone asked what I think is a simple question of where I ended up, I would reply normally). But I asked my parents if they insist on hiding who they accept the offer for, what their response to ""who'd you end up going with"" would be. They mentioned you could say ""I would not like to answer"", ""I don't want to share that right now"", ""I'm still in the process of accepting the offer so I don't want to share anything"" (this response seems a little more reasonable), and other stuff along the same lines of ""No"".

To me, I feel like that's someone asking ""How are you?"" and you replying ""I do not want to answer you."" Sure, you have the right to not reply to that question but the person might think you're a bit of an ass since ""How are you"" is the least charged question you could ask. So if we're thinking this much in depth about the whole Google situation, I think dodging the question would remove (what I believe to be minuscule) risk of badmouthing from XYZ but instead leave a slightly worse impression with the recruiter from XYZ.

Maybe the whole issue is I think company XYZ asking who the offer is with would be a more casual question (which some recruiters might not even be interested in asking) whereas my parents think there is some ulterior motive to that question.

I need some perspective/guidance.

Background: 

* BSME (grad 2014)
* Previously I had 4 years experience with a small 3D printing med device company doing primarily design work (it was a really easy gig with low responsibility and low accountability, and had freedom in workflows as the products were almost all custom)
* Some experience with very small projects 
* Personality: generally quiet, anxious, but can really blossom if I'm with the right people. technically minded but not a genius by any means. quite a happy, easy-going guy
* Got hired at new job at large med device manufacturer for the aforementioned super dooper hyper important project six months ago


Now for the tale of my demise:

I've been doing hardcore process validation work for all of 6 months. The project I'm on is incredibly fast paced. I'm on a multi-functional team. I got hired to do supplier validations for a contract manufacturer of a relatively complex assembly. Sounded good, I like working with people (despite the anxiety) and I'm a fast learner. I felt I was ready to dive right in. Or so I thought... 

Validation is a bit of an authority position. Along with this authority should go expertise. And since it's a supplier role (with a supplier that has a weak validation system), I have to be able to provide significant guidance. 

I have been making ok progress on learning validation stuff (which is really damn hard to learn), but GOOD GOD am I horribly anxiety-ridden when I have to pass on guidance to the supplier. Even discussing these with the internal team is absolutely painful. I'm painfully afraid of being wrong and I feel my questions are seen as stupid. Which has led to me either staying silent on issues where I shouldn't have, and being a clumsy mess when I actually do speak up. I'm so lacking in confidence that the knowledge/input I do have seems flimsy and unreliable to everyone. I've really tried to learn from my mistakes (I haven't made the same one twice), but there is still just so much for me to learn. 

I've never worked in a big company like this, with so many meetings, so many rules, so many expected social skills that I haven't mastered. I do have a mentor who is super knowledgeable but makes me feel like a complete idiot. I hate asking him questions because he just makes me feel bad. It's conditioned me to not ask questions.

Ultimately all of the anxiety, mistakes, more anxiety, more mistakes added up to appearing totally incompetent. My manager who is really great, said that I'm exactly the person she intended to hire, but I'm not the right person in the eyes of the rest of the team. So she removed me and replaced me with someone else.

I was relieved at first, but as time has gone on, I feel really dejected and my spirit is crushed. So I come to you all. Have you experienced something like this? How did you handle it? How did things turn out? What can I do to better myself in this dark hour?

**TLDR:** Got hired for a role I wasn't skilled enough for. Did my best, made mistakes, became saturated with anxiety. Got removed from project. How do I process/move forward?

It's chewing teeth off belts. There are 4 spindles being driven with 90degrees of wrap on each pulley. I knew I was pushing it with not a lot of wrap and the belt runs well at quite high tension. But things wear and this is in a 24/5 plant, so it needs to be bulletproof. Belt &amp; pulleys are the quite small MXL series.

I'm struggling with what seems like a silly concept. If I modify the assembly to double the pulley width from 1/4"" to 1/2"", would that improve my tooth ""skipping"" resistance? Tension would be the same and thus pressure across the wider pulley would be lower. 

The belt is not snapping, nor are the teeth being directly sheared off  - it skips a tooth, then skips again, and......eats the teeth off the belt in that location.

Attached photo is a cross-section. For reference -- the room to increase pulley diameter or use idlers to increase the degrees of wrap isn't available. The drive pulley is on the right, blue idler pulleys, then the 4 driven pulley/spindles.

Could an idler pulley be pressed to the backside of the belt around the pulley? Seems like bad practice, though.

Or perhaps there is a toothier series of belt than the MXL type - that would have pulley diameters of \~.75""?

85,What are your thoughts on findings from the 4-year study that was just released by the engineering department at UAF?,1568235576,"http://ine.uaf.edu/wtc7

The objective of the study was threefold: (1) Examine the structural response of WTC 7 to fire loads that may have occurred on September 11, 2001; (2) Rule out scenarios that could not have caused the observed collapse; and (3) Identify types of failures and their locations that may have caused the total collapse to occur as observed.

The UAF research team utilized three approaches for examining the structural response of WTC 7 to the conditions that may have occurred on September 11, 2001. First, we simulated the local structural response to fire loading that may have occurred below Floor 13, where most of the fires in WTC 7 are reported to have occurred. Second, we supplemented our own simulation by examining the collapse initiation hypothesis developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Third, we simulated a number of scenarios within the overall structural system in order to determine what types of local failures and their locations may have caused the total collapse to occur as observed.

The principal conclusion of our study is that fire did not cause the collapse of WTC 7 on 9/11, contrary to the conclusions of NIST and private engineering firms that studied the collapse. The secondary conclusion of our study is that the collapse of WTC 7 was a global failure involving the near-simultaneous failure of every column in the building.

I have a huge interest in schematics, electronics, wiring, programming, simulation, modeling etc. And I find these things are all found on job postings for Controls Engineers. I'm really starting to get the feeling I shouldve been an electrical engineer... might take a masters in electrical, computer, or controls engineering down the line. Would like to hear what people say about that also...

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm building a robot for a professor that utilizes PID controls, and part of the startup team for another professor's Controls lab. I'm taking normal MechE coursework, and I'm working full time in processes. At work in my downtime I'm working on the robot, reading stuff such as Practical Electronics for Inventors, learning Python, and trying to get deeper into PLC trainers.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of these job postings list similar things:

Redlining electrical drawings, wiring schematics

PLC/HMI/SCADA experience

Rockwell/Siemens/Allen Bradley Experience (normally Rockwell)

Knowledge of Electrical Engineering in order to understand system interactions, sizing of equipment, and fuses.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a year and a half to land the job. What could I do now that would make me a shoo-in for such a role coming from a MechE background?

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all advice welcome.",AskEngineers,False,PM_ME_YOUR_SUNSHINE,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d2ugw0/meche_to_controls_engineering_career_switch/
93,Should I drop out of Grad School?,1568220505,"Hello Everyone,

So I recently graduated with a B.S. in engineering and just started Grad school at a state school along with a full time job as an engineering CAD drafter for a construction company back in august. I got the job to cover basic finances while going to school as well as getting some engineering experience using the degree that I had since the market is pretty tough here in California. As a result, the pay isn't the best, but I love the job, and was told that I would be promoted to Project Manager as I worked through the company since they liked me so much, which has a much better salary but not the best. The plan initially was for me to work at this company to gain CAD experience so I could move on to be a design engineer, but since the company has proven to offer more, and with the job market being so tight, I'm becoming more and more hesitant to continue my education. Since they don't require me to go through grad school for this, each day I go back to school losing motivation because I'm getting the feeling that I'm wasting my time. I have a grant that covers the first year so finances aren't an issue, but I'm not sure if I even have the motivation or willpower to go through with this. I'd have to finish in 2.5 years since I can only do 6 units at a time without burning out, but even then that's been a struggle for me. I've been so locked on time that I'm not able to perform as well as I did in school, and I'm worried that if I continue I will only fail the first semester. I now have a choice, either I continue to scrape by these classes with work for a degree I may not need, or I drop out now and pursue the degree later.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Got into a full time job &amp; grad school. Like the full time job more since it has guaranteed career opportunities in the company whereas getting the masters will force me to switch jobs, since it's useless in the company.",AskEngineers,False,Tradermon,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d2t4pz/should_i_drop_out_of_grad_school/

98,Cleaning Digesters In-house or Contracting it Out,1568213991,"  

I am curious to know if has any experience cleaning out wastewater digesters. I am interning at a large waste water plant, and was tasked with looking into alternatives to contracting out our digester cleaning. We have ten digesters ranging from 1.3-2.6 million gallon capacity. We are a combined sewer outflow (CSO) city and we get a lot of grit and inorganics in our system. We are planning to clean five digesters a year and each digester cost about $250,000. 

I have found a plant in Southern California that cleans out their plant them selves and have been in contact with them. I am reaching out to see if there are any other plants out there that have experience cleaning the digesters in house or is this just something that is contracted out.",AskEngineers,False,mblanket7,/r/AskEngineers/comments/d2rhbe/cleaning_digesters_inhouse_or_contracting_it_out/
