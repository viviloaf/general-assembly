3,Making a turbojet from a turbocharger,1377143531,"Been doing some research on how to make a turbojet from a turbocharger, and it seems relatively simple, but I want to more than just dump hot air out the back of the turbine. I was thinking of how to make the engine run a generator/alternator to power an electric motor. Hopefully powerful enough to run a small truck but I'm starting to think that may be out of reach. A bit ago Jag did a concept car that used a turbine to power a generator in a hybrid system, and I want to try that. I see three ways to turn the turbojet into a turboprop. 

1) Run a shaft directly off the turbojet. Probably the most straightforward, but has a higher chance to stall the engine and I'd need to convert the oil bearings to ball bearings or graphite bushings, and I'm not too keen on that. 

2) Do something like Don Giandomenico from www.rcdon.com did where he made his own stator on the GR-5 turboshaft. At this point in my life (19) I have doubts about the integrity of a 15000 rpm ""fan"" that either me or my dad make. These could be baseless fears, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

3) Do something along the lines of what Bruce Simpson was going to do at http://www.aardvark.co.nz/pjet/turbine4.htm. This seems like the best way to me. Problem is, he doesn't go into much detail on what he did. Not too big of an issue though. 

4) Something like what Salvatore Aiello is doing with his Freepower Turbine, which seems even more difficult to make than what was done on rcdon.com. This is probably the simplest to implement but hardest to make. 

Anyways I'd like to know what people who have any idea of what I'm getting into think. I'm probably going to just do the engine first, then the turboshaft later, just to figure everything out. 

Also, what are some other websites and youtube channels I can get info from besides

5,Potable water Cl addition spreadsheet help [x/post from /r/math],1377139382,"Hey folks, math question here.

I sail as a marine engineer (glorified mechanic) and our pump that adds Chlorine to the potable water system has shit the bed. I've been tasked to figure out how much to add to the tank at 1 week intervals (filling schedule) by means of a spreadsheet for documentation.

This is what I have so far.

The tank is not symmetrical as it is outboard on the ship hull, which means a sounding of X cm does not give an equivalent result in tons to Y cm (it does, but it's a function I am unable to figure out). I have a three page table of tonnage results for various tank soundings at various vessel trim, and have found a basic formula for tonnage results that is within +/- .05 tons; which is reasonable;

=3.79+(0.989*C3:C33/4)

3.79 is the base (sounding of 0) and the C3:C33 is referencing the sounding value from column C (25cm gives 9.97 tons at even keel)
I need a formula for figuring out how many ml of Cl to add to keep the pot water at 1ppm cl/fresh water (EPA states no more than 4ppm, IMO says no more than 2ppm; so I am going with 1 ppm. If anyone knows the best reading I'd love to know)

I have this, but am not sure it is right.

=((D2:D331000)(0.001))

so for a sounding of 25cm (D2:D33) I get 9.97 tons and an addition of 9.97 ml of Cl for 1ppm.

I need the formula to take a previous ppm reading (if less than 1) into account. so if we add water, and the reading is now say 0.255 ppm how many ml of Cl would I add to bring the reading back to 1ppm

I have this but again, am not sure it's right. (forgive the Exel bs)

=((D2:D331000)(0.001))-((D2:D331000)(0.001*B2:B32))

where 0.001 is 1ppm and B2:B32 references the current reading.

10,Ball joints for tension,1377109935,"Hey everyone,

I had a question concerning ball joints for in line tension applications.  I have an Instron that I've been attempting to use a furnace with to get high temperature deformation measurements.  Because of the furnace, I've had to use long rods of 316 stainless steel to ensure the Instron is not subjected to the temperatures the furnace is held at.  Unfortunately, the coupling piece between the instron and these rods is very slightly off, such that there's a small off center tilt to the rod (rod itself is quite straight).  Given the length of the rod, these causes a noticable skew, which throws off the measurements.  I was thinking of replacing the coupling with a ball joint, but the ball joint would need to be able to withstand ~10k lbs (45 kN) of tension.  I've looked at McMaster, and it seems like the ball joints they sell are mostly used for coupling rotational motion, not tension.

I am considering getting a graduate degree in nuclear engineering to pursue a career in that field, since I wish to get a job in either computer science or some form of engineering and nuclear power is of interest to me.

Do you guys have any advice on entering the industry assuming I get into a nuclear engineering graduate degree program? I plan on taking classes in nuclear science, fluids, heat transfer, numerical methods, and complex analysis at the recommendation of my departmental advisor, along with the usual physics classes (thermo, mechanics, quantum, PDEs, etc.). My fear though is that I might not be as attractive to companies as someone with a pure nuclear engineering educational background, and I'm not sure if a graduate program would remedy that. 

Ideally I would get an internship at a nuclear company during my time as an undergraduate for resume building and to see if the job field is something I would enjoy. I worry though that because I technically am not pursuing an engineering degree though I'm part of the engineering school (my major is part of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences program, along with applied math). 

I plan on applying to other types of programs/jobs during my senior year just in case my prospects for this industry don't pan out, most likely pure physics and computer science.

Hey guys, just wondering about getting a job offshore somewhere, either in Europe or some obscure location. :D I'll be finishing my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering in July 2014 (3 years in the UK)

Throughout my student life, I've had just a couple of work experiences ranging from civil architecture to my current summer internship with an oil and gas company that mainly specialises in designing rigs in Southeast Asia (I live in Asia). The problem is, I've tried asking my coworkers about it but most of them do not have experience in working offshore or they lack the appropriate knowledge for working in Europe and such.  

I've looked on a couple of sites which mainly hire for the oil and gas sector but most of them require years of experience or/and training in various skills. Honestly though, I've no idea what type/sort of job I'm looking for. I don't mind starting from the bottom of the chain and just working through it. My main questions are:

1. How do I get into the industry with barely and experience and skills in this industry

2. What type of job should I be looking for in this industry with a degree?  

3. What type of job should I be looking for in this industry without a degree?  

4. How do I get the training for the skills to get a job in the first place?

However the policy of the company is that I have to be an intern before I can transition into full time.

Hello (again)
So a week or so ago I posted this thread: http://redd.it/1jxbk4 and got an absolutely delightful response! But now it's gone.
==probably a good idea to read the first post if you think you can/would like to help me!==
Unfortunately I had little access to internet and other issues going on which made it impossible to reply to even say ""thanks hold up i'll respond when i can"". So I put forward my apologies and thanks for that responder.

Now. Since then I've done a little more investigating and I'm starting to think ""Industrial Design"" is something similar to what I'm looking to do (I'm trying to use the right wording so that when I search things I can get the right results). I've found a few university courses under ""Mechanical Engineering"" that mention Engineering design and such. 

From what I remember the last fellow to reply said that mechanical engineering might not necessarily be what I'm looking for. I did, however, say a broad number of things that I wanted to be involved in and I've since come to the conclusion that I'll never be able to complete projects on my own. So...

The part I want to be involved in, in projects, is the design aspect. I'd like to be able to know what's going on, why I use certain materials and what happens when I do *this* or *that*. While I'd absolutely LOVE to be the one building every part, I understand I couldn't realistically do this as a career so the ideas/design section holds the most profitable interest. 

Would Mechanical Engineering cover basically what I want to be doing? 
How do I find out which universities have the best engineering courses?

For the past few years, we have run a festival using car batteries/an inverter, but this year we're lost because our electrician friend is gone and we need help! The idea is to have a few batteries charging throughout, and hooking up one battery to a DC to AC converter which will then power amps, a mixing board, cabs, and a PA. 

So -- how should we go about doing this? What batteries/inverters to you recommend? What volts/wattage should we be looking at?  3000w should be enough. ",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/1kgawg/powering_a_concert_with_batteries_and_an_inverter/

I've been working in an engineering physics lab for about 6 months doing whatever they need me to do, mostly pretty easy work. I am more interested in sustainability and geological/environmental engineering. 

My question is should I continue working in this lab which I don't mind doing or try to find another one more in the field I intend to study? I would have to start over and there's no guarantee I will find another internship in the my field. Or I could stay with the lab and become a bigger part in the research. I could also stay they for the rest of my undergrad, but I do not see myself continuing work in the lab during grad school. I took this lab job because I knew the professor conducting the research. The lab is one of the best in its field and would look good on a resume. I'm just wondering if a lab more related to the field I study would look better. Thanks for reading and any advice or past experiences would be appreciated.

91,Home Alternator help (x-post from r/ECE),1376597233,"Hi there,
I'm a rising sophomore and I'm studying EE and haven't taken that many EE-specific classes, so my formal instruction on electricity is basically V=IR.

Anyways, I found [this](http://www.gotwind.org/diy/12-inch-mini-turbine.htm) website that shows a guy making a little alternator/turbine using copper wire and a magnet. It seemed pretty simple to make, there are only like 5 things going into it, so I decided that I should try to replicate it.

I bought a slightly stronger diametrically magnetized magnet than what the guy had and I used 28 gauge bare copper wire (the dude used .38 mm diameter wire and 28 gauge is ~.31 mm I think). The only difference between what the guy wrote down and what I used was my bolts were made out of a metal (Zinc, maybe?) that is attracted to the magnet, whereas the dude used stainless steel which is non-magnetic.

I made the mounts out of the same material, wound the copper wire in the same way that the guy did, used an LED to test but nothing happened when I spun the magnet.
So I have questions, naturally.

I ended up with 4 wire ends total, how should I wire these up? I don't know what's ground and what's not, or even if there is a ground for this, so I just tried every combination of the wires and nothing happened.

Does the material of the bolts matter? Should I try making it again with stainless steel bolts?

93,Any ideas for a senior design project in Bioengineering? (x-post from EngineeringStudents),1376589102,"Hi guys,


I'm about to enter my fourth year as a Bioengineer at UC Riverside and was wondering if anyone can share some ideas for an interesting senior design project.


I have some rough ideas which are centered around veinipuncture, but don't know how realistic they might be. I was thinking of using infrared or maybe ultrasound to locate veins in the arm and have a robotically controlled needle do the insertion. The problem is finding how deep the vein is and I just found this patent which is very close to what I want to achieve: http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20110301500


I was also thinking of trying to implement MIT's video magnification of subtle changes to visually see where the vein is located instead of using infrared or ultrasound. More info can be found here: http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/


I thought I would give reddit a try to hopefully get some constructive criticism on my idea as well as any new ideas anyone might have with MIT's magnification or something completely different. The ideas can really be anything at least with some relation to the human body. Previous groups have done robotic hands or prosthesis as well as arduino enzyme detectors as an example so this can be open to mechanical and electrical engineers as well.

99,Is there such a thing as a lightweight high-speed train bridge?,1376575387,"(Context: I read an article that noted that a single Hyperloop tube was as heavy as a conventional train, so I was wondering about the weight of train track).

A TGV train weighs ""only"" 1.9 metric tons per meter, but a modern 2-track viaduct deck weighs a whopping 34 t/m (40% ballast, 40% 30-cm-thick concrete deck: source is a [French exam subject](http://media.eduscol.education.fr/file/STI2D/51/5/lyceeGT_SujetO_STI2D_Tle_corriges_version1et2_218515.pdf)). Note that the pillars are spaced 45 m apart, which is comparable to Hyperloop's 30 m.

Is it fundamentally impossible to make a high-speed train that can travel on a deck that isn't much heavier than itself?

---

EDIT:
The idea is to understand if conventional train tracks are fundamentally heavier than Hyperloop tubes, in order to evaluate the potential cost reduction that Hyperloop might bring. So:

* only the deck weight matters, not the pillars (assuming, say, 30 or 50 m spacing);
* no crazy materials incompatible with a realistic train budget (under 100 M$/mile);

5 months in and I am a assistant project manager(read ""acting superintendent""). I possess far more than an average amount of trade skills and I can predict the method of construction needed when a project is superficially explained to me. 
Unfortunately I only take in $9/hr(35 per week) on top of $8/hr(20 per week) at my second job.

To add stops along the way, could you place stations along the route where people load into train-cars which then accelerate to the speed of the incoming train and run along side it. The train-car would then dock with the main train and allow people to get on/off. Then the car would undock and return to the station.

39,Questions on school paths for a current college student.,1376326641,"I am 1 year into a Physics degree at a small liberal arts school in the U.S., and I'm going to do at least one more year there.

However, very early into my college career I determined I wanted to do Engineering (Electrical or Computer), and that I'm paying WAY to much for college right now (~31K /yr after all scholarships). 

Here are my options:

* Transfer to an in-state tech school (NC State, which has a very good program @ approx 20K /yr) at the end of my two years here to get a BS in Eng, but would probably take me a total of 5 or 4.5 years, with a low likelihood of 4 years. (I'm probably not going to do this)

* Do a dual degree 5 year program (guaranteed 5 years), 3 years at my school, then two more at one of 2 different engineering schools. Both of which are very good, but no better than NC State, but are more expensive (40K /yr unless I get a scholarship, which is unlikely).

* Finish my physics degree, then try to get a job with that (seems like a bad idea. Browsing physics forums tell me that I need a Ph.D.)

* Finish my physics degree, then go get a M Eng, and get a job with that.

I am not interested in physics academia, and while I can afford to pay for whatever I choose to do, I'd really rather not graduate with heinous amounts of debt, unless I know I can get a job with my education and pay it off. Suffice to say, money is important to me. 

I've been browsing this subreddit, as well as others, and other forums for advice, and this seems like the place to get my help.

So, engineers of reddit, I really need you I don't know which one of these paths is the best (or will even work), and I want you to give me some details on each of these; tell me what seems like the best to you.

I'm having a bit of an issue with my wifes 2006 Chevy Equinox.  The radiator cooling fans will not cut on to keep the engine cool.  When I took the electrical connectors off of the fan, I noticed that both connectors were burnt and the connector to the Aux Fan relay was burnt.  Here is a list of everything that we've done so far:

* Replaced the cooling fan assembly last year (because it wasn't cutting on).
* Replaced all 3 relays (LO Relay, HI Relay, and Aux Fan Relay)
* Checked all of the fuses
* Jumped the fans (both turned on when jumped)
* Changed the thermostat
* Changed the ECT sensor.  
* Changed all of the burnt connectors (about 2 months ago)

I noticed today that the new connectors are now burnt.  None of the things I did above have made any difference.  I'm at the point where I'm considering direct wiring the fan to the battery and toggle switch (OFF-LO-HI) that will be controlled manually by the driver.  My question to you, Reddit, is what are some things I will need to consider when wiring this circuit?  

Also, what is the best way to add resistance to a 12V circuit, such as this, for the LO circuit?  Are there resistors available that can handle this sort of wattage?

80,Structural Integrity Curiousity,1376015783,"Hi there Engineers,

I've recently become rather concerned with the structural integrity of the apartment building I live in.

**The building**

About 100years old 3 story wood building built on loose soil(no bedrock) in a seismically active region of the western US. Somewhat subpar maintenance througout. Oldest structure in my neighborhood and was supposedly temporary. There are 4 structures all of very similar construction sharing a common courtyard each with 6 apartments. I live on the first floor in the oldest building. From sleuthing I've found out that my apartment and the one above me have had the highest turnover in the complex.


**My Observations**

Nearly all walls have large cracks and deformations that have been simply painted over. The floors in each room are tilted noticeably in different directions. People walking around on the 2nd floor cause windows to rattle loudly but primarily on one corner of my apartment. Heavy motions upstairs result in floor creaking which seems normal but recently I've noticed that the walls creak as well. In particular the walls on the front(street side) of the building never creek but the rear(courtyard side) of the structure rattles from several points when cars drive by, doors(front, back, upstairs or basement) are closed, neighbors walk, etc. The rattles have been severe enough that my desktop monitor shakes noticeably if a door gets slammed or there is stomping. This never happened when I had my office in the front of the apartment. In the room(courtyard side) with the most severe sounds come from a wall which has a large inward bulge halfway between floor and ceiling.

In the basement below the room with the worse rattles there are two supports that have some additional bracing. The braced area coincides with a large bulge in the center of the kitchen floor(courtyard side) which is next to the room with the rattles and creaking.

The interesting thing is how differently my part of the building behaves compared to the other 1st floor apt in the building which just has floor creaking. When compared to a 1st floor apartment in another building the differences are massive. That apartment has few creaks and no rattles except during the heaviest of door slamming, but also has no basement.

**Courtyard**

The coardyard is paved, I've noticed that walking heavily in the courtyard results in an odd hollow sound from below. When it rains the water flows into the cracks of the pavement which seem cavernous showing no signs of collecting, haven't found any obvious outlets.

All of this seems to suggest to me that there has been earthquake damage(not unsual for the area) but also a lot of uneven settling and maybe some interesting erosion. My question is basically when does this become dangerous? Are there points of no return that should cause alarm? Would this concern you?

I'm planning on moving out due mostly to these concerns but trying to decide if I should complain and to whom.",AskEngineers,staticgoesdynamic,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1k01xb/structural_integrity_curiousity/

91,What happens to in compressible pipe flow if all static pressure is lost via friction?,1375978184,"Lets say you tried to put 40 gpm through a 1-1/2"" copper pipe. That would be a velocity of 7.5 ft/s and a friction loss of 25' per 100' of pipe length (or 10.8 psi per 100 ft)

Lets say I tap a city water line that is pressurized at 75 psi. If I have 695' of 1-1/2"" copper pipe that has no change in elevation, that is a 75 psi loss due to friction. 

What happens as you lengthen the pipe? Is there a maximum flow limit? Choked flow comes to mind but I believe that is only in compressible fluids. Does pressure go to zero and the water is no longer taking up the full cross sectional area of the pipe ... almost like a drain by gravity pipe?

Curious!

Fortunately I was able to land a job in the telecommunications industry, working as a Structural Engineer in the Southeast. I very much like my job and my company, and they have actually promoted me to project manager (task management to 4 other engineers) and given me a raise despite only working here a little over a year. 

Dilemma: I desperately want to leave my region. I want to move west. I'm sick of the southeast, I've outgrown this city. But I love my job, and my bosses are great.

Question: I feel like I have gotten some very good fortune and positive momentum in my career; how much damage, if any, would I do to my career progress by leaving a good thing at this point? Does there seem to be many hires on the west coast these days (are they offering relocation bonuses)?

I feel like right now I might need to just learn and wait it out at least until I get my P.E., but on the other hand I don't want to get stuck in this town because I talked myself out of a risky move.

The company I work for sells civil-related construction materials and our engineer department provides designs for contractors using those materials. The materials we manufacture are related and can be used almost interchangeably depending on the application and what the owner prefers aesthetically. When we write the reports that are submitted along with shop drawings, much of the language is the same for each type of product we would use. Currently, we have a ""design report builder"" program that allows us to use multiple forms to select options and then the ""builder"" uses those selections to generate a report. As I said before, much of the language is the same - only specific fields are modified when different products are specified. The program itself is out of date and it's difficult to modify. It was written in VBA and writes to MS Word, so as you can imagine it's pretty intense. I'm looking for some software or MS Word plug-in that does the same thing, but is easier to use/modify. Most folks I've asked from around the industry say they use one large Word document and they go through and erase what they don't need - that seems like a waste of time.

Unfortunatly looking at the future courses offered by my school, energy management does not seem to have it's own course. 
I'm curious about meters, and how they work.

For example, Schneider electric.. they make a slew of different meters, and have a location in my town here where I hope to get a co-op job next term.

1) How do the meters actually measure the energy or gas used?

2) How does one determine the best meter for a particular location? Obviously the supply voltage requirement is important, but after that, what are the key criteria?  I'm thinking along the lines here of an industrial setting, where you're asked to find cost savings for a building.

3) What features are most commonly used/required, and which ones sound nice but are never used? Obviously some sort of data logging is a must, as well as error messaging/alarm. 

I guess I'm confused about how to really justify or specify which meter I would choose for a location.  At my first co-op job earlier this year (just doing Autocad corrections, and some minor design), my supervisor  had to place meters in an area that did electroplating for a shipyard.  I went back to school before that project was finished, but he was deciding between two Schneider meters.. IIRC it was an ION7650 or ION7300, and he chose the 7650. My question is why?

The problem is that I understand in order to freeze the cooler packs and ice, it takes energy from my freezer. Assuming my freezer has a temperature sensor to regulate when it needs to kick on, it is going to have to work harder when I need to refreeze them.

Would the energy used by my freezer on these cooler packs and bags of ice and the external heat created in order to push this extra energy from the freezer offset the money I would be saving on not setting my central AC as high?

My brothers new house has a rainwater collection system. It collects a fair amount of rain, so there is a risk of overflow. the old owner just had the barrels overflow, but the result is that the tiled ground beneath the barrels has sunken quite a bit. My brother then attached a hose to the top of the barrels, allowing water to drain through that hose. He then rolls the hose out on the lawn whenever there is a risk of overflow. I then suggested to him that he plug the hose and drill some holes down the length of the hose, allowing water to dissipate into a much larger area of the lawn. 

The question is now: How do you size the holes and the distance between them? At first my initial thought was that the sum of the area of the holes, should add up to the diameter of the hose. But then I thought about it and the fact that the overflow tab is located above the lawn means that there must be some sort of pressurization going on, meaning that the holes must have different sizes in order to make sure that water is distributed evenly among the holes. 

Being an electrical engineer, I know nothing about fluid mechanics/dynamics. I approached the subject by looking at it as a sort of resistor ladder. A current I flows in, and through each ""hole""(resistor), a current of I/n must flow out. But I don't know if I can approach it like that at all.

Our vision is to help poor farmers escape poverty by providing an opportunity for farmers to increase their crop yield, diversify their crops, and ultimately increase their income.

We developed and manufactured foot-powered irrigation water pumps (pressure treadle pumps) at a local metal shop. In the past, we have been testing the flow rate by timing how long it takes to fill a 20 L bucket and counting the steps it takes. We test the pump at least 4m above ground to test the condition of lifting groundwater from a well. The whole process can be time consuming when multiple pumps have to be tested at once. Therefore, we would like to design a simple test setup while still ensuring the pump performs satisfactory at maximum pumping condition.

The treadle pump can lift water from up to 7m vertically and push water 7m above ground vertically or 100m horizontally. It is operated by stepping on the treadles, like stair stepper machine, which moves the pistons in the cylinders up and down. The cylinders are attached to two channels, so in each step, water is drawn up through one channel and pushed out through the other channel. We attached a vacuum gauge just before the inlet channel pipe and a pressure gauge right after the outlet channel pipe. The inlet draws water 1m below from a water jar and pipes are fitted at the outlet, which pushes the water back into the same water jar (about 2m of pipe length). Since the flow varies, we try to record the maximum reading of outlet and inlet pressure and ensuring it can pump to total head of 14m. Is this test setup appropriate for testing the conditions outlined and for determining pump performance? Any help or advice would be appreciated!

I personally have several, but in particular, I find myself utterly unable to concentrate on anything when I hear people talking.

Ear buds, when combined with some sort of noise generator, do work but are extremely uncomfortable. Headphones don't block enough noise. Earmuffs, which I currently use work, but not nearly well enough. While they block out some noise, they don't come close to making talking inaudible. But it gets worse. See, most earmuffs advertise the ability to hear speech as a feature, presumabely for people like construction workers. 

Now, I've also tried active noise cancellation. The problem with ANC is that it is basically useless for unpredictable and changing noises like speech. Moreover, I've found it not very effective with higher frequencies.

One of these is cooking.  Cooking is in general heating something to the point where you would pull your hand away from it.  This is definitely the case when turning on an indandescent bulb, that the filament gets 'red' hot.  Similar to an electric stove.  ~~Regarding the flourescent light I know in older models a filament would take a few second to heat up, and now they are almost instant.  Basically the question is if you somehow had your hand on the filament would you pull it away (from the heat, not the electrical charge.) ~~

**EDIT- i did not mean to ask about the light providing chemicals in fluorescent bulbs.  i was asking about the filament which begins the lighting process by heating up to cause a chemical process which makes the light.**



There is disagreement about whether heating an iron stove to where the metal glows is 'cooking' or 'making a fire' (both of which are prohibited).  Some call it a fire, so some people call turning on an incadescent bulb 'fire' instead of 'cooking'. This is probably the source for why many people associate electricty with 'fire' that and the sparks when turning on plugs sometimes.  This is a misconception though, jews don't (or at least shouldn't) believe electricity is fire.

TL;DR- Does the filament which begins the light process in a flurescent bulb become so hot when you turn it on that if someone had their hand on it they would pull it away from the heat?

**edit: I am realizing now in doing research based on replies that the criteria for the filaments may not actually be 'hot to the touch' but 'hot to the point of glowing'.

As I understand it the flat plate sides will deform under pressure causing the edges to contract away from the pipe therefore putting all the force on the welds, and this is what causes the tank to fail. My thoughts are that I need to know the Modulus of elasticity of the side plate, and the force that is exerted at the welds from deformation, and then calculate the strength of the welds because the welds will be the weakest link.

89,Sales vs. Engineering Salaries,1375474665,"I've been working for a company doing design engineering work for a few years now and recently I've discovered that the salesmen here are far better paid than the engineers.

Not to mention the senior level sales staff easily makes 5 to 7 times what I do, which I can at least sort of understand given their experience level. My question is, is it typical in everyone else's experience for salesmen to be way better paid than engineers? It's definitely not all about the money for me, and I'd never go into sales, but it just seems a little odd. 


Edit 1:
Just to clarify, I wasn't trying to say engineers were somehow more important than salesmen, or even that they should necessarily get paid more.

Over the summer I had to help revamp a dryer unit for a class, and one of the devices used [was this thing.](http://www.mccdaq.com/usb-data-acquisition/USB-500-Series.aspx) Other than almost melting it, it was nifty, albeit not that accurate.

Recently I began brain storming reimagining’s of da Vinci’s flying machines. I have come up with a couple of solutions and a couple of problems!

Solutions:

1) In order to make flapping the wings feel more natural I figured that making ""flippers""(mimics the motion of a flipper but is actually a shoe of sorts) attached to an axil of sorts that flaps the wings

2) In order to attain lift the wings must fold in on the upstroke and extend on the down stroke (this can be solved by a simple piston)

3)to have greater wing control there should be a glove of sorts where if you clinch certain fingers corresponding parts of the wing i.e. twist your wrist the wing twists

Problems: 

1) I do not know if it will be able to create enough lift with a simple swimming motion.

2) I don’t know if it will be possible to take off from flat land without the wings hitting the ground.

22,Insulation of underground utilities from adjacent steam utility.,1375281299,"With regard to underground utilities, is it possible to insulate a concrete conduit bank from a leaking steam line installed underneath?

The steam line has had leaks in the past, and may or may not develop leaks in the future.

My question is if it is even possible to insulate a concrete encasement against superheated steam. Wouldn't the insulation eventually just heat through with no method of shedding that heat through the encasement to the surrounding area?  I know a little about heat transfer but just thinking conceptually, it would seem that you could have fantastic insulation, but it would eventually be overcome since there's no where really for the heat to go in this environment since concrete is a good insulator as well. It's essentially like having a pot on the stove, the steam is going to curl around the bottom of the encasement and up the sides as it percolates through the soil.

The bank is a large (4' wide and 4' tall) concrete encasement of PVC conduit, the steam line is 14"" in diameter installed ~1-2' below the bank. Is there any kind of insulation solution that would protect the PVC from melting from the extreme heat of a superheated steam leak?

27,Job search tips for an entry level civil engineer?,1375233411,"Hello,
I've been applying for entry level civil engineering jobs advertised on indeed.com, engineerjobs.com, and those type of websites. I know that almost every recent graduate is applying for these jobs. I got an interview from a craigslist post but did not get the job. I have been searching engineering firms online and sent my resume to them. I recently read that most jobs are unadvertised and the easiest way to get these jobs is by networking. I've been wanting to go to local ASCE events and network, but being unemployed and with no money makes it very difficult to attend these events. Most of the local ASCE events are lunches and social events. My friend offered me a call center job and I will be doing that just to pay bills and continue my job search.

My question is do any of you know of any other websites or have any tips on how to search for unadvertised jobs? Also, what was your strategy in finding a job? Thanks in advance.

I made a chain oiler for my Motorbike which simply drips oil onto the chain as I ride. 

It works great except for one flaw, me...  The design is simple, oil reservoir, pipe and a gas tap I got of an old BBQ. Before I go for a ride I twist the tap a little bit to get the flow of oil correct then off I go. Now here is the flaw... After a good solid 5-10 hour ride I get home my body is aching and I'm in adrenaline deficit and I have on more than one occasion forgot to turn off the tap and filled my garage with oil. 

So what I want to do is connect a solenoid valve to the pipe and ignition so when I turn the key the valve pops open.

I also need a little help understanding the pitching moment with regards to Reynolds Number. It seems to me the torque on the airfoil decreases with a higher angle of attack, which makes sense since the flatter the airfoil with respect to a horizontal axis and air blowing horizontally, the more distance air would have to go over the airfoil to create some sort of rotational force.

There are a series of Tee connections that have a blind flange attached to the thru-flow end ([picture attached](https://www.dropbox.com/s/py7bkk30ofv2hom/MinorLossTee.png)). Typically, in a tee you have both a branch flow and a thru-flow with different minor pressure losses (K-factors) associated with them. Since the blind closes off one end, I've been treating these as 90-degree short radius bends. I was recently told that I could not do this and that I should still treat the fitting as a branch flow Tee.

I disagree, however. I feel that in the fitting, the fluid would become essentially incompressible in the stagnant/closed-off tee branch and would be similar to a 90-degree bend (shown in part B of the picture). Am I doing this right? Is there a method for evaluating pressure losses in this particular Tee fitting scenario?

I'm a senior ME student in South Florida, I have an internship with a powerboat company in Tampa Bay that is motivating me to shoot for a high paying engineering job so I can afford the finer boats in life. 

A friend of mine (well, more of an acquaintance) has a job lined up with Baker Hughes on an oil-rig as an electrical engineer. I understand these jobs pay high- as in over 150k or so. He isn't very helpful about pointing me in the right direction on how to get in contact with the recruitment team, so I come to you.

Any experience, pointers, or company names you can give me? I am seriously interested in these jobs as I'm pretty forever alone so I'm completely okay with being gone all the time.

With this method we have various Germanium detectors which allows us to detect gamma decay from samples and report it to our software in counts. From this, we can establish sample activities among other things. However, lately we have found that our copper-lined, well-style Germanium detector has been recording a high amount of background noise from the high voltage source. We changed the cable, but it seems to still be producing problems for us.

A 'renac' is a corded hair tool that has a round brush and blows warm air. It's function is to smooth and or create curl at the same time as drying the hair and it works very well.
The problem is in order to do one section the user must hold the tool in one place for an extended period of time.
I would like to know if it's possible (with regards to weight and function) to create a wireless version of this product so that several at time could be left in the hair. Large clamps would hold the units in the hair. 
The amount of heat and air required wouldn't be as much as is required in the units now, as the unit would be close to the head at all times.
This would allow the user to roll her hair into rollers that blow her hair dry into a curl formation. Ideally different sizes would be available.
I was thinking of re-chargeable units that sit in a base charger when not in use.
If you do an image search for renac Google you will see what the original singular use product looks like.
I am looking to find out the feasibility of this but also if it's positive, a partner to share in the profits with. I know what I know is not enough but I am also aware that the hair care industry generates billions of dollars a year.

Q1. My first question is about the motor, it is a really inexpensive motor but seems to have about the same specs as other motors that I have seen in other similar bikes.

Q2. I was planning on using an arduino to control the ignition(?). This is probably a huge side track but I wanted to setup an NFC reader in the handle and if the chip was valid then it would allow power to be feed to the motor controller. A more conventional way to think about this would be a [Key Switch](http://www.amazon.com/Key-Switch-with-2-Keys/dp/B0002BA3PE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374837008&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=key+switch) to the arduino but there I get stuck because a 48v 300amp relay is expensive and not common, is there a better way to do this?

Q3. The arduino will also control the turn signal, horn and headlights. Do each of there components require a relay and 2 wires?!That seems like a lot of those little guys. Whats it called when you get 2 shielded wires in a another shield so it looks like only 1 wire?

GQ. If my bike ends up weighing with a rider 500/600 lbs (300 for bike 200 for me or 300 for a buddy of mine = 600) will that motor be able to handle it? It seems like 6 HP should be enough.

87,Leaving the Technical side for the Management side,1374814477,"I've been an Electrical Engineer for the Navy for 3.5 years. I moved very far away from home for this job. I would say that I am an average to good electrical engineer. I was able to successfully perform at the most difficult tasks that I've been assigned (Testing lead and Direct Technical Support). My original plan was to get promoted to working level (done) and then get my PE as soon as possible (eligible for the April test). The loose reason for this is that I don’t plan on staying where I currently am geographically forever. As such, I’ve been wanting to make myself as appealing as possible for the day that I eventually move closer to home (to raise a family, be closer to aging parents, college friends/support network, etc.).

However, I've found that opportunities in management keep throwing themselves at me. Whenever a big job comes along that requires interfacing with upper leadership I've been able to step up and fill that role more comfortably than my peers. Because of this, they sort of defer to me whenever possible when it comes to talking to the big whigs. This has been noticed and is why I've been offered an opportunity in the management track. Unfortunately, the promotion is not so cut and dry. The job is totally administrative / planning. So instead of looking through technical manuals and diagrams I’ll be attending meetings and preparing strategy presentations. This does appeal to me but I hesitate to turn my back on my engineering since I worked so hard to get the education (5 years) and experience (past 3.5 years).

Also complicating matters is that the position is only a partial raise in salary. As of now I get a small cost of living allowance and a special bonus for having the title of Electrical Engineer. If I were to move to a management track, I’d become an Assistant Project Engineer, keeping the cost of living allowance but losing the special rate. Better explained here (my current track;GS-11Step2) [Electrical Engineering Special Rate](http://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2013/Table422H01012013.aspx) and here (My potential promotion; GS12Step 1) [General Engineering Special Rate](http://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2013/Table414H01012013.aspx). If I were to become a GS12 as an electrical engineer, it would take me at least 3 years and more likely 5. This is not a guaranteed promotion and is a bit longer than I’d hoped to stay, to be honest.

It seems as though I’m leaving too much money on the table by not taking the promotion. I’ll be losing a bit of my marketability for when I move back home but I think the risk might be warranted as I am already somewhat of an obsolete engineer. That might be a bit self-deprecating but the systems I work on are outdated. I do have the ability to learn, though. Can anyone offer me some advice in this situation?

74,Electrical Engineering Question/Situation Involving a 12v Inverter,1374168410,"Hi folks, appreciate your time.  I'll just blast through what I've got going on here, and would appreciate any feed back on why what I'm seeing is going on.  I'm in Canada, for anyone overseas.

Parts:
 
(+) Batteries - two deepcycle RV / marine 12 batteries connected in parallel, fully charged

(+) One inverter (Canadian Tire, rated to 400w), has two 110v outlets on it and a USB and is connected to the two 12v batteries

Cables:
(+) Cable 'A' - One of these:  http://www.homedepot.ca/product/indoor-outdoor-heavy-duty-extension-cord/965864  Note little light things on the socket end to denote powered.  Three pin.
 
(+) Cable 'B' - Generic 50' extension chord with ground pin, probably Canadian Tire or Home Depot.
 
Problem:  Weird cabling issues
 
Known info:
If I plug cable B into a wall socket - no issues.  I've used this cable for close to ten years with no issues to drive a strimmer round the garden.  I've put my multi-meter on it, there is no cross-over of current from end to end and the GFCI I plug it into when I use the strimmer has never tripped.
 
I have used Cable A to run power from my generator to inside the house - no issues, works fine, have powered my Dyson, blender and microwave off of it for an entire morning when the power went out.
 
If I plug cable B, into cable A, which in turn connects to the inverter without load two things happen.  1)  The 'live' lights on cable A go out and 2) the output to the second socket on the inverter dies.  It's like cable 'b' is shorting something out, but it can't be - since I use it fine to drive the strimmer from a wall-socket and I've tested it with my multi-meter to check for any current bleed along its length.
 
Cable A will drive the strimmer fine from the inverter.  The strimmer is two pins.
 
Plugging cable 'A' into the treadmill from the inverter causes the live lights to go out, without even turning the treadmill on, but it will happily drive a two-pin fan.
 
Any ideas what's going on here?  The one that has me truly confused is why the power dies the moment 'B' is plugged into 'A' with no load, or if cable 'B' is plugged straight into the inverter.  It's like the inverter just hates cable 'B', but I have no idea why.  I could understand if I had something plugged in to cable 'B' that drew massive current, or was shorting - but I don't have anything connected.

It's almost like the inverter doesn't like some cables and appliances, but I'm not seeing much of a pattern.

Thanks for your time, appreciate it...

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Edit =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Did some more testing last night - this is what I've determined:

Grabbed a new 3m 3-pin extension cable, plugged that in, plugged the laptop into that, no issues.

Here's where things get pretty weird.

Grabbed the 50ft cable extension cable that produces odd effects.  Removed everything from the inverter, powered it off.  Powered it back on.

With reasonable repeatability...

1)  If I plug the 50' extension cable in with no load a) the inverter cuts off and b) cuts power to the 2nd outlet on the interver, therefore, if I then plug my laptop power brick into either the 50' extension cable or the 2nd outlet - no power.

This is the truly weird bit:

2)  If I unplug the extension cable from the inverter (and reset the inverter), and plug the laptop power brick into the extension cable and then plug the extension cable in - it works, just fine.  It does not trip out the inverter and if I leave the extension cable plugged in but remove the load of my laptop the power continues to flow and I can plug my laptop in to either the 2nd socket on the interverter or reattach it to the extension cable.

I can see why it would trip out with resistance of 50' cable + a load, but I still don't get why it trips out when the open-circuit of the 50' cable is applied!  Thinking I'd lost my marbles I repeated the test, and it does seem that for the most part, the 50' will work just fine if the load is attached to the cable before the cable is attached to the inverter.

Thoughts?  (This is now just a pure matter of curiosity to me!)

Admittedly I feel a little silly asking you guys this because it seems like such a basic problem - admittedly, I've never been good at heat transfer problems.  I'm having a lot of trouble figuring it out and I'm on a real time crunch here at work.  So here it is:

I have a (4in Dia, 303 Stainless) cylindrical shaft that's running through a cylindrical cooling sleeve that I'm pumping cold water (25 degree C) through.  The temperature at the hot side of the shaft is 800 C; I need to cool it down to around 200 C.  How long do I need to make the the cooling jacket/sleeve?

Here's a rough diagram that I sketched out to hopefully clear up the problem - http://imgur.com/4mNC4b5

What would it look like if I used a different shaft material?
What would the problem look like if I changed the shaft diameter?

At some point I'm planning on running this through SolidWorks simulation so any guidance in that regard would be appreciated as well.

99,Structural Engineering : Wind Load on a Sign,1374007113,"My friends and I like to challenge each other with periodical difficult problems using things we've learned in school.  Today, I drew up a problem that's proving frustratingly difficult, yet looks so simple.  Even the P.E.s in my office, one a county design engineer, couldn't answer it!  Someone please help me!

Imagine a road sign.  One pole.  Green board mounted on the side.  Here's a quick 3D model:  http://imgur.com/TiCiLlB

If it matters, my dimensions are as follows.  Sign board is 10' x 5' x 3/8"" steel.  Post is 10"" diameter concrete, 29' tall.  The wind on the structure is a 45 mph wind perpendicular to the sign @ 85ºF.

The goals were as follows:  1. Calculate the deflection of the sign board.  2.  Calculate the torsional angle in the sign post.  3.  Calculate the deflection of the post.

Now, disregarding all of those numbers, here's where the problem begins:

Calculating the load on the sign using fluid dynamics, creates a force (N).  This force is distributed over an area: N/m^2.

However, every deflection calculation I know is done using a 2D beam.  The load is given in N/m or similar units.

How on Earth does one go from N/m^2 (the pressure on the sign board) to N/m (the distributed load on the beam)?

Deflection a cantilever beam is given as Wl^3 /8EI.  If, for example, the load on the sign was 1000 N, is it really just as simple as:

1000 N * (10 ft)^3 / (8 * 200 GPa * 1/12 * 5 ft * (3/8"")^3 )",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ifscc/structural_engineering_wind_load_on_a_sign/

21,Mining Engineering and Employability,1373887102,"Hi there, I'm a civil engineering student in the UK and I'm interested in the field of mining engineering. I would have liked to do a mining engineering degree, however there is only one place in the UK (Exeter I believe) where it is possible to do so, and so I decided to go into civil engineering instead. 

My question is, is it possible for someone with a degree in civil engineering (which would most likely be focused on the geotechnical side of civil engineering) to get into the field of mining engineering? Do most people in the field have specialised degrees in mining engineering?  If it is possible to get into the field through a civil degree, what steps are required to be taken?

I'm trying to get a laptop with exceptionally long run time compared to the length of time it's plugged into a wall for recharging.

There's only a few and they're battery model specific, and only serve one battery at a time.

So, like the idiot I am I naturally would like to know if it's feasible to make one myself. The goal would be to create a device into which multiple batteries of a given type can be plugged for charging simultaneously from a standard wall outlet.

64,"In light of the recent human powered helicopter happenings, I present you with a question. Could my idea for a human powered heli work? If not, why?",1373600078,"Let me preface this by saying I'm neither an engineer nor an artist so bear with me here. I've had this idea floating in my head for some time now, and I'm curious if it would ever work. Lets not consider the safety factor, as this is really just a question of would it work. 

First, my rudementory sketch: http://i.imgur.com/KLQWoO5.jpg

I can't draw blue prints so I must explain the drawing to the best of my ability. The one thing not shown here would be a swash plate. The swash would be controlled by cable. (Imagine a beefed up bicycle brake cable) The cable would connect on the back and on the side of the swash plate to control forward/reverse pitch and side to side pitch of the rotor disc. These cables would run to the control levers inside the ""cockpit"" if you will. Obviously my drawing is not to scale. The control leavers would be more like a joystick, tilting left, right, forward, and back. Thus controlling the rotor disc, which controls your direction of travel. 

The rotor blades themselves (top and rear) would be collective pitch, and controlled in a similar manner on the other ""joystick"". (Collective pitch on top rotor controlling your lift, and on the rear controlling your tail left to right)

The sprocket system in the front would be something akin to a 10 speed mountain bike. Start at 0 collective pitch, in first gear, and begin your spool up. Proceed to second and third gear to reach desired head speed/rotor rpm. Then as you apply positive collective, you attain lift. Just like the real deal. The geared sprocket system will allow you to maintain high enough head speed without peddling 100mph constantly. 

Now I assume the biggest issue here would be that of weight vs. lift. How light would the whole thing need to be to obtain enough lift with reasonably sized rotor blades? My idea is that with the ability to maintain higher head speed, you may be able to get away with a smaller rotor. Less lift from smaller rotor, but higher speed to compensate. That is compared to low speed but high lift capability (like the most recent human powered ""quad copter"")

The other issue would be making the swash plate system and collective pitch systems. This would all need to be cnc'd out of aluminum I would assume for weight reasons. 

I'm sure there are a ton of other details I hadn't thought of, etc, but in THEORY, could it work?",AskEngineers,SaggyBallistics,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1i4pdt/in_light_of_the_recent_human_powered_helicopter/

68,"Possible Career Paths for New Grad with BEng in Materials Engineering, Canada",1373590734,"Dear AskEngineers,

I am a recent graduate of a BEng program in Materials Engineering (henceforth ME), who is starting to try to figure out what to do next. In addition, I have a 3 year BSc in Physics. It's a quirk of my school I think, I haven't seen many programs like that. I started out in COOP, but only did 2 terms, both of which were research at universities, one of which was not even in engineering, but rather, chemistry. I have a few questions that you knowledgeable Engineers of reddit might be able to answer. Thanks in advance for reading, and potentially responding.

I've been trying to find potential jobs, but I find it very difficult as ME is almost never listed as a requirement for jobs, even though I'm sure a degree ME would be satisfactory. This, combined with the fact I have no idea what Job Titles correspond to jobs where an ME background is desired is making it hard for me to make sense of my possible career paths. I guess, ultimately, I'm not quite sure what BEngs in ME do. 

Here are some specific questions:

* What are some common Entry Level Job Titles that an ME grad has a good chance of getting? If you have a list, that would be much appreciated. 
* What are some keywords that indicate whether a job is likely to want a BEng in ME?
* What are some Jobs that likely don't consider ME grads explicitly, but would be doable by an ME grad?
* What are some places (in Canada, or elsewhere) where clusters of ME Jobs exist?
* What are some companies that tend to have ME Jobs?
* I'm unsure if this question is really relevant to a new grad, but what are the markets that tend to pay more for ME grads? What the markets that tend to pay less? What are the Job Titles that tend to be paid more? What the Job Titles that tend to pay less? 
* Is it possible to find an ME Job in big Canadian cities like Toronto or Montreal?
* Is my 3 year concurrent BSc in Physics useful for anything? Would it make getting a specific ME job easier?
* **If you are an ME grad, and you have the time and desire, could you please tell me a little about your job, what you do, and the path that you took to get where you are?**

In short, I find myself constantly making stupid mistakes, and increasingly doing so in the past few years.  This happens both in school other aspects of life.  Some examples:

1.  On a fluid dynamics test, instead of using
pressure = force / area
I wrote
force = pressure / area
and used that an entire problem.  Didn't even notice the error when I went back through the problem.

2.  Reading a test problem, rereading the problem, underlining the density given, writing out the given density myself, then using the standard value for the density of air instead.

3.  Playing a card game (Kaijudo, if anyone wondering): I know what play I should make, I somehow KNOW what my opponent has, and I play the wrong card and get hard countered immediately.  I've come to realize I lose a majority of my games just because of this.

It's becoming incredibly frustrating to know I botch my grade and throw away games because of foolish errors, but I can't seem to find a way to correct it.  Slowing down, forcing myself to think how to solve a problem or what play to make for several seconds before making it, ensuring I get adequate sleep; none seem to be helping.

It also terrifies me to know I keep making these kinds of mistakes.  At some point, I want to be in a high level design/research job as a head of the project, and recently I was invited to send my resume to the professor who heads my school Aerospace Vehicle Design lab and tentatively do some work/research in his lab.

About two weeks ago, the generator stopped producing voltage.  Thus began my quest to repair the generator so I can get my equipment running again.  A little background: The prior owner had flipped a 110/220V switch while running the generator.  It fried the voltage selector switch.  He then rewired it to run only 110V.  After I bought it, I rewired it to run 220V and it worked until two weeks ago.  I think I ran it about 20 hours prior to failure.

I replaced the AVR, thinking this was the issue.  I didn't test it, like an idiot.  But the cap looked like it had blown and shot electrolyte out.  So I replaced the AVR, and still no voltage.  My heart sank.  I suspected the field coil.  I pulled the stator assembly off to investigate the field coil. Nothing appeared to be wrong with the field coil.  I put a screwdriver on the field coil and energized it with a DC power supply.  The filed coil produced a magnetic field and held the screwdriver on until I de-energized it.

I was at a loss, so I went back and investigated the stator.  There it was, three burnt out coils.  I suspect it is because of the prior owner's switch flip mistake.  I called the company regarding a replacement coil.  Turns out it's $400 and I have to buy both the rotor and the stator.  I don't really have the $400 right now, so I'm considering rewiring the stator assembly.  I'd like to rewire just the one coil that burnt out, but I'm not sure how easy this will be.

99,"College student getting started on a drafting project using AutoCAD, a little lost and looking for some general advice",1373410601,"Hi everyone, 

I recently applied for a part-time internship with a structural engineering company that needs some drafting work to be done. The company representative that I talked with said they just needed some AutoCAD work, and since I took a class on AutoCAD about 3 years ago I applied. They recently gave me some sample drawings but didn't explain much about what to do with them and so I'm somewhat confused, but I don't want to ask them for details quite yet for fear of being rejected. I know, perhaps I deserve to be rejected, but I don't want to give up just yet since it seems like a great opportunity to improve my skills with this program.

So I'm here hoping to find an engineer comfortable with AutoCAD who wouldn't mind answering some questions to get me started. It shouldn't be too much; either I'll understand what I need to do better, or I'll realize I'm in over my head. If you're willing to talk for a bit, please message me or leave a comment. Thank you very much!

2 questions I need answered: for a simple drawing to be drafted on AutoCAD, how much would one charge and how long would it take? Same for a somewhat simple 3D object.

Edit: I'm working with both 2D and 3D, but right now what's confusing me is the 2D drawing. I was given a rough drawing of a warehouse floor plan with rooms, doors, dimensions, and I-beam placements, but I wasn't given any information on the walls (materials, thicknesses). Can I do without this?

Edit: By the way, I do happen to be looking at some videos on AutoCAD while I hope from some help here, but they go through the material pretty slowly which is why I would prefer talking to somebody about it directly.",AskEngineers,brusselsprouting,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1hyux3/college_student_getting_started_on_a_drafting/

I have a few theories, so maybe someone can verify/offer further explanation as to why things are this way.  


* (The *sshole theory) The engineers that did this are sadistic and enjoy doing this

* (The conspiracy theory) There's a big conspiracy with car companies and tool manufacturers and car companies design their cars this way so that tool manufacturers can sell more tools

* (The financial theory) Car companies do this so that people will be too lazy to work on the car themselves, so people then pay shops/dealerships to work on their cars and these places are more likely to buy the official parts from the car manufacturer

* (The unknown problem theory) The people that design these systems have never had to work on vehicles with this problem and have therefore never been made aware of it

Here's the scoop, I had a hot tub that was working perfectly fine until the pump died. So the pump was then replaced with an equivalent (according to the manufacturer) pump and nothing else. Since replacing the pump, the hot tub has been overheating. I'm guessing the new pump might have a higher flow rate and is potentially creating some issues. I double checked the wiring on the pump and it was done right. The tub reads the correct temperature, but for some reason it continues to hear past the set temperature until the overheating temperature trips and shuts down the system.

I'm currently trying to design a device, and one of the parts would be a threaded tube going through a collar to enable the axial adjustment of the tube by rotating it. The thread would be very fine with hopefully low tolerances, the pitch being around 1 mm (about 25 TPI). The diameter of the tube would be between 100 and 130 mm.  

Now, I know that I should ideally use bronze for the tube, but bronze is more expensive than aluminium, and a lot more dense. I was aiming at using 2011 aluminium due to the good machining properties.  

* How risky would it be to use aluminium as the outer collar if the thread is well lubricated and cleaned of all debris?  
* Would 316L stainless work better for the outer collar (due to the difference in hardness)?  
* The part would need to be adjusted only slightly, but often, it would rarely need to be unscrewed fully. How much of a problem would the possibility of the lubricant drying out be?  
* How corrosion prone is 2011 actually?

21,Testing the strength of a DIY linear actuator consisting of a stepper motor and a lead screw/nut. [XPOST /r/askElectronics],1373313203,"Caveat: I am not an experienced engineer but I enjoy learning as I go. I am working on a motorized, micro-controller driven, astro-binocular chair. At the moment I'm working on the binocular positioning mechanism and have an engineering question.

I need to measure the lifting force from a homemade linear actuator. Its eventual application (as a pair) will be in raising and lowering a platform supporting a pair of 15lb astro-binoculars and I need to determine the feasibility of a pair of motors I have on hand.

Here's my measurement plan:

I want to characterize the output power of the actuator over a range of step rates as well as micro-step sizes of 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16.

A digital hand scale is mounted in a vice. In a separate vice, horizontally positioned relative to the first vice, will be the stepper motor. A 1/4""-16 single start lead screw is coupled to the stepper shaft and the lead nut is attached to the end of a foot of 3/4"" square aluminum tubing. At the other end of the tubing is a hole through which the scale's hook is positioned. Activating the stepper motor causes the tube to be drawn in or pushed out.

I'm using an Atmel atmega328 mCU and an A4988 stepper motor driver, with pots to control step rate and size and an LCD showing both.

When all of the slack in the scale's chain and hook are taken up, the screw will grow taught and tension will be put on the scale, up to the stall point of the motor. At that point I'll record the measurement from the scale in a table of values.

I would welcome any comments at all, but in particular I am uncertain whether some form of dampening would improve performance between the load and the actuator tube.

Although I haven't performed the tests yet, in my mind it seems to me that the abrupt cessation of movement when the system goes taught will cause inaccuracy in the reading. It seems like some kind of spring to take up the initial load would improve the eventual reading when the motor comes to stall.

Secondly, if my reasoning above is correct, I'm not sure how to compensate for the partial load that a spring would bear or even how to determine how much of a load that is.

45,Electrical Help - Trying to fix a headset,1372995644,"Hello everyone.

Recently I have decided to try and fix a headset which has been broken for about 6 months now. It's a [Turtlebeach PX21](http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/ps3-headsets/ear-force-px21/48). It's quite a good headset in terms of sound, bass and mic quality although structurally it is absolute garbage. It consists of a headset, with speakers and mic, connected to a little [control box](http://www.tbeach.com/Portals/0/Products/PS3/PX21/Tabs_Html/images/PX21-Details2.jpg) where everything is adjusted. Well this control box is connected by a round wire (as you can see in the image) which is EXTREMELY prone to wear and tear, such as twisting and bending. I've made the assumption that this has degraded some of the connections of the wires.

The first issue I had was when the right earphone partially stopped working (the one NOT connected to the control box). When I say partially, I mean that I could readjust the round wire on top of the control box to temporarily fix it. This went on for a few months, and I ended up securing the wire so it worked normally and all was good. After a while it gradually got more and more difficult, until the right ear wouldn't work at all. At this point I just bought another cheaper headset to substitute for the time being. I'm really determined to get this fixed but I need some assistance as to what I need to do.

**Current State** 

* Can no longer hear out of either ear, aside from an EXTREMELY faint sound from the left ear, even with maximum volume.

* I have opened the control box the circuit board. It appears as if there is possible corrosion damage or general wear and tear to some wires. Note: The headset has never been wet and is generally in a cool dry environment.

* I opened each earphone to find that all wires seem to be fine and connected, justifying my assumption that there is an issue with the control box.

* The microphone and microphone mute switch works perfectly fine. Also the volume control is working seemingly fine (goes from faint sound to nothing).

I can post pictures of the circuit board and wires in high quality if necessary. 

If anyone is able to help it would be greatly appreciated. I'm also looking to learn more about electronics so thanks if you decide to help. :)

48,I'm having second thoughts about mechanical/automotive engineering. Looking for real advice on how to proceed with my life.,1372981421,"Firstly I want to start out by saying a lot of what I am going to say may be unfair stereotypes but that's why I'm here in the first place. 

I just did one year at a community college with mechanical engineering as my major. I was sure I wanted to do it when I started a year ago but I'm turning 19 later this month and feel like I've matured a whole lot in this last year. I'm also starting to get doubts about whether I want to be sitting at a desk for the rest of my professional life. 

So my first year started off successful with almost straight A's but it had a lot of gen eds. My second semester I failed my calculus 1 class and that has strongly discouraged me. I am going to retake it and should get a B if not an A because I understood all the major concepts but the little rules and exceptions to the concepts threw me off. So I want to know how important calculus and high level mathematics in general is. I also took a drafting class which I greatly enjoyed especially working with autocad. But I don't want to be making autocad models of Camry transmission casings for the next 40 years. I say that because I am very passionate about cars and would want to go into automotive engineering. I have moderate experience working on cars and know how most everything works. And I'm am just astonished by the amount of engineering put into great hyper cars by Pagani or Koenigsegg. So how hard would it be to secure a job like that here in the us or an English speaking job in Europe? Or maybe how hard would it be to pair up with a successful racing team? Because an applied desk job like that I wouldn't have much of a problem with. 

Also I was thinking of maybe doing the same thing with software or computer engineering if there are more opportunities in that field seeing as how that won't ever see a decline in jobs if everyone switches to hybrid/ electric cars or some other alternative fuel. 

I don't know I'm glad I decided to go to community college and save some money instead of thinking about changing majors at a 40k school or such. I want to transfer after another year at cc though and maybe go to Detroit where there would be internship opportunities but a good school here in California (to avoid out of state costs) would also be ok if there are good internship opportunities. What would a mechanical/automotive engineer recommend? I am going to talk to my counselor soon and see what they have to say but they don't know experience in the field like some of you guys do. 

I'm sure even though this is long I'm missing a lot of information so feel free to ask me. I just want to see how many engineers actually found an interesting job that they love going to everyday.

51,How to prevent playground sand from compacting?,1372963029,"I am the maintenance guy (read:owner) of 6 childcare centers in Colorado and I am looking for a more permanent solution to the problem I have with the sand in our playgrounds compacting and becoming semi-hard (less impact absorbing).  I am thinking that part of this is caused simply by use, as the kids run and play on it the particles self-sort and fill the spaces between particles more closely and therefore allow less movement of the bulk.  I also suspect that dust/dirt/debris of fine grain enhances filling in the inter-particle spaces and adds to the problem.  

My current solution is to run a hydraulic rototiller through the sand to ""fluff it"" but this is difficult, expensive and does not last but a short period of time before it is compacted and hard again.  

So I am seeking insight.  I was thinking about conducting an experiment in a section of one of the playgrounds where we try possible solutions.  the main one i have come up with so far is watering the sand to attempt to wash out the finer grained particles.  I would run a sprinkler maybe twice a week for 15 or so minutes and see of this has any affect.  I was also thinking of pressure washing a 10'x10' section and see if this did anything as well.

Last year I removed all of the sand in one of the playgrounds and replaced with p-gravel.  This helps considerably but it still compact a fair amount and is no where near as nice for the kids to play and build on.  

I was thinking that this forum might have a solution that I am not aware of.  Maybe a chemical that can be sprayed on the sand to lessen friction?  Or the addition to the sand of another material that would lessen the compaction ability (I was thinking the little rubber micro-beads they use in artificial turf).

This one both changed the shape of plugs, but also converted the voltage from 230VAC to 120VAC. 

I'm currently in Reading, and I cannot find ANYWHERE that sells an adaptor that will also convert the voltage. I'm obviously hesitant to get an adaptor that just changes the shape of the plugs without bringing the voltage down.

But, in looking at the two appliances I NEED to be able to use, I'm wondering if I couldn't get away with it. My Macbook's power cord says 
* Input AC 1.5A 100-240V 50/60Hz A/12378EA

74,"Structural engineers, there are cracks in my home's slab foundation which I plan to get professionally inspected ASAP. How bad is it?",1372743035,"I bought my first and current home several months ago and was rather happy with it at first. However, I've been growing increasingly concerned that there are serious issues with the foundation which went unnoticed by my untrained eye and were also not noted by the general home inspector I hired prior to closing. I've already started looking for a locally well-reputed structural engineer to take a look, and I figured I might as well ask here to get an idea of how bad it is and what I can expect.

Not long ago, I was cutting out some drywall and a strip of the baseboards in my laundry room to install a DryerBox when I discovered a [crack under the bottom plate of the wall](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#0). It looks to be about 1/4"" to 3/8"" wide. I decided to investigate to the extent that I could. This is an interior wall, and I was able to follow the crack along the floor on both sides of the wall. After tracking it beneath approximately 12 linear feet of linoleum in the kitchen, I noted that this [crack is visible on the exterior foundation wall](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#1) on the north side, despite whatever type of material has been slathered on top of it. It's probably not coincidental that the north side of the house has [drainage problems](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#2). I also found a [tree stump](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#3) at the northeast corner of the slab which was mostly concealed by stairs, grass, and the gutter pipe.

Moving to the east side of the house, the utility room, which shares a wall with the kitchen and is only accessible from outside, has a [hairline crack near the entrance](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#4). A couple feet away, there's a crack which can be seen [below the deck](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#5) and [above it](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#6). This is near a corner of the kitchen where there is noticeable unevenness in the linoleum floor.

Continuing to the southeast corner of the house, there are several more hairline cracks in whatever substance was used to cover the concrete, seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#7), [here](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#8), and [here](http://imgur.com/a/JXWMn#9). I wouldn't be concerned about these from their appearance if it weren't for the fact that unevenness in the floor at this corner of the house can be felt through the carpet.

After first noticing the crack and then taking a closer look around, many other small problems now make sense: a window in the kitchen near the largest crack is missing a pane and does not open, the utility room door has trouble closing, there are a few interior cracks in the drywall, and the north side of the house doesn't drain properly which is likely a contributing cause.

77,Need advice from some mechanical engineers for something I'd like to build (hire someone to build).,1372732173,"First of all, thanks for looking this over!  
  
I own and operate a performance entertainment company and I'm interested in building something for a performance we're putting on in September.  
  
In this [video - at 9seconds (warning, loud video!)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO2vp9X1PPc) there is a drummer who is being flipped upside down while playing the drums. He is using a rotating drum rack similar to this rack [here](http://www.2coolpercussion.com/product-rotating-drum-carrier.html) (there's a better video on that page).  
  
I'm interested in hiring a mechanical engineer (or student if it's a simple enough fabrication) to help me build three of these things, with the added element that a bike pedal mechanism would be what is used to rotate the drummer, maybe from about a distance of ~10 feet. Basically, I want someone to use a bike to rotate the drummer upside down and keep him there while he does a crazy solo thing. 
  
I have a few questions, however:  
1) Is this a particularly hard build? Meaning, do I have to hire an engineer with tons of experience to get this done? I have a limited budget and I was hoping it would be simple enough for a college student to be able to accomplish.   
2) A similar rotating drum rack is on sale for $1300. Do you feel like hiring someone to build three (3) of these racks would be worth it for me considering I'd like the bike mechanism to turn the performer upside down? Or would it cost way too much (parts + labor) to justify the custom build?  
3) Is a mechanical engineer even what I'm looking for?! Or should I be trying to reach out to some other mechanics/metalworkers/whatever?

I'm not very educated in engineering yet -- most of what I know right now is in math, physics, and computer science -- but I've been really curious about gears for a while. I know there is software that will provide gear profile templates, but I haven't been able to easily find descriptions of the mathematics for particular profiles. For example, I've read enough times that involute gear teeth are based on the involute of a circle, and how that results in a constant but moving point of contact between the gear teeth, but I haven't been able to find equations that justify that. What I'd ultimately like to be able to do is derive formulas that would describe all the dimentions of a gear given, say, a radius and number of teeth, or similar dimensions.

Anyway, I am about to finish my last semester of my freshman year in college. Right now, I am pursuing a major in Physics. I originally thought about aerospace engineering and astrophysics, but I am not too sure now. I still love space and astronomy, but the job market has me a little worried.

A little background info: I live in Orlando, Fla. I've always been interested in the physics of roller coasters and thrill rides. If I go into mechanical engineering, I'm in prime territory for the industry, I would say.

My questions:

* What got you into the thrill ride engineering industry
* What education track did you follow? Was it more the credentials or who you knew that got you hired?
* Any regrets?
* Best part about the job?
* Any general advice?

90,CompE Looking for advice on non-developer jobs,1372684080,"I'm a mid-career CompE looking for some advice from other experienced engineers.

I'll try and make this as concise as possible.

Me: Mid level career Comp Engineering grad. Did great in school even though i found the pure science foundation classes more interesting than my upper level Computer Science and digital design work. I've been fortunate to have experience in a number of roles, covering software and hardware design.

To be frank - I suck as a developer. I work slow, and have always known that about myself. Most every assignment I have been given has been completed late or/and over budget. I realize this is pretty much makes me a shitty employee and I'm surprised I get even average raises every year. I do pretty good work, but my slow pace kills my reputation. I also have problems staying focused for 8 hours a day, so my production suffers from that as well. The idea of staying on task at my desk all day seems impossible.

That said, I still feel I am intelligent and could excel at something out there. Maybe I need to give up on being a developer - but what's out there? Unfortunately, I am also painfully shy and socially awkward, so something like sales engineer probably wouldn't fly. I don't think I could give presentations and pitch companies for a living. I do enjoy talking with people and helping others, so I have thought about taking some kind of job involving field support.

Maybe I should get out of hard engineering all together? At this point I would surely take a pay cut, but that would be acceptable if eventually I could pay my dues and eventually earn a decent salary. I'd look at something in the IT field if the pay scale at the bottom looked better.

I would appreciate any advice from others here. Especially those who have made the transition from developer to another career.

http://i.imgur.com/I8gwokv.png

The holders(small cylinders) for the tissue clamps must be adjustable for different length tissues, as well as being able to vertically move to allow for measurements at different heights. I had thought to do this by lifting the lower cylinder as well as(both simultaneously or separately) the upper arm.

 My intention for the 180 degree rotational movement of the laser for measurements is to have the laser and it's oppositely aligned receiver rotate about on the circular base around the holders.

21,I'm planning the build of a studio and I'd like to have a descending/ascending ceiling. Can /r/askengineers help?,1372417463,"So I'm buildling a recording studio and in the planning stages of laying it all out. I'd like to incorporate an ascending/descending ceiling over the Live Room for versatility. I've never seen it done in a studio, though, so I don't have an idea about what it might take.

Here's the layout of the studio:

http://pl.an/zaygeu

The Live Room is about 15' x 21' and I'll have enough room for the vertically movable ceiling to be about 14'x14'. 

I imagine that it'll come down on a cable and that I can balance that center cable to the four corners of the movable ceiling. I'm not sure if that's the most safe, most balanced way to bring it up and down.

I'm also not sure what kind of motor I would use to do it.

How could I know how much the movable ceiling will weigh? And how can I know if the ceiling above it can handle the weight. I imagine it'll have elements like these studio ceilings:

And now for the ridiculous part...

I need the ceiling to be able to descend to the floor into a safe, fixed position and be usable as a dance floor without damaging the sound-diffusing stuff underneath. The dance floor will light up from underneath with either glass bricks or some other material.

31,A question for traffic engineers,1372357240,"Los Angeles is known for its horrendous traffic.  One of my biggest concerns out here after having just moved to LA is that very few intersections have protected left turn signals.  This leads to only 1-3 cars getting to turn left each cycle, and only after they force their way through when the light turns red and the opposing traffic finally stops.  Frequently this causes a back up in the turn lane that spills back into one of the lanes of traffic.  Which can create a bottleneck.   

I've been meaning to ask this on Reddit for awhile, when it [shows up on Reddit today in /r/LosAngeles](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1h6ipu/why_are_there_so_few_left_turn_lights_in_la/).  The top answer [sites a source (PDF page 52, article page 42)](http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/esg/esg.pdf) claiming that it is appropriate not to have the protected turn signal because it is better to reduce the over all amount of phases the light needs to cycle through.  Then it has a flow chart describing the times it is and is not good to have the protected turn signal.  (One that I'm having trouble following it at the very end)

40,"Hydraulic Contamination, Testing Heat Exchangers, and more.",1372293605,"Evenin',

I am a grad student working in a laboratory which does dynamic engine testing using a hydrostatic dynamometer. Currently, we have a contamination problem. 

Our hydraulic fluid is milky. I don't have any pictures, but the closest comparison I could find was [this](http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r262/jimbote/jagblingandliquidsynchros001.jpg). More specific pictures may become available if necessary or requested.

Our system holds around 200 gallons. We have yet to send a sample to a lab for accurate testing, but we are way over 50ppm, or even 300ppm. We think we might even have as high as 1%.

We're working on determining where the leak is coming from right now. Any guesses on where so much water (Or other contaminate) could come from now would be great.

We have 3 guesses right now on where it could be coming from. 

1. Water-Oil Heat Exchangers (HX) 

2. Condensation

3. Human stupidity.

**HXes**
---
We're currently in the process of investigating the HXs. There are two currently connected ones. The largest one is connected to the main reservoir. A second one is connected to a pump/motor which functions as a dynamometer.

In '11, the reservoir HX failed, and was quickly replaced. I cannot find any documentation yet to see if they did extensive testing on the pump/motor HX to determine if it was broken. 

Currently we're doing ""testing"" on the pump/motor HX, mostly by filling each stage with clear or colored distilled water, and seeing if the other stage comes out as clear or colored. Results have been inconclusive, but these are extremely rudimentary. 

Any advice on testing and reasons the HX failed would be appreciated. We believe one reason would be thermal shock. We are dumb enough to run the hydraulic fluid way up, and then reluctantly turn the coolant on.

**Condensation**
---
Condensation seems extremely unlikely. Quick HVAC calculations imply that if the entire reservoir was filled with 100% saturated air at 75°F, then dropped to 45°F (Approximate cooling temp), we would only have .08 pounds of water to account for. Even if the entire room was dropped from 50% to 30% relative humidity, we'd only end up with .8 pounds. 

We don't think Condensation is a possibility.

**Stupidity**
---
Human stupidity seems to be the one thing that would be a catch all, but is also something we can't test. 

My thoughts right now is that when the reservoir HX was replaced two years ago, the cleaning job wasn't nearly what they thought it was. I imagine leaving 3 gallons behind somewhere in a 200 gallon system would not be that hard. I do not currently know what the cleaning procedure was when that HX was replaced.

---
I'm mostly looking for experienced input on any of these things, especially the HX testing. Off the top of my head, pneumatic testing of the HX might be in order, and may be the easiest to do.

Some quick specs on the Pump/Motor HX: It's a U-type, shell and tube, rated to 250°F. Shell pressure (Hydraulic Oil) is rated to 500 PSI, tube pressure (Water) to 150. I don't have drawings or more advanced specs, yet. Working on getting that documentation.

59,I don't understand wind turbines?,1372201333,"So my understanding is that the blades rotate a small gear inside the turbine like [this](http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/images/technical/wind-turbine.jpg) which creates energy.    
-**Why are the blades so big?**  
I was thinking and it seemed like smaller blades rotated faster (so the base of the blade would turn the turbine head faster), and then I realized that it was probably an optical illusion (smaller blades spin faster than longer blades). Am I right?  
-**Why do turbines face against the wind instead of sideways?**   
Remember these [toys](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/grandpa/grandpa1209/grandpa120900015/15312482-color-windmill-toy-on-the-sky-background.jpg)? You would blow sideways to them, why not the same concept for wind mills?

In my kitchen, one breaker handles the garbage disposal and the outlet that the microwave is normally on.  When running the microwave, that circuit (microwave and disposal) suddenly lost power.  I go through the normal steps and check the breaker, the breaker's fine, I reset it anyway.  No go.  I get my multimeter and the breaker seems fine.  I take it off and reaffix the wire just in case.  No go.  I check the plugs themselves, and get 114 volts coming through.  I plug in the microwave and no go, but now the other plug is reading 0 volts.

This sounds to me like a loose wire between the breaker and the plug in the attic.  I've had rats chew through wires before, but it seems like if that had happened here, I wouldn't get the 114 volts.

Any thoughts?  I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit.  If you think I should post it somewhere else, just point me in the right direction.

Edit:  The breaker is good.  Replaced the outlet, it wasn't the outlet.  The microwave works in other outlets, so it's not the microwave.

62,Petroleum Field Engineers: Drilling Noises,1372175168,"A friend of mine, who lives near several active drilling sites, has mentioned sirens and booms coming from the rigs almost daily, in the evenings/early morning for months.  Many of them, he says, shake his home enough to crack drywall.

I used to be an MWD hand but I don't ever remember anything during the drilling stage that would cause this.  My first though was that the noise was from the perforation guns going off but I can't imagine that they would be this loud and shake the surface this badly from that far down.

He also mentioned that after the drilling activity in the area picked up there has been a smell and taste of sulfur in the local aquifer.

Does anyone have any thoughts?

**Update:** The area in question is south central Oklahoma.  When talking with my friend today he mentioned that years ago they had attempted to have a water well dug on their land.  The contractor, former oil field guy, hit a dense formation (possibly salt) about 200 feet below the surface that destroyed his bit.  The contractor said that the only way through this formation was blasting and it would take a special permit for that.  They opted not to.  

The new drilling is for a natural gas deposit found in the area.  My opinion is that they are blasting through the (salt?) formation before continuing to drill the well.

64,Problems with a poorly-formed expansion joint,1372168313,"Hi guys,

I'm currently working as an intern on a bridge project through my state's DOT.  We're having a problem with the slope of the sidewalk around an elastomeric expansion joint.  When the carpenters formed the sidewalk, one side of the metal joint was not installed at the correct angle.  To keep the joint level, the other side was installed at the same grade.  Unfortunately, the slope of the joint didn't match up with the slope of the already-formed sidewalk on the other side and the problem became apparent during the pour.  To prevent a lip due to the slopes, the concrete was smoothed out between the two levels.

Now there's an unsightly bulge and the engineers in the district office aren't happy at all.  They're saying we have to redo it, but that would require the removal of both sides of the expansion joint, several cubic yards of concrete, and the pedestrian railings.

76,Efficiency of running a boiler 24 hours vs 12 hours?,1372053381,"Nobody seems to be able to give me a clear answer on this, so I thought I'd try here. This question pertains to swimming pool heaters.

If a heater is put on a timer so that it only operates from, say, 6:00am to 6:00pm, rather than 24 hours a day, are they saving on gas, using more, or no real difference?

This is with a 150,000 BTUh heater on a pool of about 85,000L kept at a temperature of 28C. The air temperature can anywhere from 20C to 35C depending on the time of year. I realize this will vastly affect the pool's heat loss, so let's use a flat number of 28C. I do not have a figure for how cold the pool gets if the heater is off overnight, although I am assuming it loses quite a bit of heat - during recent overnight rain storms where the temperature was around 20C, I came in at 11:00am and the temperature of the pool was only 26.5C (after the heater had been running 5 hours!). Bonus fact: The heater operates in Fahrenheit; it is set for 82F. The heater will turn on when it sees 81F for more than a minute, and shut off when it sees 83F. So for it to only be at 79F after 5 hours is pretty significant.

My own assumption is that running the heater for relatively short bursts is cheaper, fuel-wise, than letting the pool cool off for 12 hours and then heating it back up. However, someone else in the past thought different and installed a timer to control the heater's run time 'to save on natural gas'.

So...help?

A converging section of the nozzle is required to accelerate the flow up to Mach 1, but the nozzle must begin diverging at the throat, otherwise the flow cannot accelerate further. If you build a rocket engine that has a straight pipe nozzle, the pressure of the combustion drives the exhaust gasses down the pipe like normal, and there is no obstruction in front of the flow (it's a straight shot out the end of the pipe), yet the flow stalls itself out at Mach 1.

In both these cases, $5 bills seem to have the most issues with automatic validators. 

I had a few times where customers would come to me and tell me that our machines weren't taking their $5 bills. I would try myself on all 4 different validators we have and have no luck getting it to accept. 

And when I would take the bills to deposit via ATM, $5 are by far the common ones to get rejected. Sometimes the machine will require multiple attempts before finally accepting the bill or not accept the bill at all. Generally, bills of other denominations that are in equal or poorer apparent condition have no issues. The only other bills that have been completely rejected were $1 bills that were extremely faded but still much less frequently even though we process more $1 than $5 bills in total.

This is something that I've experienced consistently enough for me to notice this pattern so I figured there must be something about the $5 bill's design or maybe circulation factors that make it have issues with automatic validators but I don't have any idea or technical knowledge.

The shaft is limited so it will only rotate approx ~270 deg.

The main concept is to be able to control how much resistance is placed on the shaft as another mechanism attempts to rotate it (a brake in a sense.)  However this ""brake"" must also be able to rotate the shaft back to its original position if the exterior force is to low.  IE a friction clamping thing wont do the job.

So far the only two things I have been able to think of would be either a servo motor on some sort of belt/chain drive or a stepper on a belt/chain drive.

34,Advices for my self-study plans/career,1371618439,"Hello all, I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student. Just this summer I realized I am more interested in Information Technology, so I will be re-rolling into IT when my school starts.
The biggest reason is I like to work with computers more than working with machines. Even so I think I want to work with both software and hardware aspects of computers.
I know that IT path is not nearly all about coding and programming but it is necessary.

I'm planning to change my life and study real hard for my IT career (because I already ""wasted"" 3 years in ME, I should start 1.5-2 years ahead since the courses in beginning are almost the same).
I'm currently on my summer ""vacation"" right now, I'm working as a qualification inspector in a power management company.

Right now I want to construct a ""self-study plan"" for myself during this 2.5 months left of my summer vacation. 
I'm asking for advices of what kind of programs, softwares, skills, preparations should I self-study for this summer.

I did some research and I'm going to just list the topics/things Im interested in. Note that these are just interests, I might not even know the real meaning of the topics I listed here:

Programming:

- c, C++ (Took 1 course at ME program, was interesting but didn't quite grasped it very well) - Planning to learn for sure
- Python - I was thinking of re-starting my whole coding/programming learning process with Python (good idea?)
- Later considering picking up JAVA and some other useful languages to learn (suggestions?)
- LabVIEW

3D Modeling:

- CAD/CAM/CAE (While at ME, I took some courses on CAD but I'm still quite not good with complex models, would like to retain my skills at programs like Solidworks, AutoCAD even though might not work with them that much as IT).
- Any other good Modeling programs for IT to learn?

Web Programming:

- SQL/MySQL
- Python, Java, ASP, .Net
- Ultimately I want to learn PHP the most

Web Design:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript (HTML5, Notepad++, Dreamweaver)
 
Microcontrollers:

- Arduino
- Robotics

Microsoft/Linux- environment in general.

Database:

- Oracle, MySQL (Right now the company I'm working in is using Oracle, I know how to use some functions of it, obviously don't know all of it)
- SAP (Heard it's largely used by large companies, would like to know more about it).

The thing I'm most interested in is Cloud Computing in general (I don't know how can you learn it though).

Also I want to study data storing and network security/data security.


Sorry for the long post, I really need advices to start my career, please give your opinions (biased or not, just please add some explanations) on which program do you think is good to learn.
My goal is to work in Asia (Japan, China, South East Asia, South Korea, in that particular order).
At this moment I have very little insight of the jobs I can do after learning some skills, so please guide me on what type of jobs are available for IT student please.



**NOTE that even though I listed all these programs/skills I'm interested in, it doesn't mean I think I will learn then all or I will learn them in one summer. 
That's why I'm asking for recommendations and opinions, I plan to focus on some of it and I'd like advices on which to start and which are ""must learn"" in your opinion, while picking up new things to learn constantly.
I bet even if I learn them for the rest of my life, I won't be perfect of any of them, but that's not my goal anyway. My goal is to be able to use them in work life effectively.

You can also recommend me something new that you find helpful/must learn in work life.

Any way to do this -without- spinning a board?  I really just need a 13.8V constant-voltage, 2.5A constant-current supply with backfeed protection... not too exotic, and something I'd hope I could just find.

Both of my fallback plans-- spin a cheap PCB with a DC-DC converter and power it from a 24V wall wart... or just run a 12V wall wart off a small UPS... feel pretty lame.",AskEngineers,ic33,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1glct5/float_battery_charger_without_designing_a_board/

49,I'm designing part of a circuit for a vending machine. Shall I use a ROM or a microprocessor?,1371564676,"So i'm designing the part of a vending machine that counts credit. The circuit will have these inputs:
10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2, Ca Cb Cc 
The money signals are from the coin acceptor. Ca is a signal saying 'Return all credit', Cb is a signal saying 'Return (credit-£2)' and Cc a signal saying 'Return (credit-£4)'.

The purpose of the circuit is to tell the customer his credit (between 10p and £4). It also sends a signal to the state machine saying 'Credit&lt;£2' 'Credit=£2' '£2&lt;Credit&lt;£4' 'Credit&gt;£4'. Lastly it should be able to subtract either £2 or £4 from the current credit and send the answer to the coin dispenser.

My question is what type of circuit would you recommend to implement this? I was thinking of using a ROM and flip flops (i.e. a state machine). But as there are 40 possible states for credit (10p-£4) and it needs to do two arithmetic operations, a look up table would therefore take a long time to program because of all the possibilities. 

Do you guys have any other ways you would recommend implementing this?

61,Thermal expansion of threaded connections.,1371490404,"I am a young engineer, but I have encountered two situations at two separate companies now where expansion of threaded connections have come up when a bolt fails.  Inevitably someone comes up with the solution, ""Well let's just go with a higher strength bolt, then it won't fail,"" without delving into the actual failure mode.  It works for a while until they have another failure, then they increase the strength again until (like at my first company) they end up with a case-hardened M4 Steel bolt.

[This image](http://i.imgur.com/SBwMN1k.jpg) shows roughly what is happening.  We are threading into an aluminum block with a steel bolt, clamping a steel plate onto the aluminum block.  The threads are completely engaged into the aluminum block, but not threaded into the steel plate.  Their argument is that the aluminum is expanding and putting pressure onto the bolt head - enough to break it off.  That, or it is expanding/contracting enough to loosen the bolt.  This part is in room temperature environment, so we are not cycling between any extreme temperatures.  

I believe other things are at play, because the only expansion that would affect pressure on the bolt head is the steel plate (the member we are clamping) since the steel is threaded into the aluminum.   Since the bolt and plate are both steel, they should expand at the same rate.  The threaded connection would take on any stresses caused by thermal expansion/contraction - correct?  I cannot find any information online about the stresses WITHIN threaded connections due to thermal expansion - only stresses for clamped members.  Do you know of any references that detail this issue?

As for the bolt failures, I'm leaning more toward manufacturing defect, hydrogen embrittlement, possibly something else... but definitely not thermal expansion.  What are your thoughts?",AskEngineers,killboy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1gizne/thermal_expansion_of_threaded_connections/

88,"Broke the retaining clamp that keeps a flex ribbon in place, possible fix by using hot glue?",1371235145,"So I got a really cheap deal for a backwards compatible launch PS3 on craigslist, but it turns out that the owner thought too highly of himself and attempted repairs of his own before dumping it on me.

One of the flex cables linking the on/off button board to the motherboard was broken, which explains why I couldn't get it to turn on and the clamp that held the flex ribbon coming from the bluray drive was broken too, which means that the PS3 was hardly functional. (Cannot update firmware without a working BD)

So anyways, replacing the whole part where the cable clamps on to is outside of my area of expertise as I suck at soldering, and it's impossible to find that specific part anyway. I was wondering if it would be a good idea to fix the ribbon securely and encase it with hot glue. I tried macguyvering by attaching a piece of cardboard on top and taping it up, but nothing seems to hold it in place properly. I did some reading around and if the PS3 finds some md5 mismatches due to wonky connections, it will refuse to read discs.

Also, is it easy to remove the hot glue? I know that isopropyl alcohol works, but I'm not sure if its okay to use on circuit boards.

I have two volumes of gas (assume both 100% helium) that are separated by a thin barrier. The barrier has several small holes in it such that the two volumes are not actually fully separated. So, in a steady-state condition, pressure on both sides of the barrier are equal (atmospheric). However, if I were to suddenly flow in 5 L/min of Helium into one of the volumes, I would expect some back pressure to develop on the barrier before both volumes equalized. This is due to the fact that the holes are very small with respect to the size of the two volumes. I'd like to calculate the pressure delta across the barrier and ensure that the force isn't large enough to break the barrier.

7,Most spectacular way a hydraulic outrigger can fail?,1371117738,"At my work, we use trailers with what I assume are hydraulically actuated outriggers, meant to manually level the trailer and its load on uneven terrain. M860A1 trailers, if anyone is curious. These outriggers have been reliable through years of use, but I recently came across a problem where one of them wouldn't hold a load past a certain point -- it could be moved to past that point, but once we let go of the controls, it would involuntarily retract until it could support the load again. Hope this makes sense, I'm trying my best to describe it with my non-engineering brain.

Anyway, we referred this issue to maintainers, but it got me thinking. What is the worst case scenario for the failure of a hydraulic outrigger? Let's go big.. like massive mobile cranes with outriggers that have to lift not only the crane itself, but whatever load it's lifting. That's the largest example of an outrigger (or for that matter a hydraulic device) I can think of, but there may be larger ones. 

Is the fluid constantly under pressure? Is there more pressure the more weight it supports? If the cylinder or reservoir springs a leak under load, will it explode, retract, or simply be stuck in one position unable to move? This has me interested in hydraulics.

This is a scientific application so would require something that doesn't introduce noise, so maybe an expensive one with a good rectifier in it?

Do I than just connect the ground wire from the supply to the ground of the controller, and the +24V to the encoder?

If it matters the Controller is a NI-7334 (PXI card), power comes from a NI MID-7604. Stepper motor is from Nanotec, ST4118M1404, with a NOE2-24K06 encoder.

The conical gear being like a bevel gear, but longer to form a full cone.

It would change the gear ratio by pushing and pulling on the conical gear using the hydraulic piston. This way there wouldn't need to be a clutch to change gears, since it would smoothly slide into the next gear ratio, plus you could use whatever ratio you want, rather than a specific number of presets. It's also much simpler and would therefore probably be more reliable/efficient, as far as I understand.

There would be the problem of the driveshaft moving up and down, but this seems to me like an easy mechanical problem to fix.

36,"Why do we have limited color spaces and then engineer our displays to try and match those spaces, to the point where being able to display more colors is regarded as a bad thing, instead of targeting as our color space the full range of all visible colors?",1370948295,"I'm looking into color spaces for the first time and trying to wrap my head around the concepts. I'm presenting everything with simplifications, as I'm just trying to understand the big picture concept at the moment.

So in [this diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Cie_Chart_with_sRGB_gamut_by_spigget.png), the big object is all visible colors, and the small triangle inside of it is the sRGB standard by which virtually all digital images are apparently defined. Under sRGB, for each point in an image, you have three values, indicating how strong the red, green, and blue are at that point.

From what I've been reading, for accurate display of colors, monitors and other displays are designed to match the sRGB color space as closely as possible. For professional work, there are other color spaces as well, such as Adobe RGB that has a wider coverage of visible colors, or CMYK that matches up better with inks that create color by subtracting from white.

However, if you view an sRGB image, on an Adobe RGB monitor, then the colors will appear oversaturated (and if you do the opposite they will appear dull). This is because the color space of sRGB is a smaller triangle than that of Adobe RGB, and so if you take the same numbers and plug them into Adobe RGB, you end up proportionally farther out from the center.

As a result, it is considered bad for a monitor to have a wider gamut in the visible color space than the color space you'll be working with, so if you're a consumer, you don't want a monitor that can display more colors than sRGB, as you'll end up with oversaturated images.

This can be compensated for by using color management, which is built into modern desktop OS's, and converts colors (such as sRGB colors from images on the Interent) into the same color on your monitor, allowing viewing of normal images on monitors with wider gamuts such as Adobe RGB-calibrated monitors, but most monitors don't ship with the profiles data to do this, and since almost all images are encoded in sRGB anyway, there isn't much incentive for the average user to buy a monitor that can do more.

All this leaves me with a question I'm having difficulty locating an answer to, which is why do we use these limited color spaces?

Instead of a limited color space, why don't we simply use the large object in the diagram, all visible colors? It seems that simply storing the x, y values of where a color is on that chart would be sufficient (along with brightness, transparency, etc.), and could even be used to store information on colors outside of the average human's visible field. Then, a display device could simply clip values outside of its own maximum capabilities, and more colors capable of being displayed would always be a good thing. Furthermore, there would be a single, universal, and permanent color space that all devices could refer to.

Are they a holdover from an era when it was prohibitive to include a chip to convert these values into something a given monitor would be capable of displaying?

When new standards for color spaces are being defined, such as Adobe RGB, why didn't they simply encompass the entire visible color space, instead of creating yet another limited subset of the space?",AskEngineers,caliber,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1g43ir/why_do_we_have_limited_color_spaces_and_then/

It is a full anaerobic environment, Chilled, dual antechamber hardtop box and purification system.

The catalyst is in rabbit pellet type form and brow in color. The other half is of carbon or copper pellets? Copper I'm sure but black in color.

Palladium is a typical catalyst AFIK. The problem I face is the  moisture gets up to around 250ppm when I come in the morning and can range from that up to about 500ppm in the afternoon. Through minimal usage.

I have once purged the Entire box, Hooked onto the mix gas and preformed a regeneration cycle on the purification column. Everything was great after that but only for a few days until the moisture started to creep back up.

There is no leak in the chamber as it manages to maintain a stable box pressure while not in use without any gas being used.

Have tested mA of sensors out side of chamber and they are good. Starting to run out of ideas. Box chiller is fine. Condensation? I dont understand how it gets there from a N2 filled box? Possibly a bad catalyst?

38,How much diesel fuel would one estimate it takes to power electricity to 10 houses in a country setting?,1370944950,"Just a hypothetical / idea oriented question.  I was wondering if it would be feasible to run a number of crate diesel engines, or even custom built engines, with the purpose of running sizable generator / alternators to power a block of ten homes.  Would it be cost effective for the homeowners to split the costs of buying fuel and maintaining the mini-power station?  The engines being mounted at the edge of indoor buildings, exhaust going straight outside the wall, and maybe an advanced cooling system to take advantage of not having the limited space in a car's engine compartment.  Also massive fuel tanks would be necessary, possible safety hazards or regulations would apply to quantity of fuel allowed to be stored safely. At the right RPMs, a diesel should make good torque at a mellow gas ""mileage"" RPM.  I would think these would be able to turn powerful generators, especially if running on a prototype 42volt system to ac conversion.  Not talking about running off the engine alternator either :) but rather having the transmission turn huge ones. (in case that needed clarification *shrug*)

Let's start by assuming the presence of an underground river or other major subterranean water source nearby, since they're fairly common, and otherwise it seems unlikely that sufficient water would be present to sustain a community.

**Light**

The first major issue that jumps out at me is light. In order to sustain lighting, which would be necessary in almost all waking hours, it seems like some method of electricity generation would be necessary.

The most plausible electricity sources seem like underground rivers and geothermal activity. If we already have an underground river,  harnessing it for power seems like a sensible step.

**Food**

The next major issue I think would be food. Judging from existing troglodytic creatures, the ability to forage for food is very, very limited and only able to support the most meager existence. That doesn't strike me as enough to support even a single human, let alone a whole community.

However, if there is already a power source capable of generating light, that seems like it could be used to serve as the basis for farming of some type. Things I immediately wonder are if that could be done at a sufficient efficiency to support a community, whether it would contain sufficient nutrients for survival, and what the plants or fungi or whatever is being farmed would require in terms of a substrate on which to grow.

If the underground river is bringing in fish and other food sources from the outside, that seems like a great way to get a ton of nutrition, though might be considered cheating a bit on the problem.

**Air**

It seems like caves, even very deep ones, never run into the problem of air failing to circulate sufficiently for people to breathe, but is there a limit to this that would become significant?

**Other**

The power generation and lighting would require a fair bit of technology to work. Once the community has been surviving for a few years, would it be plausible for them to develop enough manufacturing capability to generate replacement parts for wear, and new items for expansion?

Everyone gets their own private cubicle, and if you're higher up, your own private office, which most of the time just a larger cubicle.

Would it be at all feasible to melt rock and drip it upon rock beneath it, creating a 3d printer of sorts of igneous rock, in an effort to make large and stable granitic structures, and essentially a single piece of rock?

I'm thinking about the use of large parabolic mirrors to focus sunlight onto small pieces of granite in order to melt it down. My main wonders are:

-How large would the mirror have to be?

-What could possibly contain the gravel material until it reaches it's melting point, but also have the albedo and other properties necessary to transfer enough heat to its contents and retain the heat inside?

-If melted rock hitting unmelted rock after a drop would, in a practical sense, melt the unmelted rock and fuse properly, or if the temp. diifferential would always result in too much cracking, weakness, heterogeneity, etc, or even if any significant fusing would happen at all

-The structural soundness of the resulting building (probably not a great idea in earthquake zones, or if quick temp. changes occur, in which case it may crack?)

I'm a chemical engineer, handling the process design. I'm good with the piping, mechanics, P&amp;ID's etc. Here's what I need help with . . .

The project consists of 10 groundwater pumps over approximately 1,500 feet, that will pump water into a header. At the midpoint of the water well array, there will be two booster pumps operating in parallel to push the water up and over a hill.

What I need assistance on, is what equipment will be necessary to operate this system from a single control panel, with remote access. Each of the water pumps will have a dedicated VFD, as well as the booster pumps.

I was planning on using a PLC to control the VFDs for the booster pumps, which should ramp up/down based on the production from the wells. We also want to monitor depth of water and flowrate from the wells.

I'm assuming that 1,000 feet is a little long for standard wiring using a 4-20 mA signal, and we'd have to use fiber optics. What kind of equipment is needed for the transition from one to the other? Is this the preferred method for information transfer over this distance? Has anyone worked with wireless in this fashion?

I'm also assuming that we'd want a GUI in the field showing operating status of various pumps, but I'm also at a loss as to what equipment is needed for this, as well as the ability to remotely access and control the system. (I have previously worked with another system that used a cell card for access, but I was not involved in the design process).

I've only used PLCs for some simple tasks, and this project is a bit out of my comfort zone, so any information/advice anyone has for me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

Feel free to ask for any clarifications and I will do my best to answer them.

How much damage would it do if it did? Assuming the ship is as close to the naval vessel as is common before attempting to ram it and that it approaches at maximum speed while fully laden. 

EDIT: Consensus seems to be that there's no way a collision could occur outside of a very narrow shipping lane. For context, I was imagining a vessel hijacked by Somalian Pirates with a ransom unpayed for whatever reason (bankrupt company, old ship or whatever) that they decided to ram into a naval vessel as a sort of revenge attack. This is probably most likely in one of the narrower parts of the Suez Canal given its geographical proximity. With ships reaching almost 70 meters in width in a canal possibly only a little over 200m wide, simple outmaneuvering the Tanker/Container Ship becomes a much more difficult prospect.

Since we've established that a collision might be possible in a select few locations, how much damage would one do?

I need to build a test rig to measure rifle recoil to document variations between powder types and projectile weight.  I know that it could be determined mathematically, but there is a desire to have the rig for future projects as well.

My thought is to place the rear of the rifle's buffer tube [a flat surface roughly 1"" in diameter] flush against a solid plate in the jig.  The rifle will be suspended on rails of some sort, allowing free travel forwards and rearwards.  If I place a small impact force sensor in between the rear of the rifle and the fixed plate, I should be able to gather the appropriate data to illustrate relative changes between ammunition.

Recoil is not an instantaneous event, of course.  I'll need some form of high-speed force measurement to record the various recoil events that take place.  There will be the initial discharge lasting ~3ms, followed by mechanical recoil operations of the rifle lasting ~120ms.
