7,Environmental Science BS to Civil/Environmental Engineering BS or MEng and talking to advisor,1531670779,"I will try to keep this short and concise, and provide a little background. 

I graduated from a reputable state university with a degree in Environmental Management Systems, BS. For those of you unfamiliar with the degree: it's essentially an Environmental Science BS but I went through the college of agriculture and was able to study more agronomy, soil sciences, and soil chemistry which I enjoyed. Upon graduating I enlisted for four years in the Coast Guard, I just finished my enlistment and am working towards an engineering degree. 

I am leaving out my decisions and personal reasons for the career change, I don't want them to overshadow my requests for advice but I am happy to answer any questions. So a year ago, knowing I wanted to change careers to engineering I spoke with the undergraduate advisor at the university I planned on applying to. She was impressed with my degree and the school I attended, and suggested I take the engineering pre-requisites while I was in the military to apply for the MEng. I was at an operational unit, time to study was difficult to find as I was consistently recalled. 

Now [insert red tape regarding ""transfer students"" being directly accepted to the engineering program, and regarding the GI Bill approving courses]. I am taking pre-requisite courses at a local community college, and will be applying to the engineering BS this fall for the spring semester- thanks to admissions snipping a little red tape for me. 

So here is where I am in need of some advice. My undergraduate GPA from my previous bachelor's is around a 2.7. I had a rough first year, switched majors and continued to improve after that. I was asked to apply for graduate school under a professor I really admired, as well as a graduate program in agronomy at Auburn University (where I did not attend). I didn't apply to either, I was headed to the Coast Guard! Now that I am on track to the engineering BS, should I reach out to my advisor and let him know of my plans to apply to the graduate program with my low GPA, or wait, or just go ahead and complete the second BS. To clarify: I have to be in school full time to receive certain benefits, ensuring a steady income requires me to attend engineering school full time in the spring, with full time community college this upcoming fall, which is why I am not considering applying to the masters program right off the bat. 

I hope this is enough information to seek advice, I am certainly willing to offer any additional information if needed. Currently I have a 4.0, in my summer courses (calculus I, CAD drafting, and a macroeconomics course that I don't really need) at 10 credit hours and two part time jobs.

8,"Simple way to give more Voltage/Torque to a motor at start, but more Amp/Speed later?",1531667357,"Hey guys!


I just thought of an idea to replace my CVT transmission with some type of electronical logic thingie that would slowly lower Voltage and give higher Amps to the motor. This would especially benefit the indiction motor which has a free floating rotor in the mid that needs to spin up, so giving it more torque at start might make it just as strong as a synchronous (although I have no idea which of the 3 classic DC motor types are the best for what).



So, is there some trick where you put transistors or something, to slowly transmute the output voltage to the motor. Best if it reacts to speed or something. Maybe back mf can activate it or something. I have no idea.




i'm trying to make a basic thing here, so no lazers and stuff. Maybe I need to find a better design, but maybe you cna tell me of an electric piece that works like a switch. that would be nice. And also some type of trigger. If I had those 2, I could make anything , just like you cna make anything in computers with if-else.

10,Seeking Advice: Environmental Science BS to civil/environmental Bs or MEng and hiw to approach my advisor.,1531663951,"I will try to keep this short and concise, I am on mobile so I apologise for any formatting or grammar errors. 

I graduated in 2014 with a degree in Environmental Science from a reputable state university. I joined the military upon graduation and once my enlistment ended I began working towards my engineering degree (started in May, doing well in the courses). 

I spoke with an advisor a year ago in the environmental engineering department, she suggested I work on my orereqs while in the military and apply for the MEng when I am out. That would've been great, but I was completely operational for the past four years and school was next to impossible (I had to withdraw from calc I due to my schedule). Taking it again, have an A in the course while holding two jobs and 2 other classes for the summer. 

Here's where I think things get tricky. My original BS GPA is somewhere around a 2.7-2.8. I had a rough first year, switched to a more difficult major I enjoyed, GPA went up. I failed to mention my GPA to my potential advisor. 

I am currently using the GI Bill and taking my courses at a local community college before I apply (again) to the University of choice. This is a very tricky situation with the GI Bill and transfer admission, etc. I spent countless hours speaking with admissions and they threw me a bone to let me directly into the engineering program in the spring upon completion of two prerequisite courses with grade of B. I'm leaving out details because it's four months worth of red tape at the University and VA level made lose my hair. But if anyone is dealing with this feel free to PM me because I learned quite a bit throughout the process. 

Here's my ideal plan: start engineering school in the spring, kick ass in my courses, take the GRE and apply for graduate school. Here's my question: should I start speaking with advisors now regarding my plans? Should I wait until my GPA is a little better? Should I just stick with the second BS and strike the MEng?

Thanks for the help in advance, I thought I had this nailed down but I need help from the experts. Feel free point out anything I'm missing or misunderstanding.

I have three 48vDC fans I need to control. Their model is [MT48B3](http://www.comairrotron.com/content/maltese-mt48b3-19031841a). I ordered a [DC Motor Speed Controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NBMLQ3X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) from Amazon. My expectation was the voltage would be adjustable.  But after more reading I found out the controller was a PWM controller. My understanding is that PWM pulses the voltage to maintain the specified speed using at least 3 pins (power, ground, and PWM signaling with some having 4 pins for tach. But this one only had two pins?

So I then ordered [6-48V 30A Step-down Volt Adjustable Output Voltage Regulator Module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQ045LQ/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza) it looked like it was what I needed. Voltage adjustable. My setup is a 48vDC PSU on the input and a 12vDC PC fan for testing on the output. Using my multi-meter I set the dial until I got my 12vDC. The experts probably know what happens next. But I watched the fan spin for while noting sound, airflow, and temperature of the fan hub. Everything seemed fine. Then slowly I started smelling the magic smoke of ""YOUR DOING IT WRONG"" I unplugged the PSU and the fan hub had gotten really hot.

On the product details I see  ""Product PWM frequency: 15KHZ"" I can only shake my head as I can't believe I missed that detail. But I don't understand why my multi-meter was showing 12vDC. My multi-meter is a Fluke 179. I also hooked up the other controller with the same results.

Since the DC fans 12vDC and 48vDC lack the PWM signaling they will just pull the full voltage 48vDC with no speed control from PWM controllers, right? Which is what I think burned up the 12vDC fans.

If you stuck though all that thanks again. I guess my questions are, along with my guesses:

1. Does it look like that second speed controller is really PWM? (That product PWM freq 15khz sure looks it)
2. Will my results be different with the 48vDC fans. (If both controllers are PWM, no smoke but no control either)
3. If that second controller is PWM then why did my multimeter show 12vDC? function of PWM? (I have no idea)
4. If anything then what would I need to control these fans? For all purposes i'm looking for a 3A 48vDC voltageadjustable buck converter.",AskEngineers,False,JoshZK,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8yzg5p/controlling_48vdc_fans_whats_that_burning_smell/

Circuit 1: This design splits the signal early on, and places the Op Amps before the Sends. It also relies on a single Op Amp to boost the recombined signals pretty far downstream.

Circuit 2: This design sends dry signal through an Op Amp prior to any splitting, then uses one Op Amp per signal path after it's passed through the Send/Receive. This one also has a single Op Amp pretty far downstream for boosting the output signal.

My Questions:

I quite frankly don't understand the purpose of the charge pump (MAX1044) in Circuit 2. Is this just to better protect the Op Amps in the circuit? If my DC In is regulated, is this necessary?

Is the sole benefit of pushing the Op Amps downstream in the circuit (from before the Sends to after the Receives) to allow for phase reversal, or is there more to it than that?

I'm concerned about input impedance and its impact on Circuit 2. If the two sends are going to pedals that have different input impedances, wouldn't the signal be split unevenly? Is there any way to protect against that?

I'm thinking about Frankensteining these two circuit designs to come up with something that allows for On/Off of each signal path, Phase Reversal, and most importantly, accounts for input impedance. Does this seem possible?

I've been reading a book, and the guy said that these 3 are the most used. I literally didn't understand anything because the drawings are confusing and simplistic and look nothing like the actual motor, but rather like a clutch disc. Anyway, as far as I understood, the only difference between the induction and synchronous motor is that the induction one has a free floating metal thingie in the middle and it winds up on its own, and the synchronous has a permanat magnet on the rotor, so it goes to top and consistent speed immediately because the rotation of the magnetic field and the static magnetic field on the rotor lock into each other and spin at a constant speed. 



I first wanted to make your classic brushy DC motor with permanent magnets, but now that i've learned about those other 2, this one kinda seems like the most complicated one. Is a classic DC motor the best one? Even in my gardening machines, there is a DC motor. Does it have superior torque? Is it because allegedly DC motors can run on ac or dc? is it better to link the permanant magnet parallely or serially? And also, allegedly, only this motor has back EMF, which also begs the question why is it used more than the other ones? If I put the same amount of materials on the 3 types, which one will be the best? Which one will have most torque? Which one most speed? Which one most durability?




I wanna make a small motor for a toy car that I will crash later, and I want it to be cool. Which of the three types should I use? Which one could I make so ""weak"" that it resembles real life, but in a miniature, which I could ""upgrade"" a bit and make ""stronger"". Do I feed it, like, a watch battery, or do I put only like 2 windings on it? But I also don't want it to stall on start. I want it to have nice torque, to slide a bit, but no to much to fly away, and top speed should also not be too fast. But it should be ""efficient"", not limited by artificial inhibitors.

33,Best way to move heavy objects from the floor out of a freezer,1531568284,"At the place where I work, they store this heavy rolls of paper and they store them in a small freezer where temperatures are in the minus digits. These rolls are super heavy and very hard to lift them from the floor to carry them out so you need two persons, one from each side to lift them. And they are stacked on top of each other, 
sometimes you need a roll that is under 3 other rolls, so you have to move the top 2 to get to the 3rd one.
The rectangular boxes are around 24"" width, 24"" height and around 120"" length. So they are long and heavy and tedious to move every time they are needed and they are one moment away from causing an injury to a worker.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to improve the taking/storing of these rolls but I don't know what else to do. I thought about making a rack to lift the rolls from the ground so that the workers don't lift the rolls from the floor and easier to get a grip on them. 
I also though about putting a small conveyer belt but the size of the freezer is too small.

The freezer is the size of a small bedroom where the entrance only fits one person at a time. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks

Anyway, I wanted to ask why he twirled the wire in the middle of winding it? And would I need in my little project stuff like the three legged thingie or the resistor? That's probably one of those industrial batteries that goes in a drill battery or a computer, I dunno. I'd use a normal battery, and I would boost it just a little bit. Or do I need to boost the amperes and lower the vboltage to get more torque or speed to my dc motor? Also, the guy used christmas tabe for insulation. That is bad, right?

Others online seem to use a metal of glass container wrapped in a whole bunch of foam or glass fiber insulation.  Dewars seem to be frequently made of polyurethane foam.

How does that work?   Surely, the liquid nitrogen at −195C will cause oxygen and CO2 raising agent in the foam or between the glass fibers to condense, leading to soggy insulation which presumably isn't very insulative.

Worse, the temperature will cause atmospheric oxygen to condense to be a liquid, but not atmospheric nitrogen, which will cause a very oxygen-rich enviroment.  Soaking open cell polyurethane foam in pure liquid oxygen sounds like a recipe for making explosions to me...

This leaves me with precisely zero experience working as an engineer aside from unique classwork we do (see the footnote below).

I'm really concerned I'm going to end up as one of those people who can't find a job for an entire year or more after graduating.

I initially chose this degree as I wasn’t to sure what I enjoyed Most straight out of high school. I am starting to have doubts about the electrical side of my degree as I have not enjoyed the electrical courses. I have been doing well grade wise but I just can’t see myself enjoying a career in electrical engineering as much as mechatronics. I also discovered last semester that I enjoy mechanical engineering more than I thought initially.

I am thinking about either changing to either straight mechatronics or mechanical engineering. I am also considering the possibility of combining either of these degrees with business as a double degree. 

One of my main concerns with choosing mechatronics is job prospects as I rarely see jobs advertised, however I have spoke to a few employers that said they consider mechatronics engineers for mechanical roles. I would much prefer a more mechatronics orientated job but if I am just going to be put into a mechanical engineering role I’m thinking I would be better off switching to mechanical engineering.

Also I’m not sure if adding a business degree will be of much benefit career wise but it is something that I think I enjoy. 

Another option I am considering is keeping my current degree and if I and applying for mainly mechatronics related jobs and only using the electrical degree as a worst case scenario backup plan.

I’m honestly so stressed as I need to make a decision within the next couple of weeks so any advice on any of my points would be greatly appreciated.

However I need it to be able to maintain its shape very well and is a low thermal conductivity.

The material will be under mild temperature changes, usually ranging about 20C

If it matters at all, it will be in constant contact with Nylon and occasionally a mild scrap with copper. It will be only be exposed to air.


**What the metal needs**

1 - Stiff and maintains its shape

2 - Low thermal conductivity

3 - Cheap

4 - Able to hydraulic press into easy slightly curved shapes

5 - Able to withstand mild temperature deviation 


**What it will not be subjected to**

82,Career Advice: Am I not enjoying my job or do I not enjoy engineering?,1531432767,"Hello, I recently graduated in May 2018 with a B.S. in Physics and in Mathematics.  I'm currently working (for about 3 months) as a Laser Engineer in production in NY, but I'm not enjoying the job.  It isn't miserable or necessarily bad (though, I think the company I work for needs some serious improvements in management), but my main issue with the job is that I don't feel challenged or actively thinking.  I don't feel that I'm learning anything meaningful or useful or exciting.
 
Based on what I've been told from my coworkers, most of the work done by the engineers, at least in this specific company, involves (not necessarily in order of frequency):
(1) building (relative to other lasers in the company) more advanced lasers or lasers with specific features for customers
(2) traveling out of state or country to repair or assist customers with their lasers
(3) supervising technicians and helping them with troubleshooting
 
My biggest personal issue with the work is that everything I do each day feels utterly mundane.  Almost all of my time is spent screwing in screws or wobbling mirrors or lenses or some other optical equipment by hand.  Worse still, I'm blindly following a manual that fails to explain what anything does - I feel as if I'm not being properly trained.  In fact, I recently built a (very simple) laser without having been taught what anything actually does.  Almost everything I do know about lasers and what the optical equipment does is primarily due to my own independent studying and research outside of work.
 
 
To summarize my feelings about the company, here's a list of pros/cons.  There are a lot of criticisms I have with how the company is run, but I'll try to refrain from commenting on any non-personal issues I have with working there.
 
Pros:
Coworkers are all extremely friendly and eager to help when they have the free time.
Company isn't super strict with lateness, so there's no stress if I show up (as an example) 15 minutes late one day as long as I stay 15 minutes longer than usual.
Company is 25 minutes walking distance from where I live.
Based on what coworkers have told me, working out on field is tiring but it's fun to explore new places (though, I wouldn't expect to be sent anywhere until maybe after a year or so of working).
 
Cons:
Work feels incredibly mundane to me.
I make about 50k a year (before taxes).  I feel financially comfortable, but realize now that I would like to make more to pay off loans and have a bit more spending and saving money.
Advancement in the company is rare and promotions aren't great financially (though, I think this is the new norm in the job market)
There isn't a lot to do in the area I currently live in.
 
 
 
I know I've written a lot, so I'll summarize with a few important questions and notes about what I would like out of a career.  I would appreciate any opinions or advice.
 
About Me:
I like to think about problems and find solutions to them.  My interests are very wide, so I'll be content or happy with doing almost anything that involves problem-solving.
I have some research experience involving the development of a magnetic cloak (basically a material that blocks out external field without affecting the external field in a noticeable way) out of a superconductor and ferromagnet.  Some of the research involved tasks similar to what I do at work, but it also involved data analysis through Python, building new things to make measurements, discussions with group members about ideas and progress, etc.  If there are any careers that might involve doing things like that, I would absolutely love it.
I have programming experience in Python, C++, ROOT, and FORTRAN (the latter two are almost exclusively used by physicists).  I don't feel comfortable with my experience that I would be even remotely as good as a recent Computer Science graduate, but I'm comfortable enough where I've been able to code for classes, research, and small projects.  If a job incorporated data analysis or otherwise involved writing code, I would enjoy it.
I hate doing nothing or performing repetitive tasks.
If I pursue a new job, it will likely be in NYC, where I can commute from my family's home.
 
 
Questions:
Do most entry-level engineering jobs typically having the same 'spirit of work' I currently do?  Have I simply not been working long enough to really delve into the more interesting aspects of the job?  Or should I pursue a career elsewhere?
 
I wouldn't mind returning to school for a Master's or a PhD, but are there any subjects of study for engineering that would be worthwhile financially while also preparatory for a mentally simulating career?
 
In the future, if I pursue another engineering job, what kind of questions can I ask the company to efficiently gauge whether I'll fit well with the company?

8,"Been at new engineering job a month, don't like it, dream company is now hiring more than ever",1531392790,"Hi there,

I graduated this past May with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering. I began work a month ago at a decently sized oil/gas industry company but in a small satellite office on the East Coast, doing design package work. Basically just sizing equipment, writing up a report, sending it to the client, lather, rinse, repeat. At the time, I accepted this job as it *was* a job and I needed money. After this last month, it's only been confirmed that I do not wish to do this forever, already discussing with a mentor from college that I will most likely leave in a year to jump to the materials/defense industry (my original plan post college, but unfortunately did not work out by graduation). This company I'm at now just has no prospects that allow me to do my passion, through promotions or what not (I would have to relocate to Texas to do something where I'm *not* creating these packages for the next 30 years if I wanted to stay).

However, now my issue is Raytheon is hiring more than they ever have (confirmed by someone I know who has worked there 20+ years). This was my dream company, I had applied, did have an interview but as it was reaching 7-8 weeks with them still not making a decision, I took this job I am currently at. However in June they started this initiative to hire something like 1,500 new engineers. When I looked online, I found positions that are exactly what I'm looking for: research, design and development for materials, equipment, mechanical processes, you name it.

At the company I'm currently at, the pay is ""above average"" but I'm spending 5k of it per year commuting on public transportation to the city everyday (so I would end up making about the same at Raytheon in the end, a bit longer commute driving though - from my current apartment I can't leave until next May, it's an hour to hour fifteen commute here, would be an hour or so drive at Raytheon), it has a 9/80 schedule (so does Raytheon), benefits are alright (boyfriend works at Raytheon and they're pretty much the same) and both companies are open with the hours worked, however at the one I'm at now, I get here for 6:15 AM so I can have a life outside of the work/commute, cause 9 hours of doing what you're not interested in is really draining.

Now I'm just really at a loss of what to do. I really really want to apply as Raytheon is where I wanted to work and the work is what I want to do. I'm nervous that if I don't apply now, in a year when I'm looking at leaving this place, there will be no open positions (or rather, much less) because of this hiring spree they went on. Do I just apply, see what happens and if they're interested and want to hire me, quit this job after a couple of months of being here? That just sounds bad to me, but I do intend on leaving here in a year time anyway (I have set up insurance, 401k, what not, here already as well).

But that's too advanced for me because oyu need sensors, right?). How do I know how many loop de loops I should put on the rotor? A classic toy electromotor has 3 loop de loops. Some have 4, some 5, some big ones have like 20.





How do I determine: ""Aha! I want a motor powered by this much voltage, and to get the most out of it while not sacrificing durability, I gotta make 4 loop dee loops on the rotor with 20 loops of 0,5 mm wire each, mounted on 5 1mm metal plates in an x shape, and for the 2 electrical magnets I need 30 loops of 1mm copper wire around 20 0,5mm metal plates each, and that will net me this kind of torque, this kind of top speed, and this amount of durability for that amount of time.




How do I do that? Knowing why I chose specific dimensions of each part?

Seems so smart to try and recapture AC if it is over-generated and store it as gravitational potential energy, to release it back down the pipe and turn the same turbines when it's needed as electricity. 


Would it make sense to scale this down to factory or home scale by use of a large weight suspended by a pulley system with an AC motor/ generator at the end? Extra AC energy created by major power plants could be stored by factories as the weight moving up. In order to reduce the loads handled by fossil fuel burning peaker plants, the weights could be released, spinning the motor/ generator. Could this be done in homes? What about a giant spring in a vehicle? That would replace toxic battery chemicals with a spring assembly ready to rocket through a fortress if accidentally released in a collision.... AC motors seem cheaper and more efficient too...

Hello, I have some very serious discussion/question for me in life and in college so I don't want to make the same mistakes as some of you have made.

I'll start off by introducing myself and then talk about on what I want to pursue in life and into college. I'm going to be a senior this year in high school this year and I have been doing a lot of research on what I want to major in. I like to do things with computers (such as coding and building/animating things with 3D objects), math, science, biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, anatomy, health, and more. So I thought about pursuing in Biomedical or Bioengineering. More specifically, I want to work on Tissue engineering and Biomaterials. If not, then I would like to do nanotechnology. Basically, I want to work on medical things that deal with or interact with the human body parts. I have the grades and the rest of the things in school. However, from the research and the other Reddit posts, I have come across, the amount of Biomedical/Bioengineering jobs is really low and I heard that people who graduate in Biomedical have still found no jobs and this has been year and months from them. When I look up jobs from websites such as Glassdoor or Indeed, there are less than 10k jobs which are horrible compared to core engineering such as a Civil engineer. Then when I look into these jobs, you need internships or a couple years of work experience but there's rarely-none where you can work as an entry-level or starting off. I'm going for at least a Master Degree for this type of engineering (or almost any engineering) but I love to do tech, modeling, coding for a human body part, etc. Also, I heard that employment of biomedical engineers is projected to grow 7 percent from 2016 to 2026 from one source and another source says it's projected to grow 23 percent from 2014 to 2024,""...much faster than the average for all occupations."" So I think about this and say ""Well, when I come out of college (because I graduate in 2019), that was fours years plus another 4 years for both BS and MA degree and that's when all the jobs for Biomedical should be open/available."" Most of the jobs I see online are from California and I'm on the East Side of the U.S.

From researching all the things I dream about doing looks like it will not be happening. So I thought about switching from the whole engineering into a surgeon, in fact, a cardiothoracic surgeon. They get paid like 4X more and I probably would like it but the amount of schooling is insane but I already started with a lot of work in school (I take AP and HN classes.) Either or, I want all my hard work in school to pay off and I don't want to end up not getting a job that I would love to do because they rather have a ""mechanical engineer"" or an ""electrical engineer"" than a Biomedical/Bioengineering. So can anyone please help me so I could be going in the right direction? Again, I'm sorry if I talk a lot about this but I have to get ready for applying to colleges and doing great on my ACT/SAT.",AskEngineers,False,Kev9292,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8y2g8t/discussionquestion_biomedical/

I'm working on a project right now and I'm using a robot simulator called ROS. My professor has written the majority of the program, including creating the nonlinear system. 

When I stimulate, the quadcopter flies to a few points in 3 dimensional space. With the current example control law, the qc oscillates slowly (heavy over/undershooting) 

My task is to come up with the control law for 4 subsystems. I'm using matlab to do so.

Here is a list of the subsystem's statespace

1) x, x', pitch, pitch'

2)y, y', roll, roll'

3)z, z'

4)Yaw, Yaw'

I did a lot of matlah programming and simulating to find the best control law where my metric was the settling times of x, y, z, and yaw.

When I implemented these control laws the quadcopter was the opposite of stabilized. It seemed to react too heavily to inputs and would shoot off course in an instant.

Should I focus on the settling times of the attitude instead? Is settling time not a good metric to stabilize a quadcopter (or anything for that matter)?

I have found some internships for mechanical engineering for next year to apply for, but none for aeronautical.

After doing some research, it seems as though I can go into Software engineering and then merge into aeronautical. 

Is this correct and if so, how many years in software will I have to do?

52,Applying for IEng (IET),1531289167,"Morning all,

   
 I am currently going through the process of collating evidence, preparing for reports to be signed off by my sponsor and completing the IET application form for IEng registration. I have some queries if you could help me please:

· In the application form, Section C states to list codes for ‘Expertise’ and ‘specialism’ Where are these codes taken from, is there an IET document?

· What is the average ‘score’ required to apply? I have seen mixed values (2.6 seems to be the most popular) but nothing concrete

· How many times should I be hitting the competency to ensure I am a Level 2 or Level 3? I am guessing once isn’t enough…

· Does anybody have any tips for the interview/presentation? I can deal with interviews fine but what sort of questions will they ask so I know what to expect?

· Has anybody failed after their application? If so what did you do next time to ensure you were successful?

Hopefully I have posted on the right sub!

55,Is this toaster design a safety hazard?,1531282541,"When I went to visit my parents over the July 4th holiday, my dad informed me that their toaster had stopped working asked me to look at it. I didn't have time when I was there, so I brought it home. Normally, I wouldn't mess too much with a cheap appliance like a toaster, but this isn't just another cheap ""disposable"" $25 toaster. It's one of those 4 slice Dualit toasters that runs around ~$350US. I like toast quite a bit, but I'm sticking with my cheap toaster. 

In any case, I get home and this past weekend, I finally get a chance to crack it open and discover that the hot side of the power cord is completely severed and has obviously been arcing/on fire to the point that it burned through the wire itself and damaged the timer/switch to the point that the housing material broke.  [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/pInO0D9)

I also discovered that while the toaster is built like a tank,  there's no thermal fuse or a breaker in the circuit. Some googling reveals that the company now recommends NOT leaving the toaster plugged in and a common complaint among users seems to be that it tends to NOT shutoff when the timer finishes, which to me sounds like the contacts getting welded closed.


My questions are:

1. Is the lack of a safety device inside the toaster a hazard? 

2. How could the design be remedied to alleviate the hazard?

60,Your opinion about this new course?,1531277534,"I'm 17 y/o who took admission to this first of its kind course in India at a new campus of [this institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chemical_Technology?wprov=sfla1).

The course is **Integrated Masters of Technology Major in Chemical Engineering** and minor in one of the following six specialisations:

- Energy Engineering

- Polymer and Materials Engineering

- Petrochemical Engineering

- Pharmaceutical Engineering

- Food Engineering and Technology

- Fibre and Textile Processing Technology

There are unique features of this course that makes it innovative. The course is of 5 years. I won't get a bachelors degree but will directly get a masters degree and it will also lead to **TWO years of industry experience**. This is because students will actually do training in industries while doing the course. Here is how the course is.

-  The course have trimester pattern, each trimester of 4 months for 5 years.(15 trimesters in total)

- The intake is of 60 students which will together have classes for 1st trimester. After that the class will be divided between two batches A and B each of 30 students.

- At 2nd trimester, batch A will go for industry training(can be called like internship) while batch B have classroom lectures. In 3rd trimester, batches A and B swap places and this goes on till 13th trimester. By this time both batches have completed 6 trimesters of industry experience (two years) and 7 trimesters of classes.

- Specialisation will be chosen after first year based on grades in first year. (The specialisations are given here in descending order of my preference from top to bottom)

- The last two trimesters (8 months) are for project and after that the batch will get a masters degree and two years of industry experience.

I like CHE. Honestly, I don't have a preference among ME, EE, ECE and CHE. Besides, physical chemistry is my strongest subject. The irresistible thing about this course is that usually bachelor's takes 4 yrs, the 2 more yrs for masters and 2 more for industry experience of two years. That makes total of 8 years which I can get in 5 years. So by the age of 22 and half I will have masters in CE and a specialisation and two years of industry experience. By the way, **students will get stipend for all the months spent in industry training**(though it may be less, given that students will be young)

But this course is new and my batch will be the first batch of this course. So it is unprecedented, the course, the curriculum, industry training, and I have no seniors to ask about it. There are no statistics about job placements of this course.

The pay was fairly low for ChemE's but the cost of living was too, so I wanted to get some experience first and then see where I could go.

2.) Electrical power distribution systems and their fundamental components (transformers, breakers, multiphase and multipole power). I think I'm OK with this topic in general but any time magnetism or induction gets brought up I'm lost

3.) Vibration analysis and how to read vibration spectra

2,A coefficient of friction mystery. Help!,1531176186,"Hi All,

First time Redditor here!

I am currently working on a project housing crickets and cockroaches as food for my reptiles. For anyone who is not familiar with this practice, most people keep their insects in storage tubs filled with egg crates to better utilise the space within them (also used to provide warmth, security, etc). My issue is keeping them contained - particularly species of cockroaches, who are notoriously good escape artists and can climb even the smoothest of surfaces. The go-to solution for people in the hobby is Fluon - a teflon-based solution which is painted on a surface, drying to a chalky texture that, if applied properly, will successfully contain most species of insects. However, Fluon is only a temporary solution and must be removed and reapplied every so often. It also rubs off very easily. I am looking for a permanent solution, that neither deteriorates nor damages easily. I have done a considerable amount of research surrounding the co-efficient of friction of different materials, and have concluded that a teflon-based product is what I require, however, I have tried teflon tapes in various forms (tapes claiming to be teflon with an adhesive applied to one side; as well as teflon-coated, glass fibre tapes) to no avail. Whilst I have worked out that fibrous textures are a no-go, I am unsure as to why a barrier made of a tape claiming to be teflon can be breached whilst a Fluon one cannot.

After speaking with somebody on another engineering subreddit, it has become evident that coefficient of friction may not be the (only) issue, and that I may need to find a harder material which insects cannot hook into to climb their way up. I am aware that imperfections in the surface of the material and/or dirt on the surface provide insects with a potential way of climbing up, but the softness of the material hadn't occurred to be prior to receiving a response. The issue I have with this is lining the inside of the tub with said material, as it obviously needs to be hard enough to avoid insects hooking in, but soft enough to work around the curves of the tub walls.

I am also aware that glass is an obvious answer to the hardness of a material, however, I will be moving the container around, and glass is heavy and impractical. I will settle for this if I cannot find another solution.

I am currently waiting for a teflon sheet for heat transfer/t-shirt printing to arrive in the mail (https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F282661773924), but below is a list of methods for containing them that are common practice within the hobby but do not work for more advanced climbers/I have thought of on my own and trialled unsuccessfully/I have heard of people using but refuse to use due to mess/practicality, semi-permanence, etc:

- packing tape
- Fluon (https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F282802602618)
- silicone spray,
- Vaseline,
- olive oil,
- teflon-coated, glass fibre sheet used for inside of oven (the fibrous texture provides insects with an easy way up the walls of tub, negating the purpose of the teflon coating), such as the following: https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F202184428024

I started off working in the warehouse, but my work ethic made me stand out and I quickly rose to a lead position where I had to simultaneously ask for time off to attend interviews for the PhD programs. 

I'm pretty sure that once they saw me as someone striving for higher education they started moving me into a position where I work closely with our head engineer (and VP of the company). So they offered to send me out for some basic training in PCDMIS (CMM programming) followed by some SolidWorks training. These are the two primary areas I focus on at work now (it's a small company so at times I wear all types of hats) and a co-worker of mine suggested looking into going back to school for Mechatronics.

I'm curious as to whether or not anyone has had experience with going back to get a second bachelors degree in engineering and whether or not it was worth it?

10,Energy Accumulation in Thermal Systems Question...,1531161639,"Hi all,

I have a question regarding regarding a hot fluid flowing through a pipe with a brass fitting My simple question is: can the brass fitting temperature ever be higher than that of the fluid? For example. you have 50C water flowing through a pipe and a brass fitting. You measure the surface temperature of the brass after reaching steady-state temperature. Can the brass fitting ever be hotter than 50C?

My initial reaction is no, because the only source of energy (ie heat) is from the 50C fluid, so any component that touches is will be less than or equal to 50C, especially a thermally conducive material like brass which will be radiating heat. However, there's also the concept of Energy Accumulation - if the brass fitting cannot radiate heat as fast as energy is injected into it from the hot fluid, will its temperature increase beyond the 50C?

A similar question would be also for a large reservoir of the lquid vs a small reservoir, will there be a significant difference in fluid temperature inside the reservoir?

* A typical lead/acid 12v battery will provide 2.11V per cell (times 6 cells = 12.66VDC) when new and fully charged.  
* Keeping a battery fully charged reduces sulfate accumulation. Sulfate accumulation is somehow bad in one of these batteries. (For instance, it takes much longer to charge a battery with sulfate on the plates than one that has clean plates.)  
* Better chargers use a recondition stage which charges at above 15VDC for a period of time to remove sulfate buildup.  
* You should let a battery rest for 2 hours after bringing to a full charge before testing it to scrub off any surface charge.

I am trying to find a relationship between tire generated forces at the contact patch and the suspension loads. I have a way to measure all the loads at the suspension links but have no way of finding the tire forces (except in the z direction). I initially started by modeling my suspension system in Matlab to determine the consequences of exercing a force at the contact patch, observing the resulting force on the suspension system, and reversing the process (by solving a matrices) to obtain tire forces from suspension loads. Since i have only two unknowns, only two suspension members are required to solve this matrix. Unfortunately, different sets of members produce different x-y forces at the contact patch. My question is, what else should I be taking taking into account, apart from tire forces, as generating loads in the suspension members (ie: braking force, driveshaft torque, ect...).

30,Is there such a thing as a PLC which can detect physical resistance in a linear actuator?,1531111053,"TLDR: Is there such a thing as a PLC which can detect physical resistance in a linear actuator?

I am interested in making a machine that unseizes frozen chains. Currently we soak 3 meter (aprox 10 foot) sections of chain in PB blaster for a few days and then check each link individually to see which ones are frozen. When we find a frozen link, we stick the chain in a vice and pull it back and forth until the chain is no longer seized. The process is dirty and time consuming and seems like something that could be automated fairly easily.

So I drew up a sketch where a section of chain would be linked in a circle with some sprockets, a motor, and a linear actuator that would push and pull the chain up and down. Also there would be some brushes to clean the chain as it goes around. So I figured if I could get a PLC that could read the resistance of the actuator, it could tell that it was dealing with a frozen link. Then the motor would stop and the actuator would move up and down until the link was no longer frozen. When the detected resistance drops below a specified amount, the PLC would know the link was no longer frozen and the motor would resume turning.",AskEngineers,False,solarecl,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8x8790/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_plc_which_can_detect/

If I have an N/O Button, with an N/O Logic, normally the logic is unpowered.  When the button gets pressed the Logic gets powered.

38,Non-Compete/ Solicitation Clauses in Employment Offers,1531093274," Hi fellow Engineers,

I am an Civil engineer in the Greater Toronto Area and currently received a job offer for a very exciting job opportunity. After on-going talks of over 2 months, I am confident that the role, responsibilities, and projects are exactly the next steps I want in my career.

I received the formal job offer late last week, and upon reading over the paperwork, I have found some language that confuses. There is a section in my employment contract that speaks to non-compete/solicitation that seems overly restrictive.  I have 7 years of experience, and have been working at the same consulting engineering firm since graduation so I am unsure if this is normal verbiage (my current employment contract does not have a non-compete clause).

The wording speaks as follows:

***You hereby acknowledge that by reason of your employment with the Company, you will develop***

***a close working relationship with the Company’s customers and clients, gain a knowledge of the***

***Company’s methods of operation, and acquire and be exposed to confidential materials and***

***information, all of which would cause irreparable harm and injury to the Company if made available***

***to a competitor or if used for competitive purposes. In consideration of the compensation and***

***benefits provided to you pursuant to this Agreement, you hereby agree as follows:***

***(a) While employed with the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months following the***

***Termination Date, regardless of how that termination should occur, you will not directly or***

***indirectly, on your own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert, or***

***appropriate, or attempt to solicit, divert, or appropriate, any independent project***

***management and advisory consulting business from any client or customer of the***

***Company which was serviced or solicited by the Company during the two (2) years prior***

***to the Termination Date and within the Greater Toronto Area or any other geographic or***

***municipal territory in which you operated at the time of termination of employment, without***

***the prior approval of the Company;***

***(b) While employed with the Company and for a period of six (6) months following your***

***resignation or termination for just cause of your employment with the Company, you will***

***not involve or engage as an employee, partner, joint venture, principal, consultant, agent,***

***or shareholder with any Directly Competitive Company within the Greater Toronto Area***

***or any other geographic or municipal territory in which you operated at the time of the***

***termination of your employment, without the prior approval of the Company;***

***(c) While employed with the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months following the***

***Termination Date, regardless of how that termination should occur, you will not request,***

***directly or indirectly, on your own behalf or on behalf of others, induce or influence, or***

***attempt to induce or influence, any customer, client, patron, end-user, distributor,***

***merchant, supplier, or employee of the Company to terminate its relationship with the***

***Company, without the prior approval of the Company; and***

***(d) During your employment with the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months***

***following the termination of said employment, regardless of how that termination should***

***occur, you will not, directly or indirectly, on your own behalf or on the behalf of others,***

***hire or take away, attempt to hire or take away, or cause to be hired or taken away, any***

***employee of the Company who was employed by the Company during the two (2) years***

***preceding the Termination Date, without the prior approval of the Company;***

Do these seem reasonable? Is this standard verbiage on most consulting firm contracts? Are these usually enforceable? i wanted some opinions before I sign back this offer.

ASTM D5312, Evaluation of Durability of Rock for Erosion Control Under Freezing and Thawing Conditions, has a handy US map showing number of freeze/thaw cycles to subject your rock specimen to when evaluating it for durability by mass loss. The map reportedly takes into account number of freeze thaw cycles and amount of moisture in those cycles, a cold and wet place is generally tested for more cycles than a place similarly cold but dry. I haven't had luck finding a reference for the north that follows this line of thinking.

&gt;ig. 1 is an index map based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) climatic data and was developed to determine the geographic distribution of the severity of freeze-thaw cycles. The figure not only takes into account the annual number of freeze-thaw cycles, but also the amount of moisture associated with each cycle and the temperature extremes of the freeze-thaw cycle. The index number, therefore, is not a prediction of the annual number of freeze-thaw cycles, but rather, is an indicator of the severity of the freeze-thaw process by geographic area. Since the freeze-thaw severity varies from one geographic location to another, it is not possible to provide a reliable indication of the serviceability of rock for erosion control for a given locality unless the test procedure is customized for that locality. The freeze-thaw severity index allows for this type of customization. Lienhart, D.

*"" The cave system runs under a mountain range, which has mostly eliminated drilling as an option for rescuing the boys. Getting the necessary drilling equipment up the mountain would be daunting and time-consuming. ""*

I don't have a civil engineering  or geological background and wanted to know why the mountain range is such an obstacle for this task. Can drilling equipment not be dropped by a helicopter to a designated cleared location? Or is the issue the mountain range itself? Is a mountain simply to thick to be drilled into?

I wanted to explore why other options are not being considered as well and was hoping to generate ideas. From my understanding the cave system flooded while the group was exploring the cave. In situations like this, where does flooding come from? Does it necessarily have to occur from above the cave level? If this is the case can the water be drained through a pipe system? Can the water inside the cave be drained into possible lower cave systems if such lower levels exist?

77,Should I quit my engineering career?,1530961002,"hey all,

i am an engineer with about a two years of experience in software and hardware development, and I am contemplating to quit my career. I think that, deep down, I actually hate engineering and I might be doing it just because of money. As not liking engineering isn't enough, I think that I suck at it hard. A good indication for this would be, that in the whole time of my employment, I haven't delivered basically anything. My productivity is very low, I am not interested in anything, I pretend that I'm working, I procrastinate with tasks, I sleep on team meetings, I dodge the hard tasks, everything is so hard to start with and so on... Things get pretty ridiculous when I attend a conversation with a group of coworkers. Most of time I don't and can't listen to what they're saying - it's either boring or I can't understand it, so instead, I just keep nodding and hope I won't get asked something. Even if I wanted to listen to these boring conversations, I could not, as my mind auto switches to thinking about how I'm relaxing on a beach somewhere in Caribbean islands, while drinking a nice cocktail. Basically whole work is just about looking for 8 hours on a clock to leave the job and get home - tired, exhausted and had not produced much.  Obviously with such bad performance and bad attitude I lose my job, or quit it by myself, as it becomes unbearable to continue with a such pointless routine.

I'm not really sure whether I actually like what I'm doing for a living, but I can tell that I truly hated my studies.  I thought that the hate or just the dislike would go away when I'll get employed, but this didn't happen. If you would ask me, why I went with engineering route that would be probably because of financial security (pays good &amp; plenty of jobs), status in society (you're not seen as a loser) and because of my introverted/socially inept personality.

In last two years of my employment I basically created nothing, because I can't finish a single thing, or it takes me years to do it. But the productivity tends to be the worst with programming tasks. It takes me days and days just to implement a simple thing like creating a button, but most of time I  procrastinate with everything. I won't deny - it can be exciting to have a new  software product developed (or just to have an idea  about new product),but  the coding process itself is by far the horror of all times. Things weren't that bad if 80&amp;#37; of time when coding would be development, and the remaining 20&amp;#37; for fixing problems - but in my case, I spend most of time for trying understand what the hell the code that I'm looking does (even if I wrote it), where is the problem and how to fix it without introduction of new problems. This is straight painful process. If it was only some automation task involved with scripting language as a tool, then things become much easier. But using these compiled languages with complex code, complex documentation, loads of libraries,  super strictness, long compiling time, unclear and long error logs...while having no passion and/or talent to do these things, it just mentally kills me before I even start coding. I usually say ""Oh no, not this sh\*t again"", open youtube and start watching Bob Ross painting.

2,Why can't we simply pull energy out of the air?,1530899897,"Odd question:  why can't we pull energy out of the air?

Heat pumps can have rather large coefficients of performance.  You can expend 1kWh and move 3kWh of heat in common winter use with residential HVAC systems, which means 4kWh of home heating in total because the energy used to power the heat pump is lost as heat and pumped into the house (3kWh leaves the outside air, 4kWh enters the house).

Adiabatic compressed air energy storage has rather high efficiencies—over 80% in real-world implementations, and predicted over 90% in reasonable technological timeframes (theoretical 100%).

It seems to me you can use a compressed air engine to drive a heat pump and compressor, and use that heat pump to cool the engine and its exhaust.  You'd sink incoming heat into a thermal mass, and drive the air coming off your storage tank through the thermal mass to recover the energy.  The heat pump should pull more energy out of the compressor and exhaust than is necessary to drive the heat pump—and, in any case, the energy used by the heat pump itself is pushed into the thermal mass (at least with enough insulation).

The earth's atmosphere isn't one uniform reservoir, and temperature varies wildly even over small distances.  You're blowing below-ambient air and sucking in ambient air.  Compression pushes that higher-temperature (higher-energy) air into a small volume, and the loss from running the compressor (heat) is being pumped into thermal storage.

You're basically using energy from the sun—stored in the earth's atmosphere—as an energy source.

I'm trying to build my own adjustable height standing desk. I watched [a pretty inspirational YouTube video](https://youtu.be/GiV_JJyvJzY) of a reasonably cheap, well-built desk and am considering trying to make my own attempt at building one.

I'm a reasonably handy person, and think I can figure out most of the other parts of this project on my own, but I am open to suggestions!

The main thing I came here to ask for help on is the ""linear actuators"" that will be used to raise/lower the legs of my desk. In the YouTube video I linked, the creator says the desk is ""pretty quiet"", but my impression disagrees a lot. I'm not necessarily aiming for ""perfectly silent"", but actually quiet (below ~30db) would be a luxury I'd consider paying for. The other thing is making sure the actuators have the right length to be at a comfortable standing and sitting position.

I don't know how to ""shop"" for these, and my googling has led me to places that didn't seem easy to make sense of. They seemed like smaller vendors with particular (and non-specific) stock, and I didn't really know how to go through their data sheets and I definitely didn't see anything about how noisy or quiet the parts were.

As far as designing the desk--if you're interested in helping with that--[this](https://imgur.com/a/Ckwf0Le) is a ~1 minute paint drawing of what I'm going for. I promise I'm more capable at building than I am at paint. The basic idea is to use galvanized steel pipe cut to size from a hardware store, that's the gray lines and blue lines. The brown rectangles at the bottom are wooden boards to serve as the desk's feet and the pipes are attached with whatever that fitting is called.

The blue lines have an OD that fits inside of the ID of the gray pipes, and are what would be moved by the actuators (4 in this design), and my train of thought was basically that a four-legged desk would be sturdier than a two legged desk. Do you think this frame would be reasonably sturdy? Are there any simple improvements I could make without needing to really complicate the building process?

So in first year I had this project to design a cabin in the woods. It didn't need much research, was mostly evaluating what an engineering project looks like. For some reason I kinda got hooked on it and took it too far. Now I like to plan for an idyllic little cabin I'd love to build in the woods, and go up there for holidays and weekends. May never come to pass, but it's really relaxing to think about. 

The main goal for the project is a cabin made from scratch by me and whatever friends I can press gang into helping. Although the cabin will be made with as many self harvested materials, I'm aware that's unrealistic; the brunt of the work will be done by modern power tools or with brought resources. May even go the shipping container route. 

Anyway, I recently realised that instead of trying to plan how to build my cabin, then fit features into it, I should work out what features I'll have, and choose the structure that best accommodates all of that. Which leads me to my question. What kinds if systems are out there that can generate and store electricity, that can be set up by a relative layman with lots of time? Solar seems promising, since efficiency has shot up a lot in recent years, but a lot of the panels I find online seem to be such small scale I'd need hundreds, and there's no way to ""store"" the energy. 

So what are my options? Thanks guys

\*TLDR:\* Will need enough power to live comfortable for short periods of time. What kind of options are there for setting up a system that will generate and store electricity?

25,What are the bounds of the gain of a Passive Antenna?,1530839694,"Hi - I'm trying to source a GPS device and I'm talking to a distributor about a solution. The distributor rep has pointed me at the following GPS Antenna:

https://www.moxa.com/product/ANT-GPS-OSM-05-3M.htm

It claims to be 26dBi of gain. If this antenna is an ACTIVE antenna (ie, it has an LNA), then that is totally reasonable. But the rep is trying to claim that this is a PASSIVE antenna. If the antenna claimed 2.6dBi of gain, I can totally see this being a passive antenna.

If we do a thought experiment, the perfect ""omnidirectional"" antenna for a GPS application on a terrestrial vehicle would be an antenna that has all of its directionality in one hemisphere. We don't care about the hemisphere that is pointing at the ground. If we somehow made this perfect antenna, then its directivity would be D = 4pi / 2pi = 2.0. Which means the max passive gain would be 3dB if it was perfectly constructed with no loss. A 26dBi gain for a passive antenna would imply a beam width of approximately 11degrees. Which for a GPS antenna is not useful.

An omnidirectional passive antenna with 26dBi of gain violates the laws of physics because antennas are reciprocal. With no losses, antenna gain == antenna directivity. This would mean it would be able to transmit signals with 26dBi greater than isotropic pattern which violates conservation of energy. Right?

I want to know if at this point in my career, 2.5 years out of school, if I should be doing nearly as much CADD work that I am doing right now? Don't get me wrong I enjoy drafting and believe there should be a good mix of drafting work and design work but I feel like I am not being used to my full potential and I don't know if that is because I am not at that point in my career yet and am getting ahead of myself or if it's on my project managers for using me on CADD and not taking the time to show me the ropes for other aspects of the industry.  

Now I have already left a job after a year and a half for having the same thought process and issues. I was basically becoming their company work horse for the use of AutoCAD Civil 3D, as they had just started using it in their office, and saw myself being pigeon holed into doing only Civil 3D drafting so I left for this company with the hopes of doing more than just drafting. At first it seemed as if it was going to be a more balanced workload as I had field time, attended different meetings and even sat in on management meetings but as my time here extended it became more and more drafting and I am beginning to have the same thoughts and even looking at new companies who have reached out to me. 

I would like some advice/insight from others in the industry to see if I am being too big headed and getting ahead of myself or if my concerns are justified.

Sorry for the long post and thanks for any advice in advance. ",AskEngineers,False,spinabomb,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8wa8k0/where_am_i_supposed_to_be/
38,How to learn from a different but unrelated department within my company?,1530793551,"Hi everyone,

I recently graduated with a degree in chemical engineering, starting a month ago at a decently sized oil/gas consulting company's small satellite city office. And basically, I don't really like this industry, I can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life just due to not being passionate about it. I don't truly like the work or being in the city, the progression of promotions just lead to doing the same stuff but you've been here longer and have to travel to sell the technology to rich Asian/Middle Eastern/Europe buyers. I personally don't think this is a job I can do for more than a year, year and a half or else I'll be stuck in it.

There is no way at this office to really switch into different departments as there are only 3 and they seem to be fairly major dependent (my process engineer department is chemical engineers, the design department is mechanical engineers, all the miscellaneous are finance, management, etc).

60,Engineer Salary in Colorado,1530732522,"Hi All,

I just recently took an validation test engineering job in Colorado and wasn't sure if my salary is high enough.

I looked around Reddit and glassdoor and couldn't come up with a solid conclusion. 

I moved out here from California where the cost of living is high and the income is high. When I did my salary conversion I thought I had done it right but only to realize later that it may be a little off. I have a gut feeling that my salary may be on the low side.

Some background:

\-I have 6 years of experience working in Medical devices and Li-ion battery. 

\-Electrical Engineering background

\-I took a job out in Colorado working on Li-ion batteries 

\-I was making about $88k total compensation with stock options (that I didn't take which I regretted) in CA. 15 days PTO

\-Now I am making $75k total compensation with no stock options in CO. 10 vacation days with sick days separated.

\-I work 9 hours a day and get every other Friday off at the current employer. Which is nice since I will get a 3 day weekend every other week to recharge. Most engineer job hours are 9 hours a day any ways so it almost seems like I am getting extra days off without giving up too much. As far as I know this type of schedule is rare to find so its a big pro in my book.

\-My main responsibilities is creating validation test plans and documents and test cables on batteries.

\-Small company, less than 100 people

\-Threw me right into one of the most complex project the company has seen with compressed timeline. Meaning I get much guidance.

\-Lots of technical skills learning opportunities that I didn't have before. But also expected to learn quickly to use new skill to support the complex project. Not sure if I will ever have time to learn them tbh.

\-My current rent cost is $1330 a month.

I have been considering talking to the boss to see if I can ask for a re-negotiate on the salary but it seems like it may be too late to do so.

I've updated my resume and started to look around to get back into the Medical Devices industry in the area.

69,"Should I stay at this job, or start applying for jobs and leave",1530693312,"I know its long but I would really appreciate it if you read my post and give me your opinion!

Hey guys/girls, could you please advise me on if I have made the right choice. Note that I have used a throwaway account for this in case some of my colleagues lurk on reddit. 

I recently graduated from college with an Electrical Engineering degree. I applied to a whole bunch of firms at the end of last year and got a few interviews, but only one offer, which was from the company I am at right now. The job required me to do PLC programming, commissioning of a specific machine that they supply, maintenance of the machine, electrical design, and finally, recommend and implement improvements (R &amp; D). At the interview I was told that I would be doing some sort of major design work.

Now there are many perks of this job that I like, but what I am really concerned about is being locked into this field and being unable to move to a consultancy/design role in another company. I get paid within the acceptable salary range of a graduate engineer, they gave me a brand-new car which I am allowed to take home and use for personal travel. All gas, maintenance and insurance is paid for by the company. I consider the benefit of this car to be at least $10k, and if I add this onto my salary, then I get paid more than all of my friends who are graduate engineers and work at large consultancy/engineering firms. The maintenance aspect of the job means I get to travel a lot within the country, and with no allowance on how much to spend for breakfast, lunch or dinner, I have the freedom to go to restaurants and get what I want. The job itself is pretty relaxed most of the time, and there is not much stress during the day. 

I am concerned about a few things however. The company I work for is not an engineering firm, and in fact I am the first engineer they have hired. Its been a couple of months now and I have yet to be given any design tasks to do with their product. So far all I have done is commissioning and maintenance. Essentially, I am a field service engineer (I think). My boss and my colleagues are tradesmen by profession, so I am not sure if I am getting the guidance and training an engineer may get at an engineering firm.
I try to look at it in positive light because they do send me out to customers by myself, so that gives me confidence in talking to customers directly, by myself. I also get experience in the field to see what works and what doesn't work so well (which should hopefully help for design). The machine itself is mechanical (chains, sprockets, motors) and electrical (PLC, motor controllers, sensors) so that gives me practical exposure to both fields. 

I guess my question is, did I make a mistake by accepting a job at this company? Will it hurt my career and make it hard for me to find another job at an engineering company/consultancy?

11,Is it a crazy idea to go back for a second degree in Engineering (EE to ME)?,1530582818,"So a couple weeks ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/8l95a1/daily_general_megathread_may_22_2018/dzdty9s/) to /r/engineering and got a few good responses that really jumped started my investigation into whether I should really consider going back to Uni for a degree in ME.

As my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/8l95a1/daily_general_megathread_may_22_2018/dzdty9s/) explained, I have been working a pretty sweet gig as an RF hardware design/Test engineer. Unfortunately, I'm just not that into it. I'm pretty capable within my degree, but every task I work towards is like pulling teeth. Every step is agonizing up the long hill of engineering circuit solutions. Of course, the challenges I overcome everyday are fulfilling for the most part, but as I mentioned in my original post, I can't seem to shake the fact that I really don't love what I do - nor potentially any other facet of my degree. With that said, I seem to always want to take more of a mechanical approach to potential interests within my degree, and ideally, the best days are when both mechanical and electromagnetic philosophies of thought converge.

What does this mean, then? I graduated just a year ago and now I'm clambering to get back into the weeds of it all? The sad truth is I look over the ME flowchart for their four-year curriculum and think ""shit! Why didn't I just do this instead?"" This is certainly a sad reality when I absolutely found no interest in any of my EE courses other than my electromagnetism or materials courses. Hell, the best part of my photovoltaics course (personally) was actually learning about the silicon fabrication methods and solar panel installation and determining optimum placement based on time of year, region, and shading. Sure, I enjoyed my circuits courses and enjoyed my electronics courses, but only from the perspective of wanting to conquer them.

I have thought about a Master's degree, but since I lack really ALL the prerequisites, I feel I would be at an extreme disadvantage and would potentially set myself back even further as I try to move on with my life. Speaking of which, I like money. More importantly, I like *making* money. I haven't spoken to my company yet about the possibility of part-time, but let's say they agree and I work part time as I go back to school. I know it's manageable from the perspective of other peers I have seen work a part-time job as they went to school, but how many of them were working a legitimate RF career. Perhaps I'm being a bit presumptuous here, but that's why I came here for answers and for some good insight from you all!

Anyways, thanks in advance!

For those of you who are from Toronto or have been here before, you might know that rapid transit here is not adequate as compared to cities of similar size (population, economy, etc.). To counter this, there has been a push for many rapid transit projects throughout the region for at least the next 20-30 years or so.

22,Could a steam injector be used to propel a boat more efficiently than a turbine?,1530561864,"Many years ago, a summer job on a tourist railroad exposed me to the inner workings of the steam locomotive.

One mysterious, magic (well, until you understand how it works) device was the [steam injector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injector), used to fill up the boiler (TL;DR: basically, the steam injector mixes hot steam with cold water to transfer the thermal energy of the steam into cinetic energy for the cold water in order to fill-up the boiler against it’s own pressure).

Now, I wonder if you put a steam boiler on a boat, and use it to make a high-speed water jet from the lake water to propel the boat, would this be more efficient than using a turbine &amp; a propeller (à la [Charles Algernon* Parsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbinia))?

Welcome to the AskEngineers biquarterly thread to apply for contributor flair!

**Contributor flair** is both the [icon and text](https://i.imgur.com/ECzkrGp.png) next to a someone's username which indicates his or her engineering specialization that you may have seen while browsing AskEngineers. Flair with no icon does not necessarily indicate demonstrated expertise. We're always looking for new contributors, so if you think you have what it takes, keep on reading!

* A list of our currently flaired users can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Askengineers/wiki/flairedusers#wiki_flaired_users).

* **If you previously applied for flair and did not get a response:** please [**message us**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers&amp;subject=Flair%20application) or simply apply again in this thread. Sometimes applications get lost or neglected over holidays when the mod team is on vacation, etc.

---

###Requirements for Contributor Flair

* **Expertise in an area of engineering.** Expertise means degree-level academic knowledge (min. Bachelor's or BSc), or an equivalent amount of self-study, work experience in the field, or research.
  * **Note:** we will not ask you to verify your credentials, meaning this is a purely merit-based system.

* The ability to **cite sources from engineering literature** for any claims you make, especially within your area of expertise.

* The ability to provide **high-quality answers** in accordance with [**our answering guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_answers).

#### Expected behavior

We afford a certain level of trust to flaired members of AskEngineers, as they are the face of the community and represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole.  Because of this, we take into account every flair applicant's user history when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history contains any form of racism, sexism, and other types of bigotry.  Such behavior is not tolerated in AskEngineers as stated in [**our rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_civility), and we do not tolerate it from our panelists. Additionally, applicants who participate in discussions that are anti-science, pseudoscientific, or otherwise not supported by peer-reviewed scientific literature will be rejected. We also reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. AskEngineers is a space for engineering discussion based on science and verifiable facts, and the attitudes described above have no place here.

### How to apply

Simply post a top-level reply in this thread, and include:

1. **The desired [icon and text](https://i.imgur.com/ECzkrGp.png) of your flair you want to be designated as.** Try to be as specific as possible, but be aware that there is a hard limit of 32 characters (including spaces).

1.  **Links to at 3-5 comments that you've made within the past 2 years, answering a question in your field of expertise.** Your posts do not have to be on AskEngineers — if you answered questions in /r/Engineering, /r/AskScience, or another relevant subreddit, they will be accepted.
  * **Note:** we may ask for additional comments beyond what you initially provide if some of them are considered insufficient (length or depth), or irrelevant to the expertise you're claiming.

### How to nominate

Follow the same instructions above, linking 3-5 comments that *another user* made that you think would qualify him or her for contributor flair. Be sure to tag them in your comment by including `/u/username-of-nominee` in your comment. If the user doesn't claim the nomination, they will be given a generic ""Trusted Contributor"" icon that they may opt out of at any time.

### Revoking flair

Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules or fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise.

50,To patent or not to patent?,1530485019,"Quick backstory: I’ve recently graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering at a UK-based university where I’ve spent the past year developing the design of a prosthesis for amputees living in developing countries as my final year project on which my dissertation was written. The project was proposed by a charity that had great interest in the prosthesis being developed, as they would like to both manufacture and freely provide such a product to a relatively small number of amputees in the aforementioned market. As a result, I successfully produced a prosthesis that (thus far) not only meets its design criteria, but also entertains a potential innovative step that may designate it patentable. 

Due to their vested interest, the charity’s trustees have stated that they would like to facilitate the continued development of the design through to a final stage where they are able to independently produce the prosthesis. This would be achieved through the funding and provision of a research position at my university where I would effectively be employed.

Herein lies my problem. As it may be possible to apply for a patent on the product, it seems almost logical that I should take the steps necessary to ensure that my intellectual property is protected. I am interested in having a degree of ‘ownership’ to the work I’ve done, and I would be lying to myself if I said I wasn’t interested in having some recognition for it either, as well as being able to depend on it for some form of financial gain (even a pretty small one) in the future.

On the other hand, I understand the patent application process to be a costly one, especially due to the multinational nature of the product’s potential application. The costs of legal battles against companies/individuals that ignore the patent are also considerably outside the scope of a recent graduate like myself. From the charity’s perspective, they have stated that they’re not interested in funding my continued development of a design that is patented, as the uncertainty that this would hold in their ability to continue to produce the prostheses (i.e., I could choose not to lease them the production rights, or something to that effect) is too much of a risk for them. They’re also not interested in holding any degree of ownership to a patent because of the same financial implications that disinterest me.

At the opposite end of the scale, I’ve been suggested that releasing the design to the public domain via some formal means. This would be suitable for the charity in that it would mean they would have free access to make and produce the prosthesis. It would also greatly benefit me in knowing that anyone would be able to take the work that I’ve done to further the work that I might be constrained to achieving, and thus indirectly help more people. The opportunity to improve lives is a big driving force to the product’s development so far and releasing it to the public domain would embody that ethos. However, this of course would mean that upon completion of the work performed on behalf of the charity, I would no longer be entitled to any financial reward that may have been otherwise attainable, and the opportunity for other’s to claim ownership of my work without consequence is obvious.

So to conclude my ramblings, my question is this: what should I do? Is there an alternative to the two options I have outlined above that draws a better outcome for both parties? If not, which is the ‘better’ from your perspective? ",AskEngineers,False,towsklati,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8vdqsd/to_patent_or_not_to_patent/

55,Is it possible to compensate capacitance by increasing voltage across the terminals of a parallel plate capacitor?,1530443378,"Hi guys, 

Its a fairly basic question, but one that is a bit specific to my situation. 

I'm using the AD5933 evaluation board to analyze the impedance across a set of parallel copper plates placed 4.5mm apart. Modelling this as a parallel plate capacitor, I arrived at an impedance of 500kOhm at 20kHz (approx). What I did after this is what I'm a  bit worried about. 

I hooked up an amplifier which amplified the excitation voltage of the AD5933 evaluation board from 2V to 20V. This amplified excitation voltage then passed over my parallel copper plates. Except this time, I increased the spacing to 95mm. Now, I know that parallel plate capacitor model only applies for a small spacing between the plates, and to be able to assume the same model for a larger spacing is why I amplified the excitation voltage. With an amplification to 20V and a spacing of 95mm then, I arrived at 500kOhm impedance at 20kHz. So effectively, the AD5933 board ""thinks"" that the impedance between the copper plates is still the same as when it was 4.5mm apart. 

My question is, is this approach correct? I'm not an experienced electronics person, I know the basic understanding of capacitors and I know that ideally, C = Q/V and thus if V is changed then Q changes too to compensate for this and keeps the capacitance the same. Thus my approach would then correct since I get the SAME capacitance for 4.5mm as for 95mm even though the voltage is changing since the charge then similarly increases?

Personal Rant: I seriously hate that the NCEES and licensed engineers that I've seen say that they values experience over pure technical knowledge in your discipline for taking that exam which makes no rational sense. I know one reason that NCEES did this is to increase the difficultly of engineers to obtain their license in order to increase the value of it but it still isn't fair to the engineers that have the technical knowledge and enough competency in their expertise to be licensed without experience. The PE exam questions that I have seen look more difficult but studying for it I believe would be the same as the FE exam since the problems are derived from background knowledge that you would of learned in school, NOT job experience. There are many engineers I know that I personally believe lack depth in their expertise due to their lack of school/book knowledge but have decent amount of experience in their field. It's not fair at all that the system is set up this way.",AskEngineers,False,thestacks42,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8uzbt7/is_there_any_way_i_can_get_my_pe_license_without/
87,"Should I only work part time, live off savings, and focus on school?",1530326819,"This is a cross post from r/cad, I figure I might get more advice here.

I  need advice from people further on in their careers then me. I have  several questions on how to handle my work, school and use of savings. I  am 20 years old.

I am currently in  college (CC) full time (17 credits). I am entering my final and third  year this fall. When I graduate next spring I will have an Associates of  Applied Acience (AAS) in Mechanical Engineering Technology, an  Associates of Engineering (AE) degree, a certification in Mechanical  Drafting, and a certification in operation/programming of CNC machines. I  currently have a 3.5 gpa.

Next summer I  will be able to transfer to my city's university for my BS in Mechanical  Engineering, with a minor in electrical engineering. This will take 2-3  years to complete. If I am doing well I have the option to enter an  early master's program and earn my MS in Mechanical Engineering with one  extra year.

I recently completed my two  year full-time apprenticeship with an electrical engineer, and since  then have become a designer, working full-time. My job is to design and  draft (AutoCAD) our control panels and their associated systems, write  PLC code, test systems, and get systems up and running in the field.

I  fully support myself, my family isn't around. My monthly expenses  (things that are due every month) totals $925.50. And then additional  expenses (savings, car registration, ect.) add another $125.00 to that. I  am currently making $16.00 per hour, with full benefits and 3 weeks  paid vacation a year. Once I graduate from CC I will be moved to $19.50  per hours. I have saved up approximately $65,000.00 over the last four  years. $25,000.00 is completely liquid. The remainder is in investment  accounts-- I can pull $9000 a year from them without being penalized.

Currently my tuition is about $2500.00 per year, next year when I transfer it will jump to $8000.00.

So  my problem is that working full time, and school full time is getting  to be much. I have been averaging 3 hours of sleep a night for months  now ( I don't get home till about 2am every night, and I am up at  4:45am) and it is starting to really get to me. My grades have started  to suffer as well-- I used to be at a 4.0 gpa.

This  fall I have Calculus 2, Fluids, Mechanisms, an upper level Physics, and  an advanced Solidworks class. Next spring is Calculus 3, Statics,  Circuits, another Physics, and a machining lab. Once I transfer my  classes will only get harder.

So from  people who have more experience and wisdom than me, what should I do  here? Would it be in my best interest to reduce to part time and live  off savings? Any knowledge on scholarships or other ways to make school cheaper?

94,"Looking for advice: Is an ""Internal Sales Engineer"" considered engineering experience toward a design position?",1530314131,"I recently graduated and during my job hunt I got contacted by an HVAC company and got an interview right away. I didn't apply, which I thought was strange, but I took the interview to get experience because I have only had a few. They have now offered me an Inside Sales Engineer position. I do not consider myself a sales person, and I want to have a career in design. But, this is my only job offer so far. 

A few Questions:

\-Would you consider time as an ""Inside Sale Engineer"" experience? As in, should I take this job for now and hope it boosts my prospects for applying to the design positions I hope to have in the future, or am I better off continuing my search now with less experience? 

\-If I take this position and continue looking for design opportunities, will looking for something else so quickly be seen across the board as a negative? I understand it is bad practice to join a company and continue a job search, but I see having this job as better than sitting at home. Will a hiring manager see this as flaky, or understand I want to work in their field long-term if they hire me? 

\-Lastly, I have seen in similar posts a lot of ""it is hard to go from sales to design."" This is my main concern. Even if I have every intention of my next job being design and I actively look for those positions, is taking a sales engineering position right after graduation going to limit my opportunities?

A possible solution for providing power to both motors was to take two 12 V batteries and connect them in series to get the 24 V for one motor, then use just one battery from that same set to power the 12 V motors. Throughout the process either the 12 V motors OR the 24 V motors will be running, but they will never run at the same time.   


Is this a bad solution? I know that the single 12 V battery will drain faster than the second one since it is continuously being used.. Any other ideas if this is frowned upon? Also I'm wondering if this would make charging difficult since I could have 1 battery at 10 V and the other still at 11 V when I hook up the charger due to the imbalance in their usage.   


My backup plan is just to find another set of motors that operate at 24 V also as opposed to the current 12 V setup.

What should I do? Skip to the bottom for more specific questions.

Long version:
I'm a younger test engineer working on an ECM system for about two years. A bit over a year ago, I made the mistake of offering to fix a bunch of VBA code that didn't work, and now I'm ""the software guy"". It's gotten bad, to the point that my leadership has tasked me with working on a piece of a much larger application (complete with multiple developers, code review, standards, etc etc) we use that is owned by a sister organization. I'm not happy with this situation, but there are some redeeming factors as well. 

Pros:

 -I'm still called on to run the lab whenever a particularly difficult problem needs solving or non-routine test needs to be designed
     
-The places that I am sent to do remote work and the systems/people I work with while remote are very interesting/fun, but leadership has been giving more of the travel assignments I'd normally get to other engineers since I started working on software

-The job is very easy; I have significantly more motivation than the other government engineers I work with (shocker...), so I'm in a bit of a big fish/small pond situation

Cons:

-I don't think I'm a good developer. The code I have learned is only from absolute necessity, my coding standards have evolved through my time working here (some of my earlier work is just... wow. It's gross), and I've never dealt with any of the difficulties that come with developing software for more than like 10 people to use

-The environment is miserable for coding; it's on a classified system, so I can't move elsewhere, its an open floor pattern office with absolutely blinding overhead lighting, and a good majority of my coworkers like to loudly talk about how great Donald Trump is or how little they think of minorities/millenials/""libruls""/women/anybody who isn't them. 

-I quite enjoy test engineering, but that is becoming a vanishingly small part of my job because ""we need you to work on the code.""

Questions:

Is there any way for me to shift my responsibilities back towards the engineering side of things in my current position?

Is this situation unique to my position, or will I end up being pigeonholed into software at any job I make the mistake of showing capability to do it?

What kinds of things should I do to make myself a more attractive candidate for positions with other employers/in slightly different engineering fields?

Is my environment uniquely bad for software focused positions, or is it standard for the field?

18,Need advice: Estimating the compressive yield strength of abdominal tissues from the data of its rigidity or stiffness constant,1530259995,"Hi,

I am doing research on biomedical device development, and focusing on devices that work on grasping tissues in the abdominal area. I need some help with applying the concepts of material strength to human tissues.

In simple language, let's assume that the stiffness constant (or the spring constant, K) of a given tissue is known, and we assume that it is a constant and hence the compression of the tissue is linearly proportional to the compressive force applied on it.

Given that we know K, is there a way to figure out the upper limit of the Force or the upper limit of the compression I can allow, before the tissue gets damaged? i.e. can we estimate the compressive yield strength of the tissue given that we know its K?

Another small confusion: If we are talking about the point at which tissue damages, is that the point of yield strength or ultimate strength?

I'm familiar with basic solid mechanics and strength of materials on a very beginner level and I'm getting stuck in applying those concepts in the context of biomechanics. Any help in this direction would be really helpful.

PS: This is not Homework help, I work as an RA and I'm stuck at this issue in my research :)

25,Nervous about stepping from engineering to program management,1530244689,"A little background: I'm a mechanical engineer with about 12 years of experience.  The last 7 yrs are at a large aerospace and defense company.  I've worked in the same department the entire time, working my way up through several engineering roles:

* First, as a supporting engineer working under more senior engineers.
* Next, as a more senior engineer leading my own designs/testing.
* Then, a few years handling business development supporting several large sales.
* Currently, as an engineering team lead management a project budget, schedule, and leading \~5 engineers.

Throughout my time in my dept, my managers have dropped hints they see me as one day becoming a manager myself.  In a recent performance review, my managers asked me what I saw as my next step.  They said they're working on succession planning and I'm their top contender the next time an engineering management position opens.

In short, the people who work most closely with me see me as engineer, or, as an engineer managing engineers.  Truthfully, I've always been interested in the product development side of business.  It's where I've spent my entire career and feel most comfortable.

A former manager of mine (now elsewhere in the company) recently pulled me aside.  He works in a customer support organization in program management and business strategy.  His boss is hiring a new Program Manager, interviewed a few candidates, but hasn't found one with the right skill set yet.  I worked with this hiring manager in the past.  He told my boss he liked my work, and asked him to see if I'm interested in the PM position.

Truthfully, its an area of the business I had not ever considered previously.  But looking at this from an opportunity stand-point, it's certainly a great way to gain PM experience in a lower risk side of the business.  The projects are smaller and slower paced, with more forgiving business models.  I know many of the other PMs in the group and they would pair me up with a more senior PM to learn the ropes.

I'm really torn on this decision:

On one hand, I'm very comfortable and happy in my current position.  The organization (product development) is where I've always seen myself staying, and I would be happy moving up the career ladder in that area of the business.

On the other hand, there's no guarantee when a manager job will open in my current group.  This PM position in another area of the business is a good opportunity to push myself outside my comfort zone and grow new skills in lower risk way.

30,"New engineer, I have no idea what's going on, and I think I might get fired. Please help?",1530235263,"**Long version:**

I graduated about a year ago with a Bioengineering degree and I was working as a scientist at a big pharmaceutical company. I've dabbled in programming a bit since college (mainly Python) and since then I've always dreamed of getting a software job. I helped develop a data pipeline at the pharma corp which enabled me to to land a software engineering job at a biotech start up in Silicon Valley area. During the interview, I told them I didn't have most of the skills they required, but that I was highly ambitious and a quick learner. Somehow I got the job, but now I think I might get fired.

It's a really small startup, I'm technically #3 on the software team and I quickly learned that we have a lot of responsibilities including database admin, statistical analysis, pipeline development, network admin, network security, and front/backend app development. Day one, my boss presents me with a document of stuff to go over, most of which I had never used or heard of. 

It included:

* Postgres
* Vue.js, React.js, Node.js
* Scala + (Play Framework)
* R  + (R Shiny Framework)
* Python + (Django, Flask, SQLAlchemy, BioPython)
* AWS, Docker
* Netxflow, Groovy
* Develop a webscraping pipeline tool
* Adding this tool to a docker container into an EC2 instance

My boss has been telling me to socialize more and get to know the research and the scientists. I've tried my best, but honestly I've been pretty much just glued to my computer trying to figure out how to write software. I spent most of the first week reviewing every language/framework there, and developed the webscraping tool in Python. By the middle of the second week I was able to set up an EC2 sever with a docker container and get something going. This week I set up an ORM and a skeletal front/back end test application for the Postgres database. Trying to learn all of these languages, tools, and network infrastructure/architecture has been absolutely daunting. I don't feel like I've had a chance to even begin looking at the actual research, let alone socialize.

To add insult to injury, my boss (Director of Informatics) is probably one of the smartest people I have ever met. I tried asking him for help a few times and the feedback I usually get is so beyond my understanding I just nod my head. I've asked him what is expected of me, and his response usually leaves me more confused than before. He is really busy, but everyday my goals change. Initially we were going to use Docker containers, but now we are using VirtualBox. I was supposed to build a database, but now we are going to use a third-party service. The webscraping tool I built? He built a far more sophisticated one months ago. All of this has left me wondering why my efforts were being directed towards fruitless tasks. 

I really should take him up on the suggestion to socialize more with the scientists, but I've been reluctant because I don't think I can help them. I don't have the programming expertise to just start churning out apps on whim. I spent most of yesterday setting up login authentication with the skeletal web app I made, but he basically made it seem like I was an idiot for doing this because it didn't use LDAP.  The worst part is I just started using React and Node and learning about authentication methods yesterday, so I really had no idea what I was doing. I was just trying to show him what I had been working on. The consensus was that everything I have been working on has been a complete waste of time. 

I almost feel like my peers are looking down on me and don't want to work with me. They are mainly PhDs and/or 10-20 years of experience in industry. I can't contribute much in their world, and I know this. Today I could tell my boss was really disappointed with how little I know and how little I've accomplished. The whole thing is soul crushing, but what did they expect?  I barely have a year of industry experience, and I don't even come from a software background. They knew this, and the pay, which is definitely lower than most software engineers in this area, also reflects that. 

I'm trying really hard, but I think they are looking at ways to get rid of me. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this? I've been so stressed that I've barely slept in almost 3 weeks. I don't know what to do, I know this area is hyper competitive, but after today's meeting I'm feeling absolutely defeated. Any advice would be appreciated.

**Short Verison:**

* New software engineer job
* &lt;1 year of industry experience
* Immense responsibilities, little support or guidance
* Unsure of my expectations
* Feeling like I'm underperforming

I've been there for seven and a half years and I am starting to get the feeling that it is time to move on. 

The purpose of my post is to ask for advice on how to get a job in another state and how to manage the move. 


There is what I do: 

I design machines from scratch, mostly one-off prototypes, very specifically made to do quality control on a customer's part, usually an automotive part. 

Not only do I start the project from scratch, do all the 3D modeling, release drawings to manufacturing, sometimes also take part in assembling, wiring and/or plumbing the machine. 

Once the machine ships, often internationally (mostly in North America), I travel to the factory, assist in the installation and train the operators, supervisors, etc. on the usage of the machine. 


Here's why I want to change setting: 

The company I work for is very small, and thus I am one of two guys that mainly travel to customer factories. 

I manage the Engineering team so any small outing causes great delays and stress in my normal work / routine. 

Every large, complicated design for a customer or internal improvement / redesign falls on me. 


This is what I would like to do: 

I'd like to (and my wife supports me in this) find a job in a state south of here, with milder weather (due to some health issues) and a place where housing can be more affordable. We have considered Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, etc. 

Our current apartment lease will end in May 2019 so we are considering it would be best to move around that time. 


This is what I would like advice on: 

Applying for the job and sending my resume should be easy. 

What makes me uneasy is thinking about traveling out of state for an interview and then if I get the job, moving there, finding housing, etc.
 

These are my questions: 

What considerations do I need to keep in mind in this situation? 

What are things I need to prepare for now to accomplish a smooth transition? 

What can I ask of my future employer so they can assist me in some way?  

Are those states good choices for what I do or are there better options?

From my understanding, organic corrosion inhibitors are applied to certain substrates (copper, aluminum, steel, etc.) to prevent corrodents from damaging the substrate material. I've read plenty of articles that discuss corrosion inhibitors being tested on substrates in presence of inorganic acids (HCl, HF, etc) which act as corrodents. Typically, most of these articles discuss (or imply) that corrosion inhibitors adsorb onto the surface of the substrate and effectively protect the substrate that way. However, what would happen if the substrate were gold and in the presence of aqua regia. Would an organic corrosion inhibitor work to prevent gold from being dissolved? If so, what types of organic corrosion inhibitors could work? I'm specifically trying to find articles discussing organic corrosion inhibitors used in conjunction with precious metals in an inorganic acid (possibly aqua regia) environment.

I am a high school student. I have an idea for a gear system that does specific purpose. I need to simulate it on computer first.

52,"The ""I'm interested in moving to Japan"" FAQ/AMA",1530192297,"I hosted an AMA somewhere else and it got more responses than I thought it would.

I'm going to leave some FAQs here, but feel free to ask away.

I am an American engineer at AmaAppGooBookSoft in Japan.

(Amazon or Apple or Google or Facebook or Microsoft). I transferred here from the US after working a year or so there. At the time of this writing, I have been in Tokyo for about 3 years.

Answers from OP with regards to things related to work will be in the context of these kinds of big software companies.

I would encourage others who live in Japan that are qualified to answer questions to do so! Wish I had this info before I transferred.

**Q: How is the pay, hours?**

A: Hours are super normal like they were in the US. Wfh, etc is like the US...but might vary by manager. I knew a designer whose Japanese boss was not on the wfh boat.  
Pay is terrible. Entry level engineer initial offer was 7.5M yen w/5k USD stock per year. I negotiated up to 8.25M base pay.  
Currently mid-level engieer and at about 9.5M yen and 15k USD/year (\~105k USD total?).  
This is offset somewhat by affordable housing. Think 1.5k USD for a decent apartment, but smaller. Also health insurance is part of taxes, so you don't need to pay extra for it. Train commute is paid for by company. Don't need a car, either. It's a very livable salary, tbh.

**Q: How is the dating scene for internationals? Are Japanese people open to dating people from other races? What about LGBTQ?**

A: I'd say definitely. I met my wife here. If you are particularly looking for a date, dating apps and goukon (group dating) is a good way to go. As far as LGBTQ, yeah, for sure! Shinjuku ni cho me is the place for you (and also dating apps). (新宿二丁目)

**Q: Do you like cost of living better in Tokyo than the states?**

A: Yes!  
My total taxes are about 25&amp;#37; of my gross monthly salary and that includes health insurance. Clinics are insanely cheap because the government regulates the cost of medicine and pays 70&amp;#37; of your medical bills.  
I was once in the hospital for a week in a private room and it costed about 2500 USD. I opted for the fancy private room, though.  
My wife gave birth and it costed 2k or so. She had a private room in a hospital with amazing food for a week. I was allowed to stay in the room as well and got food.  
Rent is reasonable (1.5k or so) for a 700sqft place.  
Things that annoy me:  
Albums are like, 30 bucks.  
New release 4k Blu Ray movies range from 60-85 bucks.  
Old non-4k Blu Ray movies cost about 35-40 bucks.  
Groceries are a bit more expensive, but the quality is worth it. Our monthly food budget for 2 adults is about 800 bucks a month.  
Restaurants are very cheap. Like, 8-10 bucks for lunch. Usually under 1000 yen.

**Q: I heard Japanese can be racists towards non Japanese living in Japan. True?**

A: True! To some degree.  
I had the best resume a realtor had ever seen:  
N1 fluency in Japanese.  
I studied at the ""Harvard of Japan"" for a year.  
5 year visa (longest duration).  
High paying job at a huge company.  
Stable work history.  
5/6 landlords didn't give a shit. ""no gaijin"".  
You will also not receive service at probably 95&amp;#37; of ""adult... services"", if you're into that.  
When I was in college, a few part time jobs I applied to straight up told me they didn't hire foreigners.  
But once you're settled in, it's not that noticeable. Your average encounter will be pretty friendly. I'd say it's more rare to experience it.

**Q: Do you know any Japanese? How essential is it in your wok and your daily life?**

A: I am N1 level fluent.  
But I was dismayed that all that studying didn't mean anything for work, haha. Most engineers are foreigners. Everyone speaks English at the office and they have to know it because the code base is in English.  
Daily life, I use it all the time. My wife doesn't speak English as well as I speak Japanese.  
I also know several people who don't speak at all, and they seem to get by. Companies will often pay for Japanese classes as well, and let you attend during work hours.

**Q: Did you just apply for Tokyo positions? How did the visa work?**

A: Yup! I just applied.  
Visa was taken care of by a company hired by my employer. Mine was tricky because I didn't major in CS. There is a law that a work visa applicant must have a degree related to the field of work, or have 10 years experience.  
Since I majored in Japanese, they added ""required to translate Japanese in addition to coding"" to the job description, and boom. Visa. (I ended up doing semi-voluntary stuff like office hours in addition to my engineering work, where I needed to use Japanese)  
They'll figure it out, whatever the case is.

**Q: Did you start working in Japan after graduation or moved from the US? Is it easy to get permanent residence if you wanted?**

A: I transferred internally after a year or so in the US.  
PR is very attainable under certain circumstances. There is a point system. You get points for age (younger is better), salary, work experience, and Japanese ability. 80 points means that you only have to live in Japan for a year to get PR. 70 points, 3 years.

[http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact\_3/en/evaluate/index.html](http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_3/en/evaluate/index.html)

Look at the Excel sheet and find the tab for regular workers (not researchers or business owners).

**Q: How comfortable is your life there compared to the US? Does money go further?**

A: Very comfortable. If you buy a place (and have permanent residence), you're looking at interest rates as low as 0.495&amp;#37; (mine).  
I have a 500k USD condo and I pay about 1300/month. 33 year loan. Plus about 350/month in maintenance for the building.  
Groceries are a bit more expensive, but worth it.  
Restaurants are much cheaper. Like, 800-1000 yen for lunch. Monthly grocery budget for 2 adults is about 800 bucks (my situation, not counting baby expenses).  
Convenience stores are AMAZING and have great food (for a convenience store). I regularly get a crispy lettuce sandwich, onigiri and can Coffee for breakfast at the shop outside work.  
Spending power is pretty low, though. Most consumer goods are really expensive. New release 4k Blu Ray is about 65-80 bucks. Old Blu Rays (Disney and marvel as examples) are 35-40 bucks.  
But Netflix and Hulu are here and have American and some Japanese content.  
Internet speed is awesome. Gigabit in most places. But apps and Japanese webforms are fucking terrible. Most things feel like the state of the internet 10 or 15 years ago. One of my banks prevents you from using special characters for your password. Swear to God.  
A lot of foreigners find it difficult to get a credit card. Especially if you are under 30. Just got to UFJ Mitsubishi. Open an account and you can get a debit card you can use online.  
All in all, I love it here (aside from work - projects I don't want to work on and a low salary compared to the US).  
We live 5 minutes from a major train station, which means 5 minutes to dozens of restaurants, a handful of grocery stores, some pharmacies, a few clinics, and a mall.

**Q: I heard it was easy to internally transfer to Japan (or anywhere with the pay cut) but extremely hard to transfer back to the US so people might get stuck overseas. Is this true? Oh and supposedly transferring to tends to be a promotion +1 level or potentially 2 whereas from leads to a demotion?**

A: I don't think this is true at all. I know a few people who have gone back.

I also did not go up when I came to Japan, and I know people who moved to the US and they did not move down.  


  
**Q: Is there any American things you miss while in Japan?**

A: American internet. God, Japan is so technologically behind it drives me nuts sometimes. It's like the internet from 10-15 years ago. Apps suck. Japanese websites suck. Internet banking and apps suck. One of my banks \*prevents\* you from using special characters in your password.  
Streaming services exist, but they're not anywhere near as ubiquitous as they are in the US.  
I also miss how cheap Blu-rays are. 35 bucks for Zootopia? Come on.

Internet is shitty, but FAST, though. Gigabit everywhere.

**Q: The idea of working abroad is pretty novel. Sounds like you have no regrets about the time you spent there?**

A: Yes!! I'd definitely do it again, but I might have waited until I had been mid-level engineer for a year or more. The 2 rounds of paycuts was rough. First was base pay, then a surprise paycut when my US stock grants fully vested. Went from expected value of 30k/year to new grants at expected value of 5k.  
There is a lot to love about Tokyo. The positives far outweigh the negatives.

**Q: Visiting Japan soon, what do you recommend doing at night that is friendly to gaijins in Tokyo/Shibuya? I’ve heard a lot of bars/clubs are no gaijins.**

A: I would say that's probably rarer. Shinjuku has a good bar scene where you can do some serious bar hopping. If you are super concerned about getting turned away (a really terrible experience. It's really a shitty feeling), then stick to Roppongi! You may also find some ladies (or men) there that are very into foreigners.  
Shibuya also has quite a few clubs that are foreigner friendly. There's even a soapland that caters specifically to foreigners, if you want that experience. It's in Kawasaki, I think it's called paradise inn.  
The most tourist-ey thing is ""robot restaurant"" (also in Shinjuku). I took my American boss there on a business trip (before I moved here) and he fucking loved it.  
Sky tree or Tokyo tower are also great at night.

**Q: Do you have any take on how big the cryptocurrency craze is or was there compared to United States? Do you own any bitcoin personally?**

A: I haven't been into the crypto scene. But I think it's more known here. There's even a few big name stores that accept bitcoin. Don't remember which ones, but they charge like, 20&amp;#37; more if you pay in BC. I don't own any, though.

**Q: Is AmaAppGooBookSoft japan mostly for SDEs? Or is there place for us non engineering muggles?**

A: Lol, Muggles.  
Yes!! There are TPMs, SDMs, UX designers, etc. But the more you get into the business side (vendor managers, TAM, site merchandiser, etc), the more you will probably be required to speak and be literate in Japanese.

**Q: What made you move to japan for an engineering role? Never heard that before.**

A: I've wanted to live in Japan since I was a teenager. Spent a year there in University and 2 exchanges in highschool. Originally I just wanted to live in Japan. So after I graduated, I did a few interviews for English teaching. After one of the interviews, they asked me to prepare a lesson plan. My immediate reaction was, ""I don't care about a lesson plan, I just want to live in Japan!""  
Then I realized I needed to calm the fuck down and get there by doing something that I like, and with a marketable skill. I just didn't know what that skill would be...I landed a shit temp job testing Japanese games. Ended up getting an automatable task and googled how to automate it. Then found what I wanted to do. Got into AmaAppGooBookSoft as a contractor, interviewed and got FTE, then made my way to Japan internally.

**Q: I speak 0 japanese will this be a huge issue? Also if I am a mid-level engineer in usa how much equivalent jp total compensation should I be looking for?**

A: Not an issue at all for work. Most of the engineers are foreigners. You'll also be able to get by out in the real world. But I'd suggest taking Japanese classes. Company will pay for it here.  
That would probably equate to maybe 9.5M-110M yen and about 15-20k in RSUs per year? I have zero knowledge of the pay bands here, but I believe 200k is just above middle for US? I make about 9.5, but I have no idea where that is in the pay band. Whatever they offer you, negotiate for more. Always negotiate.  
It is plenty to live on. You can get a nice place for 150,000/month and a nicer place for 200,000/month. If you want to live further from work or get a smaller place you could get rent as low as 80,000/month, with a 30 minute train ride. Restaurants are very cheap for lunch. Maybe 700-1100 for lunch? Very cheap compared to the states. Company will pay for your daily commute fees. Spending power is low, though. Media is really expensive. Do some searches on Amazon Japan for common stuff to get an idea.  
FYI, my take home is about 600,000/month to give you an idea about taxes. No need to pay for health insurance plans. The government has you covered.  
In a month, I spend 144,000 on mortgage, 36,000 on maintenance, about 15,000 on electric + gas (total), about 3,000 on water, about 5,000 on internet, about 80,000 on food for 2 adults, 60,000 for ""allowance"" for myself and wife, 3,000 on phone (LINE mobile!!! If you go through SoftBank or docomo, or other big players, expect 10,000/month), about 150,000 on miscellaneous stuff, and try to save the rest.  
Let me know if I'm missing anything expense you are thinking of.

**Q: 1. Do you know if unvested stocks earned in the US keep vesting in the US? 2. Understand that salary is lower, but are savings about the same in terms of dollars?**

A: 1. GREAT question!! Yes!! Stock that was granted in the states continues to vest at the agreed to schedule. It will still be 100&amp;#37; taxed by the US, but you'll get some of it back. Taxes are such that the fraction of time spent in a country during a vest will determine how much tax goes to that country.  
Example: you have a 2 year vest and transfer with the last year vesting while you are in Japan. Once it vests, US takes the usual tax rate, but should return about half of that back because half of it was ""earned"" in Japan. Japan will then apply their tax rate to the other half.  
2. No, savings is still less. Because cost of living isn't toooo drastically different, but you make a lot less,you really end up taking a bath on savings.  
Like, currently for my family of 3, we end up saving about 700 USD a month in cash. In the states, it would be about the same (after 3k rent and a 1k car payment...Tesla, baby), we would end up saving about the same in cash (except we'd also pad our ""allowance"" by an additional total of 700 bucks). Then you look at stock. 15k gross value in the RSUs in Japan vs 30-50k in the US. Pretty big difference, IMO.

**Q: So if you don't speak any Japanese,  could you still make it in terms of acquiring a visa?**  
If so, how long would it take to acquire intermediate level proficiency in Japanese you think?

A: Yes, but you'll need a degree from the sciences, probably. Or 10 years experience.  
Intermediate level is maybe 1200 hours of study?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language\_Proficiency\_Test#Estimated\_study\_time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test#Estimated_study_time)

**Q: How do you feel about ""Cool Biz"" campaign and what is the general public opinion about it?**

A: Hard to tell because I work at a US company. I'm shielded from a lot of stuff like that. 28 C is a terribly hot temperature, though, Jesus.  
I don't really hear it being brought up that much on the morning talk shows, but I don't watch every day. Wish I could be of more help.  
It's definitely not 28 degrees in my office. We absolutely have AC because we don't want our employees to needlessly suffer in order to scrape a bit off of our electric bill.

**Q: Why did you wanna go to Japan in the first place?**

A: It started with martial arts when I was in elementary school. Always liked Japanese food, and in high school, anime, judo, and Japanese language. But when I started studying the language, I got super into it. I've been aiming to live here since I was a teenager been 10 times before moving including a few study abroads (1 year in college, 2 weeks, and another 2 weeks in HS).  
I've always liked the craftsmanship that is in Japan. Watch Jiro dreams of sushi. Perfectly captures the ""shokunin"" spirit. That guy is like 90 and he still chases perfection. There are LOTS of examples of this, but I love that about Japan.  
And Tokyo is just super convenient. Trains go everywhere in the country. Don't need a car. I live 5 minutes from Meguro station. So 5 minutes away from 5 grocery stores, 2 or 3 clinics, a few dentists, a mall, transportation of course, and dozens of restaurants. Love the convenience here.

**Q: How do the taxes work for US citizen? Do US citizens pay taxes twice for income earned in Japan (once in Japan and again in US)?**

A: Taxes are relatively simple. You pay taxes to Japan, you report income to the US. I think once your income exceeds a certain amount (100 some odd thousand), you will be taxed on the difference of that minus taxes to Japan. So, like if the amount was 100k and you made 110k, they'd tax you if the taxes you paid to Japan on that 10k were less than the US would have taxed. But it's the diff. So if the US would have taken 3k of that 10k, but Japan took 2k, you'd owe the US 1k. So it's not that bad.  
Stock is way more complicated because it depends on where you were for the duration of the vest and where it was granted. For example, I had a 4 year vest and moved to Japan in year 3. The third year, I had ""earned"" that 2 years in the US and 1 in Japan. So the US took more taxes. I mean, the second it vests, the US takes their full tax rate, but they'll give a bunch back at tax season. And Japan will take some of that. You usually come out on top somehow. Like, last year, I had 60k or something vesting. I got back 12k from the US and had to pay Japan 5k. The US had initially taken about 16k of that 60k. The percentage of tax paid depends on how long you were in a given country during the vest. Negotiate a tax accountant into your contract. My employer uses another company and I don't have calculate all this shit. I only know it because I want to know how it works, so I ask my accountants a bunch of annoying questions.  
Once you start getting grants in Japan, no money is taken at vest, and you pay Japan for taxes on the vest value in January.

**Q: My wife and Iove Japan very much, we’ve always talked about “living there for some years”. However we have 2 kids (less than 3 years) and I’m concerned it would be hard for them. Since you mentioned that your kid, do you think moving there is a bad idea ?**

A: It depends. If you are already doing parenting on hard mode instead of support network mode, I think it won't be much different.  
I know someone who went from Tokyo back to the US, but moved back for the same reason: lack of support.  
I think it would be harder on you than them. Just make sure you bring English books and media.

56,Considering relocating for a small company. Unsure about salary.,1530187212,"Hello,

I'm a mechanical engineer in Florida with two years of professional experience, some school projects and manufacturing experience. A very small company in Colorado recently interviewed me for a Jr engineer position and there seems to be a lot of mutual interest. I feel that my background makes me a really good fit for a small company like them. I also think I would develop a lot and be exposed to much more opportunity than in the current mega giant corporation that I am currently in.

That said, cost of living in the Denver area is just crazy, and trends only show it getting worse. Typical rent is twice as high as what I'm currently paying, so it would seem that I will be hard pressed to maintain my current quality of life. Glassdoor and Salary.com show salary data that is all over the place, but none of those numbers actually maintain my current finances.

I like these guys and I think they are doing some exciting stuff, so I don't want to sit here and play hard ball with them. But I have student debt and a car to pay off, and I'm not too keen on giving up my hobbies. I've lived in Colorado before and I know I love it there, but there is little to gain from moving to where all the mountain bike trails are, if you can't afford the bike.

57,What exactly happens while over revving an engine,1530184381,"Hey guys,
I just read an article about runaway diesels and discussed it with a friend.
Now I have two questions I can't really answer:
First when you have a runaway diesel and it revs up, would it be smarter to wait until the fuel, whatever it uses, is empty or shift in a gear?
I think, if the engine revs for under 5 minutes it wouldn't make too much damage to the car and if you shift in a gear like the first one, I guess it would make some heavy damage to the transmission and engine because of the engines momentum which would be neutralized instantly.
Second question:
The Rev limiter would obviously not work and the engine overrevs.
I don't understand how the engine can destroy itself with overrevving.
I read that the valves could touch the pistons but how?
I mean the pistons are connected to the crankshaft and the valves to the camshaft.
Both shafts are mechanically connected via a chain.
So how is it even possible that they could touch if its mechanically not possible? ",AskEngineers,False,gasdasgassad,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8uiclj/what_exactly_happens_while_over_revving_an_engine/

63,Is it possible to convert a dehumidifier into an air conditioner?,1530157521,"I bought for $10 an old dehumidifier.  Problem is, right now it's pretty hot out, and while it works like a beast to remove humidity, its pumping lots of extra heat into my room.

I have it taken apart, and it's very basic.  A beefy compressor, to the condenser wound about a big radiator, then onto a fat evaporator coil, then back to the compressor.

There's a fan at the front.  It draws air from the back of the unit so that it passes over the evaporator coil, then cools the condenser, then is pushed out the front of the unit.

My question is, would it be possible to convert this dehumidifier into an air conditioner?  

I'm thinking of putting a divider plate between the evaporator and the condenser, and giving the evaporator its own fan to blow indoor air over it to cool the air.  Then I would isolate the condenser side of things, and have the fan draw air from outside to blow over the condenser radiator, and exhaust outside.  

Right now air passes through the whole system, and water is collected.   I want to know whether isolating these two systems, and pushing the hot air outside, would work.

I think its a long shot, but I was curious as to your feedback on what are my chances of success, and why.

85,Bullying from client within industry,1530127957,"TLDR: Victim is wife, Client claimed quote price was was too high based on years of experience, humble bragged that he would have given her lots of work, says he will talk to original contact. Tell her to fight or to brush it off?.

Back round:

Wife is drafter for eng. firm, she does drafting on the side for small builder or home owners for extra dough, she started off at 22-24/hr and now charges approx. 30. 5+ years experience.  Roles include: measuring, drafting, dealing with municipalities (permits and forms), and making look good. Proficient with 3D, Revit and CAD

Friend (male) from wife's hobby says he knows a guy who is looking for Drafter and would recommend her.

Notes:

Guy calls wife, he appears to be a project manager with drafting skills?, wife says her fee is 30, he hmms and hasss and says based on her experience he will offer her 25$.  (sends email to put in writing)

She says lowest she can go is 28$ (she already has a full time job (Eng. firm) plus works part time  as a clerk making 28$), she says its not worth going below that amount. Plus if she lowers her fee she needs a min. agreement of 3 jobs at estimated 6 hours per job.  She sends him info for another drafter friend who has more experience.  

**He sends email back that he doesn't believe she should be charging so high and he was doing her a favor offering her 25.  He humble brags that he always has 15 - 20 jobs on the go and would have given her 1 - 2 jobs per week and would keep her busy, ""too bad that you declined that offer"".  Also he has spoken with original guy to keep him in the loop as to what has happened. The worst part is that he mansplains:  In this business, it's all about building relationships and constant referrals from clients, contractors and work colleagues.** 

My opinion:

If he was in the industry and was genuinely just looking for a drafter, if he heard her price and thought it was too high, response should have been: price was high but good chatting, hope you have a good day. Done.  If he wanted to negotiate and still didn't like the terms, fine, good day, no response required.  Based on the language he is using in the email he is clearly trying to make her feel low/worthless.  I feel like he is just trying to put her down because she is a chick, he has no other information about how fast she works, what she can do, understanding what client/municipality is looking for etc.

Recommendations:

Should i suggest to my wife to just brush the guy off, or ask her to respond and stand up to the bully?

Electrophysiologist-in-training here. I've recorded neurons in the brain receiving spontaneous inputs from other nearby cells.

What I've done is binned the histogram into fine intervals (0.0001 pA) and taken an [FFT (please click to see graph)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ivbsa660ins4lj7/WhatWouldMakeThis.jpg?dl=0). When I look at the spectral power, I get lovely spikes at what could be my quantal response interval (presumably the lowest ""Frequency"" is my quantal interval. However, I'm seeing a good deal of what looks like harmonic responses.

My question is: Why? Is this just a property of a powerful low frequency signal and I should ignore these other harmonic bands?

78,Curie temperature of permanent magnet,1529876601,"Hello Reddit,

I'm using a permanent magnet along with an electromagnet in order to hold an object in place (resisting gravity). Eg imagine a piece of plastic with the permanent magnet glued on top of it, being held a foot above the ground by an electromagnet (electromagnet and permanent magnet making contact - when electromagnet is turned off, the plastic piece falls to the ground).

I'm curious of the effects of temperature on this - The magnet I am using is https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=DA3-N52 in which it says the 'max operating temp' is 176 Fahrenheit.

From what I've seen online, it looks like that is the 'curie temperature' in which the magnet will lose it's magnetism. This is good, because I wanted a safeguard in place in which the magnet falls from the electromagnet in the case that the temperature gets too high (it's used in a high temp application). Eg the safeguard is that if the plastic melting point is 400 Fahrenheit, the plastic would fall to the ground (away from the heat source I have) before the plastic melts.

However, when I just held a magnet above a small flame I expected it to lose it's magnetism. I just had the magnet attached to a wrench (held simply by it being magnetic), and placed pretty much on top of a small flame. I would think the temp easily exceeded the 176, but the magnet did not fall from the wrench.

Do permanent magnets have a curie point, or is it just ferromagnetic material (eg if the wrench was 176 degrees, then the permanent magnet wouldn't be attracted to it).

85,CCGT power plant - How does IBH valve work at part load?,1529859129,"Hello everybody,

forgive my poor english, I'm italian and need of your hint.  
I'm not sure I understood working conditions of IBH valve.  
Correct me if I'm wrong plz...

IBH valve allows a re-circulation of inlet air flow. This is bleeded from one of the last steps of compressor. So this hotter mass flow rate avoids ice formation and protects the compressor by surge.

Is it?

Now, I have a very HUGE doubt.  
In addition to these functions, in CCGT power plant, IBH often is used to optimize operating modes at part load.

I understand that opening IBH valve increases air inlet temperature, so the temperature of flue gases exiting gas turbine raises as well as HP steam generation rate in HRSG.

But how is it possible?

Indeed I think that if the air inlet temperature raises, its mass flow rate decreases and at the same way exhaust gas flow decreases. Can higher temperature of flue gases leads to increase HP stream generation although exhaust gas flow decreases?

I hope I make myself clear enough.

So my end plan is to break out of the industry, eventually get my masters in mechanical engineering. However, I need a plan in the meantime.

I had an internship at a nuclear power plant while I was in college. I've been working for about a year on a ""nuclear"" project.

11,Question about sketchy building practices at summer camp.,1529775235,"I worked at a summer camp and at the camp they build all their own structures. The structures range from a large hay barn to a small house. They also build large towers, 30 ft high, with zip lines attached  and ropes courses. My concern is with the questionable structural integrity of the buildings. It doesn't seem that they get their buildings inspected by professional structural engineers. 

The reason I say this is that they have their camp counselors help them build the structures and I was part of that operation. While I was part of the operation, the main henchman who runs all the building operations was jacking up the base of a massive house. This was all occurring while we were inside the building and there were cracking noises and above us was a huge horizontal support beam that had a diameter of around 3-3.5 ft.  I could see the support beam physically moving. The henchman told me that the building sinks a couple inches every year and that he does this every summer. He proceeded to put a large stump under the area he jacked up and then let the building rest on the stump. As he lowered the jack the stump cracked and was visibly crushed but didn't completely lose its shape. 

Next the main boss, one of the owners of the camp, came by to see how everything was going. During down time he would ask me questions about where I was going to college and what I was majoring  in. I told him I was a mechanical engineering major. Then he asked me if that type of engineering was similar to a structural engineer and I told him that civil engineers and mechanical engineers take similar classes the first two years of the program. After I told him that, he started to speak to his henchman about how they needed to get a structural engineer out here to inspect this building. The henchman looked at him with raised eyebrows, as if the henchman was thinking what the hell are you talking about, scoffed and said ""Structural engineer?"" This was done in such a way that indicated to me that they had never had anyone inspect their structures before. 

There was also another instance where a person on the zip line ended up piercing their leg with a branch. When the henchman and the owner were discussing the incident while I was around, the henchman made the joke that they were due for a death soon. They played the incident off as just part of the job and not some form of neglect. My friend, who still works there, has experienced similar situations. He was even told to go under a large structure and jack it up himself. They also put together an amalgamation of structures for a haunted house type of event during the fall. Thousands of people walk and run through those structures every fall. It just all seems unsafe and that someone will end up dying who doesn't need to.

So onto my question, is there anyway I can make sure that they are getting their structures inspected? Is there some type of report or complaint I can file?

My issue is, after a year out of the service, I'm bored plus I miss traveling for work.

I got my degree from NC State while I was in. It is in Business Administration - Human Resources. I got it because it was kind of broad and I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. Also, I was in combat arms, and in the field a lot. This degree had a decent amount of classes that I didn't need to delve deep into, though I'm not saying it's useless or non-interesting.

Anyway, my last year in the Army, I was injured. I got lucky and worked with our corp of engineers for most of it. I got to work with a lot of civilians on the I&amp;C side of things and it really interested me. I almost reapplied to state for engineering but the truth is, I've taken elements of calculus and I struggled a decent amount with it. I had to use tutors every week.

Initially I reported to the COO.  We have a fantastic relationship to the point that I'm still going to have some leadership training and mentorship growth opportunities working with my COO.  However, as time has passed, my COO realized that they were acting as a go-between to help me allocate resources and build a work flow and project management template.

39,I'm having problems with permanent magnets and pulling force equation. Looking to see if I'm using the wrong equation.,1529684971,"I've recently been asked to make a Matlab simulation of magnets that takes the magnets size and **basic** shape, and yields the pulling force. I'm having some difficulty with though.

The eventual goal is to try to get numbers similar to real world values, using sites like K&amp;J Magnetics as a reference points. Obviously real world numbers are never going to match simulation values exactly, but I'd like to just be in the ball park. [This online calculator](https://www.frenergy.com.au/magnetcalc.php) from frenergy does exactly that. On the smaller magnets (such as the 1/16"" inch cube magnet) it overestimates, but as you use larger magnets it gets more and more accurate. We're hoping to use my matlab script to build upon later so sadly ""just use their calculator"" isn't an option.

Using [these equations](https://www.supermagnete.de/eng/faq/How-do-you-calculate-the-magnetic-flux-density) I find the Magnet Flux Density (B) of the magnet. My numbers match the online calculator close enough that I'm happy with it (less than 10% difference usually. I'm assuming the calculator takes into account more things such as coating and possibly uses a different B_r value than I do for N42 magnets). There's where the similarity ends though.

After finding B I plug it into [Maxwell's Pulling Force Equaiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet#Pull_force_of_a_single_magnet) F = B\^2/*Area/2\*mew_0 where mew_0 is a constant.As I find B in Tesla, Area is meters squared, and mew_0 is T*meter/Amp it works out to yielding Newtons.

And I get no where near the value that the calculator above gets, or the real values for K&amp;J magnets. I know I'm doing maxwell's pulling force equation correctly because there are online calculators for it [such as this one](https://www.engineersedge.com/calculators/magnet-lifting/magnetic_force_calculator.htm) from engineersedge and if I give my matlab script the same B and area as that calculator I get the same value.

So, to make sure I'm not crazy I then went frenergy's calculator and gave it some dimensions. I found the area by the hand (Length /* Width) and plugged the flux density it yielded and that area in engineersedge's calculator and do **not** get the same force that frenergy's calculator yields.

So, I'm left wondering if I'm using the wrong equation. I feel as though either the B that I'm finding isn't the B that's supposed to go into Maxwell's equation, or I'm not supposed to Maxwell's equation for this situation. So I'm going back to square one and I'm asking you all what equations are correct for this situation:

A rectangular block permanent is sitting on top of an infinitely large steel plate. Provided you are told the length, width, and depth of the magnet, its type (N42, N52, etc), and the width of the air gap, how do you find the force required to separate the two.",AskEngineers,False,ashlacon,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8t2oui/im_having_problems_with_permanent_magnets_and/

45,Cavitation in reaction turbines (high school student),1529674615,"Hey guys. Im a high school student who wants to study engineering. I really like turbines and I have been reading a lot about them.

I have been reading about cavitation and draft tubes. I understand there are different types of draft tubes. 

So my first question is 1) which draft tube is more likely to cause cavitation and why? Are draft tubes outlet always at the same level of the trail race or can be submerged?

Another question is about this thing I read:

&gt; In reaction turbines like Kaplan or Francis, both pressure and kinetic energy are used to make the rotor run. At the exit of the runner of these turbines, there is a negative pressure developed which is less than the atmospheric pressure. So to improve the work done this kinetic energy is converted to pressure energy again by the means of the draft tube.

Ok so... We use kinetic energy and pressure to make the rotor run. Cool I get that (sorta lol).  So after the runner (runner=rotor right?) theres a negative pressure and this is what can cause cavitation correct? 

2) So how does the draft tube deals with this negative pressure to make the fluid flow and discharge?

3) It also says that the draft tube improves the work done by converting kinetic energy into pressure energy. But how does the draft tube improves work done if the draft tube comes after the rotor (where work is done)?

Anyway sorry if these questions are silly or if I didnt know how to properly ask them.

*Ref Text : Chap 10 of Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design 9th ed*

So per the calculation, I get **42.71 lbf/in**, however when I checked with a spring force gauge, I get  **64 lbf/in** (which is what we spec it to). What am I missing? I double checked with an [online calculator](https://www.thespringstore.com/spring-rate-calculator.html), and they got **60.809 lbf/in** According to their site, the only thing different is they used Poison's Ratio of Material to find G. since it's given in the textbook I'm using, I omitted that but the values are relatively close to one another (Book : 11.75 Mpsi, Website : 11.5 Mpsi). Even still, that only changes my result to 41.8 lbf/in, so I don't think that's it.

25yo UK Chemical and Process PhD student (Undergraduate - Mech Engineering) due to submit by the end of September 2018 and looking for some post phd career advice. 

Past month been looking for jobs etc. One of my supervisors offered me a post doc (starting in July, alongside my write up in the medical injection moulding field), 2 year contract, around 33k salary. However, after going for a recent job interview, a relatively small IM consultancy (growing/expanding and working with some big companies) have offered me a job as a simulation engineer (originally applied for a IM process technician role but said I didn't have enough experience). Did mention I could work alongside the process technician role occasionally and gain some more hands on experience though but salary is 6k less. Very keen on hiring me and are willing to wait until Sept/oct before I start. 

I don't see my self staying in academia long term.

I considered maybe doing the post doc for a year or two and applying for grad schemes at larger companies (jlr / rolls royce / bae etc) but I guess im a bit past grad schemes? but I don't see how else I could get into such companies.

I passed the fe because it was a joke and got my EIT in CA.

College is hard when you wake up every morning assuming its your last day alive so obviously I didnt do very well, got a 2.5 gpa and made 0 friends so I cant network much at all, almost 0 people in my class know my name or even recognize my face, a few people from my project class maybe will recognize me, I messaged a few on linkedin and 1 gave me a referral which was nice even though nothing came of it. I mostly use indeed and my schools website to find jobs, I apply to mechE manufacturingE and aerospace, internships and engineer positions. I have reviewed my resume at the career center and done practice interviews. My resume is fine, obv not good but its ok.

I feel like I do fine in my interviews, not perfect but I definitely do not do poorly, I am a great speaker and I like to think I am somewhat intelligent and know my stuff decently. my last interview the person that interviewed me went to my school, did the same senior project and had a lot of the same professors that we reminisced over, I dont see how it could have gone better but I still didnt get the job...

What I am doing now obviously isnt working so I need to try something different cause I am not going to survive much longer and want to know what else I can do as a last ditch effort to get a job. I have no friends and my parents have given up on me so I cant get help from anyone, I have asked my career counselor from my school for help but they cant do much but resume review and practice interviews. 

If I dont get a job by the end of the summer im just going to kill myself as I have no reason to live because I completely failed myself and I have no way of ever getting to a place in my life that is satisfactory (I am an atheist and existential nihilist so I dont believe in any purpose to life so living and not living is completely irrelevant). even if by some miracle I get a job it will probably be shit and I am so impossibly far behind my peers I will never ever be able to catch up or even get a decent job so it isnt worth trying.

So question is what else can I do to find a job? Internships are hard to come by as most only want students and I dont have the experience for a non-intership position. if there is anything else I should try to do that im not doing let me know, I am going to give it one last shot this summer.

Programming an Excel spreadsheet with all of the wind factors and finding a way to make it applicable to every shape house just seems an incredibly daunting task for me right now.  Maybe there are shortcuts I haven't been told about, but just programming the Cp factors into my spreadsheet took me about two hours (getting the curve regressions and all of the if() statements, etc).

Enercalc works pretty well, but it seems a little jumbled.  You have to go to the wind section to do one calc.  Then you have to go to the seismic.  Then you have to draw your house walls to get the torsional forces.  Then you have to draw all of your shear walls with openings.  After all that, it still doesn't size the hold downs &amp; straps.  I guess that's not a big deal, but it's an extra hand calc that would be nice to not have to do.

RISA seems to work pretty well, but sometimes it won't converge on a specific wall size if you use ""suggested member sizes.""  And you have that whole annoying thing of having to draw so much of the house.  It seems like it could be faster.

So, I'm wondering if there's some awesome software you guys use to do the wind loads, diaphragm &amp; shear wall analysis, and hold down sizing.

I'm writing this because as an international student on this subreddit and also other pages or forums I have visited related to engineering seem to have like a negative stigma against recruiters, or as if they were looking for jobs but all they could find/get were calls from several recruiters.

Couldn't those recruiters end up getting that job you are looking for or is that a wrong way of seeing it? I am just saying cause I too have been applying to some jobs and while it seems that you never get answers back, the only ones I do have voicemails or emails are from a couple of recruiters; like AeroTek and The Select Group. Are those bad options or letting them find a position that might suit me is bad?

The same recruiter kept calling to look for other positions and asked for some references too while ""she was going to look for other opening"", might as well have my references in check. It took me a while to contact my old supervisors from my previous internship to get those references so I just ended up just ""ignoring"" that recruiter. As I kept on looking for other jobs in Glassdoor, Indeed Linkedin, I ended up getting again some calls from recruiters, should I keep ignoring them and just apply individual to each position? What are the pros and cons of recruiters? Is the stigma against them for something?

1. Ensure aggregate is as fine as possible (however making it too fine will cause the concrete to become brittle.)  
2. Utilize Rebar to reduce tensile forces applied to concrete

4. Ensure concrete is pre-stressed by putting tension on rebar before pouring concrete

My daughter and some classmates are starting engineering this fall at a well-known R1 university, and are all a bit spooked by the thought of learning ""programming"" as part of their fall semester. These are all kids who are bright - all are going straight to multivariable calculus first semester. However, none of them took any programming classes in high school (though could have). I know they have a group ""robotics"" project first semester, which is more than likely an Arduino-like platform.

As a programmer dad, I offered to show them some ropes before they head to school, mostly to alleviate their anxiety, and they are very interested (in other words, I can't back out now!). I have an Arduino with bunches of peripherals/sensors which I used with my younger kid for a school project. I figure covering basics of variable typing, declaring a function, and using a library to interact with a sensor or two will give them enough basics to put them more at ease.

**My question for engineers is whether there's anything engineering-specific you'd recommend, whether language features or industry style.**

For instance, whenever I mentor CS interns or junior developers, I focus heavily on *style*, particularly writing self-documenting code, with descriptive variable and function names, and favoring short functions to keep the code readable.

Troubleshot to a bad dc/dc converter board.

Found Schematic ([Fig. 1](https://imgur.com/a/WiUrIf6)) showing the U5 Daughter board provided 5v out, 15v out and 13.6v out. Cool. I opened up a cheapo cellphone battery back up and used the guts to provide 5v out. I'm thinking I  can skip using AA batteries now and use the power of LIPO and it will be awesome. I use my bread board and wire the +5V to pin 7 on the U5 board and voila! The gameboy powers on and music plays but no display. I did not have 15v or 13v at this point so I figured the screen would not work.

Looking at the schematic I see pin 6 is +15v out and Then I also need a +13.6v for pin 5. I decide I will buy a 5v boost converter, boost to 15v and then use 3 diodes in series to step down to ~13.6v for pin 5.
I order the part, wire it in the breadboard and turn on the gameboy. The screen does display and attempts to animate however the display only shows [VERTICAL LINES](https://imgur.com/a/fOoLDck). 

This has me thinking there is a polarization issue or something else is wrong with the board so I begin to poke around the other test pads on the motherboard. Then I notice that what I thought was +15v is actually a -15V! (I think) looking at ([Fig. 3](https://imgur.com/a/WiUrIf6))

The whole schematic is on the last page [Here](https://gamesx.com/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=schematics:gameboy_color_service_manual.pdf)

So looking at my terrible setup in ([Fig. 2](https://imgur.com/a/WiUrIf6)) Am I right in thinking I need a -15V reference, and then secondly, how the hell can I do that? 

I was planning on using the 5V lipo board in whole so that I could still use the battery backup feature to charge a phone. Then I was going to wire the Boost Converter in after the 5v output of the lipo board. So I will/would have had a 5v circuit and a 15v circuit. But now I'm stuck.

37,How to figure out strength of steel over a certain span,1529432667,"Hello all. I work IT by day and farmer also by day. I'm trying to figure out the best material and material size for a movable chicken coop. 

I recently bought a set of running gears with axles 15' apart. My goal is to build a wooden chicken coop on it in a 20'x10' dimension. My question is what should I use to span the length to build my base on? Very few other farmers have built this sort of thing and the one I have been able to find so far used beams made out of three 2x10s. My worry is that it will sag over time. I have a stationary chicken coop currently that I built just four years ago that is experiencing some sag on a 6' span of a 2x12 that doesn't even have much load on it. 

My other thought is to buy some metal. My father-in-law has several hay wagons he and his farm hand (welder by trade) made on running gears decades ago. It looks like they just used channel but the owner of Metal Supermarkets (who refused to give me any engineering advice) seemed to think channel wouldn't be strong enough. I'm not sure how much everything will weigh, but the coop will be wood and tin so a few hundred pounds, then 400 chickens x 5lbs = 2000lbs, and I'm not yet sure how much water it will hold, either a 55gal drum (440lbs) or a 300gal IBC (2400lbs). So I guess around 5,000lbs maybe (the water will be centered directly over back axle). 

Anyway, links:

However, I really feel like I'm underutilizing every aspect of my knowledge. My job right now is doing inspections, sitting in on corrective action meetings, and juggling a lot of paperwork. I haven't touched any of the math, physical, CAD, or general design work that I was looking forward to using.

47,How to calculate mean worm diameter from spec sheet?,1529412015," Hi everyone!

 I'm working with some standards for design specifications (specifically AGMA 6022-C93) for worm gearing for the first time, and I'm a bit confused as to terminology.

In some equations, there are references to ""mean worm diameter"" and ""lead angle at mean worm diameter"" to calculate sliding velocities and whatnot.

Is the ""mean diameter"" just the reference pitch diameter? Or otherwise, how would I calculate the mean worm diameter if it's not listed on my spec sheet for an existing worm/ worm gear? Google (and my standard) seem to only spit out max and min values/guidelines for how to pick a mean diameter.

65,How to best set up extraction for a coke/coal forge.,1529359430,"Hello and thanks in advance. 

I'm in the process of setting up a coke/coal forge and unfortunately the building it will be situated in prevents us from going straight up. I have previously used forges with passive extraction with various bends and horizontal sections and, while they do work once the fire gets going, they are a nightmare before everything heats up. We had originally intended to do something like this https://imgur.com/a/1QhC06Y with a vertical section up to a horizontal piece with a blower pushing air through on one end (on the left in the linked image)

However, after some research, predominantly from this guide www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/priced/hsg258.pdf it seems that it is better to have the fan as far along the system as possible, so that as much as possible of the ductwork that is indoors is under negative pressure, something like this https://imgur.com/a/d1A54Ky (ignore the drain related parts)

We built a crude model of this latter design with 1"" pvc pipe, hot glue and a lot of duct tape but could not get it to function. We tried both a hair dryer at various speeds and an inch square computer cooling fan that you could barely feel, but air would simply flow down the vertical part of the system instead of being drawn out. So my questions are:

Are either of these designs feasible?
Is there a better design?
I can think of many, many reasons why our model didn't work but what is most likely as I don't to spend days and days troubleshooting? (I'd like to see it working before spending a lot of money on the actual set up)

89,question regarding a window ac unit,1529327206,"

i live in a tiny apartment.  the landlord installed a massive window unit that cools the entire place down in under 6 minutes.  i have been turning it off at that point and using the ceiling fan to keep it cool.   i usually only have to turn it on about once every hour or so if the temp is above 90 degrees.  anything under and it usually only requires being turned on once every three hours.  is this bad for it?  should i keep it on all the time?  will it destroy the ac doing it like i am or save it?  i cant find anything on google because of how little time it takes too cool off my unit and also because i am home all day.   i also couldnt find a better subreddit, but i have a feeling this one might be wrong as well, so my apologies if this is the wrong place to ask.    i figure its a simple question but i have no one in my life who i believe would know the answer.  

*tldr* my ac unit is way bigger than my apartment needs. am i doing harm to it by only turning it on for a few minutes at a time  and then turning it off or should i leave it on auto?

90,What should I use to precisely control angular position in an experiment?,1529325380," Hi friends,

I'm an intern working on an designing an experiment right now for lunar/martian soil simulant tests (exact test details aren't really necessary to answer this question) and I wanted to know what options I have for precisely controlling angular position.

To simplify, let's say I have a metal plate that is mounted on one end and will need to pivot. I've thought about using a stepper motor to move the plate to exact angles, but the precision on most stepper motors I found isn't enough (by that I mean the ""steps"" are generally 1.8 degrees; I'm trying to be able to move the plate at smaller increments, around the order of 0.1-0.25 degrees ideally). I know servo motors could work for the smaller stuff, but I need to work in a vacuum and it's hard to find vacuum-rated servos where outgassing wouldn't be a problem. I've also thought about using a motorized linear stage on one end with only a fulcrum (no servo or stepper or anything) on the other side, but that complicates the angle calculation and I'd prefer to keep it simple.

So do any engineers/scientists/mechanics/random people on this sub have any suggestions for precise angular position control? Just trying to find some other options while I'm waiting on some co-workers and I figured I'd ask you beautiful people.

TLDR;

I need to pivot a plate/box by one side at relatively precise angular measurements. Work will be done in a vacuum, so some suggestions may be difficult to implement/hard to find vacuum-rated mechanisms.

0,Graduated but have a Dilemma,1529299762,"Hi Engineers,

I have graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering this past April 2018 with a focus in Power Systems. I took a month off to go visit family and take care of a few things and just got back.

Here is my dilemma:

I injured my ankle playing basketball months ago. It's been hurting for quite some time even after I let it recover. I visited a specialist and after examination he determined best course of action is to rebuild the ligaments in my ankle. I asked him about the estimated time of recovery and was told that complete recovery is 6 months from time of surgery to end of physio. I was also told I should expect to be in a cast for close to 2-3 months. 

Currently it's June and my surgery is scheduled for end of July. This puts me at almost January to be walking again.

Now in terms of securing a Engineering Job, I'm not sure what to do. Since I'll be in a cast, going for interviews or getting a job not close to home will be tricky. I fear I may become obsolete in the Job Market if I start applying in January of next year (2019) as a new wave of graduates begin to roll in.

Though I do have a 12 month internship experience under my belt as well as a 3.1/4.0 GPA if that matters at all.

One of my last minute plans is to do a part time Master's degree in Electrical Engineering to stay relevant starting in September.

I'm still going to keep myself occupied during my down time as I'm working on a couple of projects with some friends.

Any ideas? I feel like time is running out.

Any recommendations on learning any industry specific languages or program in the time being?

Thank you all.

My company thinks it's a great idea to expand my skill set so I looked up relevant online degrees that would get covered by my companies tuition payout. I noticed FIU offers online degrees in EE. When I told my boss that he honestly thought it was a fantastic idea because half of the engineers on my team are EE's and the others are Civils. I'd be constantly interning as every semester I'd get more work in EE and training under electrical PE's.

Basically the degree would allow me to get deeper into creating lighting plans/load center design and the goal of getting an EE education is to eventually be able to sign and seal them as well. (I would be a PE in Civil already and would just need to have experience and education in EE to sign and seal electrical plans).

I just took an FEM class last semester, and I absolutely loved it (though it was extremely hard for me since I hadn't done well in my math courses after coming to college, and to make things worse, the university made us build our own FEM solvers from scratch in MATLAB instead of just using Ansys and Fenics).  Though I only have a year left, I now feel like I really want to go into numerical analysis type stuff (though up till now, I have mostly taken environmental and geotechnical classes)- and was thinking about approaching some professors to ask if I can do research with them in related fields for my last year. So far, I have taken the basic math courses required for engineering (multivariable calc, linear algebra/differential equations).

 I wanted to know what higher-level math is required to understand the more computational/numerical aspects of Civil Engineering, and how competitive it is to get a job in this field (and if there is any non-academia related jobs for this type of stuff)? I know that Civil Engineers don't tend to focus on math a lot, but I was hoping maybe there is some intersection with the two fields?

I do feel like my FEM course re-taught me all of the math I missed due to not being confident and disciplined enough in my previous semesters, and I now understand multivariable calc/linear algebra/ differential equations well enough to pursue learning deeper math topics related to my field through casual reading and maybe taking a few math courses at my uni for my remaining year.

So I am currently interning at a large defense contractor. A few weeks in and while I do somewhat enjoy the work, I *hate* the work location. Its rural, it's boring, and I want out. (They relocated me for the summer. After the summer I'm moving back to an urban city).

The company I'm at has locations in El Segundo. I'd really enjoy working there. So my questions are:

1) Would it be appropriate to ask my boss at the end of the summer about the feasibility of moving to a different location?

28,As a civil EIT how do I make break into the mining industry,1529187367,"Hey folks

I’m a civil EIT working in Northern Ontario for a consulting company as part of the QA team at a gold mine, which is currently being constructed. I have been working at this mine for a year and have discovered that I really enjoy working on the site and in particular the large scale of construction that a developing mine offers. As this project nears completion I have found myself attracted to the idea of working for mine as an EIT and focusing my career in the mining industry. Also the idea of working all over the world on large scale projects is incredibly enticing. 

Currently I’m scheduled to leave this position that I currently occupy with Consulting Company A for a new position with Consulting Company B in northern British Colombia as a civil EIT in a municipal role. This change excites me as Company A has been a shit show and has little regard for employees, taking full advantage whenever wherever possible, while Company B’s reputation preceded them, to the point that an old classmate recommended them as a quality employer. Also at Company A  none of my responsibilities or duties in any way employ my degree, while the new role is much more inclusive of my education. 

I am starting to have misgivings about this change in career trajectory however, with respect to how this will affect my marketable experience in gaining employment as a EIT working for a large scale mining company on large scale projects. 

I’m seeking advice with this change in employer will negatively affect me potentially moving towards the above described career goal.

Also while I was able to find examples of civil engineers being employed by the mining sector I was unable to find any job postings which I was qualified for as an civil EIT. All postings were for Mining EITs without exception. Was wondering if anyone had any advice on how and where to apply as a civil EIT trying to break into the mining industry.

My ultimate goal is to become a mechatronics engineer or robotics engineer, but my job search for those specific jobs were fruitless. I actually interviewed for a FAANG company for an entry level mechatronics position, but was put as the second pick despite doing really well in the interviews. This really bummed me out, but gives me hope that I have the potential to becoming a really sought after mechatronics engineer. 

Now what complicates things is that because I'm not an American citizen, I had to pick a job quickly before a certain date, and the only options I had was a manufacturing job in a rural state far from any major cities or a data analyst job in a major city. I chose the data analyst job because it paid more, I would learn data science (and potentially machine learning), and it was in a pretty fun city. But now I'm scared that I may have chosen a job that may stray me away from my career goals. Does anyone have any advise on what I should do for the next 1-3 years to help redirect my career?

so I hope this kind of post is ok but im trying to build some electric rotary tables to display figures on. Theyre about 5kg heavy and the biggest one is 61cm in height.
I want them to turn pretty slowly, maybe about 1 rotation per minute? 
I thought about buying one of these (sorry for the german): https://www.spinematic.de/produkt/aluminium-drehkranz-20cm-80kg-leise/
Then i would but an ac motor in the middle and somehow make it turn. Atleast thats the plan..
maybe something like these two?: https://www.amazon.de/LEORX-Phase-4-Draht-Schrittmotor-Drucker/dp/B015ST2U5A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529168870&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=nema+17
https://www.conrad.de/de/getriebemotor-12-v-modelcraft-rb350030-0a101r-130-227544.html

ofc the motor is taller then the ring so maybe i have to embed the motor into the wood under it, that would be the shelf.. i even thought about cutting a circle shape out of the board, making room in there for motor and the turning plate and then having the wooden plate ontop so its like a shelf with a turning plattform in circleshape. (that would be the best). like in this picture, behold my paint skills. (https://imgur.com/a/5ANJ43J)


my questions are: 
- how would you make the ring turn?
- how would i make it so that the turning speed is about 1 rpm?
- well the whole wiring thing is pretty new to me..i probably need like a power converter of some sorts? how am i gonna go about having the ac being able to be plucked into a casual outlet? 
- what motor should i buy, so its not hearable? i dont want any clacking or other noises while its on. also on the site it says the rotary platform is 'very quiet'. other suggestions maybe?

I'm learning the basics for those sort of questions

However, what I'm trying to work out [ (and I Googled ""find RPM from kW and Nm"" but couldn't find much) ].

These are what I'm trying to work out:

-  The 2018 Ford Fiesta has a 1.0-liter/99bhp 4-cylinder engine that produces 99hp at 6000rpm, but what amount of lb/ft do you get from the engine?

- The 2003 Ford Falcon XT sedan has a 4.0-liter 182kW/380Nm 6-cylinder engine, but what does it produce in RPM?

----

I've worked out the first question as:

99 x 5252 = 519,948

519,948/6000 = 86.66 [rounded to 87]

The Fiesta has 87 lb/ft of torque.

It's the second question which I'm having more trouble with, as I don't know what the general math is for kW and Nm for finding torque.

Am I correct = hp is metric and kW [kilowatts] are imperial?

I graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 2012 with an interest in traffic and transportation engineering. After months of job searching, I was not able to find a traffic/transportation job, and ended up getting hired at a small-ish, private firm that specializes in land development (subdivisions, commercial, and industrial). I really enjoyed (and still enjoy) my coworkers, the pay is fair, good benefits, no commute, room for growth within the company... you get the picture. Great company to work for.

However, the longer I've worked here, the more I've come to resent the type of work I do, as well as the clients.

I've also been somewhat pigeon-holed into a non-engineering ""specialty"" service that my company offers. This is a very niche field, and demand for this work is high.

My dilemma - a year ago I moved 90 miles away from my the office, and convinced them to let me continue working for them remotely as a part-time employee. Shortly after moving, my immediate supervisor had a major medical episode and has been on disability leave ever since. My company asked me to return to full-time work, but still remote.

However, we still have a LOT of open projects, and if I were to leave, I have no idea how the 2 guys I'm managing would survive. Also, I have no idea what I would pursue if I were to leave.

61,question regarding my bike trailer.,1529080313,"[picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/Fwo0QpT)

My bike trailer is a pretty typical design. The clamp goes into the horizontal rear fork of the frame. And the bar is bent to allow for right turns. Sharp turns result in the bar hitting the wheel. No bueno, especially at high speed. However my trailer seems designed to be used with a kid's size bike, or a folding bike. so originally the bar was too short after the bend to allow for proper right turns without losing any teeth. So since the bar is longer on the other side of the bend I just flipped it around, drilled some holes and attached it. And now it fits my wheel. Making it usable until I figure out a better way to attach it.

Sorry for the longwinded post but I thought maybe you guys and gals have some interesting input. Now for the question.

The thing is that it rides left of center now. I'm no longer pulling on the middle of the cart. My question is, will this increase drag and wear on the wheels/tires/bearings? I feel like this isn't optimal. But I do kinda like it since there's less risk of getting too close to the curb. Since that can result in the cart flipping over onto the road, which is real bad if there's other people around.",AskEngineers,False,Kankerdebiel,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8rcb10/question_regarding_my_bike_trailer/

i simulated a sinewave that increases its frequency with time.
it goes from 0Hz to 4000Hz, and the sampling rate is 8000 Hz. 
the nyquist theorem says, that it should get displayed exactly like it is, because the sampling rate is double the highest frequency (8000=2*4000).
but its doesnt, because the amplitude of my output is not the same. why is that?
i googed it, but i havent found anything conclusive about the amplitude, just about the frequency

why does it not happen in this example https://imgur.com/a/a5AvlLA its a signal that is 7890 to 8110 Hz and the sampling rate is 8000Hz. but the amplitude does not change, which i find odd

69,"How would one measure the snap of a symmetrical, curved piece of material, suspended by a non-elastic string on 2 sides (like a bow), without shooting it and measuring the distance?",1529045522,"Hey guys!




I was thinking about medieval siege equipmnent last night before bed, and I had an idea to etch lines into a ballista (giant slingshot, or sideways bow for shooting projectiles) that would show you how far you have to pull to get a certain amount of distance. There would also be some kind of math equasion that considers the angle of the device also.




So I was thinking about the grooves and how to standardize the bow on the ballista to always shoot the same distance. I thought about suspending a certain weigth on the string, and that would show us the potential power and take into account different materials of the bow. 




BUT, I think the snap of the material would also play a major roll in how far the projectile goes, even though we suspended the same weigth on the string and standardized that to shoot x distance. Maybe some kind of wood is more springy than some other kind and there would be signifucant deviations in the projectile distance. -But maybe there wouldn't. The premise likes to have all things equal, and the only things that can be variable are different wood types and how they behave compared to the standard.




And you don't want to shoot your ballistas to check how far they shoot because someone might get hurt and there are no gun ranges in medieval times. Is there some trick to test the springiness of the bow to mathematically adjust the distance?

I was lucky enough to land an internship until the beginning of August in a manufacturing plant that creates food processing equipment. The company creates industrial boilers, silos, molding lines, etc. The company has no formal internship program and I have this opportunity due to my knowing some higher ups. As such, I have no predefined role at the company because there was no opening in the first place.

I have a high degree of fluidity in what departments I can choose to be with during my internship. They placed me in the shop floor QC department to start me off (I plan on working with the design group as well). I’ve been here almost a week now and what I usually do is do some theoretical reading accompanied with factory observation. So far I’ve read up about different welding methods, different types of steel, ASME standards, and various components. The people on the QC team have been taking me out on the shop floor quite frequently to see the practical application of my ‘research’ as well as show me different tools and qc standards they monitor. It’s an enjoyable experience so far but I’d like to do something more. 

I want to get the most of my internship and ask for some responsibilities very soon. Of course I will ask my coworkers what they would have me do, but I was hoping to get some insight on what I could gear my experience towards (I’m going to be a junior m.e.).

72,Should I quit my internship?,1529032495,"Hi everyone. I am really struggling these days so I want to get some advice from this sub. Thanks in advance.

I am Computer Science major rising junior. Right now I am working at a huge corporate (not in IT industry) for the summer internship. I got into this company through a program on campus. When I was looking for things to do for the summer I was really clear that I wanted to do technical work. I wanted to do coding related work specifically. I was also assured by the program director that I would be involved in technical work. 

However, things didn't turn out well. Three weeks in the job I am doing nothing technical related. First of all, it is a big corporation so everything needs authorization. I was assigned to do something and two weeks later I still don't have the authorization. All the projects assigned to us were poorly prepared. I personally have the perception that they just throw us some work that was stacked in the warehouse for a long time. It is unnecessary work but well it's good somebody can do it. 

I talked to my family about this issue. I am the only (future) engineer in the family. They tend to think that I should accept doing some office work because big chances I will be doing them in my future career too. However, it's not that I am unwilling to do office work. I am very concerned that I am not learning anything technical aspect in this summer. Right after this summer, it will be recruiting season for the junior -&gt; senior summer internship, which is very critical. All my friends are doing coding work during their internship now/ personally. I am really trying to squeeze my time after work doing some algorithm problems. I just don't see the point that why should I spend my time at the office learning nothing that's beneficial to me. 

On the side note, I also hate the purpose of the work I am assigned. I think it's just fake big corporate work. It doesn't pay well. The company doesn't pay us. School gives us stipend. I also feel cheated by the program director. So a lot of mixed feelings. I hope some experienced engineers can give me some advice. Thanks so much!!

My daughter didn't know what it was a touched it with her fingers tips. What are the chances of the gallium residue on her fingers attacking her iPhone's aluminum case over time? What's the best way to get it off her fingers? We've washer her fingers with Goop grease removing soap, rubbing alcohol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. She's a teenager, going more than a few hours without her phone could be life threatening to her!

95,Implementing a Quality Torque Program?,1528946903,"I am looking for ideas and suggestions on how to control torque and create a robust quality system. We have already transitioned from TS to DC tools, did several R&amp;R studies and the DC torque tools perform much better than manual tools, less variation and much better reproducibility however, I feel that I want to build more quality controls.

During one of my conversations with the client, some of the ideas we discussed\- torque verifiers\- where operators would test even the DC tools before applying force to the actual joint. 

In addition, we have identified that even with the DC tools, the angle of the tool has a significant impact on the torque applied, so I am thinking about doing a R&amp;R Study with 4 different angles to see how that impacts R&amp;R, then determine the ""optimal"" angle and add it to the work instructions for each station.

Then, a final inspection at the end of the build process to verify that the torque applied meets the requirements\- client mentioned the marking method\- I will have to investigate that further.",AskEngineers,False,IowaStateEngineer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8qynxh/implementing_a_quality_torque_program/

97,Weldable vs Non-Weldable Rebars,1528944516,"Hey, everyone, i'm just wondering how do you qualify rebars as weldable or non-weldable. As far as I know, ASTM A615 are non-weldable, and ASTM A706 are weldable bars, (sorry if i'm stupid that way).

And also, what are the risks, (or basically, what would happen) if you weld non-weldable bars?

Thanks!",AskEngineers,False,krammeritoz,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8qyeyb/weldable_vs_nonweldable_rebars/
