Looking to determine a required starting temp for a water bath of a double boiler (not really boiling) such that the liquid in the immersed vessel hits a target temp within a target time interval but does not substantially overshoot the temp or rise too quickly.

I put the system together for cheese making and consists of a large plastic tub (which contains a fixed volume of water which can be set to any initial temp when filling), an immersion circulator for holding temp or slow adjustments and then a smaller (plastic lidded) metal tub which is immersed in the water and then filled with milk usually directly removed from the cooler. The milk is not agitated after this, to prevent bubbles from forming.

If I know the volume of and I am able to fix the holding temp of the water, the volume of and initial temp of milk, and the target temp for the milk and time interval I would like that rise to happen in, how do I calculate the required starting temp for the water?

16,Business Trip/Career advice for a Jr. Mech Eng,1452607062,"Hi,

(Sorry in advance for any grammar or wording issues, I'm trying to get this out quickly before IT notices their firewall is down.)

Probably not the right sub but I need other engineer's opinons on this. I just was told that they need to send an engineer (1 of 4 other engineers) to china for a hand holding conference regarding manufacturing parts for the company I work for. I have less than  7 years experience as an ME and I've only been working for this company as a contractor for the past 6 months. IMO I know relatively little about what I do so far as I mostly do ECNs and 'clean up work' on projects. 

The good: this job pays better than most jobs in the area. I'm sure I can find another job and everything but this is somewhat in my field of choice but not perfectly. I'd rather do things that require CNC machining instead of 2D laser and plasma cutting.  Furthermore, I've never been outside the country other than when I was in the army and going to a 3rd world country to fuck it up is one thing but going to China is another as I do not have a Nation of support backing me if shit hits the fan for whatever reason.

The bad: Like I said, I'm a temp. They told me they were planning on hiring me on but I haven't received anything in writing. Further, I'm still not 100% I really like this job. They use PROE and I have a Solidworks background  which I know is semantics but I really like SW over PROE. Additionally, the job is about an hour from my house and I have no options for moving as my wife works 180° in the opposite direction and also has an hour commute. 

What do I do? Do I say ""yes"" and go to China voluntarily? Do I get voluntold? or do I quit and find a job where I don't have to worry about this sort of thing?

Please, any insight would be great! and feel free to ask questions, I'll do my best to answer them!

24,(Advice) How to choose between two job offers when you like both?,1452558007,"A little background. I have two offers right now. One is a field engineer position, which requires a large amount of international travel working with robotic manufacturing equipment (very cool and the field I want to be in). The only downside is I'm not sure what career mobility will be like once I leave this position. Could this position easily transfer to a design engineering position in the robotics field in the future?

The other offer is a Design engineer role but mainly deals with designing large industrial sized products, alot of FEA analysis from what I gather which is fine. The perk with this position is that project turnover is very fast! From what I was told, the engineer is given the specification of what the customer wants, design it, some quick FEA calculations, and the product is on it's way to the customer in a month. Always something new that needs to be done from what I understand. This sounds very exciting because I currently design stuff for the military and the projects take forever to finish. I'd love having something new and interesting every time I come into work. 

Only problem is I'm getting bored sitting behind a desk all day. (Been in product development for over a year) I'd love to travel and see some of the world while getting paid to work with robotics.

I have started a ME internship recently (first few weeks) in a position that does a decent amount of hands on work (or so I understand). So it's not a computer science type gig. And I like to do hands on work.

But during my interview I got the feeling that I would be doing less hands on work than normal, but I was cool with that. The interviewer said it would be more research based things. Alright, that's cool. 

I was introduced to the proposed project (which was, as expected, mostly research based), and the manager asked if I would be interested. It seemed interesting, so I said sure, that's fine. He had sort of given me the option of doing more hands on work, 'if I like'. I felt at the time, since I accepted the internship position, that I should be willing to do research work as well. 

But the problem now is I feel I'm not actually doing anything, my supervisor kind of just says research the topic and he goes to his meetings or what have you, and I'm sitting at my desk staring at research papers. I feel I've already got the information I need and I'm just reading the same thing over and over again. 

Now, should I ask to be given a more involved project, or more work? I feel I sort of signed up for the computer work, so complaining now would be out of line. However I feel like I'm also wasting time in a way. I want to actually gain relevant experience while I'm here.

Also I cannot speculate how well I will fit into the program, although I have a genuine interest but if I have a low GPA am I doomed to never find a job in this field? What about in computer and civil? These are major factors preventing me from doing chemical

Thirdly, I like the concept of computer engineering but I suck at it and I can't code. I barely escaped academic probation this year. What happens of your a shitty engineer? Is there any way to change careers or has anyone considered doing that ? What options do I have?

49,What are your thoughts on using technology to address social issues?,1452489793,"Hi All,

I've been involved the high tech electronics industry (design and consulting) for around 8 years now, and am looking to do something more with my life that helps make a positive difference to others.

I’ve been pretty taken by how technology is being used to help address issues like sex trafficking (Thorn – www.wearethorn.org) and combating rhino poaching (both Team Arend - www.wildlifeprotectionsolutions.org/tag/team-arend/ and Air Shepherd - www.airshepherd.org)

Long story short, I’d like to get some candid comments and feedback on an idea very seriously I’m considering. Would anyone here be interesting in an ongoing interview series that:

* Digs deep into a single ‘social’ issue each episode to understand why it exists and what can be done to solve it, with a focus on technology in the mix
* Interview a people close the problem to gain different perspectives
* Interview technology start ups and companies already working in the space
* Have a space where engineers and social entrepreneurs can come together and openly discuss ways to solve the issues investigated and gain access to resources they need to do so

Please just be brutally honest, there’s a thousand and one ways to make a difference, and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time on something that isn’t useful and won’t be used.

54,"Call for Materials, Metallurgical, and Ceramics Engineers: talk about your work! (Q1 2016)",1452469253,"Welcome to the first wiki series thread of 2016! This thread is the fifth in a series for engineers to share their work experiences.

Today's is for all the Materials, Metallurgical, and Ceramics Engineers. This one was actually suggested by /u/EclecticEuTECHtic, so thank him for the suggestion! Be sure to check out the previous threads, which are still open for responses — check below for links.

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**

### Timeframe

*(Skip this section if you don't care about how these posts are organized.)*

Unlike the original posts which only lasted 1 week per discipline, these will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted and stickied, but the old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Once all the disciplines have been covered, a final thread will be posted with links to all of them to collect any more responses until archived. The current list of disciplines:

63,Which of these FEA meshes is best?,1452450871,"Came across this question in an old textbook on numerical modelling. Having a hard time coming up with an answer (no answer provided in the book).

Is there a difference between following FE meshes (http://imgur.com/tFDPgde each mesh consists of 9 nodes, 4 on the star tips, 4 in the crevices and 1 in the middle) with regards to:

1.    Calculation time

2.    Accuracy in the calculation of deformations and stresses

My best guess is:

1.    No difference in calculation time, because each mesh has the same number of nodes (9). Hence the system of equations that has to be solved is of the same size for each mesh? Also, symmetry permits only calculating 1/4 of the meshed domain in each case?

2.    There is a difference in accuracy. Meshes 1 and 2 use rectangular elements, whereas meshes 3 and 4 use triangular elements. However, the rectangular elements of mesh 1 are heavily deformed, leading to bad convergence behavior (says so in the textbook). And rectangular elements tend to be more accurate than triangular elements. So I think mesh 2 is the best in terms of accuracy?

What do you guys think?

86,The actual electron level analysis of an electrical low pass filter doesn't make sense to me.,1452299943,"For example, consider the basic low pass filter that you see in undergraduate:

http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/images/RC-low-pass-filter.png

If the signal current is flowing from left to right, at the first input node, left of the resistor, the signal sees the impedance of the resistor.  It passes through the resistor.

At the next node, there's basically a short and then a path through the capacitor.  Even if it's a really high frequency signal and a really low capacitor, why would the signal ever travel through the capacitor rather than the short?

The curriculum for Electrical Engineering at the school where I am going to be studying is the following: (for 1st semester)
Calculus I Digitaltechnik (Digital Technology) Linear Algebra Physics for Electrical engineering Circuit Technology I
Currently I am studying a Pre-Calculus book and will soon start studying Calculus I on my own using Online resources alongside a Paperback.
After I am finished with Calculus I will move to Linear Algebra.
The thing is, I know how to study and finish those two subjects but I am lost when it comes to Circuits or Physics for Electrical engineering !! Because this is totally new to me and I have no experience at all with it.
The reason I am studying these subjects before enrolling, is because the school is a top notch in Germany and I am anxious about the study load. And the school follows a policy, in which students shall drop out of the program in case of unsuccessful completion of the first two semesters' exams. So I am trying to be well-prepared and would really appreciate some guidance on this.
The physics for the ¹st semester covers the follows:
Physical quantities and units. Mechanics. Waves and Optics. Hydro and Thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics and atomic physics.

5,Am I becoming incompetent as an ME?,1452220692,"Hey All,

I am a recent ME graduate (bachelors)  that got a job right out of college; because of tomfoolery / not knowing what I wanted do do with my life I am in my late 20's. I am posting this because I am working for a very small start up and am the only ME at the company. I have no one to compare myself with. I am worried that my skills as an engineer are not up to par / what they should be should I decide to find a new job. I graduated with a focus in mechanical design, and did not take the FEA technical elective. I graduated with a B /B+ average GPA, however I quickly forget what I learned in school. My job mainly consists of creating CAD models of parts / assemblies and creating the technical drawings for those parts and assemblies (Gd&amp;T), creating BOMs, contacting machine shops, updating the companies inventory, assembly work, and developing new ways of achieving what my company wants on the mechanical side of things. I can create parts that are machined, laser cut, bent (sheet metal),  printable, and I believe I could make a part suitable for injection molding. However my job is lacking in any real sort of machine design, stress analysis, kinematic / dynamic analysis, FEA (nothing thermal, nothing fluid), and I am quickly forgetting what I learned about these subjects. I basically know how to create a part that is machinable, how to create a technical drawing for that part, and contact a machine shop to make that part. I am grateful to have gotten a job right out of college, but the lack of a mentor or any work that will expand my knowledge of engineering in any area is becoming increasingly alarming to me. My question to you is: How will this experience look to possible employers? Is this typical of an entry level ME job, or am I doing work that is typically reserved for technicians / drafters while my engineering skills fall by the wayside?

That said, I see no reason that it would significantly increase strength:
*The moment of inertia isn't increased. 
*I doubt the cold working of bending the beams would be an appreciable difference. 
*Maybe there's a tensile member underneath connecting the two chordal points of the arc, but photos don't show much depth for that to seem like it helps. 
*Surely there's pivots between the wheels and the trailer so it's not like it's to promote load distribution between the sets of wheels.

58,[Chemistry] Handling safely vapors of heated sulfuric acid,1452088782,"OK guys, I need your help. I have to subject various objects made of polyamide to heated vapors of sulfuric acid (concentrated solution at 70-80%). Temperatures range from 135 to 165°C / 275 to 329° F. You can guess it, the stuff is going to be /quite/ reactive.

I have a cheap lab oven + laboratory glassware and I have no idea how to safely proceed. I obviously don't want heated corrosive vapors in contact with the metallic inside of the oven, meaning that I have to use an hermetic setup -but I worry about gas dilatation and risk of explosions.

I considered discarding the oven entirely and heating with a good ol' heating mantle, allowing me to use a condenser to cool down vapors but I need to have my objects  (diameter ~15cm) somewhere before that in the setup and there is no really appropriate glassware for this (maybe a big dessicator with a stopcock ?).

Finally, I'm not sure it would be OK to handle sulfuric vapors with merely a condenser or if I should add something after (for example, forcing the gas to go through a NaOH solution before the exit). Could an experienced chemist confirm this ?

Maybe I'm overcomplicating things and there is a simpler way to proceed... If you have any ideas/suggestions, I'm eager to ear them !

61,Why do manufacturers (and consumers) of power tools make such a big deal out of the battery voltage?,1452081462,"The power of the tool is just current multiplied by voltage. The voltage doesn't mean anything without current. A 250 watt cordless drill is going to behave exactly the same at 250 volts and 1 ampere as 250 ampere and 1 volt. From an engineering standpoint it's of course more reasonable to avoid any extremes in current or voltage and use something like 25 volt and 10 amps, but I don't see why you'd involve the customer in that decision.

- ""Well, the engine can rev 8000 RPM!""

**Mechanical:**
Seems like the most common major and always in demand. Seems interesting but I would appreciate a higher paying major.


**Mining:**
I don't have much to say about this major but it does seem somewhat interesting and, from what I've read, pays well.


**Petroleum:**
Petroleum is large in Canada and pays very well, and honestly that is what piqued my interest. I am worried about the job prospects in this field.


**Aerospace:**
I've always had an interest in aircraft, and it pays well too. Again, I am worried about job prospects in this field and don't particularly enjoy the places these jobs are. (Typically east of Canada.)


**Computer:**
I wouldn't say I love it but I definitely would like to learn more about the hardware and software sides of computing. Pays well and I can see a large increase in jobs in the future.


**Architectural:**
Physics is my best course and from what I've seen the pay for this major tends to be quite large.

83,Finding optimal lifting points of a concrete panel using superposition of beam theory,1452012232,"I am currently trying to find lifting points (equidistant from the edges) for a relatively thin concrete panel. I want to see if their location can optimize displacement, shear loading, or moments.

This is the scenario:

http://imgur.com/TaFlTiI

The uniform load is the panel's own weight, and the upward forces are equal loads from lifting hardware.

I think it is a superposition of the following setups:

http://imgur.com/SMdNp9i

http://imgur.com/0qOGdVg

First of all, is this valid? Obviously I need to subtract the one from the other. Do the reactions then cancel out?

Assuming this is right, I created 3 piece-wise functions for deflection, moment, and shear - from A&gt;B, B&gt;C, C&gt;D. This all seems right so far. I know that F is just w*l/2.

What I then want to do is optimize ""a"" so that max shear is smallest. As it turns out shear is independent of ""a."" So then I go for moment. Here, the middle section is dependent on ""a,"" but the optimal location is a = 0 (at the ends). This makes sense for the multi-load case, but under uniform loading I would suspect a more central load to help balance that out.

My last option is to do deflection, which I haven't done yet. I'm really concerned with shear flow in this case as it is a composite panel, but if that is independent of ""a,"" then I should go for another.

Any input? This may have been done before but I sort of want to do it this way to get some practice. Any help on optimizing piece-wise functions?

They want to attach eyelets to the foard panel walls, 15' up, and string a cable between those eyelets to hang the curtain on, presumably using turnbuckles to tension the cable once it's in place.

How thick of a cable should I use?

85,Salary question from new grad,1452011482,"Hello,

I will be finishing my bachelors of science in engineering (BSE) degree in May, and I was hoping for some information on what salary I should expect/ask for.

To start out I did not take the traditional path through school, I went for a engineering tech associates degree right out of high-school and have worked in the field for 7 years. This was mainly 3-D modelling using Solidworks, Inventor, CREO, AutoCAD. After reaching the glass ceiling as a technician at my old job at the age of 23 I decided to go back to school.

I am now 28 and am about to graduate with a BSE in “integrated engineering” the integrated engineering program can either be a mechanical or electrical emphasis. The main difference of my program compared to the traditional BSME OR BSEE is that each semester we do a “CAPSTONE” design project given to us by local engineering companies like Donaldson Filtration, and 3M among others. Other than that the program has the exact same pre-reqs as mechanical/electrical engineering, and we do still do thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and all that jazz. Having worked in the field for so long prior to going back to school, this program really appealed to me, as it allowed me use my skills I learned while working in the field. 

Anyway I have been doing a Co-op as a process engineer for the last year while finishing up my school. Just last week by boss asked me when I can go full-time, he has a Ghant chart for the all tasks the process engineering group wants to tackle this year, and wants to give me projects directly from that list.

During my last year working here, I think I have really impressed my boss with some complicated CAD models of machinery used within our factory. In fact, I was told that one project I was given (and completed in 2 weeks) was given to 2 other process engineers, and the project never got completed, as it was a very complicated model of a hydraulic system. 
I haven’t been offered anything yet, however I am hoping for something around 70k. being a new grad im expected to be low-balled at around 55k, which I don’t think is fair since I have a ton of experience in the field, as well as very high skills with 3-D modelling which has been a large part of my job here. 

What is a smart way to counter a low offer? 

My plan was to start applying to other places as well for May. If I get 
offered a position, should I use that job as a bargaining chip?

I have taken a few images (rendered models) of the machinery I have designed/ reverse engineered here for a portfolio, should I bring that portfolio to this interview? 

Any other advice would be greatly appreciated.

The older engineer I work with has a bit of experience with Allen Bradley, so when I wanted to get a PLC for a project he suggested to go with an AB Micrologix 1000 (this is also what I used in the class).  But after a bit of research it appears that the Micrologix 1000 will be discontinued in about a year and a half.

AB's website recommends the Micro800's as a replacement, but after downloading Connected Components, it seems like a horrible software package over RSLogix.  The older engineer agrees, and is even more angry at Connected Components than I am.

So, what are my choices?  The company is open to whatever direction myself and the other engineer can settle on.  The other engineer is a bit out of his comfort zone, and once he found out the Micrologix 1000's were being discontinued, he kinda pushed it on to me.

6,Fuel Dispenser at gas station slows down in cold weather.,1451935987,"I couldn't think of a better place to post this, and it's within the scope of engineering so here it is. In the morning when I open the gas station, the first few Diesel and Gasoline customers have issues pumping gas as it comes out really slow. For gas, quickly depressing the nozzle lever repeatedly will fix it, but the trick didn't seem to work for diesel. I've been told they pump slowly because the mechanical pump gets cold and needs to warm up. A way to avoid this is by taking the nozzle off and laying it on the ground for a bit as that keeps the pump activated, and it'll eventually heat up enough to move smoothly. 

I was trying to think of a solution that would keep the pumps warm, and a customer mentioned that truck stops have giant sleeves (like a car cover) for their pumps. Having browsed a variety of websites, I could not find such a solution, and was wondering what else could be done. 

If it's necessary, the pumps are manufactured by Gilbarco Veeder-Root, and the model is Encore 300.  


Edit: New information, new filters were put in two months ago, so filters should be good. I have two pumps (two sided, so four nozzles) that are pumping slowly, two diesel nozzles and two gasoline nozzles. The other two gasoline ones are doing just fine. I have tried contacting Gilbarco, but I think I'm going to have to try tomorrow a bit earlier in the morning. 
Any ideas on the possibility of it being the lubricant in the pump motor? 

Edit 2: Called Gilbarco, but I need a contract with them to have them help me. While she tried looking up the site information though, I asked some general questions, and the fuel filter is fine since it's been changed in the last 6 months. She said it is likely because of the cold, but could also be the fuel line being blocked (which is unlikely since it flows just fine on warmer days). Last bit of advice I got other than calling a technician in from a hour away is to reset the breakers, so I just did that and am now waiting for the next customer to come on by and start fueling.

First off - I'm pretty sure this is likely a metric sized motor as the manufacturer of the winch is European and all the screws I've removed have required metric sized tools.  From my research I am lead to understand that electric motors have standard ""frame"" sizes?

The motor mates to a gearbox with 4 screws (pictured in the top view).  Is this placement standardized as well?  I do understand it is IP65 rated which is a measure of resistance to water/contaminants and I still need that given its intended use on a boat.

Finally, the replacement motor is going to be used to steer the boat - not brute force it to the dock so I do not need nearly as powerful of a motor to do the job.  

Any tips on how to find such a part or possibly refit this with a sensor/turn counter kind of thing (I should be able to just reverse the voltage to run it backward - yes?) would be appreciated.

Thanks for any help.

I am in a project group where the goal is to find and try the best possible method to identify the number of people in a vehicle in a roadside custom system which is mounted over the road. 
This is our first look at the project and we are trying to decide which method we are going to use to solve the problem.

We have come to the conclusion that a regular IR/heat camera won't be able to see through a window and that we probably will need to use some kind of “Near IR camera” to see through a windshield. We are not yet that familiar about this technique. We gladly accept feedback or any tips about the project or a different approach on the problem.

 We have decided that we are only focusing on the front seat ,to determine which soulution that will be potentially best.

Do you think that it's a possible solution?

We got an answer from a store, they told us that a possible solution was to use a cheaper and higher resolution camera : silicon-based CMOS. They also said that you could use a ""VIS block filter"" so that only the ""NIR""-part of the sensors sensitivity is used.

15,"Need career advice. Am i wasting ""prime"" years?",1451891067,"Ill give some backstory. Im based in England and graduated in 2014. Within 6 months i got an offer after a few interviews with a relatively small engineering company; its a subsidiary of a larger corporation but our office employs around 50-60 people. 


I work within the sales team and my main job is preparing bids and tenders and preparing quotes for products that match client specifications. 


Due to the nature of it being a small company, there is no strict development path to follow. Im very much learning on the job and learning by doing. Because it is small there is room to circulate and take on responsibilities in other departments. Its also very flexible in terms of transferring to new departments in the future, many of my colleagues started in different areas of the company and migrated around over the years. 


There is also a lot of times during busy periods of the year where i am required to do menial tasks; this has been attributed to the fact there is no teaching program and its too risky or time consuming to work through the more complicated stages with me. This is only during very busy periods. Other times my colleagues and managers are very helpful and encouraging. 


Having worked one year at this company i am concerned whether i should be spending these prime years (i have just turned 25 and will have been a graduate for 2 years next summer) in a more structured graduate scheme. 


I am essentially asking for advice from those who followed a similar entry path into a career. Would a more structured position be more beneficial or equal in terms of career progression.


My current plan is to spend another couple of years working, earning some money and hopefully assessing my progression but im worried that at the age of 27 and 3 years on from graduation, i will struggle to find positions suitable if i did intend on leaving.

20,Explain the features of a flood control dam,1451875173,"I recently visited the Tahchevah Flood Control Dam in Palm Springs ( [satellite](https://goo.gl/maps/PwpXQnd71pn), [description](http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19650424.2.13) ). It has an overflow conduit on one side, as shown in this [satellite image](https://goo.gl/maps/3F5ZUSoKEG72). 

It has several features that didn't make sense to me:

1. Why is there a small run-off channel that runs down the middle of the overflow conduit? It's the black line in the close-up map image above. Wouldn't a flood have to rise to some very precise level to exceed the conduit floor's height and start flowing through the conduit, but not be too large to overwhelm the small run-off channel? If so, that seems very unlikely, so why design/pay for such an unlikely situation? OTOH, if it's just to catch the rain that might collect in the conduit, the channel seems unnecessarily large.

2. The walls of the overflow conduit are very high, maybe 20 feet at their highest. Doesn't that mean a lot of the dam is unnecessary? That is, most of the dam above the conduit floor won't ever hold back any water because it will it instead flow out the overflow conduit. So why build it? Maybe it's a buffer so that if a sudden, incredible amount of water almost immediately filled the entire dam, then the conduit would allow it to drain out in a controlled way on one side of the dam. But is that much water that quickly possible? 

3. If there were no dam, a massive flood of water over that area flowing unchecked into the town would be devastating. But if the dam fills enough to overflow through the conduit, then at that point, all of the water entering the dam leaves the dam and flows into the town. So the dam accomplishes nothing at that point. It might direct it to the left side, but the water still floods the town.

4. A great mass of moving water can be incredibly damaging. But without the dam, wouldn't that mass be more spread out? Doesn't the overflow conduit concentrate the flow, increasing its damaging effect, just as putting your thumb over the end of a garden hose makes the water exit at higher pressure? 

5. Finally, if you zoom out on the map linked above, you can see the size of the canyon that the dam protects against. But it doesn't look very large. Could it really collect enough floodwater to necessitate this large dam? Panning around the map, it appears to my non-expert eyes that there are many other canyons in the area that are much larger and more extensive, so could generate more floodwater. But they don't have dams to protect the town...

I also would like to consider myself as on the customer's side, trying to understand their needs (current and future), and matching it to the relevant pieces of technology that we offer that is most feasible for the client.  I sit within a sales team, so the Sales reps are dealing with duties such as account management.  However, I am also encouraged to drum up business myself, especially as the technology is quite complex and needs some knowledge on the full capabilities and how it could be applied for clients.

One of my uncles, who ran a construction company for about 20 years and is now retired, lives near the lot.  He advised me that if I wanted to develop the land, ""it wouldn't take ....many thousands of dollars.  Maybe between 6k - 10k depending on whether you did concrete or gravel.""

Soon after this conversation I reached out to several general contractors in the area.  After about a month of dialog with one of them, they sent me a proposal, stating that they projected it would cost me $175k - $200k to build.  That is ...exorbitant.  This is Louisiana, and you could build a friggen nice house with that kind of money.

On New Year's Eve I was speaking to my best friend's father, who is an engineer, and his family does septic system installs.  I told him my tale of woe with the 200K proposal juxtaposed against the optimistic price my uncle provided me, and he says, ""Well, your uncle is probably right about that price, if you managed the project yourself.""  According to him, a project like what I'm proposing is mostly ditch-work, and he offered to to the septic and plumbing work for a $2500 ballpark, which I think is very reasonable.

In moving forward with this project, I think that I want to have a blueprint of what the lot would look like finished, and where the plumbing, electrical lines and outlets, gravel lots, laundry room, and etc should go.  Is there a particular breed of engineer that I should seek out to work on this for me? 

Thanks in advance for any advice.

If I'm understanding this source correctly, there is a greater temperature profile with superheated steam (since its sensible heat has to be removed to become saturated). Therefore, the temperature of the steam that makes contact with the surface is lower than saturated steam (saturated steam has a layer of condensate so this prevents it from reaching a lower temperature like superheated steam).

59,Structure supported by members with unknown/unobtainable K values. Need the correct reactions. How would you approach this issue?,1451584509,"Our office has been struggling with this issue for a while now.  We design these small foundations for equipment.  The equipment comes with its own mounting system - that contains elements that we don't get to see or inspect or test.  We've reached out to the companies who own the equipment, but they're pretty hit or miss on whether they'll respond to our requests for information on the mounting hardware.

The issue is this mounting hardware is playing a significant role in our design.  Literally, it can determine if our designs pass or fail during analysis.  On one hand, if we assume the mounting hardware is a rigid body, the forces put into our foundation are incredibly high and the foundation fails.  On the other hand, we can't just assume a rigidity and underdesign a foundation based on a bad assumption.

So, how would you handle this?  So far, we've been assuming the mounting hardware is a rigid body.  If the foundation design fails for this sole reason, then we write a blurb in the calc along the lines of ""based on engineering judgment and a lack of mounting hardware information...""

But there has to be a better way.  Any ideas on what approaches can be used?

Here is a quick sketch that simplifies the problem to help explain what I'm describing:  [SKETCH](http://i.imgur.com/4V2b2tK.jpg).

You can see in the sketch that if K1 &gt;&gt; K2, then the load distribution for Weq will be much different than if we just assumed them to be equal.  Our primary design criterion is weight, so, we're trying to minimize weight wherever possible, so we don't want to just beef up the foundation based on a worst case situation.  Yet, we still need it strong enough to resist the forces being put into it.

Any ideas or methods that can be used to find a correct load distribution with unknown K values would be very helpful.  Thanks!",AskEngineers,Goins2754,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3yxmjm/structure_supported_by_members_with/

I'm a CAD technician who works for a company that makes medical implants and instruments. It's critical that we hit our tolerances on our parts, and we accomplish our inspection measuring with a relatively new Nikon iNEXIV CNC measuring system (aka a glorified microscope with image recognition capabilities). 

I'll start off saying that I'm about 2.5 years into my ventures with CAD and engineering... so I hope I can explain everything thoroughly. =)  To start off, we have a Makerbot 3D printer and Universal Laser cutter/etcher that we use for our jigs and fixtures. Have Swiss lathes and a Hurco Mill... but the Swisses are constantly tied up and the Hurco is on the fritz.

We have a small part that is part of a surgical implant assembly, and while creating a fixture for a round part with a hole is simple... this part has ""fins"" on the front view, and we need to check the dimension from outer fin to outer fin, which is critical to it's functionality. The fins are shown in thinner dimlines, while the critical is in thicker dimlines and noted: http://i.imgur.com/xvPWw8E

My problem is getting these fins to align as true as possible on the front view so I can hit its tolerances on the iNEXIV. What we've done for other round parts is 3D print a base with a ""wall"" sticking up, and a post that extrudes horizontally for our parts to fit in... that way nothing rolls around. Now I understand that one could say ""Well, just turn it until it's as close as it gets.""... but the problem is that we might have to run 60 parts on the iNEXIV at a time, and aligning every part is simply not efficient. Initially I thought you could put some kind of stop under the fin to hold it true horizontally, but the fin only projects outward .0125"" from the cylindrical base (in the image, the right-most ""ring"", or the bottom of the part). While the resolution is high on our Makerbot and Universal Laser... that's still going to be a seriously difficult task to accomodate such a small size. The largest diameter of the part is .363in to give you an idea how small we're talking.

84,"Waterfall and Iterative Development, is it an eternal struggle?",1451457958,"I seem to be the only guy in my office who doesn't mind redoing CAD designs.  

I tend to work iteratively.  I'll do a first cut of a design, from sketch planning, to BOM generation, to creating parts, to finally assembly building, then see what works and what doesn't.  I'll do each phase 60%-80% in completion before moving over to the next.  I'll show my work to my coworkers as a sanity check and to get ideas.  Then I do the whole thing over in more detail, filling in the blanks.

My coworkers on the other hand tend to do more of a waterfall method, where each phase doesn't progress until there has been a semi-official review, with meetings, checklists, and spreadsheats filled out.  They tend to want all the information upfront, and won't proceed to the next phase without 100% confidence.  They tend to only want to do things once.

They claim I'm wasting a lot of time and I'm creating the potential for errors.  Funny thing is, I catch errors in what they make just as often as I do. They spend a lot of time after they've sent their projects out for fabrication, trying to fix errors when it comes time to integrate.  These are errors I tend to forsee.

They try to convert me to their side of the force, I try to convert them.  Is there some middle ground?  Or are we forever meant to be separate camps of people?",AskEngineers,throw_mm1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3yr7k0/waterfall_and_iterative_development_is_it_an/

88,Could space disposal of radioactive materials ever be practical?,1451440652,"Assuming that repossessing and reduction of spent fuels and misc high-level waste are done to their fullest, we'd be left with the nasty stuff with unpleasantly long half-lifes. 

One of the easy thoughts is to send it somewhere that will never be a problem, but there aren't that many options here on the planet surface, so that leaves deep earth disposal and out into the cosmos.

Clearly a conventional rocket presents many problems including:

1) A high risk of spontaneous deconstruction on the launch pad and spreading contamination.

2) Radioactive elements are heavy and would require an enormous amount of fuel to reach orbit. Directly leading to:

3) Good aim and a high amount of Delta V would be required to send the payload into the sun or at least to a planet we don't ever intend to visit, otherwise orbit would simply deteriorate and drop the mess back on us eventually.

I might've been drinking a bit and watching Scott Manley videos when he mentioned an old idea: the space cannon. The basic idea was to simply shoot a capsule out of a cannon, adding all the velocity at once instead of dragging around heavy fuel and engines. Naturally this doesn't work with humans and most equipment because they become a fine goo at such high G-forces, but a heavy metal canister of metal, powder or ideally vitrified material shouldn't have that problem. Problem 3 is still a factor, but if we took aim at one particular crater on the moon, we should be able to hit it with our current technology, and having an actual target means that risk of return flights is minimized. Granted, it might be a problem if we ever decide to go back to the moon.

Some sort of artillery in the .5m size range, likely a electromagnetic railgun seems like it would be the best option to test this, as smaller would be unlikely to survive the atmosphere and wouldn't carry enough to make it worth the effort, while systems larger than 1m would likely be too expensive to build and test. (I haven't done the math on that, just speaking from experience in manufacturing).

I guess the questions are as follows:

A) should I have posted this in /r/showerthoughts instead?

B) does it seem remotely practical?

C) what did I clearly forget or simply never learn?

D) would you rather drill a big hole somewhere and quietly forget about it, hoping never to have a bad earthquake?",AskEngineers,motoko_urashima,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3yq9ve/could_space_disposal_of_radioactive_materials/

94,Can i2c be used over 3.5mm stereo audio cables?,1451394966,"I'm trying to figure out a way to send instructions to several microcontrollers over a medium distance (~10-25ft). Audio cables are dirt cheap, and i2c is a reasonably easy protocol to implement, so I was wondering if that was viable? I've never seen a project using i2c over long distances, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. 

In addition to the SCK and SDL lines, do I need to send VCC or GND over the cable too, if each device has its own independent power supply? Or do they need a common ground?

**EDIT:** I was looking at DMX/RDM, and those protocols seem like a good fit for my purpose but 3-pin stereo cables are cheap and I already have plenty of them on hand. 
I want to control a bunch of slave devices from a single controller, don't need tons of throughput, but latency is somewhat important.

**UPDATE:** Alright, so the solution seems to be RS-485, probably using modbus on top of it. The [converter boards](http://www.amazon.com/uxcell-MAX485-Module-RS-485-Development/dp/B00FHG1QC8) are nice and cheap, avoiding the need to breadboard the max485 and just get on with experimenting.

What exactly is this test supposed to simulate? I know the answer is the vehicle's restraint systems, but is that it? 

I mean, other tests do that too, such as the 40% frontal overlap test, but that test creates realistic rotational forces that restrain systems have to deal with in real-world accidents. The 40% test pits a vehicle against a deformable aluminum honeycomb structure that mimics the front of another vehicle. This test clearly mimics what happens when you leave your lane on a divided highway and hit another car.  

Would a parallel real-life situation be one in which a vehicle crashes into the side of another vehicle? The sides of vehicles are engineered to be very rigid to preserve passenger survival space.

I have rather suddenly and unexpectedly discovered that my inheritance from my grandfather is...  Significant.  To the order of 30 times larger than I was expecting.  It might feasibly be enough to do something interesting with it, and I've always been a WWII buff.  Recently I've been getting into airsoft, and I wanted to take a serious look at building a replica StuG III, a casemated (turretless) tank destroyer/assault gun, for use in airsoft simulation events.

Some considerations:
It has tracks.  Tracks are complicated and hard to make.  Would using LEGO-esque hard rubber belts carved with tread be a workable solution?
It only has to stand up to airsoft pellets, so it could feasibly be made entirely out of thin sheet metal.
To further save weight, would it be feasible to build the base as a frame and then lay some hard plastic over that?
What kind of engine requirements would be necessary?  Ideally I'd like it to move at about 20 km/h or so.

first of all I apologize in advance if this isn't the proper sub. I hope someone will answer anyway, or point me to a better suited subreddit.

Anyway, I bought a boat. The boat is heated by a boiler with a pump that circulates water to the radiators. There wasn't any water in the system when I bought the boat, and so I filled it.

The system is filled through a tank, from which it is pumped to the boiler, through the radiators and back into the tank. The height/depth of the water in the tank should be constant if the system doesn't have a leak somewhere, right?

I added a picture to explain: http://i.imgur.com/QrOJz9j.jpg

And now for my question:

It's been two weeks since I filled the tank, and about half a litre of water has gone missing. I fear the system has a leak, but I hope it can simply be that the water has evaporated. The hole through which the water is filled into the system has been open the entire time. It is perhaps 8 cm. in diameter. The tank - and thus water surface - is 20x50 cm. The outside temperature has been between 2-10 degrees celcius, and the boiler almost hasn't been running at all in the two weeks.

I tried to calculate it using some webpages, but I couldn't figure it out to be honest.

Is it realistic that half a liter of water has evaporated from my tank under these conditions?

I have a few questions related to switching jobs on a fairly regular basis, i.e. every 3 to 5 years. All the advice I have gotten from previous co-workers while on co-op has been to do it. No exceptions.

I also just received a full time job offer from a company I have been working for part time the last 6 months. I will be starting after I graduate in May. 

This has been beneficial to me since I've been able to ask fairly nonintrusive questions about the quality of working there. The overwhelming consensus is that it's fantastic. This is coming from people who have been employed there from 6 months to 25 years. 

I really enjoy the work I do there and it is very close to my parents home, which I would like to buy sometime down the road.

http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1012v1/img/h1012v1_114_2.jpg

I am just a little confused on why this is. 

Is it because the heat energy gained from the burning coal includes the energy left over in the exhaust steam out of the turbine? Which is then subsequently lost when it is condensed backed down to saturated water? Am I understanding this right or am I completely wrong?

19,MRI Compatible Mouse Headphones,1451242955,"Hey there Engineers!
I'm on the verge of becoming one of you (only thesis missing) and need your help to do it!
So, my task, starting in February will be to build a set of MRI-safe mice headphones to use in auditive stimulation studies in a Neuroscience Lab.

What I have:

Willingness to learn new stuff

A hardware/software Engineers team in my lab that can help me with technical issues pretty much on the spot.

A good budget

4 months to do the task

What I lack:

Hands-on experience (I'm in Biomedical Engineering and, unfortunately we didn't have that much experiences with actual electronics stuff)-I have a solid theoretical knowledge though (I think).

My question to you is: What do you think I should start reading up on? Do you know of existing commercial solutions to this problem? What do they lack? How would you tackle this challenge? (I'm aware these are several questions)

Hoping to hear some cool answers from you!

21,How much will trying other career / life options destroy my future career prospects?,1451239882,"So I've been a proper little almost contributing member of society for most of my life. Slightly too proper. At school, I focused on schoolwork, at university I've sacrificed a fair amount of exploration of extracurricular and social life in favour of being an a slightly-weird all-assignment-turning-in person.

As a result I graduated a world leading institution in tech and landed a solid, well paying and intellectually challenging job as an embedded developer. 

What am I complaining about then? Well, it wasn't until I've started applying for jobs in my final year that I realized that this career might not exactly equal my passion. And after several months of working there I am coming to realise all of this is definitely not for me. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy solving technical problems a lot, it's just about the kind of lifestyle that it carries - it doesn't resonate with me particularly well. I'm being surrounded by people who are quite happy following a reasonable path laid out in front of them by the society - get job, get paid, get gadgets, get a flat, go on all-inclusive holiday, get a family, get a house, get more gadgets, go on more holidays etc. I'm not saying that path is a bad one. It just really doesn't fit in well with how I like to enjoy my life. I've had a chance to live in a tech-hippie almost-commune for a year while in college and that's the kind of environment where my heart is. A place where friendship, communality, creative freedom, technical project freedom are the key instead of a more individualistic approach of building one's family life with a do-what-you-must-to-earn-cash career-based foundation. I'd be perfectly happy working month on, month off for half the pay, but unfortunately this is not how the industry works.

This is something I am thinking now, at 24. But I also don't want to be a dick to my future self who might have a different priorities in 10 years. I'm not going to quit my first job right now, just after a few months in to go travelling or work on a farm. I was hoping to stay there for a 1.5-2.5 years, learn as much as possible and then leave to discover if something else suits me more.

The thing is, I'm concerned that by taking a few years off tech to travel / do research / try out other career I will be closing that door for the future me. Even if the thing I do after I quit my job is pursuing a tech start-up - I will still loose touch with the professional and proper side of things.

Is my concern legitimate? How much will I fuck over the Sanuuu of 2026? I don't think the danger will put me off trying to take time off professional engineering to try to find my actual passion (a lifetime of regret is not worth it).

In the meanwhile, I have received an offer from a top tier consulting firm on technology consulting, giving me manager level and 20% pay rise.

I am seriously considering this offer to turbo boost my career into management, and then return to industry in a few years time frame.
What I am not sure of though is, if breaking away from traditional technology company is a good idea for a career boost. As in when I return, i will definitely have less technology (operations) knowledge, but more management and sales experience.

Also, which kind of roles can I target once I return to industry.

30,Help Improve our Project for Mobility Challenged People!,1451133071,"Dear all
We (Maor Rosenberg and my co Vered Waksman) are Materials Engineering students at Ben Gurion University in Israel.
We are working on a project in the field of mobility equipments for people who are physically challenged (as elderly and temporary/permanently mobility challenged people).
As we work on this project we believe that we, as students, do not have enough knowledge in the field of mechanism and the human factor. So we would appreciate your help!
In our project we will build a kit that will be plugged on the typical (and the most primitive) walking aid (an illustration is attached down).
The most important component of this kit is a product that will make this walking aid to be able to help the user to go up/down stairs.
The product is a telescopic leg. The leg is made with “stop points” located in the most typical and standard heights of stairs. The user will be able to control and adjust the legs with bicycle brakes (or other kind of a brake), located wherever the user wants them to be.
After it is being plugged to the walking aid, it is very simple:
1.	The user puts the walking aid on the next stair.
2.	Once the user pulls the brakes, the two telescopic legs are released and fall to the previous lower stair.
3.	When the user reaches the last stair – he puts the equipment on the floor and pulls the brakes again – now the walking aid weight makes it to fall down to the ground, and closes the telescopic legs.
*While going downstairs: the user uses the devise in the same direction as going upstairs.
We will appreciate advises and ideas in making this product better: from the right kind of material to make the legs, through mechanism and human factor, and anything else you can think about.

At the bottom, a tee to a cleanout port and a connection to a vertical pipe ending at the height of the inlet. This would terminate in another valve for the output. Operation would consist simply of opening the inlet and outlet, pumping in new material and collecting the effluent, and closing the inlet and outlet. Finally, a large blanket of insulation around the whole. I think the small amount of ""waste"" heat from my water heater would help improve the digestion.

58,How to get involved in engineering abroad in hazardous/politically unstable areas as a recent college graduate?,1450929676,"Hey everyone,

As a competitive marksman, I've had multiple active or former military members as well as members of the defense community give me the same advice on several occasions, which is the following:

""If you're willing to travel abroad to hazardous or politically unstable areas (i.e. the middle east, Africa, etc.), then even an engineer just graduating college can get incredible, often 6 figure pay right away working with defense contractors, etc.  They can never find enough people to fill those roles!  You should get in on that while you still can!""

I just had that conversation AGAIN this morning, but as always that individual didn't give me any advice on where to actually look, or what I can do to take advantage of an opportunity like that.  As a recent college graduate and single person with no geographic ties, I would be very interested in traveling anywhere in the world for mechanical engineering work of that nature.  I think that an experience like that would be very unique, valuable, and a great way to start off my career.  Can anybody here offer me any advice, resources, or introductions to help me make that happen?

I'd be happy to provide any additional information as necessary, but here's some quick info about myself:  I graduated from UVA in 2014 where I earned a BS in mechanical engineering and two minors in aerospace engineering and engineering business.

73,Single Shot upon Power On Circuit,1450847396,"Context: I'd like my car to turn on the fog lamps whenever the headlights come on. Presently, the fog lamps are trigger with a button in the cabin.

&amp;nbsp;


My approach is to use a relay to simulate the pushing of this button. A circuit will momentarily close this relay when the circuit sees +12v from the headlight relay.

&amp;nbsp;


I have an Op-amp configured in comparator mode. V+ is tied to Vcc (~12 V), V- to gnd, and reference voltage of 0.5 * Vcc from a voltage divider going into Vp. On Vn, it is connected to the positive side of the capacitor on a resistor-capcitor network. I've sized the R and C so that the relay stays open for 1.5 seconds.

&amp;nbsp;


Simply put, the Op-amp saturates to V+ upon power up. When the capacitor charges to about 0.5 Vcc after 1.5 seconds, the Op-amp saturates to V- (ground). The output of the op-amp is in turn used to drive a relay.

&amp;nbsp;


I am simulating this circuit on 123d, and having trouble with the relay staying closed after 1.5 seconds. I suspect this is a bug in the software, since the volt meters show 0 volts across the relay coils. Can anybody take a quick look and confirm my suspicions?

75,5 Year Master's Dilemma: NEED ADVICE FROM EXPERIENCED ENGINEERS,1450834836,"To summarize my background, I am currently a sophomore studying mechanical engineering at Purdue. I received enough scholarships and financial aid that I won't be graduating with any debt. I am also a co-op for the U.S. Department of Defense and will likely be working there in the future as a full-time employee.
 
My school offers a 5 year BSME/MSME program and was thinking about pursuing it. Personally, I want to just get my Bachelors and start working but my parents insist that I pursue the 5 year program, which they are willing to pay for. My parents' argument is that an advanced degree will open more doors of opportunity in my career and that once I enter the workforce, it will be very difficult to go back to school. But my argument is that I can get a well-paying job just fine with only a Bachelor's degree and that the opportunity cost (salary/experience) of staying in school for an additional year is too high. I think that a Master's degree will definitely benefit people who want to go into upper management or do research, but at my current place of employment, I have no desire to be a manager and there is no research work available.
 
I've also thought about getting a master's degree online while working full time but I've crossed that out of my list of options. I would be absolutely miserable if I had to work an 8-hour day, come back home and do homework.

**I started with [Rustoleum Magnetic Primer](http://www.rustoleum.com/MSDS/ENGLISH/247596.pdf) and Naphtha**. By repeatedly thinning the primer and filtering the magnetite out with a strong magnet, I was able to rinse the primer from the magnetite, *creating a mixture of magnetite particles and Naptha* (and probably some trace amounts of resin still, but not enough to cause problems). I decanted as much Naphtha as I could manually and added some used fully synthetic motor oil (straight from the engine, it was oil change day), expecting the remaining Naphtha to evaporate from the mixture over time. **Now I have a mixture of Magentite and Synthetic Motor Oil** (with some naphtha until it evaporates).

So my problem is that while my mixture does do amazing things when near a magnet, it doesn't act like Ferrofluid. Instead, the iron particles condense and collect, removing themselves from the oil and creating spiky fins rather than gooey cones. Well, I figure that the problem is that the particles aren't 'suspended' in the oil, which I don't fully understand nor do I know anything about the chemistry at this point. That's why I am asking here.

I found one resource that explained the scientific method of creating ferrofluid, including an intermediate step of adding **oleic acid** and **ammonia**. This step creates what they describe as a 'soap' which works to suspend the particles in kerosene. I don't have oleic acid and I don't know how to get it; I also already mixed my iron with a bunch of motor oil. Must I use this oleic acid to suspend the particles, or do I need a particular kind of ingredient for my mixture? Can I use any kind of ""soap"" (maybe even a drop or three of some kind of shower wash)?

**In short: What suspends iron particles in synthetic motor oil?**

*EDIT: So apparently the go-to is Oleic Acid. I don't have any on hand, except I do, but it's in the form of bacon fat. Supposedly bacon fat is over 50% Oleic Acid, and my intuition is that everything in bacon fat is soluble in oils including synthetic motor oil.

1,"At the rated pressure, are tires more volumetrically full when it's hot outside or when it's cold outside?",1450728835,"With the changing temperatures, tire pressure has been on my mind lately. The other day, I noticed that my tires looked a little flat, but my car's Tire Pressure Monitoring System registered them to be at the appropriate pressure rating.

Let's say it's December and your tires are running low, so you add more air (increase mass) to raise the pressure to the 31 psig it needs to be at. July rolls around (temperature increases), so my car is telling me that my tires are overinflated. I let the air out (decrease mass) in order for pressure to be at 31 psig (equal pressure).

So if you use the ideal gas law and set both scenarios to the constant and then cancel out the same pressure, you would get a relation of V = mRT.

My question is this: **Would volume of my tire be greater in July or in December?** Mass has decreased, but temperature has increased. Which would affect volume more?

This has been racking my brain. I thought you all might be able to be of assistance.

7,Chromated aluminum corrosion in chilled water system,1450715866,"Hi All,

I'm working with a system that has had flow issues over time. [See here for detailed description.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3w484t/chilled_water_circuit/)

This system breaks the flow into 32 individual flow paths which go into individual ""heat exchangers"". These heat exchangers are made of aluminum which is chromated with hexavalent chromate.

Initially this system ran well with only tap water (PH ~7.5), but over time each stations flows have degraded. We moved to a 30% propylene glycol solution to combat this, but the issues kept occurring. 

Today we took the heat exchangers apart and saw an incredible amount of corrosion and junk build up inside the flow paths. [See pictures here](http://imgur.com/a/3dSg3).

These heat exchangers are made up of a top and bottom which are hex chromated aluminum. They are joined by 18-8 stainless bolts (do not touch fluid), and sealed with RTV. The heat exchangers are electrically isolated from each other, and the chiller.

I'm trying to find the authoritative industry standards for user speed performance on ADSL2.  I've tried looking through the official standard - ITU G.992.3, but while I'm finding electrical performance specifications, I didn't see anything regarding user speeds.

Specifically, what I'm looking for is the minimum and maximum speeds that fall within any given level.  For example, I know that generally speaking, 15% is assigned to overhead.  So for a 10 Mbps line, you wouldn't expect to see more than about 8.5 Mbps.  But what is the bottom end of the range, beyond which is considered to be failing to meet the standards for a 10 Mbps ADSL2 line?

I'm looking for an authoritative source for this information.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?

I'm here seeking advice on controlled heating elements for a test vessel I am working on.

I am having issues reaching target temps (250F to 650F) in a timely manner.

68,Help me win a bet with my boss - Does a submersible probe measuring water pressure need line-of-sight to the surface to work accurately?,1450397367,"So here's the situation. When dealing with wastewater pumping, sometimes they will use a submersible probe that gives them a reading they use to calculate the water level in the container. The same formula apparently works no matter the volume of the container. My boss claims - and I believe him - that the same reading means the same #feet of water in any given container.

But! He also claims that the probe is ""weighing"" all of the water directly above it to achieve this. We debated for a bit, and he drew an hourglass shape, and drew the probe under the lip of the hourglass. He claims that the probe would not read accurately because it isn't looking at all of the water that is technically above it, the bottleneck separating it from line-of-sight of the top of the water.

That's ridiculous, right? There's no way that it's actually measuring weight, but pressure. So the probe *MUST* give the same reading whether there's a solid surface above it or not. Right??

90,Attaching a Disc on a Shaft,1450340526,"Hello all,

I have an issue regarding attaching discs on to a shaft. So I have two discs (acrylic for now, later will be of stainless steel) of different diameters (17 in and 18 in) and they have to be attached to two different shafts. In order to do this, I've made a solid shaft which has a 20mm OD and another hollow shaft with a 30mm OD and a 24mm ID so as to allow the solid shaft through it. The discs will be attached on these shafts with the 17in disc on the 20mm shaft and the 18in disc on the 30mm shaft. These discs will be on top of one another, with the distance between them varying from 1-2 mm. 
The heights of the shaft are 
Solid Shaft - 155 mm
Hollow Shaft - 77 mm

I've attached a picture if it helps to understand the problem. 
http://imgur.com/a/ZMSv6

I have two questions:
1) how do i go about attaching the discs onto the shaft? The discs are flat, so my thinking was have a small circular hub with a bore the size of the shaft and drill 4 holes through the disc and the hub and screw them together and then use a grub/set screw to attach it onto the shaft.  I don't have a lot of distance to play with so the hub is going to be around 5-6 mm (max 10mm) in height.

2) Since the disc is large, I am sure it will wobble at the ends no matter how securely I fasten it to the shaft. How can I go about preventing this wobble at the ends of the disc? The distance between the discs, as mentioned before is 1-2 mm. Can I provide a stable surface for the discs? There isn't a lot of weight on the discs (medicinal tablets fall on the plate) but from past iterations I've always noticed a slight wobble. 

Tablets (medicinal) will fall on the upper disc, I have a stopper/brush that brushes the tablets from the top disc onto the bottom one, where they will eventually go out from onto the rest of the machine. The speed of the upper disc will be around 40 RPM and the lower one will 20-25 RPM.

Any help/ideas would be appreciated.

I know they had just done utility work in the area (from what I saw replacing a water line) and repouring the sidewalk. The sound was coming from one of a trio of manhole covers labeled gas.

I don't smell gas, and the setup to me says that it's a T junction. Probably they closed the valves and shutdown part of the system. When they opened them after the work they didn't open one all the way and when they re-energized the system the gas is now hissing past the partially open valve.

But I don't know for sure so I dial the police and have them come and get the gas company to check. I didn't hang around but I did take the fifteen minutes to get somebody out to check a possible gas leak.

In the process a ton of people walked past and looked at the cover. Once I got home I even mentioned it to my roommates and they say they walked past it and thought of calling but didn't.

How do you organize your files so that it is concise as well as descriptive in being able to include revisions and special fixture use and so forth? (examples?)

What resources to you use in your design work for small assemblies and doing DFA analysis?


What resources do you use that you couldn’t do your job without?  We are getting a nice CMM soon, so that will make things nice in reverse engineering prototypes to create models and technical drawings for them.  

What resources do you use frequently, and what for?

I'm making a foot pedal and I need to be able to measure the position of the pedal. The [design looks like this at the moment](https://imgur.com/86dejyU), part B will attach to a larger base plate and the torsion spring will attach to the pedal (P) and the base block (B).

Right now the pedal moves freely over the [axle bolt like in this gif](http://imgur.com/XlYPnIR) (spring is not animated yet).

My questions are:

1. Is this a decent design

2. How do I measure the position of the pedal?

I would prefer to use a [magnetic sensor](http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/6127V1A180L.5/987-1387-ND/2620657), but these ones are very expensive and I'm not sure how to connect the shaft to the pedal.

Then I wondered if perhaps that heat could be captured and used to generate more power via a heat engine, or maybe drive another process, like solar graywater distillation or an absorption chiller. I've been scouring the internet for more ideas about feasibility, because it seems entirely plausible, but I've come up with zip and my brain won't stop running. 

* roughly how far would the concentrating lens have to be from the photoelectric cell to be ideal?

* what would make a decent heat sink? I originally thought of aluminum plate in thermal contact with a Stirling engine, but it seems to me that such a solution might not dissipate heat quickly enough to keep the cell at working temperature. 

* would it be more efficient for the entire array to track the sun, or simply having the focusing element track the sun? I've been unable to dig up a good explanation of Fresnel lenses and how they work at angles, but I would assume the former.

**EDIT 2: added [another diagram](http://puu.sh/lXp0j/e8b0c6e918.png) for input/output clarification**

Hi everybody!

I'm a first year student (after a few years off between high school and now). I haven't taken any physics or engineering classes yet, so bear with me. Sorry for the wall of text.

I'm part of a student-lead group that is designing a suborbital payload that will launch on a NASA sounding rocket in August (we are totally **extra curricular;** our only ties to school are a loose administrative framework that ensures that we're covered in case anybody gets hurt building the thing. This is not a homework/school assignment question).

We are working with some pretty severe constraints, and are trying to come up with an ultra compact, but still highly robust mechanism that will drive some mechanical booms. The mechanism has a 1.75"" height constraint, and a 12"" diameter, and we need at least 11.5"" of extension on four booms. Furthermore, the mechanism will be exposed to hard vacuum, and brutal thermal transitions (+/-200°F in a matter of seconds).

Underneath the mechanism is a sealed enclosure that will house a couple of side experiments, the flight computer, and a motor to drive the mechanism up top. The motor shaft will pass through the ceiling of the enclosure with a dynamic seal (lots of o-rings and silicone grease).

The mechanism we hope to implement is a planetary gear drive where the ring gear is toothed on both sides. The outer ring drives four pinions, and their racks.

[Here's](http://imgur.com/dYDIR9U) a quick little diagram I made. And [here](http://imgur.com/rWd4h7x) is my 3D model of the mechanism. Modeling the ring, sun, and planet gears' teeth in TinkerCAD is something I don't have the patience for, so use your imagination.

The sun gear is the input, and the planets are constrained so that they rotate the ring gear. The outside of the ring gear is also toothed, and contacts some small pinions, which then drive the racks which are attached to the booms we are trying to extend.

Speed is not a concern. In fact, there's a speed limit of 1""/s. This is my own design and I know next to nothing about gears and ratios and all that jazz, other than the fact that they're pretty complicated. BUT, we're not looking to do any exact reductions or anything like that. We just need a way to drive those satellite gears all the exact same amount, at the same speed. The only thing we need to retain is the torque necessary to articulate the booms because there will be about a pound on the end of each boom, maybe more.

**So, my question is this: I know that when you drive a small gear with a large gear, the torque is reduced, and vice versa if the small gear is the driving gear. But if a planetary gear set is the one driving the large gear, what happens to the input torque?**

Problem was this was another 6 month contract, contract ended this October and I've been eating up my savings trying to pay for rent and making ends meet ever since. 

I've had 3 interviews since and everyone keeps asking me about why I've been through three jobs in such a short timespan. I explain that two of those were contract jobs and the other job was not the right fit for me. 

It's now been almost 3 months without a job and I'm starting to think working these contract jobs makes me look like a job hopper and a risk to hire.

37,Is it possible to run a (50 HP) screw compressor at a lower speed ?,1450162532,"Hi,

I've been looking for a good air compressor for my shop.

I'm a cheapskate and I set the budget at 1000$ for something that can deliver at least 40CFM@ 125 PSI.

I found a ""50 hp g/d turbine"" with 84'000 hours on it for 1500$.

Kind of over my budget and power requirements but it's the best deal yet in this market where many 5HP piston compressors ask for 1000$.

Looking at a recent [Gardner-Denver Integra screw compressor](http://www.gardnerdenverproducts.com/assets/0/180/132/188/476/484/0262c80c-5f4d-4238-8d27-b6fd37070ca5.pdf)
that much power should put out about 193 CFM@125PSI when new.

This is more than I actually need, I'll have 300 gallons of storage tanks (40 cubic foot) and this would fill them in 12 seconds. This kind of high performance simply isn't needed here and the power requirements simply will bring in more costs.

I only have 1 phase power so to run this with electricity I would need a rotary phase converter (home made of course) which means buying a 65 HP electric motor ($ouch$) as well as about 200$ worth of capacitor, plus housing, plus special relays and other stuff, I'm looking at another 1000$ minimum if I get lucky on a cheap 65 HP motor. That's too much !

I have another option, to run it off an air-cooled gas powered motor. I found such a motor a 40 HP Wisconsin brand motor with clutch and electric starter for 450$, now we're talking !

So I could hook that up to the screw compressor but a 40 HP motor on a 50 HP load, it will stall or break. 

So I need to spin the compressor slower and this is my question

What happens when you run a screw compressor slower ? 

Does the sealing action of the oil on screw stop working ? 

Will the air/oil separator still work effectively at a lower flow rate ? Will lubrication still work properly (assuming the compressor's oil pump runs off the input shaft) ?

Can I run it slower even than the speed required to make it a 40 HP load ? 

Even at half the power that should still fill the tanks in 24 seconds (Barely enough time to get the engine hot, and that's probably a bad thing (? or are stationnary engines better at dealing with many cold start for short durations ?))


Any insight would be appreciated, thanks !",AskEngineers,shodanx,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3wwqog/is_it_possible_to_run_a_50_hp_screw_compressor_at/

How big can we safely increase the size of the bubble? Can we make it large enough to become a temporary under water house? If one of these bubbles is suspended just above a surface, the surface can become the floor of the room, and the area would even be large enough to furnish.

92,Is there a valid reason for my lead to conclude that a flaking of varnish vs a dissolving of varnish is a preferable defect on a part?,1450043634,"The part in question is steel protected by varnish. The part is run through a cleaning solution, and by changing some variables, we can get two different types of defect.

In the first type, the varnish is removed from the steel in chips or sheets. It appears that the wash is able to get underneath the varnish, flaking off in larger pieces. When the part is dried, the remaining varnish is adhered to the surface (this is by visual inspection only, no testing to confirm), but there are areas where chips have shifted position and then adhered. Some of these chips can be peeled off.

In the second defect type, the varnish appears to be dissolved at a uniform rate. There are some areas of bare steel where the original coating was thinner, and the varnish at the edge of the bare areas is still adhered to the steel.

Leaving aside the obvious that we need to focus on preserving the varnish coating rather than arguing about which failure is better, can I get some opinions as to why a flaking defect is preferable to a dissolving defect? We have seen no obvious visual difference in total varnish coverage remaining after either wash method. My lead has not been able to explain why he thinks flaking is better, and before I challenge his view, I'd appreciate some perspective.

2,3D Printer Design Anti Z Wobble,1450005722,"Hi guys, hope I can ask this here. Let me explain my issue:

I've spent a lot of time designing my 3D printer and I've spent so far a fair bit of time building it, slowly purchasing the parts and getting it all together. Today I installed my 600mm lead screws for the Z axis, there's two of them on either side of the build platform which is also guided on each corner with 12mm rod. (The lead screws are in the middle on two sides.)

I noticed there's a bit of wobble (Slightly bent lead screws). My reprap uses the same lead screws, but they're 300mm long so it's probably not so much noticeable, but it definitely is with these 600mm rods.

I want to come up with a solution to 'z wobble' as it seems to be called. I was wondering if I could use some material (Nylon?) that I could attach to one side of the lead screw nut, and another piece on the mounting bracket and use some sort of lubricant so it can slide a little in all directions while the platform stays still being held by the four guide rails? And then downwards weight of the build platform will keep everything level and stable. I would have to stop the nut spinning though, so maybe encase it in something that can slide on one axis, and encase that in something that can slide on the other axis.

But I'm open to ideas and trying to think of other stuff I could do. I was thinking perhaps a spring but as printing goes on the weight would push downwards and cause artefacts. ",AskEngineers,89387435,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3wmymq/3d_printer_design_anti_z_wobble/

9,Waveform Sampling Question - Why does the amplitude of the peak frequency stay constant given different levels of aliasing?,1449957198,"Hey all, engineering undergrad here (Mechanical Engineering) with a signals/sampling/electronics question. 

**Some Background:** For a mini ""create-your-own"" project at my school my group decided to take a clip of a song and look at what happens to the waveform when you resample that clip at different sampling rates. We performed a Fast Fourier Transform on each of the new waveforms and looked at the location of peak frequency. Unsurprisingly, the peak frequency got smaller as the sampling rate got smaller. We also saw that, at these peak frequencies, the amplitudes were the same .

**The Question:** Why does the amplitude of the peak frequency stay constant even when you resample the waveform at lower and lower sampling rates?

Note: We were using a Labview VI to resample the songs and another LabView VI that used the Signal Measurements Express VI to utilize the FFT. ",AskEngineers,Starfishburns,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3wkera/waveform_sampling_question_why_does_the_amplitude/

12,"Question for mechanical design engineers: What portion of your job is actually design vs. creating/updating documentation, dealing with engineering change processes, etc.",1449938630,"Sorry if I'm putting this question in the wrong place/time. If I'm in the wrong sub please point to my the right one!

I graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering 2 years ago. Since then I've been working as a design engineer for one company. I like some aspects of my job, but at the end of the day I feel like lately I've been doing so little design. I'm wondering if its the right for me to find a new job, or if this kind of the norm.

A recent example: I worked on a new design where I spent about **two days** doing calculations, 3d modeling, and FEA. Within the next 2 weeks we prototyped, tested it, and it passed. Then the next **2-3 months** were spent making 3d models for all configurations, making drawings of all configurations, updating the top level assemblies, updating installation documents, updating configuration documents, drawing reviews with mfg, design, and installation; updating SAP, and just in general a lot a lot of engineering change process stuff. Now it goes to be manufactured, and it wont be actually sent out to the field for another **3-4 months**! I find this entire thing so frustrating. Its not even a safety critical component that would require special attention.

I'm really only interested in the very first part, where I got to create it in CAD, calculate it by hand and FEA, and then test it. I'm less interested in the latter updates to documentation. I understand that they are important, but I don't like how big of a portion of my time it is. 

I also don't like the massive delay until the components will be produced (these are just sheet metal btw, not anything that requires special tooling like castings). The 4 month delay between drawing release and production takes away the gratification of completing the job.

So, are there jobs out there where you can really spend a lot of time doing actual design, and not documentation? 

Are there jobs out there where you get to quickly realize new designs and can quickly get the satisfaction of seeing them produced?

The figures claimed are, well, staggering &amp; could potentially be *game-changing*.

&amp;nbsp;

* 80% charge after 15min
* Extended range, even versus a Tesla
* 600HP, although this isn't really anything which truly prohibits EV use
* 0.60MPH, 3.2sec, again see above

&amp;nbsp;

**My question is, what with it requiring a substantial 800V charge station, likely developed exclusively for the Mission E by Porsche themselves (a potential limitation), is this car likely to be prohibited from becoming not only a commercial success but successful in terms of driving the growth of EV?**

&amp;nbsp;

As an engineering student, therefore lacking the experience &amp; industry in-sight to truly judge, I see potential barriers due to the requirement for a specific charging station, branching technology &amp; the distancing from the more *universal* charging voltages of the Tesla (I say universal as they publish their technology, as opposed to Porsche who'd likely keep it secret) and the potential for those who can actually afford these cars desiring to maintain their prehistoric, brute force V8's and V10's. That said, with companies such as [Ford](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/12/11/ford-stirs-ev-pot-4-5-billion-new-evs-batteries-fast-charging/) increasing investment into EV's and with companies such as Tesla, McLaren, Ferrari &amp; Porsche proving there exists a demand for high-performance EVs, we may be on the cusp of a rapid growth of this market and I'm interested to learn more.

It is designed around 6"" diameter, 18"" long cardboard shipping tubes. They are on a drawer that slides out. 

The unit is 48""x14""x36"", and made of stainless 0.125, and plywood 0.75; there are 14 holes. 

This (random link) https://grabcad.com/library/mini-shredder--1 is what I'm envisioning for each hole. Each of these shredders would be connected on a common shaft (two really, one for each row) and be specialized for the application. In other words, the glass shredder might just be a bar, whereas the steel shredder would be fine toothed. The motor would be internal, and there would be a cord out the back.

I whipped up some very basic images of the concept, and I am looking for anyone with experience in shredding, shredders, recycling, ideas or concerns about the concept generally. I know exactly nothing about recycling. If anyone has any advice, let me know please! Thanks in advance.

Currently, our setup uses a small water tower hooked up using a self priming pump and hoses running across the ground.  This setup was only intended to be temporary while the construction of our lab was being finished, and we are now moving to the permanent system which uses permanent 4 inch steel piping that runs throughout the building.

We would like to use the same water tower, a [Cooling Tower Systems T-250](http://www.coolingtowersystems.com/t250towerspec.php) and we already have selected a pump with the appropriate head and flow-rate. Our only concern is the cooling tower.  The water lines in the building are all overhead (10 feet off the ground), but our water tower is at ground level (The basin is approximately 3 feet off the ground and the return line is approximately 6 feet from ground), so we are concerned that we may flood the cooling tower and drain the water lines when the system is opened.

Do you have any advice on how to set the system up so that it will work successfully? We're hoping that we can add some sort of check valve and avoid having to raise the entire cooling tower (which would be expensive and time consuming.)

Additionally, do you have any ideas on how to prevent the cooling tower from freezing? Currently, we have to drain the tower and pump to prevent freezing. All the pipes are heat-traced, however.  Thanks for the advice, and please let me know if you need any more information on the setup.

51,Trying to hang a climbing wall safely...,1449770739,"I'm looking to install a 12' x 7.5' climbing wall.  The basic construction is 3 sheets of 3/4"" plywood, with 2x4 and 2x6 framing and studs. The combined materials weight of the wall and a climber should be less than 500lb, but there is obviously some dynamic load when climbing.

I have an upstairs bedroom with a 45* vaulted ceiling above 8-10' vertical walls.  There is no attic over this one room, but a garage and I beam directly underneath, through the middle of the room, perpendicular to the wall I intend to use.

In order to allow varying inclination, my design is to foot the wall on the floor against the wall, and hang the top from the wall or ceiling.  The interior, almost certainly non-load-bearing wall (garage underneath) meets the ceiling ~10' up (and continues at 45* up to 14').

This means the wall will never be quite vertical, but should be able to be lowered to about 45* for harder bouldering than I can currently manage.

My best plan so far is to expose 80"" of ceiling just where it meets the wall, attach (bolt? screw?) a 2x8 or 4x4 across the entire width, and bolt some mount for chain/cable to actually suspend the climbing wall (probably both chain and cable, one for raising/lowering, one for holding the load).

I have not yet checked, but as the roof peak above this part of the house is also 45*, I'm guessing it's a vaulted parallel chord construction.  These seem less common, and I can't find the usual force diagrams that are everywhere for normal attic trusses.

From some basic calculations, it looks like the bulk of the weight will always be on the floor, but at extreme angles, the climbing wall will have both vertical and lateral dynamic loads.  I am mainly considering using the ceiling instead of the wall because of concern for these lateral loads.

Is this at all sane/practical, or is a ton of reinforcing going to be required for a roof that probably supports little other than moderate winter snow?  Should I use the wall as far up as possible instead?  Is the floor itself at risk (one corner of the wall will be almost directly over the center of the I beam below.)  Do I just need to consult an actual structural engineer who can perform the necessary exploratory surgery?

ill keep this short and sweet. Im reverse engineering an assembly of 2 parts jointed together by a pressed collar.

6mm thick copper plate held flat with another thinner piece of copper with a copper collar. 

So it appears that the assembly process of this is to press the collar in and then swage or press blank (term?) one end to deform it outwards and keep it in. This process also deforms part of the copper too, which i imagine is a straight thru hole previously.

What i want to know, is there some sort of theory or way of theoretically calculating the original dimensions of the collar before this assembly process? I will have to produce a drawing for the unpressed collar to be made. I just want it roughly right, and i know the final supplier will help me get to this point, but i figured there might be some deformation equations i can use in the mean time?

I was studying some mechanics, and while searching for the formula for bending stress in a pipe, I came across this image: [image](http://www.gliderengineering.com/laboratoridenvol/info/tech/tubes/max_bending.jpg)

found on this page: [page](http://www.gliderengineering.com/laboratoridenvol/info/tech/tubes/tubes.en.html)

So I got confused by the equation labeled for stress:  sigma = My/EI (units don't make sense, it seems it would become dimensionless)

I was under the impression it would be sigma = My/I (the units would make sense here as well)

This error carries on to the final equation as well, an extra E is put in everywhere after that. 

Am I correct in my thinking? I do not see any benefit of dividing stress by Young's modulus, unless the author meant to find strain, in which case the labeling is incorrect for the equation.

After looking for a year for a job out of university (I live in Ontario and engineering job market is pretty bad). I finally found a job at this small manufacturer as a design EIT. It's mostly a glorified CAD technician position with below par contract (38k salary), but I wasn't in a position to be picky after a year. 

Now I'm 1 year in at this job, and the only one at the company with the technical background for automation.

 I am trying my luck here to modify my HTC Re camera for different application. Basically just putting it into a case that is 50% shorter in length, same thickness,  and extends the image sensor into a smaller, cylindrical shape that mounted at the middle of the case. My main requirement is that most hardware functions (such as SD card support, reset button) as well as software function on mobile app (ios or android) work just as well after the modification. 

PCB, Battery and image sensor will have to be changed to fit inside a smaller case. My main concern is the replacement image sensor, while still capable of capturing 1080p video/ images, it also has to be smaller to fit into the new dimension at 7mm in diameter at the cylinder (from 1.5cm in diameter on the original Re Cam). Wide angle function is something that I don't need though, so the image sensing assembly could be smaller. 

Battery could be replaced with somethings smaller, and the PCB probably has to be shorter, so a customized one perhaps?

I have been working with the same group of engineers since leaving uni 6 years ago. The other engineers in the office do not go on long trips such as this, so don’t have any idea what is normal in the industry. What made me ask this question is that another engineer working in our Denmark office said I should be claiming back the weekends I work away as extra holiday days. The logic being that my work is preventing me from doing the things I would normally do at the weekends and I should be reimbursed for sacrificing my time. Is this sort of thing normal for UK engineers?

I have a job lined up with a small manufacturing company in Idaho, and the title for my job position is ""Mechanical Engineer"". So when I learned I passed the FE I got poking around the Idaho Board's website at their FAQ and found a question on titles an EIT/EI can use, this is what they said:

""The Board has expressed opinions previously that use of the title ""engineer"" is not protected, but use of any title that implies that the person is licensed is protected. Obviously ""professional engineer"" is protected, as would be ""licensed engineer"" or ""civil engineer"" or any other discipline preceding ""engineer"" in a discipline used for licensing purposes. The Board has previously expressed an opinion that the title ""Project Engineer"" is not protected, but if a person is certified as an Engineer Intern, their title should reflect the same with those words or the acronym ""E.I."" In this case, the use of the title ""Design Engineer"" would likely not be a problem so long as it included ""Engineer Intern"". Like some other states, the title ""Graduate Engineer"" would not be a problem, but again, tell the whole story and include ""E.I."" so no one will be misled regarding your licensure status.""

So do I need to ask my boss to change the name of my position from ""Mechanical Engineer"" to something that is ""&lt;not an eng. discipline&gt; Engineer"" instead? Or would ""Mechanical Engineer, EIT"" suffice since its clearly stating I'm not a licensed PE? Just looking for a little more clarification.

85,Industrial and/or Systems Engineering. Anyone here know anything about it?,1449638473,"Hello. I am a high school senior about to enter college at SJSU for Industrial and Systems Engineering.

A month ago, I was set on changing my major to Comp Sci. or Software Engineering because I have an interest in software and computers, but mostly because of it's great job placement and salary. But as I did more research on ISE, I thought that I might like this major and profession. Being that your a professional in this field, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

1. What is the job search like? If I attend SJSU, which is a pretty reputable University in Silicon Valley, and get good grades, is it pretty simple to land internships and jobs after college? How saturated is the job market for ISE? I read that a lot of ISE's are unemployed somewhere :P.

2. Do you love your job? Is it fun?

3. If you don't mind me asking, what should I expect for the starting salary and my mid-career salary? Money is not everything to me, but it is pretty important. 

4. What are some skills I should learn or something I should do while in college to help my chances of succeeding at landing a job and doing well? I understand that this is a very broad field

5. I heard that it is very possible to become a Project Manager with ISE. What must I do to increase my chances to becoming a manager? I've always liked being in charge and being the one who makes sure stuff gets done, I think I have a natural talent for it.

I was given a old (1940) South Bend 9a lathe. It had an AC motor from a company that went out of business in 1931. I'm replacing this, along with all the pulleys involved for a directly driven DC motor, which will probably be 1hp motor @ 90v. The easiest place to mount the pulley will be at the back end of the spindle. The only problem is on these lathes, the gearing for the lead screw is at the back end, which is cut into the spindle.  I was originally going to turn down the gear teeth to a smooth shaft and add a key way, but the shaft is hollow to allow for a collet so that option is out.  My next thought is to use a split hub pulley, but Im concerned with it slipping. I'm sure it won't becuase the torque isn't very high, but I would like to know for certain.

My younger brother is 15 years old and is starting to show an interest in engineering.

In terms of my budget, I really don't want to go overboard here and would like to limit it to something up to $30.00. I know that's restrictive, but it's what I've got to work with right now.

So, please, if you have any ideas for a gift for a young engineer, let me know. Thanks!

Students from years past have told us that staying under the page limit is the largest challenge.

My question is how do you and your design teams go about writing large reports as a team?  Do you break everything up and just fill it in over time, or do you all sit down and decide what will go in the paper as a team?  When there is a page limit do you shoot for going over the limit in drafts and try to cut it down or do you try to keep as low a page count as possible as you progress?

8,Question Regarding Launch Operations of Air Launched Liquid Engine Launch Vehicles.,1449554165,"The question I have is about LauncherOne and the newly announced Cosmic Girl mother ship. AFAIK, LauncherOne utilizes LOX and RP-1 for it's main engines for the first and second stages. [As far as I can tell from pictures, it looks like the Newton series engines are gas generator cycle engines](http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets_2/United_States_7/V.G._LauncherOne/Gallery/Newton_1.jpg) and the attitude control will solely be done using thrust vectoring. So, there does not seem to be any vernier engines, meaning there's no other types of propellants, notably hypergolics. [NSF](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/12/virgin-galactic-cosmic-girl-launcherone-aircraft/) states that it will take approximately 30 minutes from takeoff to the ""drop zone"". I'd figure taxiing and getting cleared for takeoff can add up 10-15 minutes from ""ready"" to drop and actual ignition of vehicle engines.

How are launch operations carried out specific to fueling the vehicle? Will a ground operator have to manually fuel the vehicle and detach the propellant lines prior to take off? Will the boil off from the LOX during the 30-45 minutes from fill up to ignition be significant enough? Is there reservoir of LOX onboard the mothership that will be used to continuously fuel the vehicle during ascent? How will safety of the operators and pilots be ensured during fueling? Won't more stringent certifications and testing similar to human rating the vehicle need to be done as there are human operators during the first phase of the mission? What are the contingency plans in case where an engine fails on the mothership? How easy will it to de-fuel in cases of emergency landings? Especially when landing in places without the fueling infrastructure?

Sorry for the delay in posting this, I had an unexpected work trip and didn't have time for the past couple of weeks. The holidays are probably going to mess things up a bit as well, so the next thread won't be posted until after New Year's.

This thread is the fourth in a series for engineers to talk about their work. Today's is for all the Chemical Engineers! Be sure to check out the previous threads, which are still open for responses — check below for links.

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**



### Timeframe

*(Skip this section if you don't care about how these posts are organized.)*

Unlike the original posts which only lasted 1 week per discipline, these will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted &amp;amp; stickied, but the old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Once all the disciplines have been covered, a final thread will be posted with links to all of them to collect any more responses until archived. The current list of disciplines:

This should be a simple question /I think/ however my colleagues have found a way to make this seem more complicated. We are negotiating for a contract and have received a requirement that all of our measurement equipment must be 4X accurate for what we are trying to measure. Typically we spec accuracy as a percentage.

Questions:

1. How does the 4X requirement work? I have heard various descriptions including dividing the last decimal point by 4 and an explanation that 4X = 400%.


2. When given an accuracy for an instrument in percent (5% for example) how is that translated to 4X? (this may become obvious based on the answers above)

3. Is it typically accepted to rely on the equipment calibration data (and what standards the equipment was calibrated to?) for these types of requirements? ",AskEngineers,shhitwasntme,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3vsio6/contract_accuracy_requirements_what_is_4x/

30,Help with coming up with an hourly rate and 3-D software to help physician bring his medical device idea to market?,1449489143,"Hi r/askengineers,
       I was wondering if you could give me your input on a couple of things. Quick backstory: I'm a recent college grad with a bachelors in biomedical engineering. Currently, I'm working as a technician for a former J&amp;J company on large, automated processing equipment (not really related to my major unfortunately). Last Friday, I met with a doctor in NY who told me he wanted to hire an engineer as a contract worker to help bring his idea of a medical device to market. He didn't have any specifications for me, other than that end goal (we did discuss making a 3-D model of it too and filing for a patent). Therefore, I'd be coming up with the design and execution of this project plan as well. I would be able to work from home and bill him the hours I spent working each week, which he said would probably be between 8-10 hours per week (my full time shift ends at 2:30 PM so I'd have the late afternoon/evening every day to work on it). Overall, the doctor is well established in his field and seems like a very outgoing individual as well.

Now for the questions: He told me to spend a week researching on an hourly rate that I'd like for him to pay me to do this job. I really have no idea what to ask. He said he would also do some research so that we could negotiate the terms but I want to give a respectable offer without going too high or low. I think this would be great for my resume, especially considering I don't have a full time engineering job right now.

Also, since I mentioned 3-D modeling, would I have to use a modeling program like Solidworks? I'm not overly skilled at it (haven't used it much since my Freshman year of college) but I'm sure if I spent time on it I could figure it out. I spoke with someone over the weekend who mentioned using sketchup for the 3-D model. 

TL;DR: Recent college grad in BME, who is working full time (non-engineering position). Met with a doctor regarding a contract engineering position to bring his idea to market and file for a patent. My role includes designing and executing the project plan, doing research and making a 3-D model of the device. Id be spending 8-10 hours per week on this. 1. What hourly rate should I ask for? 2. What 3-D modeling software should I use? I can use solidworks but I'm not very proficient with it. Sketchup has been mentioned to me as an alternative.

Any input on this would be much appreciated, thank you for reading.",AskEngineers,JanMoses,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3vs4ts/help_with_coming_up_with_an_hourly_rate_and_3d/

My largest worry is that, if I so choose not to continue service after this time, I will be re-entering the engineering work force at 36 or 37 with no relevant engineering experience over the past 8-10 years. Why on earth would anyone hire me? My initial thoughts are to use benefits to get an engineering masters degree and go from there in rebuilding my career. This is an opportunity that I don't want to lose, but I also don't want to lose everything I've worked towards up until now. There was the thought of reserves, but no company is going to want to employ an engineer who randomly leaves for a day here, a week there, or a few months to go play pilot.


Tl;dr Applying for a flight position in the airforce. Would be leaving engineering for 8-10 years. Is it feasible to get my career back on track when I return?

I recently helped build a small art gallery for an employer, and really had a great time with the whole structural design process. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, I've started designing other types of buildings for fun. 

I've tried sketchup, which was intuitive, but seems to be limited in terms of shape complexity and kind of just lacking in overall realism.

My question is, when you come across a problem that makes you go ""There has to be a better way."" when do you go out searching for that better way? Quite often I realize these during a time crunch, so finding it immediately  seems out of the question (but it may not be). Do you begin your search after the task is done and before starting the next project? Or do you dedicate some free time on the weekend or something to learn a new job-related skill?

11,File Management Methods for Small/Mid Engineering Firms?,1449082529,"Hello,

I work for a small structural engineering firm (30-35 engineers) which is constantly working on multiple projects (we probably work on roughly 800 jobs / yr).  We currently have setup our file management system on a Windows Server 2012.

We use a directory based system such as:

Projects --&gt; Company Name --&gt; Project Number - Project Name

E.G. C:/Projects/Apple/APP 013 - Apple 6S

We have subfolders in each directory where we split analysis, calculations, inputs and drawings.

Our problem that we run into is that it becomes difficult to keep track of every job (or reference back to previous work).  We have a microsoft access file that keeps track of basic info (company name, brief description) and is searchable. Then you can also go to the projects folder and search through there with ctrl+f. But with thousands of emails and thousands of jobs, if a client comes to us and asks ""have you done any work at this location"" or you know you did something similar a few years ago; it's difficult to find that past work.

I'm wondering what other mid-size firms use and if anyone has found a better solution to file management w.r.t. engineering work.

Thanks!

24,[Mechanical] What are the necessary parts for attaching a robot wheel to a drive motor and drive train?,1449041217,"I'm an EE student but I'm designing the chassis and drive train for our robot (and designing all in SolidWorks before making any purchases). We are doing a 4 wheel drive and 2 motor tank drive design. To reduce cost we are not purchasing gearboxes and also using 2 motors instead of 4. 

The only major problem I have in terms of researching and picking parts is that I don't know the necessary parts (like gears and shafts) or even the proper procedure for attaching the drive motor's shaft to a gear and chain and that to the wheel. I'm having a hard time to even find good info on the internet. Maybe I'm searching the wrong terms. The only images that keep popping up are complex stuff for cars.

This image shows what our chassis might look like: http://i.imgur.com/e4tsFaw.jpg, minus the gearboxes and two motors.

Our motors will be laid out similar to this configuration: http://i.imgur.com/bnywfKo.png, except here they are using 3 drive motors on each side and 6 wheels. Our robot will also have the wheels on the outside of the frame. From this image you can get a good idea of what I have in mind for our drive train but I'll do it for only 2 wheels each side.

My major questions:

1) What shaft/rod do I put into the wheel hole/hub and keyway? I don't really understand how to attach a gear to it to not only keep the wheel in place but also make the gear spin the wheel.

2) For mobile robot designs where the wheels are on the inside of the frame there are ""things"" to hold the wheel in place on each side, where as designs where the wheels are on the outside (like a car) the wheels are held in place only on the side of the frame. What do I do differently, if anything at all, to keep the wheel in place like in the first image? It looks like there is a washer and screw on the outside but it's hard to tell.

This is the wheel I have in mind: http://i.imgur.com/NS6yy4p.jpg. EDIT: Actually according to the seller of this wheel it comes with two steel discs for holding the wheel in place on the end of a 3/4-inch shaft, and a 1/4-inch key is also included. I still don't know how to actually ""install"" any of this though.

25,How would you best calculate the coefficient of discharge when determining product (natural gas) loss through a hole in a long range transmission line?,1449038990,"Using an [equation](http://i.imgur.com/msUmBhy.png) it is quite simple to calculate the rate of mass loss from a pipe at constant pressure to atmosphere but in order to do this somewhat accurately (While assuming that the gas in non compressible) I need to have a good assumption for the Cd value. I have the following guideline as provided by Lees (1986)

(1) For sharp-edged orifices and for Reynolds numbers greater than 30,000, the
discharge coefficient approaches the value 0.61. For these conditions the exit
velocity is independent of the hole size.
(2) For a well-rounded nozzle the discharge coefficient approaches unity.
(3) For short sections of pipe attached to a vessel with a length-diameter ratio not less
than 3, the discharge coefficient is approximately 0.81. 

but I am having a problem with wrapping my head around the terminology i.e.  sharp-edged etc.

* Good salary just with an undergraduate degree.
* Ability to create cool things. (creative nature of the field)
* You help make the world a better place using science

Some of the engineering students had done advanced maths in high school giving them a solid foundation. So they find  the subject not very difficult.

Others either not having done advanced maths before or due to poor in math skills  find engineering very difficult.
Most of them work extra hard and eventually become successful engineers. However, there is a large proportion of them who drop out of engineering and switch to a different major.

I assume that everyone here decided to stay in engineering. So my question will be hypothetical.

What career pathway would you have switched to if you found engineering too difficult?

Will you be able to satisfy all the reasons that got you drawn to engineering with the different major?  Please explain?

I am really interested in the ones who got into engineering because of the cool science stuff or to help make the world a better place as PRIMARY MOTIVE rather than the high salary.  If you only wanted a career with high salary then you would have gone to Banking.

54,Why is fracture toughness measured like that? How is the crack measured? How is the force applied?,1448945613,"I can't make sense of this. I read several tutorials, and they all say the same things - but these things confuse me. If it's more of a physics question, tell me, but it seems like something engineers would spend more time thinking about.

You take a chunk of cocaine, and you want to measure its FT. You start it with a crack 1 m thick, and increase pressure until the crack starts growing. This requires 1 MPa. So the fracture toughness is 1 MPa·sqrt(1m).

1) What is the crack like? Is it a flat split from one edge to the other, one meter deep everywhere? How would you make such a thing? If it's a regular jagged crack, then how can you talk about its size?

2) What are internal cracks? Are they ones that don't go from the left edge to the right edge, but are visible at the top? Are they completely internal, not touching the surface anywhere? Then what meaning does its length have, when width is not given?

3) You apply the force here. The crack is over there, and the force is transferred to it in a complex way. How do you tell what the stress is at the crack?

4) Why the square root?

5) There's a much more intuitive metric, which integrates the stress-strain curve to give energy per unit volume. This makes sense to me as the energy of intermolecular bonds that just got broken in the sample. Is there a simple conversion?

I'm from the East Coast and am currently working there as an engineer.  In September I applied for a position in the Midwest with a company that has a great reputation in the field I want to go into.  This company also has a (smaller) engineering office on the east coast.  

When I had my first interview with HR for the position in the Midwest they asked me if I would be willing to relocate.  I told them my priority was to switch industries and find a position in design, but my ideal location would be the East coast. I told them if I found the right fit with the right position in a company and felt comfortable with the company, I would be willing to relocate.  The process has taken over 8 weeks.

I’ve been applying to engineering graduate schools in the meantime.

Just recently (End of November) I had a technical phone interview with a group in the Midwest who was looking for an EE and a few days later was invited to their campus in the Midwest for a final interview.  

While this is exciting, and I do want to transition fields, I am not feeling comfortable with moving to the Midwest for this company. Unfortunately, I haven’t had much luck with companies on the East coast.   I’m unsure as to how to proceed with this new feeling, and need to make a decision as to what to do soon.  I don’t want to burn bridges with this company though.

Should I simply tell HR that something in my situation has changed and I no longer wish to be considered for the position, and ask if anything is available in the smaller East coast office?

63,Aerodynamics: Is drag behind a moving car a low pressure or high pressure zone?,1448927534,"Such as right behind a license plate or in my specific case the rear window of a Porsche 914. Since the air is moving slower it should be higher pressure, but it's also counter intuitive to what I've understood to be a drag zone (vacuum bubble, flow separation?) which would be a low pressure area?

Background: My buddy has a Porsche 914. Due to the shape of the car we were trying to establish whether the area behind the rear glass window is a low pressure or high pressure zone when the car is at speed (see picture below). He is an engineer and explains that since the air behind this window will be at a lower velocity the air will be at a higher pressure (Bernoulli's principle). I'm confused by this since I've always thought of this area to be a vacuum bubble created by drag, and therefore a low pressure area, making it harder for the engine to get air when the car is at speed (compared to a more efficient design). I'm not sure if it matters if we are talking about the air slipping over the surface of the car or just the general air around the car as if it were being tested in a wind tunnel.

My manager is more than happy that he hired me and everything seems to going well. I enjoy working at my current company and I get well along with my colleagues. I have heard some rumors going around that Q1/Q2 of this year was pretty rough (before I started working). There was some lay-offs and people are generally more alert about whats going on in the higher ups. 

A smaller competitor contacted me this week and offered a meeting over a lunch. One worker at my office just resigned to work for mentioned competitor. I asked him (in private) why he choose to change and he said that during his salary talk with our manager the manager had no idea what he has been working on throughout the year or how many hours he put in. The talks were less then pleasant and he got a very minor salary increase. Now, I know that this guy is good at what he does. And my opinion of our manager is that he is a cool guy. 

So I don't know what to make of this. I think that I will accept the lunch offer just to see what the competitor manager actually wants. Maybe say that we should keep in touch for future discussions? I don't want to have a reputation of being disloyal. It would be strange if I quit my first real job within the first six months no?

85,Magnetic Levitation with Hyperloop,1448821833,"Hi everybody. I was curious about if a system like the Hyperloop could effectively use maglev instead of air bearings to provide levitation. 

I understand that currently, maglev tracks are expensive to install and require a lot of electricity to operate. I also believe that there are two types of coils in a maglev track, one that provides levitation and one that uses induction to overcome the friction the train faces in the atmosphere. In an application such as the Hyperloop, the propulsion component wouldn't be necessary along the entire track, only 70 miles or whatever it says in the Hyperloop Alpha. 

Is there any information available that I could use to find on maglev that only accounts for the energy used in lift? I'm working on a paper and am having trouble finding information on maglev that isn't including both propulsion and levitation (a search term I could use?). Also, I'm sure that there is an efficiency coefficient associated with magnetic levitation. Is there a term for that that I might not know?

86,[Mechanical] Design of (rowing) test rig. Lots of questions.,1448821420,"Hey all,

I hope this qualifies as a valid question; it is part of my final year project however I believe it might be closer to graduate level in terms of engineering challenge. Whether that's the case or not, I'm sure having a hard time. 

I am designing a test rig to for research in rowing blade efficiency and rigging optimization for professional athletes. Current methods of this practice are (to my knowledge) limited to on-water instrumentation, which isn't ideal for a number of reasons. 

My design team want to design a test rig capable of recreating a rowing stroke in still water (as opposed to in a flume/with an actual rowing shell). Recreation a rowing stroke based on input parameters (such as athlete mass, rigging geometry, stroke rate, etc) will yield force values (theoretically) equal to those experienced if the same path was carried out by a rowing crew. 

We've spent the past two months doing research into the sport and the physics involved in the stroke, and are attempting to begin detailed design. Two prominent concepts exist at this time, one which mimics real-life geometry and uses force-based actuation to generate the blade path. It's relatively simple, but would be a lot bigger than we want due to a necessary ""track"". The second is a coordinate-based actuated system that uses the oar-blade interface as an origin and recreates the path in real-time. This will require control theory beyond my current understanding and will be more difficult to design and produce, but is much better suited to my supervisor's research. 

My problem is that, despite knowing what parameters effect the rowing stroke, and in which way, I cannot seem to conceptualize turning inputs into something the controller can use to control the actuators, having never worked with with this before. 

Using the shell(boat) velocity and stroke rate (oar angular velocity) we can fully constrain the blade path. The shell velocity itself depends on numerous factors. Everything in this problem is transient and confusing.

92,Help Finding the Right Pressure Sensor,1448739179,"Hello all,

I am trying to track down a pressure with the following specifics. The pressure sensor must be capable of reading pressures from 0 to 10 psi, with an accuracy of about 0.1 psi. However, the pressure sensor needs to be able to record and output a pressure value for a continuous force for up to 8 hours. We would prefer the sensor be as small as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

Since it needs to continuously output pressure values for up to 8 hours, my team and I ruled out piezoelectric and piezoresistive pressure sensors because based on our understanding, they only work with a short burst of applied forces, not a continuous force for 8 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone have any suggestions?

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: The application is medical in nature (being placed between a mask and a human's face). The force is a mechanical force on a solid object for up to 4-8 hours.

I have an acme threaded rod that I'll be using to move a counterbalance along a platform.  My plan is to press fit a cylindrical acme nut in a custom part to hold weights, but I'm trying to figure out how to mount the rod itself on both ends.  I've heard of machining the ends down, but I'm already planning on using about a 1/4-16 rod, so that might not leave much to mount.  Could I conceivably press fit the rod itself into a ball bearing, which is itself pressed into its mount?

Other considerations I've had in mind: using acetal conveyor bearings from McMaster, pressed into the mount (I realized these don't have moving parts, though, so it would just fix the rod); also, pressing another cylindrical nut into a ball bearing, then threading the rod through the nut and Loctiting it (or similar).

The rod won't be holding much load itself, since the weight is going to be on two tracks on either side.  Also, it will be used in a vacuum chamber in the milli-Tor range, so I need to keep outgassing considerations in mind; nonmagnetic materials are also heavily preferred.

3,how to keep a cat out of a closet,1448685464,"I don't know if this is the right forum, but I figure engineers might have some clever ideas here.

I have a wide bedroom closet with a 3-panel sliding door.  The doors are attached in a track at the top, but not at the bottom.  So, they slide left-to-right, and swing in-and-out at the bottom.

I also have a cat with one-eye and a bad attitude.  She likes to climb into the closet, up my suits, and jump into the ceiling (I have one of those shitty drop-tile ceilings, like an office building).  She then gets stuck up there for awhile, and it's a whole thing.

Here's what I've tried: 

1. Close the bedroom door (duh).  Obviously this works, but she sits outside the door and whines.  Plus, the heating in the bedroom (where my desk is) is terrible, so in the winter time this is pretty unpleasant.  

2.  Door-stops.  I bought a pack of 4 and have tried positioning them such that the door panels can't slide left/right or swing in/out.  This is OK, however, since my apartment is shitty, one of the doors is too high off-the-ground for the stops to stop.  She's also more-or-less figured out how to remove the stops &amp; open the doors (precocious little scamp).  

My goal is to find something (or even make something) that can stop the doors in all 4 directions from opening.

23,How important is mathematics to an engineering education?,1448531633,"Background: I'm an EE academic at a (highly-ranked) UK university. UK BEng degrees are only 3 years, and so we're constantly streamlining to fit in new modules that would be more attractive to students. Many of my colleagues feel that most maths is not necessary for 'real-world' engineering jobs.

At my university we have two 12-week teaching terms followed by an exam session. This is quite common in the UK, so teaching is quite intensive but it makes it difficult to cover everything. It's a constant fight against having certain modules dropped in favour of what's deemed to be more attractive, or more useful to the students.

There are constant arguments with regards to the need for maths in an engineering degree. Crazy I know, but the view from some quarters is that most engineers will never use any of it. I completely disagree, because if they don't use it directly, a good understanding of the foundations will make them better engineers (as opposed to glorified technicians).

My own higher education was all in the US so I'm aware of the system there (Calc I-III, ODE/PDE. LA, Probability/stats, a few more options), and in Europe outside the UK requirements are similar. But over here we have two 12-week modules, and that's it. While my UG courses weren't particularly well taught, the material has been extremely valuable for me. 

But then again, I'm a research-focussed academic, so am I just a bit too biased towards what I need in my own students?

I'm interested to know whether others feel that they need more, or less mathematics in their engineering education. I'm particularly interested in  views and stories from industry, even more so if you're UK-based.

tldr; too much maths in your engineering degrees?

29,How would you approach this situation?,1448501268,"I work at a consulting firm and last week one of our administrative assistants (lets call her Diane) was tasked with fixing an excel sheet that we use to budget time over two week periods. This sheet lists all our current projects, clients and shows the approximate time each person in our division will be working on that project during the time frame. 

Anyways, Diane wasn't able to figure out how to fix the sheet. I walked by another admin's desk (my friend Sarah) and she looked very frustrated, so I asked if everything was OK. Sarah had just been asked by Diane to help fix the sheet and was frustrated that Diane couldn't fix it. She said that Diane had gone so far as to email her husband (who does not work with us) and had him try to fix it, something that apparently happens quite frequently. Sarah and I ended up fixing the issue in a matter of minutes after seeing it for the first time - the husband's work was silly and incorrect. The correct solution was literally just summing up subtotals and then a 'total' line. Sarah and I had looked at the sheet for the first time and could fix it easily, but by the time we had finished, Diane had wrote up a huge email to her husband trying to explain the problem for further help. This frustrated Sarah even more.

My issues with this are two-fold:

1. The information in this sheet contains our project and client list. I consider that sensitive information that should not be sent to people outside the company under any circumstances. Besides, his 'solution' wasn't even correct and was needlessly complicated.

2. I'm concerned that Diane's not capable of working to the level we need her to (she has been with the company for a couple years now and this isn't the first time I have thought this), and that she either isn't comfortable working with our team to solve a problem or isn't willing to.

Does this mean refer to the fact that if an object is vibrating and translating,  at some point the instantaneous velocity is zero, or is this still a high level description of the fact that stick-slip means the object moves and then stops repeatedly?

My problem is that I'm not an ideas person. I have the skills to design hardware, but all of my ideas for designing just seem lame.

My question is: how did this happen exactly? considering that it was at least 10 hours from when I took the can out from knocking it over and the bag itself was barely damp, how could so much alcohol have gathered to cause a largish puddle (about 20cm in a circular fashion)?

However from this layman's perspective it seems a fairly large field of choices are off the table and I'm sure there must be a why and was curious if anyone here had thoughts they'd like to share.

For example...  ...if we can reliably predict the ""drop-zones"" based on the launch sites why couldn't the rocket parachute down to solid ground?  Is the ground impact significantly worse than the water impact?

Or...  ...if we can orient the ""vertical"" position for the traditional launch posture - is there an option for a ""horizontal"" thrust position on the return?  Could a returning booster soften it's landing with a thrust burst from the horizontal side facing the ground as it approaches.

Wired this way, it triggers a single camera just fine. However, when you add additional cameras to the circuit, it doesn't work anymore. I'm guessing that the resistance is no longer correct, because now a focus trigger does nothing (I think) and a shutter release trigger makes one camera focus.

When I was 11 I was the proud owner of a Dick Smith Funway into Electronics set. I'm afraid I've learnt nothing much since.

Any way to wire this up so that the resistance is correct for all the cameras? Ideally I could add more than 6 cameras in the future following the same method.

My fall back is independent circuits with a mechanical switch closing them all independently, but 1/100 second accuracy would be a big help here, so I'd love to do it right(er).

64,What are some good electrical ways to ignite wood pellets?,1448349738,"I have 12 volts to work with. What are some good ways to ignite wood pellets? I tried using a diesel glow plug and that worked fantastic, but burned out after a couple runs, or maybe I burned it out. I just hooked a ceramic cartridge heater from a spare 3d printer hot end to a battery and it got hot enough to glow. Maybe a high voltage arc might be less prone to burn out? Or perhaps someone more knowledgeable with glow plugs could tell me that there's a specific way to control it so it doesn't burn out. I know regular pellet stoves use a 120v ceramic cartridge heater, so a 12 volt version should work too?

As far as application goes, it's for a pellet burner for my steam bike I'm building.

65,Trying to calculate rim pull torque on a handwheel?,1448332615,"I have a valve that has a handwheel operated actuator attached to it to reduce the input torque required to open the valve.

The handwheel is 10"" in diameter and is attached to the actuator shaft. I need to figure out what the actual required rim pull torque is on handwheel to open this valve. 

I used a torque wrench to get a base torque reading of what kind of force was required to open the valve with the hand wheel removed and the torque wrench attached to the actuator shaft. It read 20 ft/lbs to turn the actuator and open the valve.

Is there a way I can use that information to calculate what the actual rim pull torque will be when I open the valve with the handwheel attached? Thanks.

As a basic starting point, one person should be able to lift an object weighing up to 51 pounds:

If the object is within 7 inches from the front of his or her body.
If the object is at waist height and directly in front of the person.
If there is no twisting involved.
If there is a handle on the object.
If the load inside doesn't shift once lifted.

What I know so far is that for optimal performance, the fuel should ignite when the cylinder pressure is maximum at the top of the stroke, but the air and fuel aren't mixed well so there are a lot of NOx compounds. To avoid this, the fuel is ignited when the piston is moving downwards. This results in a lower efficiency but is cleaner. What I don't understand is how they achieve this controlled ignition since there are no spark plugs and what exactly Volkswagen cheated on. Please get as technical as you wish.
