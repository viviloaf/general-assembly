0,Why are ski lifts always built in straight lines?,1503587901,"If you look at the map of any ski resort, the lifts are almost always going straight up on the mountain.

3,I'm taking a years sick leave between my bachelor and master (Biomedical engineering). I have some ideas on how to fill the time but I'd love some further suggestions.,1503574356,"**Backstory:**

I'm studying biomedical engineering and I suffer from chronic pain. It's not always a great combination and the last semester of my bachelor was especially taxing on me. So instead of going directly to the masters I decided to take a year off to give my body some rest. I'm covered financially by the government so I won't have to work either, leaving me with a bunch of spare time. I'd like to use most of that for something useful.

I've already got a few things in mind, namely programming and data analysis. Biomedical engineering seems to be a mixed bag depending on the university but at mine we do a lot of data analysis and modelling and I really like it so I would like to get more hands-on with machine learning and the like. (Most of what we've learned on the subject so far is theoretical)

**The question part:**

What are your suggestions on good ways to spend this time? 

I have few requirements:

1. It has to be something I can do from home, preferably from my bed/couch/desk.
2. It should have some relevance to engineering.

Don't hold back, whether it's a book recommendation or a small project I'm open to all suggestions. ",AskEngineers,SproedAsfalt,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6vq8dg/im_taking_a_years_sick_leave_between_my_bachelor/

So, in other words if discharge pressure was supposed to be 280 at X flow, its now 250 psig at X flow. So, about a 10 percent drop in performance. 

Vibe check came back clean on the pump in regards to cavitation.

36,Advice on 2.4 Ghz data capturing technique,1503461572,"I would like to capture the data sent via 2.4 Ghz tranceivers via a computer so I can begin to understand the signals that are sent to remote control vehicles.


My end goal is to create a small, land-based model that replicates the orientation of a drone in the air (in real time).


In other words, as a pilot turns a drone left, I would like the ground model to turn left... etc.


My first step is to simply capture the transmission data and try to make head or tails of it.  I currently own this controller for testing:  https://www.banggood.com/FrSky-ACCST-Taranis-X9D-PLUS-16CH-2_4GHz-Transmitter-with-X8R-p-952630.html

Two things I need suggestions on:

1.  A USB hardware device to plug into my computer that can bind to the transceiver and receive the data (2.4 Ghz)

2.  A software (or script) that can analyze the signal.  Preferably something that provides visual feedback (I'm thinking like a logic analyzer but for RF).


I believe different controller brands use different communication protocols, which is why each controller usually requires it's own special receiver attached to the drone.  This will eventually be a problem, since I would like the model to work with multiple different controller brands (but I'm guessing with enough elbow grease, different libraries could be written).  I'm also not sure if the controllers have any sort of authentication protocols that would hinder my efforts in connecting

All help and suggestions on software/hardware are greatly appreciated.  I'm out of my depth here but would like to use the project as a learning experience.

All my gov't coworkers (all of whom are networking majors and IT majors, not computer engineers) tell me how great the gov't is and that the pay is great. I tend to think, though, that in the open market, I would earn a fair bit more than they would, and so the gov't, with pay not depending on career field, is not as attractive an option for me.

Now that we have a product, I need someone to help me build a website so that my customers can have access to my product. 

We're in the Sports Tech/Data space and are essentially a database for sports players. So we'd have a LOT of data online for the players to access. This data would be in the form of charts, numbers, words and images. eg: Football - pass completion %age, shot accuracy %age, heat maps

Now, I would like this to be interactive (to a certain extent at least for my MVP) wherein players can choose what stats to see. Positioning/heatmaps for specific actions etc. 

I more or less have the designs as well and just need to effectively hire someone to be able to code the whole thing. 

All I know is that I first need someone to do the back end, which in my case is mainly database architecture, and then the front end.

* - Could you name ALL the languages that one could use for this? If you can literally use all, which are the preferred (based on ease and availability of talent)

* - Are there subsets of languages? Like some are meant for a specific kind of process and some for the other?

* - All the jargon that I would need to know?

* - What all comprises of the ""back end""

* - Can one language be used for the backend, frontend and database architecture?

* - What exactly is UX?

* - I'm being asked questions like what interface and framework would I like. Also, which platform would I like, *""C# / .NET / MS SQL, or can we do this in Vue.js / Laravel / PHP / MySQL?""* - Pls explain.

65,How important is your first job out of college as an engineer?,1503373300,"I've been thinking about this for a while. I'm entering my third year of my engineering program and I'm becoming more and more aware of how competitive the job market is. My dream job would be to do spacecraft simulations (thermal, CFD, structural, etc.) but I realize the chances of me getting a job like that right out of college are practically zero. Looking from an employer's point of view, I wouldn't want to hire someone with no experience with just a B.S. to do this kind of work when there are hundreds of engineers with a Master's with 10+ years of experience applying for the same position.

I have a friend who just graduated from college who is really adamant on doing design and analysis work in the aerospace industry. He has internship experience and was the aero lead for our supermileage club where he designed the aerodynamic shell. The problem is not getting job interviews for him, the problem is that what he is being offered isn't what he wants to do. For instance, he interviewed at a 3D printing company today where he was offered a customer interfacing job (which had no design or analysis work). Would you have taken this job in his situation? I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't take a job for the sake of taking a job. On the other hand, even though his job wouldn't have included design or analysis, is the opportunity for him to do that at that company completely closed? There's always networking opportunities for companies like that as well, right?

I feel that your first job out of college is pretty important. If you want to end up doing CFD for SpaceX, but you take a manufacturing engineering job where you make drawings for parts on SolidWorks, isn't the door almost completely closed for you to do that? My idea is, if you aren't constantly doing CFD work, how can you improve? Yes, you have experience, but it isn't practical. Would you really be that much more useful than a engineer with a B.S. that did CFD work for clubs? Could you potentially be less useful?

If you work at a startup like Boom, or a smaller company, you would have the opportunity to do a lot of different things, which would improve your engineering skills. On the contrary, even if you work at a bigger company like Northrop, but you're making calls to customers and doing paperwork, you would still be in the environment that you want to be in, so you could potentially watch the CFD dudes and learn from them, right? So as long as your first job is in the industry that you want to end up in, you should be set?

But what if you can't find something like that? Are you going to be screwed? How long should you wait after you graduate to find a suitable job? How related was your first job out of college to what you're doing currently? Please share your opinion, I would like a lot of comments about this.

66,Researching Building a Process Monitoring System (Msps),1503360122,"Hey, I'm interested in building a process monitoring system. This is outside of my field of expertise and I'm not looking for you to do the work for me, but rather to help me identify topics that I need to research further and raise some questions that I should ask myself that I haven't even considered. Furthermore, I may have the opportunity to pull some other people into this work and need to know what skills are valuable for this endeavor. 

The basic premise is that the system will accept various analog inputs from process measurements, let's assume 0-10 V. The system will be constantly polling these channels on the order of Msps, and when a trigger condition is met, it will permanently write the process measurements as a record for a user-defined period starting at or prior to the trigger and ending some time after the trigger. The measurements will be written to a database, likely SQL. There will also be a GUI to present the signals for the last trigger event in a user-defined unit (likely time), among other views of the data.

What programming skills/languages jump out as clear candidates for pursing this work? Any go-to textbooks/resources you could point me to?

What basic hardware approach would you consider? National Instruments is a clear choice, and it reduces the learning curve I'd otherwise face, but it's an expensive platform to build on.

Are there other options that I should consider? What if instead of building one I plan on building 10? Are there some low-volume economies of scale that make competing options worth considering?

The pump is on the ground at the same level as the bottom of the tank, sucking water from the side of the tank, about 6 inches up the sidewall. There is a ball valve right above the discharge port that is used to throttle flow (about halfway closed). The piping goes about 5 feet straight up, turns thru a few elbows 180 degrees to return back towards the ground. It passes thru a venturi injector (air) on the way back to the ground. There are two gauges on either side of the injector (injector inlet reads 15 psi, outlet reads 5 psi). My question - is the pump only generating 15 psi of pressure for this injector (ignoring the pressure caused by throttling the valve), or do I also need to add frictional losses from elbow/fittings and the pumping height (~5 feet). If it only generates 15 psi, I think the pump may be failing because that pressure is at the extreme right of the pump curve.

I cant find anything on the internet and I would prefer getting a used one for cheap.
All I do find are DC motors without gears and those dont deliver the required torque
or dc motors that have a lot of torque but run at 10rpm... Does anybody know where I can get something like that?

85,"Graduate looking for some job guidance, am I being taken advantage of?",1503313314,"Hi, I've recently graduated with a B. Mech Eng and got a job at a small (&lt;8 people) consulting firm. Firstly the ""office hours"" are 8:30-5 with a 1 hour ""lunch break"". So im being paid for 7.5 hours work/day. I would also like to add that this in Australia.

Firstly after I started I was told the lunch was a kind of work while you eat deal although the idea of 1 full hour for lunch was heavily enforced during the interview and on the phone when verbally taking the job. No big problem I'd get bored with an hour break, although this hour of work therefore technically goes unpaid and lately we have been too busy to even stop to grab a bite to eat, today i ate my lunch while i drove home after a 9.5 hour day. Secondly, I often work for up to 10 hours/day again with anything over 7.5 hours goes unpaid, I do personally have an issue with this as the clients are still billed for my time but i am not paid for it. I was also told that the company closes over christmas for about 3 weeks, during this period you are to use your paid leave (leave entitlement are 4 weeks annual leave and 2 weeks sick leave/year) is this odd or is it the usual? Only ending up with 1 week worth of leave when I want it through the year.

Is this all pretty normal for graduate? Being the new guy im getting all the jobs no one else wants (which involves a lot of driving, inspections and such, no issue with it as its about the only part that im enjoying) but these jobs can take a lot of extra time as thing often go wrong and people do not cooperate, it seems as though I am expected to finish the work that I dont get to in my own time. 

It has all come as a bit of a shock to me. I just wanted to know if its common or if I am being taken advantage of as I dont really know anyone else in the industry so I cant guage what is good and bad. Also I will add that my salary is about the same as someone who would do a 40hr/week retail job. Thanks for any help guys.

Edit - thanks for all the help guys. I don't mind it too much at the moment, im pretty lucky to have it considering the job market here but I'll keep looking for something better.",AskEngineers,mechengguy93,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6v26m6/graduate_looking_for_some_job_guidance_am_i_being/

87,Selecting The Correct Glass For A Solar Distiller?,1503285479,"Hi All I’m in the process of designing/planning to build a Solar distiller which will be based of this design; 
https://imgur.com/a/Yzdqn
Sorry for the crude drawing I can't currently post CAD renderings or other diagrams since I need to address these questions to complete them. 

Are Here Are My Questions What kind of glass should I use in this design? The glass must be as thin as possible and be “food” grade as this design aims to produce highly purified drinkable water, the distilled water will also be remineralized. I’m concerned about the potential for glass to leach compounds into the water as some glasses contain metallic oxides.

What would be the ideal thickness for a single or two glass sheets of this size? Ideally, I want the glass to be as thin as possible glass which is thinner will condensate water more effectively and I want to maximize my yield of distilled water. However thin glass is much more fragile and this glass could experience fairly rapid temperature changes as it will be outside and I’m worried it will crack if the weather changes.

Although this subreddit is geared more to the appreciation of glass sculptures and art I'm posting this here since I've been able to find any other reddit community which deals specifically with glass. If I'm posting in the wrong sub reddit could you please direct me to the appropriate forum to post this.

The interview went really well and the interviewer said that he would be glad to hire me, **EXCEPT** the company doesn't have that much work to do at the moment. Hiring me would over-staff them.

He offered me the opportunity to do part-time/casual work for them. The number of available hours is uncertain, but it was heavily implied that it would not be enough to live on.

A conundrum arises because I feel like this opportunity is very rare for a person with my connections and skill level.

* I will be close by and available when they have room to hire more full time staff.

* **BUT** I will need to find other part time work - and from what I've gathered, it's hard to find that type of work in engineering.

*If I don't accept the work:*

* The odds of me being busy with another position when a full time position becomes available is very high, which means I might never get this type of job opportunity again.

[Here is the album of pictures of the centre beam of the house,](http://imgur.com/a/zm661) but I'm also linking them below. But first, a little context.

Since the permit hasn't closed yet, I spoke to the building inspector yesterday about the support beams not being to code, as multiple handymen/contractors had told me. The inspector tells me that the support beams were not part of the permit so he never inspected that portion. He was told the beams were only 'temporary'. This didn't seem right to me, since the posts were cemented in.

Wide portion: 178 inches (or 14ft 8 in)

Shallow portion: 130 inches (or 10ft 10in)

20,How to determine flywheel specs for auto KERS,1503067597,"For a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) how do you determine flywheel specs? I'm assuming vehicle mass, average speed, and motor/generator specs play a part. 

Let's say the flywheel was attached to a 10kW generator that made full power at 1000rpm. And let's say the Max O.D. Of the flywheel had to be 12"". Let's assume the vehicle was an average mass midsize car. 

Also what determines how long a flywheel will continue to spin on its own inertia based on its mass, specs and generator specs? So once the vehicle slows to a stop from say 65mph, how do you determine how long the flywheel will continue to rotate once stopped? Will the battery load dictate that?

The power TV is switched, that starts the motor to turn the panel. Maybe some type of magnetic sensor, something like the alarm sensor on a door or window, embedded in the frame and the panel that when made kills the motor.

Graduated in May and started my first job about a month ago. I majored in EE with an emphasis in signal processing, and landed a job at a major utility company as a generator/exciter engineer.

There really is no formal training I think, I just kinda show up and read/take notes. I'm not given anything to work on, so I feel like none of this information is really sinking in.

I found from the document through some very small font that if the tower was operated at Max flow instead of Design flow the approach should be 7 degrees. So the tower is operating as it should and i get a higher approach with higher flow.

37,Theoretical Propulsion Career Questions,1502994401,"(cross posted in a few engineering subreddits)

Hi all, apologies in advance for the long post. I’m an undergraduate mechanical engineering student (with physics and electrical engineering minors), and I have an enormous interest in theoretical space propulsion systems (nuclear thermal, beam powered, ramjets, etc.). I believe we’ve entered a renaissance of interest in space, and I’m extremely excited by the idea of getting to contribute to this essential technological frontier. As such, I’m looking to become involved in the research and design of future propulsion systems at an academic or government institution, or in the private sector. The problem is that the education and career path to becoming such a researcher is not well-defined. 

Organizations working on advanced theoretical propulsion like NASA’s Eagleworks lab and ESA’s ESTEC Advanced Concepts Team have been established that employ researchers from a variety of backgrounds, and as such it’s difficult to discern what I should pursue. Broadly I’m set on an engineering or physics path, yes, but the details escape me: after I finish my undergrad, should I build on my bachelor’s in MechE with a master’s, or should I branch out into aerospace engineering with a propulsion focus? It seems that almost all propulsion graduate programs are focused on refining current technology, rather than researching theoretical systems. Another option would be to pursue physics immediately – I’ve tentatively defined physics as the field for a terminal degree, but without any clear idea of what my foundation for a PhD should be I’m only guessing. A great deal depends on me identifying graduate mentors I can work with of course, but again, theoretical propulsion seems to not feature heavily in the research of most professors.

I’m planning on reaching out to the public inquiries address at Johnson Space Center (home of the Eagleworks lab) in the hopes that my email might be forwarded to a researcher who will take a few minutes to give me some advice, but I also wanted to get the opinion of the engineering communities here.

I'll be graduating in two quarters and I just don't feel like I know enough to be useful in real life setting.

I've taken plenty of 'book courses' where we go through a text book and do problems on it. But none of them felt ""real"". And I felt like I just scratched the surface on a lot of topics but very few in depth.

Controls? I did couple projects in matlab. Materials? Did a lot of book studies, and set through a series of lectures. Which was informative and interesting, but I don't have a clue where I'd start in a real life project. Aerodynamics? a lot of it was again book study. and I don't think real life situations will be a series of problem 10.2, 10.3 ....

&amp;nbsp;

As far as more concrete skills go I know Solidwork, Matlab and Python pretty well. Have done fair amount of experimental work in labs. Got my hands on machining, LabView, and such but not an expert. I missed out of FEM stuffs due to schedule conflict, which is my big regret.\. 

I've done one internship, but it was much more independent (little to no guidance) than I thought, and I played with Arduino to make a automated roller for 3 months. Since I had no experience with it before I struggled pretty hard, and by the time I got a hang of it the internship ended.

When I visited Boeing plant and such, I was pretty overwhelmed by how much work is being done. How much expertise the engineers have there. Of course I fully expect to have far less experience than the veterans, but I feel like I can't even contribute anything of real value.

And that's scary. Because entry level engineer gets paid something like $70,000 as far as I know. And I feel like I can't produce nothing worth that much. What can I do? make a solidwork model? punch in some matlab code? write a 10 page report?

I feel like I'm missing something and it's terrifying. What should I do at this point? What kind of skills can I learn in next 7 months to make me more useful? How do you deal with this sense of being overwhelmed?

A few aspects, such as articulated engines are application specific to rail.  But others design improvements, such as compounding are more general techniques that apply to stationary engines as well as other transportation applications like the double/triple expansion engines of marine vessels.  

Thus far, I'm only aware of scant examples of late stage steam engine designs.  The literature I've come across mostly regarded them as historic relics, and they're presented as such.  But I'm curious what a technical presentation on them would be like.  I short, I wonder what the most experienced steam engine designer of the age can offer in approaching the theoretical performance limit of this venerable technology.  raw/build material selection, welding/construction techniques, boiler/piston design considerations, performance priorities, etc.

A follow up of sorts: There are examples on youtube and elsewhere of enthusiasts who've built DIY steam engines, either from scratch or via conversions, for fun.

67,What is the duration to fill submerged tank by gravity feed?,1502896967,"An empty tank is submerged in sea water. Top of tank at 100 ft water depth, bottom of tank at 200 ft water depth. A feed line 6 in sch 80 pipe allows water to enter at 5 ft water depth to fill the bottom of the tank. A vent line from the top of the tank (2 in sch 160) vents the tank to 15 ft above water line.

Tank is cylinder, 10 ft radius, 100 ft tall.

Allowing the 6in line to free flood and fill the tank, how long will it take to fill the tank?

I started using Torricelli speed of efflux at depth entering tank, but the velocities were huge. 

Vo = C*((2*g*h)^.5)

Then I applied the Torricelli formula at the 5 ft water depth (h) entrance and assumed constant velocity to the tank. This limited the velocities to more expected values, but the venting velocity of the air is still high (varying the coefficient for T formula (0.51-0.72), the venting velocity of air is  71 - 103 mph).

I also know the back pressure of the vent could come into play, but looking in some manuals, compressibility starts to become an issue at .3 the speed of sound, still not that high based on my calculations.

I also applied Hazen Williams formula to make a table, but ended up running in circles with assumptions and results.

Any approach or methods to apply would be appreciated.

69,[Career] Anyone have experience switching industries and quickly wanting to switch out/back?,1502889794,"Looking for some insight into this scenario, to help me make some decisions.  
  
Background: I worked at my state DOT during school and for about 4.25 years afterward. I was in Highway Design for most of it. I really enjoyed the design work, but wasn't a big fan of the political aspects that came with being within the DOT. I got the itch to move so I started interviewing. The transportation industry was slow at the time and my family (wife and son) were not in a position to make a big move, so I started investigating other CE opportunities in the area. Found a posting from a very interesting, small, site/utilities firm in the area. This industry seemed like a great opportunity, and they were also prequalified to do work on DOT projects (they hadn't worked on any yet, but they had the potential to).  
  
I got the job. Got a salary boost (about 30%). Got an office with a window (was in a cubicle in an old basement before, no windows). Was feeling good. Fast forward 3 months. I'm starting to get a hang of the aspects of my new job, but I'm not really feeling the same passion for this work that I have for transportation projects. Most of my design projects are purely underground utilities, and there are no highways in sight at the moment. I do enjoy the sanitary sewer and storm sewer design, but those aspects are very similar to the drainage components that I was designing at DOT. As for the natural gas, potable water, and other aspecs... meh.  
  
I'm heavily guarding this lack of enthusiasm, telling myself it's just the growing pains in a new industry. Definitely not letting this affect my performance. Going to give it hell while I'm here!  
  
Just wandering if anyone else has made a switch to a different industry (not just within CE), and made the decision that it was time to go back (or move on to something else)?

3. very very flexible work hours 
4. can bring my pet to work

6. we have more benefits here, gym, massages, etc...

1. i'll get around 1% options (it can be deluded in the future i guess) 
2. awesome people, and be among the first people working there 
3. i believe in the product, it's already deployed at some customers

5. it will be a refreshment from a place i'm in 6 years (i've switched positions - but still, it looks bad in resume if someone is in a single company for many years)
6. i'll be more hands-on than what i'm now (though i can do that in some part also here)

the cons: 

1. lower salary (around 1600$ less per month) 
2. its after a funding round, but unsecured job instead of a secured one i have now. 
3. probably more hours, i will have troubles maybe with my pet (leaving it alone at home), and my workout routines (which i don't want to skip)

Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this. I have no idea how easy or how sensible it would be to do this, but I'd like to convert this into a shed/garage.

To give an idea of its use case, it would either hold smaller tractor attachments and equipment (wheelbarrow, snowblower, bags of salt, etc) Or it would hold just a utility trailer for the truck.

I can walk through this structure with no issue if I stay in the center (must crouch a little at the walls). 

My thinking is it is easy to throw down plywood on the floor, plywood the walls, seal it up somehow, and done.

The main problem being the front - the vertical and horizontal beams need to be removed so that I can easily get in and out with equipment. Ideally it would be completely open, with two large hinged doors. But I don't have an understanding of this part and of what's required.

Would it be more sensible to convert this structure? Or would it be more sensible to buy a new garage/shed building (I'm looking at in excess of $5,000 for that).

2,Relative elevation of banked crossovers?,1502792732,"[Here](http://abload.de/img/ueberhoehungsquyp.jpg)'s what a banked two-track line looks like, at least in continental Europe. As you can see, the tracks are level.

I'm having trouble understanding how banked crossovers work in this situation, even with much larger track spacing. Whether the crossover connects two curved tracks of constant radius or the inner tracks of an S-bend, there's always a difference in elevation as a direct result of the banking. The way I see it, either both tracks would need to be banked together along a common axis, or the crossover track would have a hump. Or, I guess, the inner and outer tracks of a turnout could have different banking, but this seems an excessively expensive solution.

I've looked at pictures and cab ride videos trying to figure out the method actually used, but I can't make heads or tails of it. Everything just seems to magically fit together when it shouldn't. Can any railway engineers share insight as to how it's done?

My current understanding of diesel engines are that it injects fuel once it's reached it's most compressed point , and the pressure in the cylinder causes the combustion. 


So anyway my main question is What are the challenges of using that same style of engine with gasoline? Why did they have to use spark plugs?

I have only taken one intro coding class but have done some other minor coding on my own (Codecademy). CompE (at my school) seems about half CSCI and half EE courses. My question is - is this a good route? I feel like it could either be advantageous or not because I'm breaking up my ""specialization"" between two majors - so it could mean that people who major in strictly CompSci or EE have an advantage over me with being more disciplined in their practice.  On the other hand, it could give me a step by being more well rounded between the two subjects, correct? 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't make much sense, I cannot sleep and I may just be babbling and overthinking but I'm very curious as to what career path I should follow. 

**Tl;dr: very tired and cannot sleep. I've wanted to do EE but CompE seems like a good route since I could still follow EE with a little bit more of a well-rounded CSCI background. Is this true? Is it a good idea? Will it put my at a disadvantage/advantage?**

We are designing a fixture to fatigue a spring. Currently the design involves a dual acting actuator hooked up to the spring. One end is connected to a switch and the other is left open to air (with a filter.) 

The cylinder is pressurized, extending the spring. When it gets to the right extension, the switch is thrown by an arm of given length which opens the pressurized side of the cylinder to an exhaust and closes the compressed air.

The spring then pulls the arm back to its original position, at which point the arm switches the switch back, repressurizing the actuator.

It's not perfect but should work with what we have on hand.

I am the one responsible for designing steering system for the vehicle. It would be perfect if all of it could be done in SolidWorks. I've been researching the field for several months and I found lots of sources which tell how this stuff works, but not many really guide you through the design process. By analysing the few I've found I came up with these steps that I need to complete:
1. some basic assumptions about the system - it will be a simple rack and pinion system. The most important factor that we want to focus on is to make it cheap - it would be perfect if most components are adapted from existing cars and aquired cheaply
2. System geometry - the connection point between a tie rod and a rack must be in a right place, so when suspension moves vertically, the wheels won't turn. It will be assured by making a sketch with suspension and steering arm, moving it up and down and then finding a spot around which the end of steering arm oscillates. Then, top geometry will be determined, by making iterations and getting it as close to ackerman as possible. Simultanously, we will make sure that none of the components collides with any of the other chasiss elements. This will grant us all 3 dimensions of the rack, tie rods and the steering arm.
3. Designing elements, which cannot be bought, making sure they function properly and will not break
4. Once again checking if the whole system works by analysing the 3d model of the design
I would like to use this great opportunity of asking engineers from all around the world if this is a good way to approach this problem, and especially what am I missing. How can I evaluate if my design is done correctly (step 4) other than actually building it? Is there such a function in solidworks or software specifically designed to that?

I know the basics for pH probes where you have one side of the glass probes filled w/ a neutral pH substance of 7.0 and on the other side of the probe detects the pH of the substance you want measured - the difference in H+ ions between the two sides is what causes a potential difference to be measured and pH calculated. My question is - how exactly does this H+ concentration difference create voltage? The way I'm thinking of it is that you have one side that has a charge of say +7 and another side that has a charge of +4, and that charge difference causes a potential - but what's the exact background elementary reason/equation for that?

Likewise, car O2 sensors work similiarly in that one side of the probe is exposed to atmospheric O2 and the other side of the probe is exposed to O2 in your exhaust gas, and the difference in O2 concentration causes the voltage measurement. Again, how does the O2 concentration difference cause the voltage difference? Are the atoms charged, and if not how can you measure voltage by simply varying their concentrations?

A quick introduction about me, I am a recent graduate with a passion to work as an analog designer. 
I have been applying to various semi conductor companies for the roles of analog but compared to digital there are only so many companies which hire an analog design engineer with very minimal experience( 1 year as an intern in my case). I come from a tier II institution hence we are not exposed to so many companies working in VLSI at our career fair. 

I have done a lot of decent/basic analog projects, however, I think those are not good enough. I mean I have interviewed a couple of places I got reviews saying I am not good enough or I either have don't have enough experience. I want to be better but I don't know where to start or how to get better since the feedbacks were really vague. 

I started with youtube videos by professors from various universities teaching the same analog fundamentals which I was introduced in school. I am not saying that I know everything but the youtube lectures aren't really helping me. 

I write this Reddit question in the hopes of finding a mentor from the industry to give sharp feedbacks so that I can actually be a good enough analog designer making contributions to the company I work for.

The company I interned at this summer has offered me another internship next summer, and they want to know my decision by the end of this week.  The offer is really good for me financially, to the point where I probably wouldn't have to take out a loan for my senior year, which sounds really fucking nice.  However, I really don't want to intern there again.  I really want to try and get some more variety in my experience, and I feel like if I go back there I wont accomplish that.  I also feel like I didn't grow my technical skills there very much, which is probably the main reason I don't wont to go back there (I am not sure if this is a valid point, me being just an intern, and if I should change my view on this).

I really want to apply to other companies that do things I am interested in working on, however the offer I have from my previous company is really appealing.  Add in the fact that getting an internship at a company that interests me is not guaranteed, and re-applying to the company I interned at doesn't guarantee me the current offer, spending 3 more months there wouldn't kill me.

I understand they can be useful to battle gimbal lock. I understand how they are defined, and that they minimize certain loss function.

They mention in the book that they reduce computational speed. This is where I have problem.

The parameters are in the book defined using sin(x/2) and the eigenvector of the rotational matrix. I don't understand how this would reduce computational speed. Firstly, we have to compute the eigenvector of the rotational matrix. Does this have to be done for every single new rotation? If so, it seems extremely unhelpful in terms of speed. The parameters also include sin(x/2) you also calculate a bunch of trig functions, something they, in the book, said was a big difference between the euler angle formulation of the direction cosine matrix and the quaternion formulation.

I understand I'm misunderstanding something:

Why are quaternions faster? Is the principal eigenvector a vector I have to calculate for every single new rotation (-> new rotation matrix)? If so, how can the book claim quaternions are actually faster?

This is where I get stuck. I assume the level of liquid CO2 in the canister drops, so would gas not have to occupy the empty volume? CO2 should not be able to exist as a gas at this pressure and temperature. I know density of liquid CO2 changes slightly with pressure but not that much.

9,Would I need a pump in this setup? (Emptying a water tank into a sink outlet that is slightly higher up than the tank's output),1502330616,"My washing machine doesn't have a pump to empty its tank, just an outlet hose you have to prop up while the machine has water. Emptying it out a bucket at a time gets old fast, and right next to it I have the ""sewer"" inlet from a sink.

So I was thinking if it would be possible to rig the machine's outlet hose to that sink's outlet (sorry I don't know what the technical terms are, English is not my native language).

What I'm not sure is if I would need an actual pump or if the water pressure alone would be sufficient.

Some specs (rough measurements using a ruler):

The tank that holds the water is about 32cm x 45cm x 40cm

The tank has an outlet hose at the bottom at about 20cm from the ground. The sewer inlet is located on the wall at about 58cm from the floor, so I would need to ""pump"" the water up some 38cm. 

The hose has about 8cm in diameter (the sink outlet I want to connect it to is wider, not sure if that makes a difference).

Now, when the tank's water level falls below the level the sewer outlet is located at on the wall, would it just stop emptying or would the suction already created keep it going? I know it's a very basic question, but I don't have the knowledge to even know how to figure it out.

My (possibly) incorrect assumption is that such a setup would create something akin to how you can suck on a hose and have water coming out the other end even if it has to travel up.

The idea is to be able to empty the washing machine directly into the sewer pipe as simply and cheaply as possible. If my idea even makes sense, an open/close valve and some pvc pipes (and maybe some one-way valves to prevent water going the wrong direction) should be able to get the job done (I hope, but for now I'm not thinking specifics that much, have to know if it's viable first).


Not sure if I was able to explain it well enough, if anything was unclear or if more information is needed please ask and I'll do my best.",AskEngineers,VoidViv,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6sq9v8/would_i_need_a_pump_in_this_setup_emptying_a/

2) This is a more procedural question. In the drawings, the template has a block for ""revised by,"" ""drawn by,"" etc. If there are multiple revisions by different people, is it convention for the ""revised by"" to state the name/date of the latest revision or do you create a new space for addition revisions?

I have a bit of problem making anything out of this task. I am currently trying to find what dimention of the steel support for a crane. Mainly this involves around an L beam of steel. I need to find the dimention and grade. I have attached a drawn picture if anybdy could help. I am mainly not sure how to transfer the cranes momentum down through the foundation and to the L beams and how to fint the yield point. I have provided 2 situation with the boom 90 thegrees different at situation 2. If anybdy can help me with this task or can provide som good example on problems related i would be much appriciative!

So does that mean when the motor turns 12x the output axle turns once? And does that also mean if the output axle is turned 1x the motor turns 12x? 

Because I want to hook the output axle to a wind propeller to make a proof of concept of a wind turbine using a DC motor. So for each time the prop turns I want the motor to turn multiple times to generate power. This small a DC motor won't turn anything, this is just a PoC.

I also want to learn more about gearing. If you have a website for noobs that would be great. Did Joe Shigley ever write a book for beginners? He's pretty famous in mechanical engineering circles. He was a friend of the family.

When my internship was over I even received a letter in english stating the amount of hours work in the plant (450+ hours) over the summer and signed by my mentor engineer and human resources department.

I had to drop out of the workforce due to disability 5 years ago but want to rejoin the workforce but can’t do what I did before. I have a BS in engineering (96) from University of Florida and an MBA (02) from a regional college. In my early career, I started in technical sales and then quickly moved to manufacturing management while being the only engineer on staff most of my career; 70% of the time. I had occasional use of my specific engineer skills that satisfied my interest in the details of manufacturing. I rose to General Manager with P&L responsibility responsible for a staff of about 250. Money wise I made the most money as a Manufacturing Manager two steps below the GM for a carbon fiber manufacturing company.  I passed my EIT in 96 but never had a chance to advance to a PE in my chosen discipline, environmental engineering. The closest I got was plant waste management and applying for and receiving a title V air emissions operating permit.  After my experience in the workplace I discovered I didn’t want to be a full-time engineer but enjoyed the challenge of running businesses with an engineers’ perspective and skills. MBA was child’s play compared to undergrad engineering at UF.  I am providing all these details in hopes that an engineer in management can make a suggestion for my new career. I want to work in IT and possibly work my way up to management again. I will be getting a BS in Computer Science and choosing electives will dictate my new skill set.

The slot is essentially a cage made of carbon steel flatbar, with about .200"" of allowance around the outside diameter of the fuel pack. However, recently while leak testing the fuel pack it was exposed to some reasonably high temperatures maybe 45C (113F) and the hdpe expanded in a way that the pack no longer fits into the slot, even when the temperature returned to normal 21C (70F). From what I found is HDPE expands .000067"" x degree F x linear inch. What I'm curious about (and have attempted) is, could I cool the pack in freezer to -7C (19F) and put it into a jig, and have it return to normal room temperature would the HDPE simply expand the direction of least resistance?

Some courses I have taken that are related to fields of engineering are Calc II, Calc III, Linear Algebra, Differential Geometry, Modern Physics, Engineering Design, Mechanics of Materials. 

I know one course I would have to take would be diff eqs. If anyone else gone from a math degree to a mechanical engineering degree and had to take classes in between, let me know! ",AskEngineers,LTskimp,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6s9zw1/bachelors_in_math_to_masters_in_engineering/

To Design?,1502145973,"As someone in a Inside Sales Engineering role, doing mostly ""menial/tedious"" tasks such as quoting, customer response, and product knowledge, I'd like to ask if there's any way for me to jump into a more design oriented career path? I'm starting to grow bored of this job and I find myself sitting on my butt 99% of the time on the computer. I only ever get out of my office during lunch and to use the men's room -- sigh.

I'm a social person which is why I thought I wanted to do sales, but sales engineering is completely different than retail sales.

1. Are there any other engineering careers that are ""social""? Meaning I'm part of a team and get to work on new projects and interact with people for ideas on a daily/weekly basis?
2. Will employers look at my background and see that I don't have much design experience and pass on me if I decided to get into that role?

Currently I'm trying to analysis a bolt and sleeve together as a cantilever beam problem. In particular this bolt & sleeve is bending under a certain concentrated applied force. However as I understand I cannot assume the bolt & sleeve to be one solid piece, as the bolt & sleeve are not bonded together.

I've been reading up on ""composite beam"" theory in my Mechanics of Materials textbook to refresh my memory on how to approach this problem, however I'm not sure if that is the best approach. Had anyone seen or experienced the proper way to analyze a bolt & sleeve pair for bending moments?

I am a 27 year old CPA with a undergrad in Accounting. I'm growing weary of my work in public accounting (Audit in particular) and am currently in the process of trying to get another accounting job to hopefully shake off this feeling that accounting/audit isn't for me. Nonetheless, I'm pretty aware of my future career paths/opportunities and am worried none of these really excite me.

In the mean time, I'm also taking a few community college courses I know I'd need at some point if I do end up going back to school. Currently enrolled in a Physics I course and Calc 2.

Basically, I have found a program near my home at Illinois Institute of Technology that is a masters degree for EE/CE that is available for non engineering undergrads. The school does a good job of listing out the undergrad courses I will need prior to taking any Masters courses.

I also have the option of going the 2nd Bachelors route. The most realistic school in this case would be University of Illinois at Chicago. I've reached out to their admissions department and was told they'd take my Accounting degree (from DePaul University) and after (and if) I'm admitted, can work with me to determine what remaining courses I'd need to take.

My question is for someone like me who has thoughts of changing their career pretty radically, what is the best path regarding education?

I didn't know this before, but during my research have found there are a lot of Universities that don't offer a send Undergraduate degree. I also found, which I was more expecting, lots of Universities don't offer Masters degrees to those with unrelated undergrads.

I'm currently doing a feasibility study on installing an inlet air fogging system on three GE Frame 9E Gas Turbines. The power plant in question is combined-cycle, as stated in the subject with 3 HRSGs connected to a Steam Turbine.

Installation of an evaporative cooling system (fogging type, not the obsolete media type) from Mee Industries Inc. is being considered. However, I need some clarifications:-

Installing these fogging skids at the inlets of these GTs improves the output of these turbines, and also decreases the net LHV heat rate, which for a simple cycle GT is a good thing obviously. However, some engineers on my team have expressed a concern that employing this system will lead to a decrease in the Steam Turbine's output due to a lower LHV.

Can anyone here provide me a detailed technical paper or two to consult whether or not this is true? It seems a little counter-intuitive to me, but I want to be sure.  ",AskEngineers,SpartanTank,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6s46a2/impact_of_reducing_net_lhv_heat_rate_on_output_of/

He said that his utility, among many others, is coming up on a period that will find them with a serious lack of workers.

The problem I am having is that the smaller tube needs a way to guide itself into the bigger tube, as they aren't always fit into each other. To start, the two pieces are separate, and as the winch pulls the smaller tube, it needs to align and center perfectly in order to slide into the larger tube.

30,Regarding questions about 9/11 & collapse of the WTC buildings.,1501832162,"/u/THedman07 requested [in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6qrn5s/recently_heard_a_claim_that_there_are_no/dl5bmim/) for us to ban questions on 9/11. I started a response that ended up longer than I thought, and because it's important for us as a community it is being posted here for visibility. My original response follows.

### Can we get a ban on 9/11 conspiracy questions?

This is a tough one.

On the one hand, if we ban 9/11 questions altogether, that in itself is a form of censorship which is an accusation very loosely thrown at mods — even though we have no history of ever suppressing factual information or dissenting opinions. This is something we'd like to avoid at all costs because it would damage our reputation as an open forum and place of discussion.

In some instances, questions about the WTC collapse are asked in an innocuous (if misguided) way, as was the case [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3kl5zq/why_didnt_just_the_tops_of_the_twin_towers_fall/) and more recently [**here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6rgv9q/why_does_this_look_so_much_like_controlled/) Technically they break the soapboxing rule, but it's very easy to tell whether a user is asking genuinely vs. posting 9/11 truther bait.

---

On the other hand, this particular subject can be offensive or traumatizing to some people, especially if they were impacted by the original event. For the rest of us, it's frustrating and annoying to deal with 9/11 truthers, [**as I and others did for nearly a week,**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/33tl74/how_did_the_wtc_north_tower_top_section_fall_and/) 2 years ago.

However, I strongly feel that it's my job as an engineer to prevent the spread of false information, flawed logic, and fearmongering when it relates to an engineering topic — so I did my best at the time to engage the offending users in a way that was both professional, and educational for non-engineers.

---

In conclusion, no, we have not and will not ban 9/11 questions because banning them outright is a form of censorship, and because the best way to combat conspiracy theories and the spread of misinformation is through education, recognition, and by establishing rigorous engineering definitions so that these types of conspiracy theories can't gain any traction.

This is exactly [**how AskHistorians deals with Holocaust denialism:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/57w1hh/monday_methods_holocaust_denial_and_how_to_combat/)

> Educate ourselves, educate others, and expose Holocaust Deniers as the racist, bigots and anti-Semites they are. There is a good reason Nazism is not socially acceptable as an ideology – and there is good reason it should stay that way. Because it is wrong in its very essence. The same way Holocaust Denial is wrong at its very core. Morally as well as simply factually.

In the same vein, by engaging conspiracy theorists and disproving their claims with demonstrable facts and engineering logic, they cannot push their agenda and misinformation onto the general public, who do not have the engineering knowledge or mindset to refute their nefarious claims. This is the best way to promote engineering and science while preventing conspiracy theorists from gaining any credibility.

Is it frustrating? Of course it is!

Last year I got a job as an engineer working on a project to build two new nuclear reactors in South Carolina.  Unfortunately, the utility/owner cancelled the project on July 31st (read about it [here](http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-nuclear-south-carolina-idUSL1N1KM125)), not even 1 year after I got the job.  The project was way over budget and behind schedule due to exceptionally bad project management by Westinghouse Electric Company (not my employer).  As a result, I am out of a job, along with **5600** other people.  I had been hoping to make a career out of working as an engineer in the nuclear industry, but it is clear now that the industry is dying.

So, I’m getting out of the nuclear industry, and I’m looking for advice about where else I’d fit well.  My question is: 

Do you know of any US industries where someone with my education and experience could do engineering design work?  My education, experience, career development focus, and desired type of work are listed below.

**Also, do you know of other places where I could post this question and get more replies from other people?**

Thank you.

**Education**:  Degrees in Nuclear Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.

In the dorm rooms I've met some guys who are in film school (we have mixed dorms) and my university has a course which is really appealing to me (basically becoming a professional camera operator). 

I LOVE CAMERAS. Perhaps even more than aerospace things or maybe engineering in general. Give me any camera and 10 minutes and I'll figure out how to operate it with minimal effort. When my friends told me (upon my questioning) about the existence of such a course my eyes had lit up. I felt an insane surge of energy since I've always had a keen interest in cinema cameras (and using them my entire life). I've never ever felt such energy and burning passion about something.

I've got my engineering textbooks and have already started reading them to stay ahead of the masses. The thing is that I'd be kidding myself if I said that I'm super passionate about engineering. I'm very confused.

I told my parents about it. They declined. My mother asked me to talk to my father. He declined and asked me to ""not give him headaches."" 

I've been preparing for engineering for the last two years (it's a big deal in my country) and my interest in engineering has been declining.

16,Portable Air Conditioner 1-Hose to 2-Hose Modification,1501532547,"Hello there. Junior-ME student here. 

**Question:**
I have a 1-hose portable air conditioner (almost identical to the one in the link below) which I want to convert to a 2-hose air conditioner so that when the unit is operating, it won't create a vacuum in the room. Does the conversion make (ballpark) economic sense? 

**Air Conditioner**: https://tinyurl.com/ya5wabo3

**Background:**
I purchased this portable air conditioner 2 years ago to provide cooling in my 900ft^2 apartment. 

**Problem:** Whenever I turn it on, warm air is drawn into the air conditioner from the room it is located in to be cooled and exhausted back to the room as expected, however, air is also drawn from the room to be passed over the condenser, which is vented via duct connected to a window. 

The vacuum created by the air conditioner pulls hot air (and neighbors cigarette smoke-which doesn't play well with asthma)  in through cracks, door jams, windows, other apartments, etc. It seems like the air drawn in *nearly* cancels the cooling provided by the air conditioner, making it less efficient. 

**What I want to do:**
I'd like to go to my local hardware store and pickup some ~dryer vent/~HVAC tubing, and port the condenser air-intake to draw air in through a tube/hole located just beneath the current exhaust port for the condenser exhaust, hereby eliminating the vacuum effect within the room. 

**Evaluation:** Does this make sense?

 I think this will give me my desired outcome. Cigarette smoke will likely not enter the ""proposed intake vent,"" as it is located too far from where they are consumed. Most cigarette smoke is drawn in from neighboring units. 

**Other idea:** Instead of spending money affixing the additional vent, I could just replace the whole unit with a $50, 5,000-Btu unit from Craigslist, although I'm not sure how well that would replace the 12,500Btu unit currently in use. 

**Closing:**
As always, any thoughts, comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc, will be highly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to consider this.

Ive attached a standard plug to it and have been playing with powering different things off it, to my surprise, about 90% of switching transformers work just fine!


I plugged in my magsafe and it puts out 19v, exactly like it should. I plugged in my laptop, and sure enough, it started charging. ive also tested two phone chargers, and one puts out 5.02 v and the other is 5.21v (about .05v higher then on AC) 

I guess it depends on where they have internal isolation transformers. If it's on the front end during rectifying, nothing will happen. If they rectify to DC and then produce their own AC before it hits the isolation transformer, a switched mode will work fine on 120v DC. 


So heres my question, this 900w boost converter only cost me about $16 off ebay, but almost no harmonic noise heard through the herd though the headphone port, unlike my cheapo $43 MSW inverter. Is there any harm in just using this to power my gear?

31,Silicone grease on plastic - are there any alternatives?,1501471501,"Hi all,

Not an engineer so not much knowledge on materials, chemical components etc.

I have a [finger-grip trainer](http://imgur.com/gallery/UHsAT) that seems to be a bit sticky and showing signs of wearing down (white dust, perhaps plastic?), and I was thinking of lubricating it.

I've searched around for lubricating options and some options I've found were Teflon, silicone (mixed reports on whether they fuse plastics together), graphite, boron nitrite etc but I thought I'd like your feedback.

I saw this thread from a nerf forum and I think the OP has similar requirements with me. One of the answers:
&gt;The Good
Ones you should use

&gt;1. Silicone - Available in many varieties and applications, and you must select the type that is intended for your use. Certain mixes contain purposed **additives or viscosity ratings** that could actually hinder performance or potentially damage your Nerf blaster internals.
Get the Silicone GREASE that's available in small tubs. In hardware stores it is usually located near the PVC Solvent Cements.

Are there general guides for what additives I should avoid? Is silicone grease terribly messy?

Previously, I've tried using bicycle chain lube, a Teflon-based dry lube, which came in a bottle rather than aerosol (some say aerosol propellants are bad for plastics). It worked well for a while but has since stopped working, also its terribly messy.

All in all, I want is a lube that:

1. isn't messy (ruling out graphite powder), since I use it at my desk.
2. isn't overly sticky (a trade off vs. lubricity which I don't mind since it isn't an item that goes through an incredible amount of stress) since the rubbing areas are places I'll easily touch while using this item.
3. does not degrade the plastic. I think this isn't too difficult cos I'll look for something labelled as plastic specific.
4. does not require constant reapplication. I don't mind reapplying it once a week or so but anything more than that I'll just go back to using my chain lube.

Also, I do not know what type of plastic this device is made of. It might be important with deciding what sort of lube to use.

I disliked both my internships and now I feel like I wasted any opportunities to explore other companies.

First internship was at Qualcomm. I didn't really like it. They had good pay, nice benefits, and all that. But my entire team was at least 45, I'm not super excited about what they do, and people didn't seem passionate about their work. They care about their families, children, etc. and I'm 22, so those aren't priorities in my life right now.

Second internship was SpaceX. I thought I was going to love it but I don't think it's for me. I feel like there is so much pressure and stress, and a slight feeling of ""We're the best and brightest so this work is to be expected."" People on all the teams I've been on say this job is significantly tougher than their previous work at NASA, Big 4, etc. which might have been words of motivation but I find discouraging. I like to do cool things and not burnout in the process.

I'd like to hear about CS and Aerospace companies that are less demanding than SpaceX, do interesting things, and have fun cultures. What does it mean to have a good worklife balance? What are good benefits? Do you work for the entirety of your 8 hour days or are chunks of that devoted to ""goofing off""?

46,[mechanical] Roast my idea for a solar-powered air conditioner,1501386051,"**The crank case and pistons**: 

* A cam shaft is mounted on a sturdy frame with N-number of rods, no engine block.
* Each rod is N-meters long, extends down below ground, X-meters into a pool of water,
* No cylinder chamber, just rods going into the water
* At the end of each rod is like an upside-down cone, like a martini glass, with a quick-release valve that allows it to fall downward into the water with minimal resistance.

**The heat collector:**

* A series of N heat collector tubes, X meters long, large glass tubes with black material inside to heat air.
* Each tube connected to hoses that ran vertically down below each ""martini glass"" collector. 
* Valves let in cool air from above, close, then heat makes the air expand, displacing water in the hoses, and eventually bubble up under the martini-glass. 
* Air in the glass pushes pistons up and slowly drives the cam shaft, just like a gasoline engine, but much slower. 
* The valves allow cool air to be taken into a single heat-collector, while others are under pressure and bubbling into a glass.
* standard pneumatic techniques could be used to amplify the pressure effects for optimal performance (the same way pneumatic jacks are somehow able to leverage and combine force )

**the cooler** 

* the slowly moving crank-shaft would be connected to an appropriate gear shaft that turns the compressor axle on a standard A/C unit.

60,Which mechanical alternatives to a crank exist that converts a constant velocity circular motion to a constant velocity reciprocating motion?,1501331052,"I was watching a video about a sickle blade sharpener on youtube, and it is using a [crank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_(mechanism\)) (as far as I can understand) to make the rotating whetstone move along the blade of the sickle. [Here's a link to the point in the video where you can see the whetstone reciprocate](https://youtu.be/-jAGsGwPZ1Y?t=10m50s). Later on in the video you can see an example of the mechanism being used to sharpen a sickle blade.

From my understanding, this reciprocating motion is more or less sinusoidal, which means that it will spend more time grinding the extreme edges of the sickle than it will grind the middle of the sickle. Perhaps that's desirable in this case, I don't know.

But if I wanted to construct a mechanism that spends equal amounts of time grinding all points of a blade, which mechanisms could I use? In other words, **which mechanisms can convert a constant velocity circular motion to a reciprocal motion that has constant linear velocity?**

I can imagine that this could be achieved with some kind of [rack and pinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_and_pinion) mechanism, but I don't know how it would reverse direction at the ends of the rack. And I'm sure there's other ways of doing this too.

The sickle blade sharpener is just an example. There's no practical reason for me asking this other than to satisfy my curiosity.

73,Need advice from material/metallurgical/mechanical engineers regarding mono-metal pair welding.,1501251085,"My current project involves laser welding a thin rectangular copper sheet (3x6 cm) on a square copper substrate (7x7 cm) -assume they are both pure. As far as I know, when welding (keyhole welding) copper to copper no intermetallic layer forms compared to welding Al and Cu. So the bond does not suffer from brittleness ie. stronger mechanically.

Now this will get slightly specific. I am interested in knowing how the weld seam layout (a vertical seam, a horizontal seam, a circle) would affect the overall joint quality (ability to withstand pull stress). Of particular interest to me is the effects of weld seam placement on the joint quality. For example, if i place the weld seam at the very edge of the sheet (rectangle longer than it is wide, weld seam placed widthwise at the ""northern"" edge of the rectangle), will the joint be worse? What if the weld seam is x mm offset from the edge (Overlapping layer between sheet and substrate in both cases held constant)? Any effects if I made the weld seam as long as the sheet width? What if it's made shorter? What is the theoretical framework that governs mono metal pair welding? lambert-beer law?

Now I don't need direct answers to these questions though I would certainly appreciate that. What I need is literature (textbooks, journals) that deal with these questions. I have been googling for a while now but the results are less than satisfactory. They are either too general, or they deal with alloys or dissimilar metal pairs, or they don't cover laser welding. 

A little background: I am neither a mechanical nor metallurgical engineer nor a material scientist. My background is in optics. What I'm doing now deals a lot with material science and related discipline, of which I know almost nothing. So I really appreciate your help, especially inisight from experts.

Ps: theoretically, i think the weld seam placement and geometry affects the heat affected zone of the material. If it's placed at the edge the thermal flow is
restricted so it could probably lead to deformation, but I'm not sure since it's not my field. ",AskEngineers,bwyne,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6q415c/need_advice_from_materialmetallurgicalmechanical/

The part-time AWD system disconnects the rear axle ""for improved fuel economy"". This disconnect is done, from what I understand, by an electrical clutch at the read differential.

Since all the parts are still there (weight) and still turning (friction), the only change is that the torque applied on the rear axle and wheel is now coming from the road going under the wheels instead of coming from the engine. However, since that road movement is generated by the engine turning the front wheels, the engine is still moving the same number of parts, only if goes from front wheel, to the ground, to the rear wheel instead of going through the driveshaft.

I don't understand how such a system can improve fuel economy or if it really does a difference. Are there other factors at play that makes such a system really more efficient than a permanent coupling, a la Subaru?

(X-post from /r/woodworking),1501195073,"Hi everyone, I was lucky enough to receive an old table saw from my wife's neighbor for free. He stopped using it because the motor went bad, and bought a new one to replace it. He had this in his shop for several years taking up space before he offered it to me. He and his neighbor found a Dayton 5k960-A 1hp motor that turned on, and ran, but it was for a left tilt table saw, and the saw that he gave me is right tilt, so it spins the blade the opposite direction that I need it to spin. 
I have already tried switching leads 5 and 6, which is what the wiring diagram on the motor says to do to change direction, but when I try to turn on the saw the motor only hums and does not spin. I have done some poking around on other forums and already tried some of the more common advice, including spinning the pulley by hand when starting the motor (no belt on,) and installing a new capacitor. Neither of these have worked, and the motor still only hims when I try to turn it on when it is set up for counter clockwise rotation.

  - is open source
  - has absolute position sensing all the time
  - is stepper driven

The joint that makes me uncomfortable is [the 4th axis in this picture](http://iptmajorproject.weebly.com/uploads/3/8/3/2/38323399/467473521.jpg?299).  So far I haven't found any *good* examples of cross sections or exploded diagrams to study.  Maybe my problem is belief?  It find it hard to accept that simply clamping both halves of the arm to the bearing will maintain rigidity for repeatable accuracy.

I understand the larger the radius of the bearing the more stable it will be and that putting two bearings with some distance between them will make it even more stable.  

Even if there are two bearings with some distance between them, then there's a new problem: where to put an absolute rotary encoder.  I've been using magnetic hall effect sensor which has to be centered along the axis of rotation.  I pay $20 for my sensors now and $30 for each bearing.  A hollow shaft encoder for $50 would be... more than I could hope for.

So... am I confused?  uneducated?  I know there must be a way to do this without breaking the bank.  Maybe I don't know enough to ask the right question and that's why I'm stuck.

In a perfect world I'd like to make a single motorized geared joint that has an absolute encoder and a pass-through for wiring.  Then I could chain 6 of them together with some angle brackets to build the arm I want.  Bonus, being all the same would simplify my manufacturing.

- spare monster cable (its huge, no worry here)
- 2x 100w 8ohm 4"" kenwoods

Last night I gave this a trial run.  The PSU was powering an unimportant computer, and I used the pcie line as the power to the amp.  Everything powered up, computer boots, dc converter lights up.  However, I forgot to adjust the dc output of the converter.... and the amplifier simply popped, smoke etc.  I would later use my multimeter to find out I was putting 48volts into the amp rated for 35~36 :-(

Having bought a replacement amplifier of amazon, and now tuned the dc converter as low as it will go (36.6v), I am worried about two things:

- Q1 the remaining over-voltage.  Will a 1 volt excess harm the amplifier? It lists 36v using 6ohm speakers, and 34v using 8ohm speakers.  But the capacitor I popped lists 35V on the side.  Can I use a resister to drop the voltage from 36.6v to 34v?  Doesn't the varying amperage load screw that up?  Or maybe the amplifier will be ok with a slight overvoltage?

- Q2 this whole time, I've been assuming [from the TDA7498's datasheet listing 6amps as the overcurrent shutdown threshold](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/db/c5/04/74/fd/08/43/de/CD00244535.pdf/files/CD00244535.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00244535.pdf), that the amp would only ever draw 5A.  Working backward, the dc dc converter outputs 5A max, and draws 15A max.  Am I correct in assuming the PC 12v rail at 25A will easily power the computer and this amp (drawing 15A)?  Am I creating a dangerous situation?  Is the varying amperage draw from music playback going to affect things?

- Q3 is my wiring ok?  I did some research and found 3 parellel 18AWG comes to 13awg combined, which is more than enough to run 15amps across 2' length to the dc converter.  After that, 30+V at 5A can be handled by single pair of 18awg, right?


I will not be running the amp at full power, but I want my build to be safe.  The higher amp nature of everything, and the smoking capacitor on my desk, makes me cautious.  Is there anything about how amperage flows through varying load music amplifiers that I don't understand / account for?

Also, Silicon Nitride doesn't expand much when it's hot - though if it's in a metal chassis that does expand, why would this be important? Is it when there's tiny tolerances of the race ways/bearings and the bearing would jam if it expanded?

Whereas Zinc Oxide expands like metal.... 

I've only seen one Silicon Nitride bearing - and it's ""scratchy"" when spinning when not under load. The Zinc Oxide bearings I've seen spin a lot smoother when not under load.                
Is it like this for all Silicon Nitride bearings, or did I experience a badly engineered one?

Finally - hybrid bearings.

I've read the hard ceramic polishes the race ways, producing less friction. But I've not read any reasons for using a hybrid Silicon Nitride, versus Zinc Oxide.           
Is there a difference that would influence the choice of hybrid bearings in a machine?

On the bright side, the weight of the Germanium and Copper is quite minimal, so I can neglect it. However, the thermal stresses are just too much, going slightly over the yield strength. The only other structural material that will work is LE phenolic linen. While the material does look like it has very promising thermo-mechanical properties, it's a composite material. I do not have composite mechanics course experience, and I do not have nearly enough time to teach it to myself before the design is due. (Though I will probably learn that stuff eventually.) However, there might be a way around that:
Can I treat LE phenolic linen as an isotropic material if the whole component is purely going through thermal stresses (a change from 68 F to -321.07 F)? Or if not, how do I solve this, and is it feasible to learn the background info and solve this problem in a few hours and understand the mechanics purely behind this material in this loading scenario? (And what are those formulas?)

I am also aware of the possibility that this was in fact intentional.  I'm pretty sure the president is a mechanical engineer, so he would know that composite mechanics is an elective that not a lot of universities offer on a constant basis and even fewer people take them, and that learning composite mechanics in two weeks is unrealistic, so the pool of people that would be able to fully solve this problem would be very small.

17,Advice or RFC on a home evaporative cooling system.,1501097315,"http://imgur.com/ISTXJAL  is the general outline.  I used ms paint to make it easier to explain what I am trying to achieve.

##Problem  
I live in an arid/desert environment where the dew point is avg 45F, max 65F, and min 35F.  I live in my basement with limited options for cooling the air as I don't have enough windows to make a traditional swamp cooler viable.  In addition I have Multiple sclerosis and become mostly incapacitated when the ambient air gets above 80F so ideally I aiming to keep my living spaces at 70F or lower.

##Current solution &amp; issue   
Currently I have a 10,000 BTU portable air conditioner which is mostly effective but it is cost prohibitive electricity wise while I have access to plenty of water from a 1200 gallon cistern and municipal water.

##Source idea #1 (Coolerado LLC.'s multi-stage indirect evaporative cooler)  
In addition I live somewhat literally down the street from a company called Coolerado which makes commercial scale ""multi-stated indirect evaporative coolers"" which I am trying to mimic in someways.  More in depth information on that is provided by an NREL report here http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61304.pdf  
I've seen the Coolerado evaporative heat exchanger and I don't know where to begin with trying to replicate that design (page 4) so I figured KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) is the best approach.  

##Source idea #2 (Evaporative ""bong"" cooler)  
Best example of what these look like is here http://www.overclock.net/t/1503843/my-bong-cooler-build-log-evaporative-cooling  Air is forced up a pipe while a mist of water sprayed from the top falls down to a reservoir below with some amount of water converted to a gas, lowering the temperature of the remaining liquid.


##Proposed idea  
Using the image above as a guide (http://imgur.com/ISTXJAL) there would be an working air loop drawn into the basement which would run through the ""bong"" cooling tower and then exhausted outside.  Ideally the water dropped down the cooling tower would be close to local ambient (generally it is ~54-60F).  In tandem, water would be drawn from the reservoir, run through a simple exchange which would hopefully cool the interior air before being sent down the cooling tower.


##Additional ideas, future improvements.  
To make the system a bit more efficient and minimize water losses, the air loop fan would be turned off when the temperature in the reservoir reached some desired temperature (say 65F or even 55F).  

Similarly the interior air exchanger would turn off and on when the ambient interior air temp reached some desired temperature.

A float switch in the reservoir could be used to turn everything off if the reservoir was about to run dry.

Likely part of the first build would be an screen and air filters to keep the reservoir water from being fouled up by dust brought in from outside while a bunch of silver anti-bacterial sticks repurposed from humidifiers would be used to minimize bacterial funk.  That or perhaps just a few milliliters of hydrogen peroxide?

A collector would take water that condensed on the interior air heat exchange and somehow drain that into the reservoir.  I say somehow as I am not sure how well that would work.  If air is being forced into the bottom of the ""bong"" cooling tower, my thought is that it would try to take the path of least resistance by going through the hole meant for condensate to pour into. 

If this works well, a far in the future idea would be to build multiple water/air exchanges in various rooms in my house with insulated PEX pipes running to the reservoir.


##Misc data  
Totally at random I was thinking of using a 6 inch diameter PVC tube for the ""bong"" cooling tower, mostly filled with 40mm ping ball balls, and likely a 1200 gallon per hour flow of water from the reservoir.   

##Mostly random numbers
""Bong"" cooling towers would be 10 inch diameter, 5 feet tall, mostly filled with 40mm ping pong balls to increase surface area.  
Reservoir - currently thinking 30 gallons would be sufficient.  
Intake air exchange CFM - No idea just yet but likely it is around 2,400 CFM
Inside water to air exchange/radiator - No idea, at worse I might just braze together some sort of aluminum abomination radiator and put that on the front of a room box fan.


---

So.... Is this viable?   I have the PVC tubing (rigid &amp; flexible), I have water pumps (claimed 12.5 head with ~1600 GPH flow rates).  From a defunct portable A/C I have a high CFM blower for the intake/exhaust loop.  As for the reservoir itself, sourcing a suitable insulated container shouldn't be too hard (maybe just a large ice chest/cooler).   I was planning on having three cooling towers run in series (with a lot of tinkering to ensure all three get equal amounts of air &amp; water) to compensate for having no idea where to begin with calculating exterior dew point, air intake CFM, water flow rate, and interior air exchange

20,Question Regarding Crowned Roller Geometry in a Driven Nip,1501092065,"I have a crowned roller in the nip on a laminating machine. The nip is driven and the nip rollers are chain driven together with identical gearing. We have a crowned bottom nip roller to help even our nip pressure. We are still having uneven nipping at the edges, which is causing me to reevaluate our roller design. According to our testing, the lamination is even across the width, but in certain products it is pretty clear that the edges are getting pulled harder and causing a longer edge that will curl and stipple.
My question is, with a crowned roller pair with a non crowned roller, should the edge diameter of the crowned roll (so the area with no appreciable crown) match the diameter of the uncrowned roller? Or should the max diameter of the crowned roller (center) match the diameter of the uncrowned roller?
Looking at our rollers, the max diameter matches the top roller, and the edges are undersized. Could this cause a speed variance at the edge of the web? Or does the deflection of the roller take that up?

26,Career Crossroads-Company Paid-Master's (with lots of exceptions) versus Switching Jobs,1501082355,"Hello All-

As a young engineer, I'm looking for some career advice on an interesting situation I'm finding myself in.

Background: Graduated ~1.5 years ago from well-known state school with my BSME. Now I'm working at my first full-time job out of college at a very large fortune 500 company as a 'project engineer' within product development.

Dilemma: This position is very 'hands off' and 'high-level'. While I'm gaining some very nice project management and soft skills xp, I feel like my engineering side of my brain is not utilized at all. It feels like it is becoming lost over time. My plan until recently was to finish up my project (would be around the 2 year xp mark) and then start applying to slightly more technical roles within product development at other companies.I also very much dislike the area of which my job is located, so another factor in this is for me to get out of this area(I already have 2 areas in mind).  I spoke with supervisor and there's no lateral movement to a different position for at least another couple years, unfortunately.

Recently-I discussed with my supervisor and it was suggested to start my masters. The benefits of this would be an all paid for degree, with the hopes it will put me in a position to a more specific, technical role. Drawbacks of this. In order for it to be fully paid stipulations include: completing it over the course of 3 years, staying with the company for another 2 years after completion (or else owing $$), and continuing in this job/area I dislike. 

So fellow engineers-is it worth it to stick out a crappy job/area for the next few years to get a free masters?

36,Satillite Propulsion,1501045362,"Alright, this thought has been plaguing me for a while now, and I'm wondering if it's even possible.  
Imagine a cube floating in zero G: where each of the 12 edges consists of a rotating beam spinning at a high RPM. Now what would happen if I revved down 3 of the beams that are in line with each other, so the remaining spinning ones are 4 on either side of each other, with one bridging between them. From there I rev down the 4 that are not connected to the bridging beam, leaving us with 5 rotating beams and 7 that are still.  
Now what would happen, in a physical realm, if we stopped these last ones as fast as we could?  
My thinking is that the two on either side of the bridge would cancel their gyroscopic forces out, and the cube would begin to rotate around the bridging one as an axis.  
  
Assuming this to be true, if we only allow the cube to rotate 90° by re-revving the other beams, would we be able to repeat this process to essentially make the cube ""walk"" through zero G?  
  
Again, assuming this logic is sound, would we be able to enclose it in a sphere inside of another sphere where the inner one would ""knock"" against the outer one repetitively with brief pauses as a means to overcome the fact that walking cube wouldn't be able to truly accelerate itself (other than around its axes).  
  
Hopefully this makes some sense. I'm just curious if it would even work as there's no real way of testing it other than in space.

43,Is this realistic?,1501003925,"Hello all!

I am a junior in high school, and I am designing a bicycle-powered generator for a science project.

I'm completely new to the aspect of electrical and mechanical engineering and all, so please forgive me if I sound naive.

Now, I understand that bicycle-powered generators are not new. I want to add something though to my project. In my understanding, no bicycle-powered generator that I've seen is all that efficient. The most efficiency I've seen is 10 watts per second.

So, I want to make an extremely efficient bicycle. I know it won't power a house, but I want to create something that, at the very least, isn't laughable. Maybe it could charge a battery. Or a phone.

Here is my design. I am currently replacing the back wheel of a bicycle with a flywheel. This flywheel is heavier; thus it contains a lot more inertia. The purpose of this is to keep a steady flow of energy once I've pedaled for about five minutes. Think about it  - in the beginning it could be difficult, sure, but after a minute or two keeping the wheel going shouldn't be that difficult. It'll be relatively lightweight.
Also, the flywheel helps me got to overall faster speeds. There's only so fast that a regular bicycle wheel can go. A flywheel that is heavier can go much faster once enough energy has been inputted.

I am designing the flywheel so that a chain can be attached. This chain will lead to a sprocket. The sprocket contains 5 teeth. Consequently every time that the flywheel turns one full revolution, the sprocket will turn five revolutions. Because the sprocket is small and directly attached, there shouldn't be much heat lost due to friction. This boosts efficiency.

I am also attaching a gearbox that has a 1-7 ratio. Every time the sprocket is turned once, the gearbox is turned 20 times. Thus, every time the flywheel makes one full revolution the gearbox turns 35 times.

Pretty simple. I'm attaching this gearbox to a generator, not a motor. You see, if you turn a motor in reverse, that does create electricity. But from some basic research, I have seen that motors are terrible generators. Sure, you can turn them in reverse. However, the design that makes a motor a good motor conversely makes that same motor a bad generator. 

So I will be using a generator, a pretty powerful one at that. 

So, here is the math. Let's say that I can only get the flywheel to make 0.5 revolutions per second(worst case). That would mean that the gearbox would turn 17.5 times per second. Multiply by 60(to get rpm, revolutions per minute) and you get 1050 rpm, which is pretty good.

My end goal is to charge a battery. 

Are there any flaws? Am I stupid for trying this?

48,Do other engineering disciplines talk about methods and processes as much as software engineering?,1500982798,"I'm a software engineer. I graduated from an ABET accredited Software Engineering program housed in the College of Computing and Information Sciences (with CS, IT, and a few other computing programs). I've been working full time for about 7 years now - I spent 5 years in aerospace/defense and I'm now in my 2nd year of working in healthcare and pharmaceutical (making software to support these industries).

By process and methods, I'm not looking at engineering disciplines who create processes and methods. For example, industrial or chemical engineering. Instead, I'm looking at the processes and methods of requirements engineering, design engineering, and project management.

I'm looking at a everything from undergraduate education through the end of one's career, including graduate education, certificate programs, and work experiences, and so on.

As an undergrad, we had a required course in software development processes and project management. The other engineering project management courses were in the College of Engineering or the College of Applied Science and Technology and didn't seem to be required. Some friends in other engineering fields had no interest in engineering economy or engineering management courses. I ended up taking engineering econ, but the economics of software are different (material costs and construction costs are low, almost 0 compared to design costs), but the principles we're interested.

At my first job, I spent 4 of my 5 years there working with Engineering Process. There were several software engineers interested (as someone who has formal education in software engineering processes and methods, I was the ""lead"" on process improvement), but it was extremely difficult to find interested people from the other engineering disciplines. It seems like software engineers like talking about how they do their work and to find ways to meet industry or regulatory requirements and do their job better.

Looking at conferences, many of the more traditional engineering disciplines go to conferences where academic research is presented. The software engineers I know (myself included) go to conferences where we not only talk about the cutting edge and technical subjects, but also soft subjects, like how we work and how to work better.

Am I missing something?

52,Calculating conductivity of a solution,1500946180,"Hi,

Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post, but I'm having some trouble measuring the conductivity of a solution.

So I have a AC Voltage generator connected to my solution via 2 electrodes, which is connected to a 1k resistor, and I can visualize and measure the voltage across the resistor using a device. A picture is shown below.

http://imgur.com/a/QDsLu

What I am not sure is when calculating the resistivity rho, am I supposed to be using the surface area of the solution, or the surface area of the electrode tips? And what about the length? Should it be the length of the container of the solution, or the length between the electrodes?
The reason I ask is because when I did my calculation with the surface area of the solution (5mm x 5mm) and the length between the electordes, my conductivity was about 2 orders of magnitude off from the known value for the solution.

By my reading online, it seems like I'm supposed to use the surface area of the electordes, but when I drained the solution out of the well using a syringe (while the electrode tips were still submerged), the output voltage went down accordingly, which suggests that it's the surface area of the solution itself that I should be looking at (?)

Furthermore, when I decreased the length of the container, as well the length between the electrodes, the output voltage did not change.

So I'm just really confused and any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",AskEngineers,Misanthropic_Cynic,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6pcytd/calculating_conductivity_of_a_solution/

62,9-10 years to earn a Civil Degree?,1500924879,"Hello /r/AskEngineers,


I shared this information in other threads before, however I have a very specific question relating to Engineering.

Here is the topic:

Last year I was forced out of Civil Engineering to Applied Sciences (non-abet Engineering). After another rough year(2.5 GPA), I was forced out and into Physics(not Engineering). Doing the math, I realized I could graduate with a Bachelor's of Arts in Physics by this Fall or Bachelor's of Science in Physics by Spring 2018. This Fall is my 7th year at the University(I switched majors) and I wanted to just get a degree and then immediately come back for my Civil Engineering degree.

After speaking with the Program director for Civil Engineering, I was informed that if I do very well for Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 I could be offered to return to Civil. He said that after that, I would need another 2 years to graduate in May 2020 due to the requirements of the major. 9 years after I enrolled in this University(albeit I'll have a Bachelor's degree already). 


What I wanted to ask is: is this worth it? I'm going to be paying them for 9 straight years. Before you say it, I definitely want to be a Civil Engineer, I had huge bumps in the road but I still want to continue it and succeed. 

Also, my parents are unaware of the situation and most likely will be not supporting me financially after next summer. I would need to work my butt off while at the same time attending classes.


Please advise me, as I don't know who to turn to. I would have thought that I could get a job with my Bachelor's of Arts in Physics during next Fall and graduate by 2018 Fall or 2019 Spring, however being told I need to be taking classes until 2020 Spring was a shellshock.

I live in New Jersey, and have experience in Civil Engineering from very prestigious people/companies. I also have a PRINCE2 Project Management certification, but I doubt I can find work while I am still in school(even if I was part time).",AskEngineers,Octopus69,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6parz1/910_years_to_earn_a_civil_degree/

65,How long before a tech position becomes a death sentence for a graduate engineer,1500923484,"Ok so I have been applying to engineering positions and whie I have been getting interviews, and making it to some second interviews the competition just seems very intense. 

Thus I started to look into tech jobs. Some engineering technician jobs require an associate's while others just a HS degree. 

The general consensus here and /r/engineers seems to be that it is a death sentence since it is tech and not engineering. On the other hand, this seems to apply more for *design* engineers and not so much manufacturing, field, or project engineers. Also it seems to only apply to those who stay on a tech role for 3 years. 

I graduated with a degree in industrial engineering and have no interest in going the design route. 

The plan is to start looking 6 months on the job and plan on only being on the tech job for a year or two. It will have to be at least a year since I will need to lease and in the states you can end up anywhere. 

Also I did not have a large network nor did I stay in touch so this will give me the opportunity to grow my network since networking seems to be the number one way to get your foot in the door.

66,Can a frequency counter characterize an ultra-short duty cycle (on the order of 1/10 000 000)?,1500922225,"This will be somewhat in relation to this thread I created here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/6ogvv3/affordable_way_of_measuring_a_10_ns_signal_pulse/ (Making this second thread in this subreddit since this is as much optics as it is about electronics)

Quick recap, I want to measure the pulse width coming from a laser. The laser pulse will be anywhere from 10 ns to 10 ps (and even shorter if we can manage it). We’re shining the pulse on a Si photodetector and observing the resulting electrical pulse on an oscilloscope. I’m looking for an affordable way to make super quick measurements on that pulse. We want to confirm that a laser that says it can do 100 picoseconds will in fact have a pulse that’s that fast.

I read that a frequency counter could maybe do what I’m looking for. If I set my laser to 1000 Hz, with a pulse width of 1 nanosecond, I’ve effectively created a 1 millisecond period with a duty cycle of 1/1 000 000. Shortening the pulse width will result in an even smaller duty cycle. What I need then is a frequency counter that can measure these ultra-quick duty cycles.

Or... if there are frequency counters that will just tell me the time between the rising edge and the falling edge directly, that would work too. The idea is to do away with all the complicated stuff that an oscilloscope can do, like amplitude and comparing multiple signals simultaneously. What I want is just the time measurements. And (hopefully) get a more affordable instrument in the process.

I found some decent looking frequency counters over on Digikey, but I want to make sure I'm on the right track and not... completely misunderstanding how frequency counters work.

77,I was on probation. Now I have 2 options to get back on track: Community College or University. Which option puts on the best impression on my transcript?,1500911866,"Hello,

Canadian here. *Thank you for taking the time to read.* 

So I was withdrawn from my University program in Engineering with 6+ failed courses and now I am here. 

Where? I am in community college. As in, I have received offers from colleges that I wanted. I am definitely applying to Universities when I graduate with my diploma (no associate's degrees here). I need a degree in this field. 

But at the same time, I had tried an alternative route back into my program at University. When in probation, I also applied to programs that were not Engineering. I applied and got accepted into Social sciences and Physics. At first, my plan was to accept these programs, study like hell for a year in these programs, upgrade academic standing, then apply to switch programs into Engineering. The admissions officer and the Faculty advisor told me that it's possible. But I did some risk assessment and found that it's a hit-or-miss risk:

- My transcript is really affected by all those failure averages. **IF** I would be able to do impeccably well during that 1 year in either social science or physics, will it be enough, or is the possibility just so low now? i.e. What is the cut-off average that I need and is it possible for me ? 

- If I cannot make the move to engineering, both areas are not my interest (I just chose them to ""get in"" and do the trick)

- If I cannot make the move to engineering, both areas won't do much with a Bachelor's degree 

But here's the thing. I got accepted to a wide range of programs at college. It seems like a fresh start. But In Canada, College (we refer to community colleges as such) is not really very high in relation to High school, and paired with the fact that there are no ""Guaranteed Admissions Agreements"" and Associate's degrees, it's a ""free-for-all"" for college graduates. It's their fair game policy. The pros are that I got accepted to a range of programs from Engineering technology to computing science, and the con  is that it doesn't carry a lot of weight in relation to High school. 

Now we all know that once I apply to University, ALL my transcripts will be submitted to the admissions office. 

To round it up,  If I go to University, I will either go to Physics or Social Sciences. I have no interest in them so the sole purpose is to do very well as a full time student then transfer to engineering full time. If I go to college, I will go into an engineering technology diploma, graduate, then apply to university for engineering. Assuming that I study very hard, my question is, which one of these transcripts will put on a good impression for universities when I apply ?

* The GM Volt works great, but it's not a true serial hybrid, and the engine+transmission is very heavy. 84hp
* The BMW i3 REX works great. I believe it's also pretty heavy (300lbs+ with gastank) 36hp, underpowwered.
* Ford's 3-cylindre 1.0L 80hp. 120hp for the turbo version. 215lbs.
* [Toyota's free piston thing with no crankshaft](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/185789-toyota-develops-high-efficiency-free-piston-no-crankshaft-combustion-engine-to-power-an-ev) might be the best thing I've seen so far, they claim it has a 42% efficiency.

(I want to clarify that the president of the company is testing me on my ability to learn new information, and actively encouraged getting help from any sources; books, papers, forums, even himself.  So I'm not cheating by going to reddit.)

I am supposed to redesign a component in a [high purity Germanium gamma radiation detector.](http://imgur.com/SyIzWEP) There is a  [triangular support plate](http://imgur.com/SyIzWEP) that is supposed to hold the weight of the [Germanium crystal and the copper rods](http://imgur.com/GdRRJuI) that transfer heat to the 30 liter vat of liquid Nitrogen in order to keep the detector cool enough (77K) to get reliable readings.  I decided to change the design to [this](http://imgur.com/pXp9NOR) (I have lots of space to reroute the wires to go around the plate instead of through a hole in the plate.)  It needs to withstand the weight of the copper and the Germanium (3.04 lb) as well as the thermal fatigue from warming between room temperature and 77K.  (The president said one cycle per week for ten years.  So 520 cycles isn't a whole lot, but it's still fatigue.)  The weight of the Ge and Cu is distributed in a ring that goes from the large inner hole to a circle that is tangent to and surrounds all three of those tiny holes immediately surrounding the large central hole.  Ideally I would like to do some hand calculations and then back it up with Inventor's FEA.  I was hoping to find a case somewhat similar in Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain (7th ed) and the closest one is Table 11.2, Case 2f (outer edge of the annular plate fixed, inner edge guided, and uniform distributed load from a distance away from the center to the outer edge.)  But as you see, the loading conditions really aren't all that close.   I've been searching for a couple of hours and I really can't find anything better.  *Technically* I could derive a solution, but that would be a royal pain and does not appear to be efficient.  

So can anyone come up with a better method to double check the FEA with hand calculations, or is this component complex enough that the only way to quickly make any meaningful analyses is through FEA?  

Also, given that I'm a new grad looking for entry level mechanical positions, how often would I really be using hand calculations when the components I'll be designing are probably going to be far more complex than anything I've done in college, and how should I change my approach to those parts in the future?

Assuming the engine would automatically inject the same amount of gas for each revolution regardless of engine speed.

Hello all,  I want to add a semi suspended ceiling over my kitchen island. This ceiling (some told me to call it a soffit) should be 54"" wide, 9"" in height (roughly), and 14 feet long.  One 54"" wide end will be attached to a wall and the other end will be held via two steel cables. I plan on using (5) 1""x10"" boards that are 14 feet long run lengthwise and about 14"" apart.   This ceiling will have drywall bottom and sides (and likely top, as well).  This ceiling will also support a 80 lb. range hood. It will be located 10 feet away from the wall where this ceiling attaches to (or four feet from the other end (the end suspended by the steel cables). The hood will not be centered about the 54"" width, but rather 12"" away from one side. Because of this, one of the 1'x10' beams will not be full span but will need to be cut and a hole made available for the hood exhaust to pass through. This will weaken the structure but I feel it should still be suffice having 4 boards run full length. Where the board is cut, I will build a box to support the hood and to strengthen the cut 1x10 board. The ceiling will be attached via steel cables as follows:  The 1x10 boards will be notched at the bottom (about 12 feet from the wall???)  to accept a 2x4 board (54"" long). This board will be drilled thru (near 1x10 board number 2 and 4 or not near the end boards nor the middle board, obviously) and an eye bolt will be attached to the steel cable attached to the 2x6 trusses in the ceiling. I plan on using SS 1/4 inch cable which support about 1400 lbs each.
My questions are:
1. Are 1x10s wood board a good idea for this? I feel metal studs would be too flimsy. Okay upright, but not confident layed horizontally.
2. Where along the entire length of the ceiling shall I locate the 2x4 and eventual steel cables? I was thinking at 11 to 12 feet from the wall. Not sure where the optimum placement should be.
3. Is a 2x4 laid on its side strong enough to support this roughy 300lb structure. I intend on laying the 2x4 on its side (weaker) but this reduces the height of the notch on the 1x10s. The notch would only be 1 3/4"" instead of 3.5"". If it makes more engineering sense to lay the 2x4 upright, then okay. Would love a recommendation.

This design was from common sense and no engineering calculations performed.

I have been looking at language schools in Guatamala. $160 / week which includes 20 hours of one-one-on lessons, 3 meals a day, and a place to sleep with a host family. Pretty good deal, but it would be hard to have an income coming in.

2. Since I've always wanted to see the world, a sustainable way to do this seems to be teaching English abroad from my research. I have been considering Asia the most, since they pay the best. Vietnam in particular, because from my research it seems that I could work ~25 hours a week and make enough to still save ~$1000 a month according to many sources. The downside is that I have no predisposition towards learning Vietnamese and it seems like a tough choice for a guy who isn't even fluent in Spanish yet. With that said, a job working part time where I make enough to live seems ideal to me. It would free up my time for me to pursue entrepreneurial ideas much more strongly than I can now. It also would allow me to enrich my life with following some other goals such as learning Spanish, reading more, working out more consistently, and just in general spending some time getting to know myself better. The job I'm in now is very stressful with lots of travelling sporadically, late nights, and working on the weekends.
FINALLY, to the crux of the issue (well, one of them) that keeps me awake at night (although I would love to hear any general input on that you guys have). I am trying to figure out what I should do about healthcare. COBRA is super expensive for me. Can I just apply for Obamacare in the middle of the year? Are there any better options? I looked into plans and saw one w/ a monthly premium of ~$150 but it had abysmal coverage if something was to happen. The next step up is a lot better but it costs ~$250 a month; not an insignificant difference. I compared some medical travel insurance as well and it would be ~$3500 for me for a whole year for an average plan. I'm worried about what this would do to my savings.

I am of course worried about my career in the long term. I am getting to a very desperate point with my job, and think I will pick up a waiting gig for a few months just to catch my breath. And like I said, I want to see the world in my twenties, even if it isn't the best financial decision. I am hoping that I can jump back into the white collar world in a few years (if my own business ventures fail and I get tired of teaching English) and work in a business capacity rather than engineering. I graduated with honors with a degree in electrical engineering....I chose engineering because they told me that you could do many different things with this degree. So I am hoping that this is true and I will be able to find non-engineering professional work at some point (maybe technical sales). But I'd like to focus on myself for some time. Everything has just been progressing so linearly, and I really can't take this job anymore. It is severely negatively impacting my health mentally.

Thanks guys! Hope everyone is having a great Friday.
Any advice or words of wisdom is appreciated.

31,Shear capacity of a tool,1500650551,"Looking to buy a small hobby brake and shear and I want to reasonably ensure that it has the shearing capacity that I am looking for. The brake is a Kaka Industrial brand 8"" mini shear and brake. The best stats I can get on it are:

32,What do you tell an employer when they ask you “How long do you plan on being with us?”,1500650299,"I’m about to get my college degree as a technologist.  It’s like a pre-engineering college degree that gives us the option to either get a job as a technician after our 3 years training, or continue onto university to become an engineer.  I was told it was different from most pre-engineering programs in that they teach us a lot of hands-on and practical problems, like a class on how to handle 120 volt systems, as opposed to most college programs that just stuff you full of math and physics with the specific goal of continuing studies at university.

Anyway, I was told that what students often do is take extended internships for a few years, and they can use the experience as credits, replacing certain classes they would otherwise have had to do when they do finally go back to university.  I felt like doing that, but when it came up during my interview (at a pretty fancy laser design company near where I live), the interviewer implied that they prioritize people who plan on staying longer.  So I decided to bend the truth and said I planned on staying with them for 5 to 10 years before going back to university.  I didn’t end up getting the job, because she told me they wanted longer commitments.  I actually spoke with the two students who got the internships and asked them what they told the interviewer.  They each said they planned on staying there forever.  When I asked them if that was true they laughed and told me they’ll probably be gone and move onto university before 1 year has passed.

All this to say... is it normal in the industry to lie when asked these sort of questions?  I can imagine it’s super useful to companies to have stable, loyal, long-lived employees in their retinue.   But has it reached the point where everyone always lies at this question, so the companies adjust their expectations accordingly?  So that if you’re a naive fool like me and say the truth, the interviewers think “Oh crap, he said he’s staying for 5 years, he’ll be gone within a few months.”",AskEngineers,PhilippeASP,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6ook4k/what_do_you_tell_an_employer_when_they_ask_you/
33,Questions about connecting fans and TEC devices to a Rechargeable battery,1500648644,"**Introduction**

I really am a super amateur at electricity, and I know this might not be the most technical question; however, I really want to make my little cousin something really cool he can play with, so I really hope you guys can help me on a few things. The general idea that I want to accomplish is that I want to have a rechargeable battery that can power either: 
2 of these: http://ebay.to/2twmRLp
or 2 of these: http://ebay.to/2uQdhTD
or one and one.

**What I know:** 

What I have found out is that you need a PWM controller that you can plug a Molex header (on the fan wires) into, and that I need to watch out for Volts as the small VGA copper fan is 12V, 2 pins while the Dell Fan is 5 Volts, 5 pins that can't be mixed together. Lastly, I know that I need to connect a power supply to charge the rechargeable battery. 

**Questions**: 

I don't know what to do once I have the rechargeable battery. How do I charge a rechargeable battery using a power supply and use this rechargeable battery to power 2 fans? **I know that I need to connect the rechargeable battery to a controller that then outputs the power to the 2 fans, but I don't know anything else about controllers that fits my needs and voltage imbalances**. I do also want to hook one of these http://amzn.to/2uhZbc6 (30 Watt) to my rechargeable battery but the Peltier doesn't have a Molex on it, so I come back to the same problem of how do I get the Peltier TEC to run off of my rechargeable battery, and ultimately the same controller? that my fans run off of?

at my summer job, I recently made these SolidWorks parts and now need to create drawings that in the end will be used to machine those parts when we send them out to a machine shop. 

This is one of my first jobs, and I've often heard about the annoyance machinists have when drawings are kinda crappy. 

My question is, how can I make sure my drawing is ""proper"", in other words, it has all the necessary info, etc and doesn't come off as ""sloppy""?

On a more specific note, I have a question about threads and conveying the right info. In short, you can just imagine this part as a cube with a hole through it that is going to have an internal thread because a screw will go into it (kind of like here: http://imgur.com/a/Gp7A9).

I'm pretty inexperienced with threads/screws/etc but assuming the screw is a #4-40 x 3/4 panhead, what would be the necessary information to include so the shop actually knows what I need?

42,Why can the torque reading on a rake in a thinkening tank increase with no noticeable difference in the current draw on the motor?,1500598576,"I have a thinkener tank with a large rake running constantly through it. There is a torque meter on the rake itself (an arm pressing against a load cell). We fairly regularly see changes in this torque depending on how thick the stuff in the tank is, but absolutely never see any difference in the amps that the motor is drawing. The rake is not on a VSD and always runs at the same speed, and the gearbox can't switch gears - it always has the same ratio.

Others at my plant argue that the lack of current change is because of the large reduction that the gearbox provides (the rake only turns every 5 minutes or so). I have never found this answer satisfying, because if the torque doubles, the current should also have to double, regardless of gearbox ratio. 

The only plausible explanation I've been able to come up with is if the torque meter is calibrated to give output for only a very small range of absolute torque. So say if the difference between 0-100% of the toque meter reading is only a 5% difference in absolute torque, then it might be that we don't notice the 5% difference in amps with the noise that exists in the data.

This answer confuses me as well because at times the tank is essentially just water, and at other times it is filled with very thick slurry. Between those two scenarios the torque meter goes from 5% to 60% or so. This would mean that the rake only takes 2% more energy to move through slurry when compared to water, and that seems implausible to me as well.

43,Is material science a study with diminishing returns?,1500598099,"Having read a bit about different super alloys and special varieties of steel, I'm curious if material scientists are just closing in on the best possible materials for a given application.

Another way to put it: 100 years ago we just mainly had carbon steels for machining. Now we have tungsten carbide and high speed steel, which perform much better. In another 100 years, will we have made a similar improvement?

I'm especially curious given the Hollywood trope of the ""indestructible alien spaceship that's undamaged by every weapon on Earth."" Could such a material exist? Or are the best materials only somewhat better than what we have?

Disclaimer: I know I'm oversimplifying the subject a lot. There's no such thing as a ""best material."" My point is that for a given quality, like young's modulus, is progress linear, exponential, or logarithmic?

44,Building a Tripod to Lift a Person?,1500593062,"I would like to build an inexpensive, relatively-portable tripod that can lift a prone person four feet in the air (200lb with a safety factor of 10 = 2000lb, 6' long). I'm looking at black iron (ASTM A53?) gas pipe as a good material, which is commercially available up to 1"" diameter in 10' lengths. To suspend a six-foot-long person at four-feet off the ground will require the pipes to be at about a 53° angle from the ground. Is 1"" pipe strong enough? Can I get away with a smaller diameter?

I have no idea what I'm doing but here's my attempt to calculate it:

&gt; [This tripod force body diagram](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4031/4481815027_7e97227021_o.jpg) says that a 2000 downward load will exert 2505 pounds of force on struts at a 53° (37° from vertical = 0.646 radians). Divided between three struts = 835 lb.

&gt; Based on [these dimensions](http://products.anssteel.com/viewitems/steel-pipes/sch-40-bare-black-standard-steel-pipe) in this [area moment of inertia calculator](http://www.engineersedge.com/calculators/section_square_case_12.htm) a 3/4"" pipe has 0.037 in^4 and a 1"" pipe has 0.087 in^4 .

&gt; The [elasticity of carbon steel](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/young-modulus-d_773.html) is 29.3e6 psi. Using this [column critical load calculator](http://www.efunda.com/formulae/solid_mechanics/columns/calc_column_critical_load.cfm), I get critical failure at 748 pounds of force for 3/4"" pipe and 1760 lbf for 1"" pipe.

&gt; So it seems like 3/4"" pipe isn't quite strong enough but 1"" pipe is more than twice as strong as I need. Have I got that right?

However, the [US Army Rigging Manual](http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/MCRP%203-17.7J%20With%20Ch.%201%20z.pdf) says that as a rule of thumb if the feet of a tripod are more than 2/3 of the length of the struts apart, the struts will get significant shear stress in addition to compression. How do I account for that?

Also, does it make a significant difference if I use a [tripod top plate](http://akflow.com/global/images/part_class_images/full/Tripod-Hoist-Stand-6691-10E2838BF135E.jpg) versus [lashing the struts](http://simplethings.henrikhaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/20111221-L1005475.jpg)?

46,Questions About NPSHa,1500591007,"I'm working on kind of a weird pump setup and don't really know if I'm doing this correctly.

We have two pumps that we use to run cooling water through two heat exchangers. They both are fed off the same water line and output to the same line, which later splits off and goes to the two heat exchangers that are about 20ft higher than the pumps. They originally installed two pumps so that way they can alternate between each pump while the other was on standby, being repaired, etc. Lately, they have been running the pumps at the same time, supposedly because they needed to run more water through one of the heat exchangers, but I don't really know why and haven't found out why. Recently, one of the operators noticed that the pump sounds like it's cavitating. I couldn't figure out when the issue started. I'm trying to figure out if it's an issue with the suction head of the pump, a lack of water coming into the pumps, or if it's something else. Below is a description of the system.

The water feed line is a little interesting. The water starts off at the cooling tower, with the bottom of the pipe at the same level as the two pumps in question. There is a pump immediately outside the cooling tower that sends the water up 20ft where we run all of the plant's product, water, steam, and gas lines. This pipe is 12in in diameter, and goes about 200ft before it gets to the pump. The line it's using is the main water line for most of our equipment on the reactant side of the plant. Once the water is above the pump, it offshoots through a 4"" pipe, down 20 ft, to the pumps. At the pumps, the water goes througn both pumps (currently) and off to the exchangers. The total output from these pumps is about 105gpm. 


My questions:

1. What do I call the water source? Is it the cooling tower, the feed pump, or the pipe directly over the pumps in question?

2. Do I use to 105gpm outflow as my inflow (for calculating friction loss etc.)

3. Do I halve the NPSHa because the two pumps are using the same feedline at the same time?

Edit: Ok, I figured out that it's definitely not an NPSH issue. We have loads of head room on those pumps. With the current flow rate, impeller size, and with one pump running, we are running way in front of the pump curve. That's probably why they switched to using both pumps, and the problem came back up again due to something mechanical. I'll propose switching to a larger impeller and cleaning out the pump.

my situation is a little complicated, and I'm seeking out for help from people who possibly did obtain engineering degrees in the USA, and Germany.

For about 2,5 years I went to FHWS Schweinfurt (University of Applied Sciences), going for a Bachelor of Engineering in Logistics. 
Due to personal circumstances I did not graduate from FHWS, but moved to the USA. I can go back, and finish my degree there. I have about 90 ECTS. 

One of the assets I was able to acquire over the past years are 24 months of GI Bill. The personal circumstances are not a given much longer, and I am unsure whether a USA degree in engineering will be a good choice for me. I would start of as a upper level transfer student. But I had issues with evaluating my transcripts, and transferring them already. 

I chose the University of South Florida, but their engineering program does not offer CO OPS. How difficult will it be to get the ""foot in the door of a company"", if I do not have the support of my school? 

I am very unsure, if this is really a good idea. Maybe I should just go back to FHWS in Germany, and graduate there. 

USF seems to be ABET accredited, and it is showing as a H+ on the anabin website. 

If you had the choice to go to an engineering college in Germany, or to go to one in Tampa, Florida, what would you take under consideration?

I have been negotiating on this one for quite some time. I would like to use the GI Bill in the most productive way. 

Sorry, if this comes off as a little chaotic, or confused. I have been dealing with a lot of personal issues. Divorce. Domestic Violence. Trauma.

66,Solar Power Setup,1500535943,"I'm rigging up a van to travel in. I calculated that I would need about 2000w per day. 750w going to  necessities; a 12v fridge, ventilation fan, full phone charge, and full ecig charge. The remaining 1250w would be for a laptop, video games, etc. I would probably only use the full 1250w on rare occasions, but I want to be fully prepared on power with no worries about it.

Here is what I have...

(4) Renogy RNG-100D 100w monocrystalline solar panels

Renogy Rover 40 amp mttp charge controller

Renogy 2000w pure-sine wave inverter 

(2) Mighty Max 12v 100Ah batteries. 


I have a few concerns and looking for advice on them. 

1.) I will be running devices from 6v to 19v with the 12v pure-sine power inverter. I was told that I should get a boost/buck converter for my laptop which runs at 19v = 3.42a (max). Is this needed with the pure-sine inverter I have? If so, how and where does a boost/buck converter hook up to a laptop and do I need one for each non 12v device? 

2.) I'm sure I need to add another 12v 100Ah battery to keep up with the 2000w per day the solar panels should be bringing in, since 3 batteries would give me 1800w of usable storage. However, I have read somewhere that I should not run more than 2 batteries in parallel for some reason, what's the risk?

3rd, and lastly, I have the main parts to complete the solar setup (I think), but I know there are little things I am missing. I read that I should have a fuse ran after each power source. I would also like to have some kind of meter that tells me how much power is stored on the batteries to prevent overcharging or over-draining them. And anything else you can think of that I might be missing because this electric circuitry stuff is all new to me.

69,Do fields besides EE have something similar to EE's power factor?,1500520590,"The really short and oversimplified version of [power factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_factor) is this: You generally don't just use electrical power (e.g. in your conventional ""edison"" light bulbs). You actually use both ""real power"" and ""imaginary power."" Lightbulbs and electric motors don't just put a load on the system, they specifically put an ""inductive load"" on the system. In effect, it makes the system less efficient.

In the link, wikipedia also talks about the phase of the sine wave. So basically if you have nothing but resistors the sine wave doesn't shift or translate (i.e. it's still in step, it's not lagging or leading, aka the peaks will be in the same position on the X axis). But adding inductive load makes the sine wave lag behind the input wave.

For example, you have to generate 5 real Watts to run 1 4W motor, but 10 real Watts to run 2 4W motors (edit: these are made up numbers).

The way you counteract inductive load is with capacitive load, which is had from capacitors. Many business that have either lots of conventional light bulbs or lots of motors will sometimes install a capacitor bank to help offset the large inductive load.

**Does thermodynamics/ME/whatever have anything like this?** It would be interesting to see if there are other fields where you can correct power waves and stuff.

76,Help choosing a sub-discipline for a Master's of Engineering: Structural or Water Resource,1500503191,"Relevant Background Info: I am currently working in Kansas City, KS, USA. I majored in petroleum engineering as an undergraduate. When the market crashed I could not find employment. My employer was generous enough to take a chance on hiring me for a Civil Engineering firm, where I mostly do materials testing and special inspections for buildings. Fortunately for me, I end up loving the industry, but wanted to get some formal education so I got into a MCE program. I have 1 year of experience and have passed the FE exam.

My question: The two sub-disciplines that interest me are structural and water resource. Structural engineering was my original plan, because special inspections for buildings has me asking the ""why"" question now, rather than the ""how it's built"". However, and I do not know if this is true or not, but a colleague told me that structural engineering may become automated or streamlined into a bunch or ""cookie cutter designs"", minimizing the need for structural engineers (which I hope isn't the case). In this sub-discipline I am specifically interested many aspects like bridges, buildings, or even aircraft. 

Water resource is interesting to me as well, but was my second choice. It seems that there will always be a demand here. I fully believe it is very important work as well.

Lastly, although the demand of the sub-discipline matters to me more than pay, pay is important as well, and it has been difficult for me to find out which has an edge here. However, again, this is not as important to me as the demand in the future.

I have to choose in the next several weeks. The first Master's class I took will apply to both (corrosion engineering- awesome class by the way).

81,Would this engine work?,1500488416,"**EDIT: Soooooo**

**Current concept wouldn't work.**

**Compression went 404.**

**Working on coming up with sth.**

Had an idea about an engine design yesterday and I'd love to know if it'd work.

My basic idea is to avoid any kind of energy loss due to stroking piston motions.

A standard engine consists out of a piston stroking in a cylinder.

My idea is to build an engine that performs one constant spinning motion - it is quite simply one rotating cylinder.

This cylinder is cased in a tube that contains cavities for the explosion to happen and to withstand the pressure of the burning fuel.

It also houses all fuel inpout and exhaust systems.

The inner cylinder is fitted to the outer tube tight enough to be able to spin but seal off at the same time.

In the cylinder are cavities which point diagonally into the cylinder.

[Example image 1.](http://i.imgur.com/sA43HTE.png)

These are the expansion chambers, designed to induce a spinning motion on the cylinder.

Fuel only burns off into one cylinder at a time at the bottom position, the gas is exhausted after the cylinder rotated for 120° and new fuel is introduced into the chamber another 120° spin away.

[Example image 2.](http://i.imgur.com/K4gSPtm.png)

There are a total of 12 chambers. 2x6 next to each other, offset by 30°.

This means that per rotation of the cylinder 12 fuel ignitions occour.

It is just a rough idea which needs lot of finetuning.

But could the general concept work?",AskEngineers,dayofmone,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6oadvc/would_this_engine_work/
82,"Control Theory PhD, MatSci PhD, and Interesting Jobs",1500484205,"I'm a rising Sophmore in mechanical engineering and have so far focused on getting into a PhD program in materials science and engineering (structural materials focus). While I was doing research this summer, I took a class called Control Theory and really enjoyed the subject. The problem is that all of my publications and research thus far has been in materials science. Since I only have 4 semesters + 1 summer, there is a rather large risk that if I switched to controls research my publication record won't be nearly as strong as my matsci one would be and thus would affect my ability to get into a top control PhD program. 

To make the switch and take such a risk I would need to be absolutely certain that controls was what I wanted to do since I already know I enjoy materials science research. To that end, I have been trying to ascertain what the nature of industry controls jobs (that require a PhD) is by asking around my college (professors, grad students, etc.) and looking through Glassdoor. What I have gathered is that while controls PhD jobs are not as plentiful as MatSci PhD jobs, they certainly exist. The most interesting seem to be in autonomous driving (and a few in UAV control). Ultimately, I want an industry job that heavily employs physics and math (which is why my MatSci research focuses on dynamic materials) and in that regard the top controls jobs seem to be superior to the top MatSci jobs. The problem is that there aren't very many of them and I would assume they would go to graduates of colleges like MIT, Cornell, etc. which is concerning to me since I am unsure of my ability to get into those programs. This also worries me because it seems that controls jobs one ""tier"" down are not that interesting (ex. standard flight control jobs).

So, to finally get to my question: those who have worked in jobs or known people who worked jobs that would require a controls PhD - are there interesting and complex jobs for people outside of the top 5 controls universities? Those who know people who recently graduated with a PhD in control theory - how hard/competitive was it to find a good job? I realize much can change by the time I get out of grad school (autonomous driving underperforms or succeeds wildly) but I'm just trying to get a feel for the current situation.",AskEngineers,dontchoosewrong,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6o9wh7/control_theory_phd_matsci_phd_and_interesting_jobs/
83,Friction Hinge Sizing,1500481526,"I'm designing a hinged machine guard for a customer and I am wanting to use friction hinges to prevent the guard from slamming shut should someone let go of it. I'm not sure exactly how to size the hinges, however. They don't need to necessarily hold it open at any position, just keep it from slamming. I don't want to make it take too much effort to open and close (oversized hinges) for example. The types of hinges I'm looking at are like these https://www.mcmaster.com/#1783A2

The weight of the hinged guard is 12.5lb. In the closed position, the center of gravity is 8.04"" away from the hinge in the horizontal axis, and 4.88"" below the hinge in the vertical axis. I've calculated the maximum torque of the box (cg is aligned horizontally with hinge) as SQRT(4.88^2+8.04^2)*12.5lbf = 117.6in-lbf so I know that above that torque rating with hinges, my box will hold any position but I'm afraid that would make it difficult to open (weight of box + hinge resistance).

Is there a proper way to size these so it will make a soft close if dropped? I tried to calculate the maximum potential energy (initial energy to start) and equate that to a final energy comprised of KE of the guard and work done by the hinges, but I'm not sure if that is valid. Am I on the right path here? Using this, I calculated a final speed of 2.93rad/s rotation when dropped from being open 90deg and using 90in-lbf of hinges...seems fast.",AskEngineers,butterflavoredsalt,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6o9liq/friction_hinge_sizing/

The main problem I believe was that they didn't put enough pilings under the slab in certain areas to support the load. The fix, cut the slab in the areas that needed extra pilings and pound them in. After that it seems a extra slab was pored over the existing which leads to me to my question. 

The steel structures were already built, at least that's what I'm guessing after seeing how they are mounting them which you can see in the pics. It seems as though they extended the bolts in order to raise the beams to compensate for extra slab height, this seems sketchy to me though I'm not an engineer which is why I'm asking.

In both my tests the seal design failed although not catastrophically.  My gland design is correct according to the Parker handbook. I used 2 size 135 o-rings (70 shore A Buna N) on a male gland. the gland depth is .082"" and width is .140""

I make sure the enclosure is completely dry, place a paper towel in the enclosure and seal it.
I put the enclosure in a water pressure test vessel and put the pressure up to approx 1250psi.
I have cycled it 3 times in test 1 and let it stay at pressure overnight in test 2.
Both tests resulted in the paper towel being damp, and in test 1 there was a few small water droplets in the enclosure. 
The O-rings show no sign of failure or distress in any way.

My first guess to why the design does not work is that the oring size im using is to small for the pressure its seeing but i cant find any evidence of oring size being a problem online. To change the oring size would require changing the entire design, which is possible, but i may miss my deadline because of it.
Im also open to suggestions on different sealing methods. 

I hope someone with more experience with this can help me out!

36,Notice: the AskEngineers rules have been completely revised.,1500305767,"In general, one of the biggest problems with rules is that new users don't read them and fail to follow the expected behavior for a subreddit. To address this problem, I contacted the mods of a relatively new subreddit, /r/neutralnews, to ask them for permission to copy the format of [their guidelines](/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines) in order to greatly simplify our own rules. Those of you who have been around long enough will remember that over 2 years ago, I sought &amp; received the same permission from the mods of /r/AskHistorians, which this sub is roughly modeled after.

After getting permission last week, I started a draft revision of the rules and had a round of feedback comments from the other mods. The rules you see now are the result of that. I succeeded in reducing the body of text from *over 20,000* characters to just under 8,700 by removing redundant information and condensing over a dozen different sections into four very straightforward sections:

  * **Section 0:** Mission Statement
  * **Section 1:** Submission rules
  * **Section 2:** Comment rules
  * **Section 3:** How we moderate &amp; misc.

Sections 1 and 2 are the only ones with sub-sections, which make it very clear the types of posts or comments will get removed, and how you are expected to create posts and write comments. They are also designed to be able to be read on a single page in under 3 minutes on modern desktop resolutions.

### Comment quality

The biggest change you may notice is that we will now require answers to contain a short explanation using engineering and scientific logic. One-sentence answers are unlikely to be sufficient anymore. For assertions of fact that do not have an obvious and easy answer, we will now require a credible and relevant source.

This rule has always existed, but it was always sort of an unspoken ""legacy"" rule to allow everyone to say what they want, since the discussion would be self-regulated by real engineers. However, [I realized](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6lhxyp/did_anything_ever_come_of_tesla_releasing_their/djwn544/?context=3) that this is neither consistent nor a reliable form of moderation since someone knowledgeable on a particular topic may not be present in every thread.

Moving forward, we're slightly raising the bar for the quality of top-level comments that attempt to answer OP's questions... but in the spirit of free and open discussion, we're not going full AskHistorians draconian and requiring essay-length answers with multiple sources. I still expect everyone who is an engineer to do their part in regulating the comments by calling out wrong info and dubious opinions made by users who may not be expert enough to answer the question at hand.

---

###tl;dr The rules were revised and simplified. They're pretty much the same, but answer comments in every thread will be more strictly enforced to a higher standard.

I am modeling a thermo-mechanical heat transfer problem on Abaqus, I have posted my queries about it her before as well. This is a new one I am facing today:

**Overview of my Model:**

The model consists of two parts, a base plate and a thin metal block on top of it. I am giving a body heat flux of 15500 to the metal block on top, and I want to see the temperature variation in the block as well in the base plate. I also want to see the metal contraction/expansion during this transient thermal process. I have specified initial temperature to the entire structure as 25°C in ""Predefined Fields"". I have also mentioned a conduction condition for the interface between the base plate and the metal block. I have assigned both the parts convection as well as radiation heat transfers. The dimensions etc. are in SI units. 

**My problems are:**

1. What is the unit of this body heat flux?
2. The temperature of the base plate is not increasing. NT11 values for the base plate indicate room temperature throughout the process. Why is this so?

49,Question about joystick snapback using a spring--I've found myself with a curious puzzle that I cannot solve.,1500253465,"Hi, so my question is about how I could reassemble a joystick that I took apart, specifically how the spring adds tension to the stick so that it always snaps back to the center (neutral position). I'll provide some bg and photos, but if you'd like you can just skip to the last paragraph for the meat of the question.

The story goes that this is on my Nintendo 2DS, and the joystick (called a circle pad on 2ds/3ds) happened to get something stuck under it the other day, causing the stick to get stuck. I opened everything up using an [iFixIt guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nintendo+3DS+XL+2015+Teardown/36346) or [2](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+2DS+Joystick+Replacement/35846), and successfully removed the sticky culprit, but I've found no instructions on how to reassemble specifically the joystick part that's giving me trouble, and I'm unsure where the spring was located/how it was positioned to create this joystick snap back to center that I lack without the spring. 

The joystick is one small, contained unit/wafer that looks like [this when unscrewed from the console](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/bmxIOqhTRM35Xyuu.huge); then after pried open [the ""bottom half of the wafer"" looks like this](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/FbHfDAFCy4m6cKaD.huge)
, and [the ""top half of the wafer"" looks like this](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/eFphGUCNZuodSfUY.huge). And [here's a video](https://ifixit-guide-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/igo/video/ifixit/nfA2Li6Qxke3ItRr_MP4_592.mp4) showing the basics of how the mechanism detects the position you're holding the stick in so it can send that information to the console. 

As you can see in the [3rd photo](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/eFphGUCNZuodSfUY.huge), the spring is connected on each end like a necklace, and there is enough space in between the white wafer and the grey wafer to fit and house the spring. However I'm not 100% sure that that's where the spring was located prior to my disassembly, it just appears like the best place for it since that's where it can fit. But if you just place that spring inside the grey wafer, add the stick to the center and close the white wafer on top of it, then nothing is holding the spring in place (it just gets pushed around when you move the stick and doesn't snap back). I can't find anything that may hold the spring in place so it can create the tension I need on the joystick.

Is there a way that I'm not thinking of that I can place this spring inside this joystick unit so that it can create the snapback I need? Like some placement/configuration I haven't thought of so it can actually create tension on the stick? I've brainstormed for 2 days now, searched the internet, and I can't think of or discover how this spring was situated before I opened it up. I figured this must be a question an engineer somewhere might be familiar with. Thanks in advance for your time, and let me know if there are any details or photos I should add to help.

Also on the YouTube Channel Practical Engineering, he talks about how sand/dirt is one of the strongest and cheapest ways to support something ( he gives a few examples like elevated highway overpasses). In the book he talks about how expensive it is to make a dam due to the amount of materials needed. So why not implement this idea into creating a dam to save money? I only did some brief research but I was not able to find out all the materials listed to make the structure of the dam but the book seems to say its mainly concrete and reinforced steel. Am I go crazy or is this a feasible idea, even if you take advantage of concrete and steel still.

There’s a ton of resources online about making sophisticated water guns, but most are geared towards on-land water battles, where the water supply must be portable. I feel like being in the lake there should be a simple way for me to store energy as pressurized water to get a strong burst.

I am a senior undergraduate chemical engineering student about to graduate in December. I have an interest in biotechnology and health, mostly looking towards pharmaceuticals. 

Keeping it short, I had depression for 2 years which affected my academic career. My GPA is a 2.87, but I have a possibility of graduating with a 2.95-3.05 if a class I failed is dropped which is in review right now. In total I failed two chemical engineering courses (got B's second time) and withdrew from 2 classes. I have taken 4 graduate level courses related to pharmaceutical engineering which I received B's &amp; an A. Also as  a sophomore I worked in a pathology lab for a semester and an entire summer plus a semester in a material science &amp; engineering lab. In the MatSci lab I worked on polymeric micelle drug delivery. I have no internships.

I am in the process of learning Aspen Plus and plan to become more familiar with Star CCM+ and Matlab/Maple. I am also studying for the FE Exam.

Eventually I would like to attend graduate school, not immediately upon graduation in December. A Masters seems much more likely than a PhD although, I do have a passion for research. 


Things I have considered are working for a year or so and then applying to graduate school, I will decide part-time and online masters degrees at that time. Ideally working for a biotech/pharma company or as a research technician/associate at a university or private company. In addition, I have given thought to staying an additional semester to obtain a minor or take additional graduate level courses to demonstrate that when healthy I can perform academically.

I'm just curious if engineers are generally over-prepared for the workforce due to engineering curricula being very rigorous. In my opinion, I think that engineers are basically at least prepared, but I wouldn't think someone would be over-prepared because engineering jobs are nothing close to menial. However, I also think that someone who obtained an engineering degree from a very intense program that ends up working a relatively easier engineering job might think they were over-prepared. But this is also the opinion of someone who just finished freshman year and has no work experience... I guess what I'm really asking is, which is harder between completing an undergrad in engineering or the actual workforce? I understand the question may be silly and that responses can vary due to people having different experiences, but I just find the topic interesting.

Have anyone thought of switching to any other field. As Job security is volatile in oil gas industry, so what other options comes to your mind? What are the field available to switch with this specified background? I am an unemployed petroleum graduate planning for pursuing Masters on energy or related concern. I really love the concept of energy. Really passionate about to stay in the energy related field. Now will you please help me to pick one?

I have few things in my mind. Please share your opinion, experiences with the following points.

1) Energy Related programmes, like Energy Engineering, Energy Technology Where the efficiency and optimization would be major concern (correct me if I am wrong). Can you please tell me anything about the job scenario of energy engineer or energy technologist? What are their major role in industry? Efficiency only?

2) Energy management, Energy Economics. . It's like MBA or MA. However as long as the things are energy related so it would be okay. But this programmes require job experience which I don't have right now.

3) Sustainable Energy. It's completely renewable sector. So would I be able to cope with it with my specified petroleum engineering background?

4) As petroleum engineering is most of about computational technology, so I have extensive knowledge on computational programming languages. I am a problem solver with huge volume of Data. Digitalization is the future of oil &amp; gas and Data Science is the pioneer of this digitalization. So what about pursuing Data Science as graduate study? Data science knowledge would be useful for any kind industry. So I wouldn't have to worry about the ups &amp; downs of industries.

Moreover, please tell me the name of any middle rank university of US and Canada, who offers masters degree on above mentioned programmes. 

Then, what are the chances of a petroleum graduate will achieve a graduate funding in the energy related masters study? Have you know anyone who had petroleum major in undergraduate but switched to another major related to energy or other concern with full funding? Have anyone switched to renewable graduate study having petroleum background? I would like to get the research assistant type position so that I wouldn't have to worry about financial issues. I am comfortable with research works.

This came up as part of a discussion within our group. Both companies I've worked for have had generic, corporate wide IT departments that tried to cater to everyone.

Additionally onboarding engineers takes at least a week before people can be useful because it takes that long to get all of our tools setup, configured, and working. If we get a new employee's laptop before they show up we'll try and get the basics (Matlab, version control, Vector CANape) installed but that takes away from us doing our job.

At the very minimum having a ""Engineer's Laptop"" new machine image would save us ~40 hours per employee.

as it has an output current of 150 mA which matches the LED's forward current of 150 mA. Is this correct? Is there any other parameters I should be looking at?

You have all been a very helpful resource for all my Abaqus related troubles and I wish thank you all for your inputs!


I have another query:
I am performing a thermo-structural analysis, and there are two geometrically simple bodies in contact. I don't want one body to have any kind of deformation (i.e., it should be rigid), but at the same time, I want to assign thermal properties to it such as conductivity and specific heat.

For the first body, I have assigned ""discrete rigid"" when I created the part. But this becomes a problem when I try to assign it a section with thermal properties for it. I get an error saying:

&gt; Rigid parts cannot be assigned sections.

How can I make a rigid body while at the same time be able to give it thermal properties as mentioned above?

20,"Ok, how do I go about finding an outboard that fell off a boat into a river?",1500009968,"I hang out with a bunch of older guys that restore antique outboards from the '50s and earlier.  At one of our monthly meets this guy let his teenage grandson take his boat out on the river alone.  Unfortunately neither the guy or the grandson ensured that the transom clamps were tight or the Oh-Shit cable was attached from the motor to the boat.

It was the first and only meet that this guy has been to, and I believe that everyone has forgotten about him and his beautifully restored late-50s Evinrude.  Either a 25 or 35HP motor if I recall.  If I can find it, at most I should probably have to clean less than a year of river muck off of it and replace the rotating assembly (sometimes not even that depending on how it was running when it got sunk)

I have a rough idea of where it went down.  I know that it's about 80-100lbs of outboard with maybe 4/5ths of that being aluminum, the rest being mostly stainless steel and iron, with a small amount of other materials.  I also know that the river where this went down is 10-15 feet deep.

I'm thinking that a home-grown metal detector might work, but I'm unsure how sensitive it will be at that depth of water and with that amount of ferrous metal.  I'm also unsure if my boat (fiberglass with aluminum trim, but steel steering cables and other assorted items) will cause any interference issues.  

If I go with this, how should I design it to accommodate the amount of ferrous metal and the depth of water? What other problems should I plan on encountering? If I should go with another plan, what would you suggest?

I have access to a couple of near-ancient fish finders as well.  Old enough that they were advertised as ""transistorized"" so I'm doubtful that they will be much help, but they are generally pretty good at showing me where the bottom is and if I'm passing over a gator or a log or something.


Sidenote:  Once I find it, how do you think I should proceed to get it up?  I don't like the idea of swimming in this water as it's not spring fed so it's not that clear.  And the aforementioned gators.  I have the makings of what could potentially be a fairly decent electromagnet, but I sort of doubt it will be powerful enough for long enough for me to get it up into the boat.

Does a noise canceling headset actually reduce the sound pressure, or damage that an ear might be exposed to? Specifically I'm talking about noise canceling headsets for pilots. Over my career I'm going to be exposed to thousands of hours of sweet sweet droning propellers, turbines, and many quick moving molecules of air.

Obviously there are two strategies, passive and active noise canceling. I have an active set and it does seem to feel more comfortable and offers a feeling of immediate relief when it is switched on. So from what I have experienced I want to say yes, it does in fact reduce the pressure your ear is exposed to.

22,BSPP male into BSPT female,1499998672,"I know that you can technically put BSPT male into BSPP female and still get the threads to seal, but what about the other way?  Does the tapered female get too small at the end for you to get enough pressure on your crush washer?  Could you manage if you just ""white knuckled"" it and galled the threads making it kind of a one time use (never coming apart)?  Is the tolerance on these fittings such that you might have instances where you are able to bottom out your threads easily?  


I'm asking because I had to undo some pipe fittings where the male portion is certainly BSPP, but the female portion looks tapered.  Some of the assemblies had impossibly galled threads while some are still usable. I suspect that the female threads are tapered 1) because they look tapered, and 2) because it seems very difficult to source a 3/8"" BSPP tee.

With everything else being equal i believe that the utility's available short circuit current is affecting this.

The utility feeds our substation 161kv + or - 7%. This is fed into a 50MVA 161kv to 13.8kv transformer. This 13.8kv is then distributed to our 45 mva arc furnace transformer that goes from 13.8kv to 500-800V. 

My question is, is there a way to calculate the available short circuit current on a system with only knowing my transformers and the incoming voltage. The 161kv line jumps 2-3kv when we arc our furnace. I figure this fluctuation in the 161kv line while running would give some indication on how stable their line is.

I'm a co-op for a company that makes medical surgical parts like screws and plates that go inside you. They tasked me with figuring out how to surface finish tumble a new pin that they are going to start selling. The process they currently have is too time consuming because we're tumbling about 1000 at a time and sorting them out has been the issue. Currently the media they're using is the same diameter as the pins themselves. The pins are about a centimeter long, a millimeter in diameter, and made out of Stainless Steel. Typically the parts and media are different sizes so you can use a strainer to sift through and retrieve all the parts. 

I was thinking Centrifugal Magnetic tumbling but I'm not sure of it would work because I don't think it would give the correct surface finish.

59,[Electronics] Can a BNC terminator (50 ohm) force a signal source to produce too much current?,1499867973,"I've been playing around with oscilloscopes and signal generators, and I've been wondering what exactly happens when you plug a BNC terminator (like this: https://static.computercablestore.com/content/images/thumbs/0000067_bnc-terminator-plug-93-ohm-male_400.jpeg) into your cable.  I measured the impedance and it's actually 50 ohms in parallel with the signal you're measuring (unlike the 50 ohm impedance of the BNC cable itself, which only comes into play at high frequencies).  

My question is this, what happens when you use a terminator while you're measuring a signal that isn't designed to produce many amps.  Like a signal generator that's only meant to provide voltage.  The usual measurement devices (multimeter, oscilloscope) have an impedance of a millions ohms or more, to ensure that the device will only need to provide microAmps of current.  But when we pop in a terminator, aren't we saying ""Okay signal, now you need to give me a lot of milliAmps.""?  Say for example I'm measuring a signal coming from a relatively fragile board, like an arduino.  I think it's out ports are only rated for 40 mA pulses, or 20 mA continuous.  If I put a BNC resistor onto my probe cable while reading an output hovering around 4 v, according to my calculations that's going to ask the arduino to provide 80 mA.  In short, can a BNC terminator damage a fragile board in a situation like this, by acting as a kind of semi-short-circuit?

I also wonder about the BNC port itself.  If instead of an arduino I'm measuring a signal that goes up to 10 v.  With 50 ohms that would give us a current of 200 mA, and a power of 2 watts.  I had imagined that the terminator's load resistor is something like this: http://media.rs-online.com/t_large/R0132494-01.jpg   Which are only rated for a quarter or a third of a watt.  Does the metal casing of the resistor act as a heat-sink that enables the resistor inside the terminator to get hotter than normal?",AskEngineers,PhilippeASP,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6mu3fe/electronics_can_a_bnc_terminator_50_ohm_force_a/

64,What does it take to break a cable like this (Photos) Is it a slow break or a long break? Its used in a school. They claim it was checked a week prior. Would wear and tear show?,1499859454,"Hi there engineers, thanks for taking the time to look at my question. The title is a brief run down heres some more details.

So there was a suspended bolster swing in the school my son attends. It broke whilst he was on it, although it was apparently inspected just a week prior to the accident. 

[This is the swing](http://imgur.com/vr5hhF0) the product page for it is http://www.southpaw.co.uk/southpaw-bolster-swing-78-p.asp.

Now to me cables are pretty damn strong. and as it was inspected just a week before i am unsure if its even possible for it fail so much so quickly. *(its a closed environment so only supervised access)*.

[here's how it looks at the end that didn't break](http://imgur.com/zFPwqYE)

[And the end that did](http://imgur.com/XabKoO0)

The children that access the equipment are aged between 5 and 16. My child was at the lower end of the scale at 8. He isn't anywhere near the weight limit, And was using the equipment alone whilst being supervised. He wasn't misusing the equipment.

Is it really possible for a cable to go from ok 1 week, to failing the next? (Official inspection)
The cable seemed to have 7 braids in it. Maybe it was 8. BUt it crtainly wasn't anymore than that.

70,How to go about mounting a little thumbstick,1499843141,"This is mostly a parts design problem for an at home project. I'm designing a split, tented, keyboard and want to put a thumbstick on either side. I bought what I figure are the more industrial grade thumbsticks from mouser (ALPS RKJXV series) as opposed to the un branded (but probably still alps) things off of sparkfun or adafruit. The problem is that I don't actually have a way to mount it.

I will be hand wiring the keyboard so I don't have a pre designed pcb though with this in mind I might want to get one that could mount this thing anyway. [The switch in question is this one.](http://www.alps.com/prod/info/E/HTML/MultiControl/Potentiometer/RKJXK/RKJXV1224005.html) The footprint is smaller than the sparkfun and adafruit switches and is actually almost the same size as the cherry clone switches I'm using for the rest of the board. So custom mounting it is.

How would you mount this? The potentiometer contacts are the longest pins followed by the mounting legs and the push button switch pins are the shortest. There is no shoulder like the cherry switches where it could snap into place in an appropriately sized hole. It seems to be designed to be on a pcb or molded plastic housing but I can't find anything commercially available.

My first thought was planetary gear motors to get that precision of movement but I've tried turning them by hand in the past and there's a lot of resistance and you risk damaging the gears. I doubt it's a stepper as that'd be too jerky unless it was geared down but then you have the same problem

First, I understand the FCC regulations regarding this topic. I do not reside in the USA and this isn't going to be used in USA territory. I have been looking into this for a little while now and have found a few options. I will be in the US in the coming month. However due to FCC regulations retailers have been a bit reluctant or a bit vague in the help they provide. I contacted Wilson electronics explaining the following :

&gt; I want to set up a cellphone signal booster in a remote area/ranch. The carrier I have is T-Mobile. The ranch I have is in the valley/base of the nearby hill. currently the only way I can get signal is if I take a quad ride to the top on the hill. The unobstructed line of sight from the location at the top of the hill where I can receive signal to the ranch is about .8 miles. the hill is within my property and there would be no issue setting up a little relay weatherproof shed to power the cellphone booster. What package would you suggest to me for this issue? i see your boosters come with an internal and external antenna, I assume I would need something that comes with two external antennas. any help would be appreciated

I received a response that FCC regulation prevents their boosters from using 2 external antennas in rebroadcast manner.  i was looking into their Connect 4g-x with 2 outdoor antennas.
I received the following response:

&gt;Thanks for reaching out to us! Unfortunately it is against FCC regulations to use two external antennas and rebroadcast. That kind of run would not work with our boosters you could maybe do a 100-200 run possibly at the most but you would be getting LMR 600 and LMR 900 cabling and that run very expensive along with our most expensive booster, but you would have no coverage area in your home you would be right next to the internal antenna. Unfortunately our boosters will not work in that given situation. 
If you have any other questions or concerns please let us know! Thanks so much.

I suppose the question i have is am i in the right track?
I also saw the big boost system stelladoradus has and it seems it is what i need. However, i thought i'd save in shipping considering i will be in the USA soon. are there any off the shelves things i can get to make this system work or will a booster with two directional yogi antennas work as long as they are not interfering with each other?

80,Easiest way to run an AC Servomotor?,1499805189,"I have a robot arm with a small collection of AC servos.  All I have is the arm - nothing in terms of external controllers or a way to plug it into a wall.  I was hoping for DC motors, since I find those pretty easy to work with; but I've never dealt with AC motors before.  Worst case I can spec out each motor and swap out for rough DC equivalents, I'd just rather avoid all the mounting hassles that would entail.

I'd like to avoid anything that would require rewiring my house (standard U.S. 120V 15A circuits), but beyond that as long as it moves it's good enough, full speed would be cool but really unnecessary - it's basically just a toy that won't ever be used in an industrial setting again.  I don't need a specific shopping list, I'm just not sure where to even start - any quirks with running it on lower voltages, minimum power, rough idea on how to control it, etc.

81,I'm planning to arrange a one-on-one meeting with my boss. What discussion points would be off-limits?,1499803165,"I'm working my first full-time job ever, and I've been at this company for about a month. I am an electrical engineer at a very small consulting firm (probably around 20 people in the office). There is one senior electrical engineer I go to if I have questions, and usually he is the person who distributes tasks to me. As a result, I have had pretty little interaction with my boss. It's not like he has absolutely no clue what I've been up to - I had to ask him a couple questions along the way concerning the assignments I was given, and I also think the senior EE guy keeps my boss updated. I don't want this to become a trend though and I'd like to keep an open line of communication with him, which is why I am scheduling this meeting.

My main concern is that I am feeling confused as to how much progress I'm actually making. I've touched on 5 different projects without learning any single one in depth. For example, in my third week, I was tasked with designing a lighting plan for a small building within one of the sites, and after I submitted, I never had to go back to that project. I never learned the full scope of the project or the design/submittal process of the project as a whole. Then I was given a small assignment on conduit schedules for a different site, then I was told to recreate a one line diagram for another site using a software that we don't even have a full license for so I wasn't actually able to complete the diagram, etc. You get the picture. I also have a lot of slow days where I just study documents without actually contributing or ""working on"" anything. I feel like I've learned a lot about industry, and at the same time, feel like I've accomplished nothing.

Part of me thinks people are babying me and intentionally not giving me assignments that are involved or complicated, maybe because I seem to already have a reputation as someone who is timid and shy and therefore not capable, or maybe because the work dynamic is a bit odd and I'm young enough to be most people's daughter. 

I'm not quite sure how to approach my boss. I mainly want to update him on what I've been doing, just ""for his information"" and so he doesn't think I'm a slacker. I'd like to ask him for some general input or feedback or if he thinks I'm on the right track, but I don't want to give the impression that A) I'm very uncertain and lacking confidence in myself or B) I'm complaining about the work.

86,Non-engineer seeking help creating device with laser tripwire,1499788288,"The gist of what I’m seeking help with: I need to build a compact, portable, battery-powered device that sounds a brief tone if a laser tripwire (5' end-to-end range) is crossed. I have no idea where to start.

&amp;nbsp; 

**What is this for?**

I train dogs for dog agility. Jumps are a very important part of competition (every course has 8-12 jumps). Jump bars are displaceable and can be knocked down easily. Knocking down bars is a serious problem, though – knocking down even one bar during a competition is a disqualifying fault.

One of my dogs is running fast, he’ll often mis-judge and clip bars. This sometimes causes them to fall down. For most dogs that do this, you can hear them “tick” the bar and adjust your training accordingly. [The challenge with my dog is that he has fluffy feet](http://i.imgur.com/MBPnWaT.jpg), which means I often can’t hear him tick the bars. The foot fluff has made it much harder to teach him that he needs to clear the jump entirely without scraping over the top. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What am I trying to create?**

I’m trying to create a sensor with a laser tripwire, that I can attach to a jump bar for use in training. I’d like to set it up so that if the tripwire is broken, a short tone plays. Basically an alert system to mark the exact moment the dog ticks the bar – I’m not trying to punish him with a loud noise, but just create a system where it’s easier for me to identify and reward when he puts in a good effort and clears the bar with some space to spare.  

&amp;nbsp;


**Background information on materials I'm building around**


[Here is a dog agility jump](http://i.imgur.com/mSrOys4.jpg). It has attached plastic jump cups on the side at 2” intervals. Jump bars are 5’ long and rest in the cups. 

&amp;nbsp;


**My idea so far...**

[My imaginary invention looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/6G42Gpz.jpg) (dotted line is the tripwire line). At this point I'm imagining sensors attached to the bar rather than the jump upright, so the jump can still be adjusted to different jump heights. I’m thinking perhaps a battery pack that sits on the ground next to the jump, with wires wrapping around the jump upright and plugging into a tripwire attached to either end of the jump bar. I don’t care where the tone comes from as long as it is physically on the unit somewhere. I don't care if the device can be transferred across bars - permanent installation on a bar is okay as long as the bar can still fall down if my dog crashes into it.

In a perfect world I would also be able to pick the noise that is made for the tone. But really as long as it's a short, medium/low volume noise I can probably make it work.

I have no idea where to start. I have no engineering background. I need suggestions for basic reading, ideas for potential materials, existing types of products I might be able to buy and modify. Even suggestions for where else I might post this would be helpful! ",AskEngineers,manatee1010,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6mn33d/nonengineer_seeking_help_creating_device_with/
87,What qualifies as a hands-on engineering project?,1499786380,A lot of companies want to know about your hands-on project experience prior to getting hired.  What qualifies as a hands-on project?

88,How often is it recommended to change jobs ?,1499784560,"I have been at my place for the past 1.5 years now and for the past 6 months now feel like I'm stagnating. I work as a production engineer at a food plant and my day involves trouble shooting , process improvements, etc. For me after I've learned the process , and what to do when thing A breaks down has been the most rewarding part. However lately it's becoming a drag and very cookie cutter solutions: If this happens then you do this, if that happens then you do that. Nothing new, nothing is sparking up. I know a lot of people in this company that have been here for 20+ years and went from operator to supervisor so that's great but the engineer life span here is less than 3 years.  I'm about half way through that. I'm thinking about switching jobs so I can both develop my skills as an engineer and keep work more interesting. Is 1.5 years too little time ?

93,"To those who had thermodynamics classes, how hard was it?",1499771656,"Hello everyone, I'm in my first year of civil engineering and, as I'm almost done with my semester, I had a bit of a struggle trying to raise my final mark in the class in question, but sadly it was all hopeless.

My question to you all is how hard thermodynamics was for you in college. At first glance it looked really easy, I considered physics to be my turf and the content itself seemed pretty straightforward, looking back at it, it's still pretty easy to understand, but on 3/4 evaluation days I'd just screw up all over the test sheet because of some little detail I overlooked on the question.

94,UK engineers - Do you feel financially undervalued?,1499767290,"A question for my UK brethren; do you feel undervalued in terms of your base pay? Most specifically that which you received on first starting work? 

The question arises as I have been comparing starting salaries between the UK and US average. Now when we're talking about a country as large and complex as the US it's difficult to nail anything down for certain but as a back of the fag packet comparison it should do and I'll use an average Mech Eng grad's starting salary to try and keep it as even as possible. 

So, in the Red corner we have the UK with an average starting salary of £25,000 (Target Jobs, 2017) which is  approximately  $32,300 (xe.com) whereas in the Blue Corner we have the US with starting pay for the same at $64,100 (Payscale, 2016) or £49,620. In a general sense the cost of living is cheaper across the US compared to the UK and that $64,100 has 19.32% greater purchasing power (numbeo.com, 2017) and you start to see that engineers in the UK are really paid a pittance compared to our transatlantic counterparts. 

So my question again; do you feel like all your effort at uni (and later) is valued when you see those stark differences and what do you think can be done to redress the balance? 

Also remember that our US counterparts generally leave uni with a BS (and...this is going to be unpopular, sorry Amerifriends) that going by the rules of the Bologne agreement and the Davidson report is only valued at FdENG or Ordinary degree level and that many UK grads are leaving with an MEng these days (though I don't have solid numbers on that but would appreciate some) and if not the standard British Honours degree is valued, by the same report (when taking into account credits, cintact hours and subject speciality), as equivalent to a US MS. 

To sum up; money isn't everything but when you see this it does make me at least wonder why I bothered in the first place.",AskEngineers,blastvader,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6ml8wk/uk_engineers_do_you_feel_financially_undervalued/

96,Finding Time for Clubs?,1499762296,"Hello engineers! I'm starting my Sophomore year of my Aerospace Engineering degree in a month. I want to get more involved this upcoming semester, but I'm not sure I'll have time for engineering clubs and competitions.

I have a full class schedule, and I work everyday except Monday and Wednesday from 5-9pm. I can't really cut my hours, I have to pay all my bills except rent and I have to move out of my parents next summer and I'm saving for that. I also live about 45 minutes from campus with Rush hour traffic, 20 without.

Does anyone have any advice or a similar experience? I'm not sure I have the ability to meet when a club wants to meet since my schedule is so tight and I don't have even weekend afternoons.

EDIT: Also kinda related. I'd like to get a head start over summers as well. Is the summer after sophomore year a bit too early to look at internships? In the event I can't get a club to work I want to get experience some other way. As long as it's a paid internship, I have no problem asking my current boss for the summer off. Any advice on this? Or is it simply too early? ",AskEngineers,jfizzle232,/r/AskEngineers/comments/6mky3o/finding_time_for_clubs/
97,Help with Simulia Abaqus,1499761727,"Hi, I'm trying to simulate the heating (along with coefficient of thermal expansion) of a metal plate kept on top of another metal box (Let's call it ""Base Plate""). 

What kind of Boundary Condition should I specify between the base plate and metal plate, such that the metal plate also rises as the box gets heated and expands?

As of now, I am using ""Encastre"" for the lower surface of the metal plate. This is causing the box to expand around the plate as the bottom surface coordinates of the plate are fixed. I am not getting a satisfactory result so far. Please help!

98,Credible Online Heat Transfer Course?,1499755097,"Hey guys,

In a bit of a pickle at the moment. Im set to graduate with a mechanical engineering degree in December,  but by the misfortune of a rough start to last semester, i received a D in heat transfer, which is a spring semester only course. 

I reached out to my advisor and professor about the matter and they said that the best (only) thing i can do is try to get the credits elsewhere, be it online or taking it at another institution in the fall. Being that i go to school in Montana, and that the closest school with that program is an hour and a half away, I am hesitant to make the drive three days a week. 

Enrollment services really wasn't much help as far as finding a suitable place to acquire these credits, so i was wondering if any of you guys know a place that offers Heat Transfer online. 

Any help would be much appreciated. I figured reaching out to a diverse pool of graduates may offer insight to what is out there. I really don't want to go back to school in the spring for three damn credits. 

Also posted this to r/engineering. Sorry if this came up in your feed twice.
