0,Advice on moving on from my first position,1431317393,"Hi AskEngis,

My SO and I will be moving to across the country in August, but I'm yet to tell my current employer.

How much time is enough? I've been job hunting in the new area already and have a list of jobs I want to send my materials to, but I'm unsure if I should wait to contact them until after I've given notice (so as to allow potential new employers to contact my current boss/work references).

At this point, it would be close 2 months notice if I told them this week. This seems like more than enough, but Im concerned about being let go early.

What are your thoughts on this engineers? Also, what advice do y'all have for a young engineer leaving his first position? Im close with my boss, do I just tell him in person or should I draft up a professional letter and send it in to HR? 

Thanks for any and all advice. Ive never done anything like this before and obviously cant talk to anyone at my company about it.",AskEngineers,spicy_tofu,/r/AskEngineers/comments/35k8xg/advice_on_moving_on_from_my_first_position/

4,Taking a pay cut to move to a more desirable location. Opinions?,1431296353,"I asked this in another section but I'd also like to hear the opinions of other engineers, who may have been in a similar situation. I am an electrical engineer, the new position would be an aerospace engineering related position:


I graduated college a year ago and accepted a high paying job in another state. Now I want to move back home but land a job before I go. I may have a job lined up but no offer yet (2 phone interviews and took a flight for a face to face interview). I didn't discuss salary but they gave me a ballpark number and that is less than I am making. Currently making ~$65k, new job ~$55k


Currently living in a northern state with a lower cost of living. This job if I get it is located in west palm beach, fl and I would much more enjoy living there, since it is closer to home but far enough for me to be on my own.

The thing is, Florida does not collect a state income tax from your salary but rent, and insurance and everything costs more over there. Here are my questions:


1. How much should I be paid for comparable living?


2. If there are unwilling to pay me as much as I want, should I settle for a lower salary, because I would be happier living there?


3. How do I negotiate a salary anyways?
For my current job, I just accepted what they offered me since it was my first job out of college and I just wanted to get my foot in the door, since I did not have any internship experience.


4. If I do get a job offer I like, how many weeks notice should I give my current boss?

I don't think 2 weeks is enough because this is a professional job. Also, it will take me time to research and look for a place to rent and move everything to a new state.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/35j86p/taking_a_pay_cut_to_move_to_a_more_desirable/

6,Anyone ever experienced job burnout? How did you deal with it?,1431291592,"If you couldn't guess, I'm dealing with a severe case of burnout. A good portion of it comes from the fact that since I work as a process engineer at a factory that runs 24/7, my job truly never ends at home. Almost nightly I get phone calls asking questions. Most of the time they are before I go to bed, but sometimes they do happen in the middle of the night. During the weekend I sit an worry if they are moving parts down the line like I asked or if Monday I'm going to come in and be behind another two days to our customer's milestones. Most of the time this leads to me going into work on Saturdays as well just to make sure. It's one of those jobs where even when you're salary and getting paid for 40 hours, you're expected to ""go above and beyond"", which equates to working way more hours. Most of the senior engineers put in 60 hours every week. For some reason if you arrive on time and leave on time at the end of the day, you look bad. Nope, much better to come in an hour early to stay an hour late every day. Even work through a few lunch breaks. I absolutely cannot work for a company where this is not only the norm, but *encouraged and expected*. My motivation has been completely shot. I'm most likely going to get a bad review this quarter, after years of high positives and exceptional performance reviews. I walk in the door every morning wishing I could just turn right back around. Problem is, I'm the sole income for my family since my wife is a stay-at-home mom for our autistic daughter. The spiral of depression is staggering. I've been talking with a therapist for about six months, but it's not working 100% like I thought it would.

The job is toxic. I need to get away from it. I know that I need to get away from it. I've been applying everywhere I can, but the job market isn't all that great where I live. I've been thinking lately about going back to school for a different career or moving to a different state entirely. One thing is for sure, I will NEVER work in manufacturing again. My wife is on board, which is good. If I did quit outright and take out loans to go back to school, luckily most of our bills are pretty low. Both cars paid off and we rent a house that is pretty cheap, student loans are the only thing I still owe.

20,Could a bluetooth connection between drones be used to make them act like a swarm?,1431213543,"I was wondering if this would be possible, to use a blue-tooth connection, and naturally extend the flight controller processors to account for other drones around them? I'm much more interested in the algorithms required to this, if bluetooth connection is the wrong way to go about it, any suggestions? I'm not an engineer I'm a programmer, I am not very good with hardware.

I figure the basic high level idea would be that each drone follows the average (acceleration?) vector of the entire system, i.e. for the entire swarm, while also maintaining a distance from other drones around them, then if they just also followed the rest of the flight controller's logic, yaw, pitch, roll etc you would effectively have all the rules required to communicate with a group of drones as a swarm. I feel like that would be so very valuable in the future? Imagine a swarm of drones entering a house from every window and door, going to each room of the house, and then internally spreading chemicals to put out the flames.

 You could effectively control many of them at once like that. So instead of giving commands to each drone uniquely, you are essentially creating an interface for communicating with them as a swarm. Also, if you could give them commands to split into separate swarms following this same logic, but only their specific group's sum vector, you could control 2-3 swarms at once. You could even build upon that to control large forces of hundreds of swarms working in tandem. To me it seems like quite a beautiful solution to controlling a swarm.

friction = sqrt(longitudinal friction force^2 + lateral friction force ^2) / vertical load.

The enclosure is made out of acrylic and cut using a laser cutter. I initially made 3 holes on the button to pass the buttons, such that then the button are pressed it directly connected to my PCB.
After testing this out, 3 buttons made the cube uneven (which can be seen in one of the images), which lead me back to the drawing board, and since I am here, I want to add a battery option for the device, and the current design didn't allow for it.
I decided to sketch out what a possible solution might look like (image available). If i had a base, I could bury the battery and any switches in the base and not have any disturbance in the light flow, as this would happen if i mount the battery top PCB side as the LED i am using has a 120 degree angle. My problem with this design is how to I make it such that the base and the cube stay attached. Please take a look at the images I've attach. One is the current flawed design, a drawing of the a possible solution, and a rough demo of what it may look like using cardboard. I am having trouble figuring out how to keep the two parts attached but still allow for push button movement, Please I will probably have access to a laser cutter and basic tools. Please take a look at the animated image as well. If you have any ideas I would greatly appreciate it. If you do not time or dont know, I still appreciate the time you've taken in reading this, thanks again

43,Petroleum Engineering from my point of view,1431129679,"It's my first post on reddit so I'd like to say hello to everyone. English is not my native language so I'll try to write a proper and understandable text. Sorry for eventual mistakes.
I'd like to dispute about Petroleum Engineering which is a major I am currently studying in Poland at AGH University of Technology in Cracow. Have you ever heard about it or maybe in you work or at your universities you had an opportunity to meet people from it? I am really curious about it. If you did please write your opinion about it. Actually translating from polish it would be 'Mining and geology' but it's mostly about Petroleum Engineering and it's easier for me to use this term because it's much more precise. For many, many years my faculty of Drilling, Oil and Gas has been offering this one major and a couple years ago started to offer another one- Oil and Gas Engineering which at bachelor's level is pretty much the same as my major. The difference is between MD. 
After this time I realised it was quite a good choice for me to study this major but of course there are some disadvantages as well. First of all I am worried about my future. I mean I like what I do at univeristy, not everything but most of it but I don't really get any chances to see how everything works in reality. I tried to apply for an internship in companies like Schlumberger or Statoil but there was no point doing that. I even tried in some small firms in Poland but still couldn't find anything for me. My peers who have got some kind of apprenticeship or internship generally have some kind of relations with people working in this trade or relatives who do the same. And as one knows it's really important thing to learn some practical stuff and be prepared in order to get a job. Knowledge I apprehended at university I guess isn't sufficient enough to let me feel comfortable while I am not getting any apprenticeship. 
I feel like I can do some things to make my CV more appealing to employers. I am thinking about writing an arcticle for a Young Petro magazine connected to the topics like fuels and energy, drilling engineering or geology, geophysics. As I said my current knowledge is not good but I assume it's all about finding a good topic to write about, focus on it and spend some time with some scientific books and do some research. What do you think of it?
Second thing is going abroad for an exchange with other university. Lectures in english, different environment and foreign country to live in should help me develop myself. Do you know any universities with PE who would possibly like to consider my application? I know english at some level (for you to judge) and some spanish as well but my GPA is rather weak (I've got about 3.3 on 2-5 scale). Apart from that I don't have any relevant work experience just some usual jobs during holidays and unfortunately no language certificate.
I know if now I don't do anything which takes me closer to the Oil and Gas industry then it'd really hard for my to get any job after graduation from univeristy. So if you have any advice for me what to do, what to focus on or how do you see this feel free to write your opinion.

I’m looking to build a custom cold drip coffee machine that works by slowly dripping water over a chamber of ground coffee over a period of 5-12 hours and then through a filter and into a receptacle below. You can see how one of these works here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FufVh6Zyu04

The problem I have with domestic-grade cold drip coffee machines is that they have very fiddly drip valves that make it hard to measure or set the flow rate required for a precise extraction of the coffee. What I’m looking to do with my custom machine is to use a drip valve that is much more accurate and can in some way provide measurements of the flow rate.

Take a stamped piece of sheet metal or stock, in a thin rectangle (maybe an inch and a half long by half an inch wide, for illustration purposes).
Make two circular holes near either end.
Bend the piece in the middle into a V shape, like a 45 degree angle.
Ta-da

Now you can put a rod through the two holes, and in order to move the piece up and down you have to squeeze the two free ends, because when you let go the spring makes it bite into the rod. It's like a nut that can be moved extremely fast and set instantly, and resists minimal force.

So, I need to make a corner angle elbow (https://cdn3.volusion.com/syjmz.yldty/v/vspfiles/photos/E203-2.jpg?1340031592) for a cube, and i'm not sure how to do the notching. I've used computer programs to print out guides for doing simple one-tube-on-one-tube notching, but this is uneven and complicated. I can think of three different ways to notch combine the tubes, but I just don't know how to do the math.

The first way is to cut two tubes diagonally, rotate one of the tubes to get a 90-degree angle, and notch a third tube to connect to the side of this 90 degree angle. The second way is to notch one tube to fit onto a second and make a 90-degree angle, and then notch another tube to fit onto the side of this 90-degree angle. The third way (like the picture above) I imagine would be notching three tubes exactly the same and fitting them together into the 3-way angle.

27,All the fuss about power strips and overloading,1430840218,"Hi there,

in recent days I've heard a lot about overloading electrical circuits through the use of power strips. I'm an electrical engineer myself and really don't understand all the panicking authorities make and even more how people manage to start a fire using power strips.

So here's what I think: Each circuit breaker in the main breaker box connects to a group of outlets, lamps etc. If all the wiring is done properly, we have for example a 15 A circuit breaker and wires running through the house that can handle 15 A.

So, that said, I am allowed to draw as much as 15 A (or 80% of it according to NEC) from all the outlets/lamps combined, right? I can hook up 15 A to one outlet and 0 to all others or distribute the load. As soon as the sum of all loads exceeds the rating, the breaker trips and nothing happens.

So, assuming I buy a shitload of extension cords and power strips THAT ARE ALL RATED FOR 15 A - I can connect them in whatever funny way I like, hook up loads to them, daisy-chain 5 power strips and connect 20 cellphone chargers - as long as the total load is under 15 A nothing will happen. Once the sum of all loads exceeds 15 A, breaker trips.

So the only explanation I can come up with is that people use cheap power strips with a rating less than that of the breaker but still using loads that come close to the rating of the breaker with the cheap strips.

So in a nutshell: As long as from breaker to power strips all electrical equipment has the same rating there should be no way to start a fire at all, right? I'm excluding issues like loose contacts and improper grounding here, since that shouldn't happen with good power strips and can also happen with bad wiring/outlets.

So what's all the fuss about using power strips? In the end it all boils down to the question how much load you put on the electrical wire that runs from the breaker.

I don't even get why power strips should have their own breaker. Again, if everything is rated for the same current, the main breaker should be enough to protect any overload condition anywhere in the circuit since all current needs to go through it.",AskEngineers,suffix90,/r/AskEngineers/comments/34y8no/all_the_fuss_about_power_strips_and_overloading/

2. The solution Im working towards is to make sure that there always is a gap between the parts. I have all the tolarnces worked out except for between the rolling elements. The rolling elements have a diameter on 3 mm, so the gap between 2 rolling elements can be 0&lt;gap&lt;3, because if the gap is greater then 3 mm a new element will be added. Is there a recommended gap I should have and why? Is it better to have a large gap or small? I have taken into account every deformation of the rolling elements.

3. Because this bearing is custom made, the life rating calculation that exist can´t be used because that require numbers from diffrent manufacturing catalogues. Do you know any other way to do it?

Current top comment by starstarstar4: 

&gt;The damage would be staggering.
&gt;
&gt;New York City (I'm guessing you mean the city, not the entire state), last experienced a big earthquake, and it was only 5.5 mind you, back in the 1800's . This was long before there were tall buildings within it. New York is not in a area prone to earthquakes bigger than that, but never say never.
&gt;
&gt;What would suffer the most would be old ""Brownstone"" constructions made of brick. They are strong against pressures pushing ""down"" on them (the weight of the floors above them) but very, very bad against lateral (sideways) movements. Imagine a stack of Jenga blocks. Push down from above, and they are pretty strong. Push the tower from the side though and....crash.
&gt;
&gt;Modern skyscrapers built with steel are better at resisting earthquakes, but the building code requirements in NYC do not require new buildings to withstand earthquakes the way a skyscraper in say San Francisco or Tokyo do. A level 8 earthquake like the one that hit Nepal would probably flatten most of the city, with loss of lives in the hundreds of thousands or possibly even millions if it hit in the middle of the day during a weekday, when the city is most populated with people working there.
&gt;
&gt;It would be bad, let's just say that.

I've been skateboarding to work, between schools, and back home for about five years now. While I enjoy the exercise, I've been tossing around and idea in my head for a device to help me travel faster uphill and on flat ground. A ""skitching"" device, with a nice safety feature.

Here's my best description the device: 
-It might take the shape of a gun. 
-Inside is a spool of hollow wire that is pressure loaded (co2 or a strong spring)
The end of the wire would have a suction cup.

Pretty simple basic idea here I think, and it works just like you have already imagined.
The safety feature:
Obviously this whole idea could be dangerous since once you've attached to a vehicle driving by, how are you supposed to stop or slow down without dropping the device (which is probably the last thing one would want to do with such a rare thing)?
The hollow wire I mentioned previously would have a smaller normal wire inside that runs from just inside the suction cup to a switch on the side of the device connected to the inside of the wire, called the Safety. When the Safety is pressed the inside wire slides up through the hollow wire and presses against the vehicle, releasing the suction. The suction releases and the wire reels in.

71,How does copyright law apply to an original document I create at work that may have marketable value?,1430625876,"The company I work for recently asked me to create a training guide for engineers new to my field.

When finished, the document will be 200+ pages and provide the reader with a unique interpretation of information that is currently unavailable in any single written document.  I believe the document could be used to start a training course that many of our clients and competitors would be interested in.


My questions:

* If I create the document at work, who owns it?  What if I create it at work after business hours and on the weekend?

* Would I be able to break away from my company in the future and establish a training course of my own using the document I created?  

* Would I have any claim on profits generated if my company uses this document to sell a training course?  Or sold it as a training manual?


I’m prepared to write this document on my own time if that’s what I need to do in order to maintain ownership of it.  I used to do some teaching and the idea of starting a consulting company to train other engineers in what I do is an option I’d like to keep open.

Thanks to Inigo93 for the quick response and laying it out clearly.  Looks like I have no option other than to do this at home if I want to maintain the copyright.

New round of questions:

* Does getting a copyright from copyright.gov ensure that I am the only one that would be allowed to establish a training course based on the document?

* After completion, I intend to give the document to my employer for them to train new engineers.  Some engineers at the company may be able to provide me with helpful edits after I complete my first draft.  Does using someone’s editorial comments in a revised version of the document damage the integrity of my copyright? 

I have no idea what I’m doing with regard to copyright and allowing use of a copyrighted document.  Any direction/advice is appreciated.

80,Help with single/swivel wheel trailer; trailer wheel oscillates out of control,1430586453,"We have a Prius and my wife is handicapped and in a wheelchair. She had a high end motorized wheelchair that we cannot transport inside the car. So I have built a single/swivel wheel trailer to carry the motorized wheelchair. 

There are a couple production companies (swivelwheel.com is the biggest) that build similar trailers and a couple of people have built their own. So I decided to try and replicate the designs to fit out needs. 

The problem is that, at times, the wheel tends to oscillate out of control (like a shopping cart wheel). The current design allows for a small amount of vertical movement (the whole trailer will tilt 3-4 inches) on the sides due to the natural clearance within the hitch. With this design the wheel is stable until a sharp corner or a larger bump. Then the wheel oscillates uncontrollably and the only way to stop it is to come to a complete stop and start again. 

If I remove the vertical movement is removed, which I feel should fix the problem of going around corners and bumps because the load remains stable. The wheel starts oscillating immediately once the car reaches about 5 MPH.

I've redesigned and rebuilt it a few times, trying to figure out the problem. The only things that have made a big difference is the front of the trailer being lower than the back, and the angle of the swing arm being smaller, so the trailer is closer to the tire. I've had a small suspension spring/shock which didn't seem to make a difference.  

I've used bags of sand to simulate the weight of the wheelchair (250 lbs) and this only makes oscillating start quicker and be more pronounced. 

I've double checked to make sure everything is square, level, and tight.  What else am I missing?

tl/dr; Homemade swivel wheel trailer swivels too much!

I updated to include more pics, as well as the designs I used as inspiration.

As a present for my parents who enter a silver marriage I want to add some flavor to their outside pond. I want to create something that is similar [what is shown in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06GfYEAbiuw) It's upside down aquarium that allows fish from the pond to swim above the pond. This allows people to better see the fish that live in a pond. 

I prefer having a glass aquarium instead of an Plexiglas (modified non-yellowing acrylic), since acrylic tends to scratch very quickly. But if anyone would recommend Plexiglas instead then I would like to know why, but that is off-topic of course. 

My question is regarding the thickness of the required glass. There are many calculators online that estimate the required thickness of normal aquariums, but obviously upside down aquariums work differently. In order to get the water inside an upside down aquarium you need to suck the air out of the aquarium. The water then gets pulled into the aquarium by pressure difference. You guys know it better than I do. I could take a very thick glass to be sure, but the thicker the glass the more the light will refract. One disadvantage of glass is that the fish tend to be more disproportionate the thicker the glass is. How thick does the glass have to be to not shatter?

**The problem:**


Rough size of the upside down aquarium in cm: 30x100x70cm with 70 cm being the height (roughly 12'' by 39'' by 28''). If my calculations are correct then this will contain roughly 210 liters of water. In order get the water inside the aquarium we need to decrease the pressure by sucking out the air with the help of a vacuum pomp. This will strain or potentially break the glass right? If the aquarium is filled with water then I assume the pressure is higher than normal.

&amp;nbsp;

The thing is, the industry sector around here is going through a recession, so the job hunt for engineers is not favorable and really competitive, at the point that even experienced professionals are competing for entry level positions (just last month, a big technology company in my area fired around 100 people and shut down one of its development departments). 

&amp;nbsp;

My strategy for the moment was to enroll in a M.Sc-like degree here at my university, wait for things to settle down and keep applying for jobs (I've been doing that since November, sent some 100+ CVs, got one interview and no offers). The problem is that I don't think that an academic degree will help me get a job, I feel that I'm wasting my time. I was not a good student, and following the academic path is not something I'd like to do.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm trying to come up with ways to stay relevant in the market, but I'm pretty clueless, really. From what I could gather, my main problems were the lack of emotional intelligence and of experiences abroad. I've been looking into professional master's degrees, and found some interesting and affordable programs in Canada. Spending some time in another country is something that I'd like to do, regardless of career, and these programs seem to fit nicely in all aspects.

Im an intern for a very small power electronics company. We design and build power inverters (on the scale of 500KW-1.5MW). We've been looking to implement a PLM tool to organize and manage all of our design data. Ive been lurking for a bit and noticed many aren't too fond of PTC Winchill, but we need something that can integrate well with ProEngineer and Altium.  Our main hope is to find a Cloud based PLM or something of the SaaS (software as a service) type with solid integration for ProE and Altium, so we wont need to go through the costly process of setting up servers and hiring someone to manage it. 

The cloud PLM systems we have been considering are: PTC PLM Cloud, Arena PLM, and Autodesk PLM 360. 

I would say that PTC PLM cloud would be the clear front runner due to the sure integration with ProE, but Im having second thoughts when hearing of what a pain PTC windchill can be. Especially when we don't have a dedicated PLM manager. 

Arena PLM seems to integrate with Altium, but we worry about ProE. 

Does anyone have any experience using or implementing Cloud based PLM?

6,Sensors generally used on automotive and industrial machinery,1430492012,"I'm currently working on a final year project on the use of data mining for fault diagnosis. I'm using test cell data, so obviously there's a huge quantity of data available, however I'd like to also do some analysis which is more applicable to current real world engines. 

A quick google provided this list from wikipedia:


    Air–fuel ratio meter
    Crankshaft position sensor
    Engine coolant temperature sensor
    Hall effect sensor, used to time the speed of wheels and shafts
    MAP sensor, Manifold Absolute Pressure
    Mass flow sensor, or mass airflow (MAF) sensor
    Oxygen sensor, used to monitor the amount of oxygen in the exhaust
    Speedometer, used measure the instantaneous speed of a land vehicle
    Speed sensor, used to detect the speed of an object
    Throttle position sensor, used to monitor the position of the throttle in an internal combustion engine
    Tire-pressure monitoring sensor, used to monitor the air pressure inside the tires
    Torque sensor, or torque transducer or torquemeter measures torque (twisting force) on a rotating system.
    Transmission fluid temperature sensor, used to measure the temperature of the transmission fluid
    Turbine speed sensor (TSS), or input speed sensor (ISS), used to measure the rotational speed of the input shaft or torque converter
    Variable reluctance sensor, used to measure position and speed of moving metal components
    Vehicle speed sensor (VSS), used to measure the speed of the vehicle
    Water sensor or water-in-fuel sensor, used to indicate the presence of water in fuel
    Wheel speed sensor, used for reading the speed of a vehicle's wheel rotation

I think there may be a couple omissions, for example:

    Fuel rate
    Fuel rail pressure
    Intake temperature
    Exhaust manifold pressure (particularly on turbos)
    Exhaust temperature
    Atmospheric pressure
    NOX (is this used for SCR or is the oxygen sensor used?)
    EGR position
    EGR pressure (intake and/or exhaust side)
    Fuel temperature?

7,A 12VAC motor and a 12VDC supply.,1430488392,"Hello. I'm trying to power a 12VAC (5w, 4.2VA) water pump using a 12V battery and control it using an audrino and relay. I like to learn from experience by testing things for myself, but I don't want to damage or destroy any of my batteries or equipment.

I have a couple of ideas, and I'd really appreciate it if someone could let me know what they think.  
First idea, I could use a DPDT relay, have the 12V battery's positive connected to Pole 1's terminal, negative on Pole 2's terminal, and have the output positive/negative feed on the Throw 1's terminals, reverse them on Throw 2's terminals. These would connect to the pump. (Please correct me if I have the terminology messed up there) I'd then have the audrino control the Relay's switching terminal at 50/60 times per second. I assume that this would produce a triangle wave, but I'm not sure if the motor would be happy with that.  
Second idea, look for some magic IC that can convert DC to AC without any unnecessary stepping-up of the voltage.

8,Estimating the uncertainty of a point in two dimensions between two observations.,1430482642,"Imagine an experiment where I take a box and set it to a particular temperature.  I then hold it at this temperature for some time period and record the value of some other property of it (lets call it P).  After the run, I can reduce the data down to a single data point in T-P space by taking the median of my recorded temperature and P data, and come up with an uncertainty for both by looking at the 20th and 80th percentiles.

I now repeat this process for many temperature values, which allows me to draw a curve (P as a function of T) using the calculated median values.  At some point, this curve trends upward and crosses some threshold in P.  I want to find the value of T that corresponds to this crossing, as well as understand the uncertainty at that point.

So this is my question....how do I go about doing this?  While the uncertainties in T and P are uncorrelated, they both factor into the uncertainty in T if I try to interpolate the crossing point.

It seems like it would be more complicated than with machining, because with machining a part, you have your chosen datums and then the tolerances are stacked starting from the datums.

With plastic injection molding, I feel like there are tolerances from the machining of the two molds, but I think there should also be tolerances for how the plastic sits in the mold and shrinks as it cools. On this website (http://www.protolabs.com/injection-molding/design-guidelines) it talks about two tolerances, a resin and machining tolerance. Are those the ones I attempted to describe earlier in this paragraph?

Anyway, here is a sloppily drawn mockup of a part, and some basic dimensions:  http://i.imgur.com/3Lvh62u.jpg

The red is a cross section view of the part, so where it separates in the middle, there is an undercut to allow for the bottom half of the mold to reach that lower face shown with a black line.

If you let go of the buttons, it just stops.  If you resume engaging the buttons, it continues until the press is fully actuated, at which point you can let go of the two-hand controls.

Now if you want the press to open, you flip a switch, and engage the same controls again.  Again, if you let go of the two-hand controls, it just stops.  If you resume using the two-hand controls, it continues to open until the press is fully opened.

I know for a fact that all deshellers sold in Asia and India use 1 hp electric motors with about 1700 rpms, usually single phase, about 30 to 60 final output rpm (gear reducer) The other machines, the dehusker, uses 3 hp motors, don't know much about their direct specs, but having looked at motor distributors I am reckoning about 3600 rpm.

My biggest doubt is in gear reduction and the actual electric motors to be used.

I know for a fact that I need a motor with 1 hp and another with 3 hp for these two machines. I also know that I need about 30-60 rpm in final out, after gear reduction, in both machines.

So before I keep rambling, these are my questions:

* Does it matter what type of electric motor I pick in terms of durability and torque considering the wood-ish processing application? Besides AC, single phase (maybe 3 phase for the 3 hp one)

* Does it matter that I stick to the limitations of the gear reducers I find (example: max input hp, max rated rpm)? Or should I find gear reducers that strictly match the specs of their corresponding motors and I don't more or less match the specs. (Is it better to go over in max specs than over?)
* Should I worry about or do gear reducers really do slow down shit but also multiply torque?
* Do 3 HP electric motors work better as 3 phase, as opposed to single phase?
* Does it matter if I use compressor electric motors, or should I get specifically wood working electric motors? Or are they the same just have different names for marketing

Reason I am asking all these questions is I don't have much money to spend and I would really hate it if I messed these expensive parts up because I didn't clear all my doubt, even after having done my research.

I am all ears.

Thanks in advance.

38,Should I become an engineer? (advice),1430340118,"**A little background on me:**

Married, baby on the way, already in a career in biotech/microbiology. I have my BS in biochemistry, a lot of the emphasis in biochemistry is natural sciences and the body, especially enzymes, equilibrium, etc. Recently, I took and passed the FE environmental in order to qualify for a bioenvironmental engineering position in the Air National Guard. I self-taught myself all the info (plus books, reviews etc.), and I had to teach myself how to ""think"" like an engineer to solve problems. So obviously I am not an engineer just because I passed the FE (would love to have my EIT, but I need a Masters of Engineering in my circumstances), but I have become very interested in engineering, specifically environmental and civil. My background gives me good insight into chemical reactions used in water and wastewater engineering. I also work for a biotech company under the broad umbrella of microbiology, so I understand that well and how it would apply to remediation and water quality.

My question to you guys is: should I make the transition to engineering? I do not have a stereotypical engineer's mind where I understand things analytically and am extremely devoted to certain areas, but I have a solid grasp on critical thinking and problem solving. I want to get my Masters, whether my MBA or MS Civil so that I can become a scientific manager. In order to get my MS in engineering I would have to get about 6 remedial classes (retake Calc, diff eq, fluid mechanics), so the timeline is longer, but I really am leaning towards that path.

This isn't a purely school-related question, hence I did not post it under r/engineeringstudents. Anyone who has experience switching from a non-engineering to engineering for masters, and who works in environmental engineering would be who I really want to hear from, but anyone is welcome to chime in.

I am getting in an RF signal and amp/filtering it twice to around -50 to -55 dBm. The mixer is mixing the signal and oscillator(10-12 dBm) to the appropriate IF (for easy IC filtering) except with 15-20 dBm loss. 

I have tried several configurations including the balanced in/out with impedance matching of 3000/50 (http://i.imgur.com/Zh6Hv7B.png?1). Just a sch I threw up on LTspice. Btw... SA612 was not an easy model to find. I thought it would be easier with how much people talked about it at a local HAMfest. 

I am currently attempting an unbalanced configuration but, so far the results are similar/worse. Are their any tips from a RF engineer/HAM out there that may know as to why this mixer seems to only act as passive?

I'm not looking for someone to hand me a circuit. I would like to still have done this mostly on my own due to pride issues but, I would really appreciate a direction with what I have currently. Or if I simply need to order a different mixer.

75,How do I plot the path of these vertices as the piece is rotated about it's center?,1430203901,"I have a sort of grid like pattern of 1.5 inch slats spaced 1.5 inches apart. This makes a larger grid but I'm only concerned now with the four inner vertices. I would like the entire grid to rotate and as it does, those four vertices to follow a contoured ""track"" so the slats pivot and shift back and forth. To get the entire grid to rotate, these shafts will stick through a slotted plate like [this](http://imgur.com/EWE6vMk) which will rotate about it's center. Then to get the grid to shift (not just stay square/90 degrees) I need to control the position (closer or further from center) of each of the four shafts as they rotate. The problem is the path of these points throughout the rotation is more complex than I was expecting and I have no fixed reference point (other than the center of the grid which is the direct center of the four innermost slats) [This](http://imgur.com/SfcOPh1) terrible sketch may give some idea of the shift from square to tilted and back again if I haven't explained it well enough. As it goes back to square, vertex 1 would then be in the top right. I've worked out that the path is similar to two overlapping circles with a 3"" diameter but that's not exactly it.

How can I learn to use our engineering resources better?,1430176509,"Hello, I am a design engineer for a company that engineers photovoltaic (solar) systems. I feel that we are severely understaffed and the amount of work that needs to be done is simply daunting. We have 3 designers that are capable of producing construction documents for our active projects and 1 full time engineer. We are the only technical staff that actually produces what my company sells. We have about 6 active projects that need attention but we can only do so much at a time. Our current process is to assign an individual designer to a single project and having that designer fully engineer the system alone. (The full time engineer does oversee the projects... but he is useless, which is a completely separate issue)

To me, this seems like a very poor way to operate. Working on a project alone means that you have to make all the judgement calls and you lose the value of collaboration. I personally work much better when I am working as part of a team, and I don't like how I have 0 collaboration with my colleagues.

89,[UPDATE]/[SOLUTION] For anyone interested in the Real-Time \Latex document creator I was looking for a month ago.,1430161472,"I understand if this isn't something you are particularly interested in, but I'm sure that some people will be interested in it, either now or in the future. 

What I was originally looking for is a LaTex editor that would allow me to see the code I typed in real time. Part of the issue I take with coding is that you can't really see what is happening until you compile and then you have to debug and try to find the issue in tons of lines of code. This is not ideal for when you're creating a document for presentation. There is no real reason why I shouldn't be able to see ""$ \Frac {x} {\vec {x} } $ doesn't work as it happens, rather than after. 

It is a pain to compile every line or 2 to see if the code is good, so what is a TeX-er to do? Well, I had a couple of solutions and I would like to share them with you.

1. A WYSIWYG editor. Some of these use an insertion pane. This might be what you like but is not what I was looking for. Still, take a look into it.

2. The thing that worked for me is Gummi for Linux : it is exactly what I wanted. The key to look for is real time compiling. As you type, for example,

    \subsection{words}
    
    $\frac {x}{\vec {b}} $
    
    \begin{description}
    
    \item{one} one one one
    
    \item{two} two two two
    
    \end{description}

it has a preview pane on the right that shows you what it will look like, and if there are any errors in your document, as you type it. Super useful for document creation. Since it compiles on the go, you will have to set the document up symmetrically before you go (set up beings and ends before it will show you), but it is pretty much exactly what I wanted. The compiling happens during idle time, when you aren't typing, and can be set to any number of seconds for a delay. You can set it up for 1 second, so it updates as you go, or you can set it to a 15 second delay.",AskEngineers,Kilo__,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3428zf/updatesolution_for_anyone_interested_in_the/
90,Concerns with the new FE Exam Process,1430159273,"I'm sorry if this question is not allowed, but I am a little upset with the FE Exam process and would like to vent and ask who to contact about this.

To start signing up for the FE exam you have to create an account with [NCEES](http://www.ncees.org). I did, I put all of the required information in, including my Associate's degree and expected Bachelor's degree (within 20 credits). There was no proof of anything required at all, and when I purchased the ticket to the FE exam I was surprised that I was considered eligible instantly. I signed up for the date/time/location right away.

I took the exam a few weeks ago and got my answer that I passed on 4/23/15, of which I was quite happy about. I had an interview the next day and told them as well that I am excited to be on my way to eventually becoming a PE in the future.

I wanted to locate some sort of proof that I passed the FE but I couldn't find anything. I called my state's office of the professions and was told that literally **a screenshot of the webpage** that says I passed is my proof to employers.

*What?* I am not mistaken. There is no certification, no official letter, no nothing. I realize that it is simply just the exam, but there are a few jobs I would like to apply for that require that I passed this exam and it almost seems embarrassingly unprofessional to give them a screenshot of my user profile with the tiny little green box that says I passed as my proof. Plus the FE is a requirement for the PE...yet only this screenshot is proof that I passed?

I contacted my college and they said this is the first they have heard of this issue. She contacted the state for me and she got the same answer.

I am not one to usually complain about things being ""too easy,"" but this was almost fraudulently easy. Provided I have done no such thing, but let me point some things out:

* NCEES technically has no proof that I was eligible to take the FE. All I did was write down that I have an Associate's and an expected Bachelor's and they let me take the exam without question immediately.
* The state supposedly gets their information from NCEES. What information?
* My school sends my transcripts to the state after I graduate. So right now nobody has any proof that I was even eligible. Currently it is ""I said so.""
* There is no official paperwork that states I passed at all. Nothing mailed, nothing printable online. No searchable database of name or certification number online or offline like the PE.
* I could pay $70 for an EIT certification in my state, which comes with a certification number. However, there is no searchable database employers can use to prove my certification, and the state charges an extra $20 per letter to send proof of my certification. Too much, in my opinion, and EIT certification is not a requirement to get the PE down the road.
* With all of this seemingly lack of secure knowledge on the eligibility and completion of the exam, the security in the exam was comparatively extreme. I had to empty my pockets into a locker, remove my sweater and jacket, use their provided dry-erase paper and marker for scatch-notes, and had two cameras on me at all times.

I realize that proof might not be necessary, and usually I'm not one to complain about these things, but it seems that almost anyone could have signed up for this exam and get on their way to certification. The necessary information for eligibility is spread very thin, and permissions were given without any verification.

Anyway, I'm a little flustered that the process was *so* simple and potentially easy to fake, as well as the lack of anything even remotely official or professional that says that I passed the exam, and/or lack of a searchable database to even verify that I passed. This test will be a requirement for my PE later in life and I wanted to make sure I was settled.

Am I over-reacting? Does anyone agree with me? Who should/can I contact about this? I talked on the phone with two gentlemen in my state's Office of the Processions to no avail, one of which was quite rude to me. Anything else I can do? Thank you all in advance for this rant.

7,"I'm a chemistry major, trying to worm my way into Material Science. Would you suggest getting a masters in MSE before grad school?",1430100946,"I'm sorry that something like this probably gets asked every other day but I was looking around for threads on this subject and couldn't find any.

I absolutely love chemistry but I am not sure what to get my PhD in. I have an extremely strong background in organic/inorganic/quantum and I am interested in doing drug-synthesis/photovoltaics/battery/fuel cell work.

In other words, I don't know what I'm doing but I really like chemistry.

So in order to get a better understanding of what I can do, I was thinking it may be smart to take a gap year before I pursue a PhD in either organic/inorganic chemistry and get a master's degree in MSE because that would be closely related to what I want to do. CE doesn't look like the right form of engineering, I'm not interested in scaling up reactions and such. I'm more interested in making new and innovative products, doing hands-on and applicative work, and so I think mat-sci is the way to go.

I would possibly do this before pursuing a PhD, so I know it's a shit ton of school but I'm totally okay with that (before this semester, I was in pre-med, so I'm still going to be finished maybe 3-years ahead of schedule). Then, once I gain a better understanding of how these devices work, I can choose the route I want to go with my PhD: organic, inorganic, or material science!

So what do you think? Masters in MSE before PhD? Is this a crazy or good?

12,Slack V belts running over stationary pulleys - please educate me,1430090140,"Sometimes V belt tensioners are used as a kind of clutch. One pulley is connected to perhaps a running engine, another pulley is connected to some stationary load, they are connected by a v belt, and there is a lever to engage a tensioning arm/pulley.

Ie: tensioner off, no pressure on belt, no power is transmitted. Tensioner tensioned, power is transmitted. There's a little bit ""feathering the clutch"" - ability.

That V belt is running over a stationary pulley (although it's not transmitting any power). Is that bad for the belt? Does it wear the belt more than normal? Will it glaze the belt over time? When or in what circumstances is this design acceptable? I see it used on farm equipment sometimes and it's generally considered kind of a hokey design, perhaps unjustly?

I assume it's an acceptable design for applications where the main purpose is to make starting the engine easier. The belt spends little time slipping in those applications.

What about some kind of transmission assembly? I'm thinking two different pulley ratios, two different belts. One tensioning arm is ""high gear"" and the other tensioning arm is ""low gear."" A belt will be slipping at all times, is that still an acceptable design? Or should I be looking at electromagnetic clutches or some other design?

39,How did the WTC North tower top section fall and crush the structure below without experiencing any deceleration upon impact?,1429972335,"This is a serious question and I am looking for serious answers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the North tower collapsed the top section of the building continued to accelerate as it impacted the structure below, it did not experience any deceleration, in fact it did the opposite, and accelerated as it fell. 

Here is a graph:

http://i.imgur.com/zxjbF5M.png

We know that in demolitions where gravity is used to crush the structure (they collapse the columns at the half way point, and allow the equal and opposite reaction to destroy the structure) that there is a measurable deceleration when the two sections impact. There is a jolt. 

Which can be seen in this analysis:

Go to 1:50 if you would like to skip right to the analysis. 

https://youtu.be/NiHeCjZlkr8?t=112

We observe this deceleration in objects (like if I were to drop a brick onto a stack of bricks, it would slow down upon impact) and we see it in known controlled demolitions.

Why did the world trade center collapse not do the same. What was so drastically different that it allowed the falling mass to crush the structure below, without decelerating. 

There is a paper that discusses this issue:

http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/2008/TheMissingJolt7.pdf

Wouldn't the only reasonable conclusion be that the structure did not experience a deceleration, because it was not impacting and crushing the structure below. If it was, it would have slowed down, as energy was being used to crush the structure below. 

The towers got progressively stronger as they went down, the columns increased in thickness. Wouldn't this make this even more implausible. 

Bazant wrote a paper that tried to explain this discrepancy, but it is seriously flawed in the eyes of Tony Szamboti, the author of the 'missing jolt' paper. 

http://www.journalof911studies.com/resources/2014SepLetterSzambotiJohns.pdf

*""errors of a very clear and unambiguous kind, apparently
stemming from the use of input values that differed from those provided by the NIST in their WTC report. For
example, in calculating the resistance of a column as it buckles, using Bazant’s “3 hinge” buckling model, the key
value is the column’s plastic moment Mp. Le and Bazant simply state this to be 0.32 MNm, for an average column
on the first impacted floor. They do not derive it, as one would expect, from more fundamental data, such as the
average column’s physical dimensions and the type of steel used. Moreover, when Szamboti and Johns calculated
the Mp themselves, from the data provided by NIST, they obtained the value of 0.64 MNm, which gives the

41,Question for UK Mechanical engineers,1429953836,"So I'm 25, and sick to death of my current job and career prospects. I've got a degree in music (don't judge me) and realised that I'd love to do engineering for space sciences and that sort of thing as a job.

I applied for a mechanical engineering apprenticeship at the RAL in Oxford but didn't manage to get in this year.

I'm not entirely sure how I'm able to get into this career without an apprenticeship, but I've heard that after 25 you don't get them as the government doesn't help with the training fees.
So my question is how do I get into this career at this age? Is it even possible to get started and what's the best way to go about it?

Are there any decent ""Start here"" reads for it that will help me along?

I have googled this but it throws up an insane amount of unhelpful info for my age group.

I had to email the HR manager about it and he informed me that the person in charge is out of the office till Monday, and he apologized for looking so disorganized. I was only able to get the start time from the HR manager after sending him an email.

I'm nervous because I technically lied on my resume and I wonder if I would be fired, or have the job offer canceled for doing that. My official graduation was supposed to be in December of 2014, but due to transferred credit errors, my requirement was at 99% and I couldn't get the degree. So I had to get that sorted out and I'm supposed to be receiving the degree this May.

Of course, the HR manager found out about it and asked me about this issue. I explained what happened with the graduation and he said it is fine as long as he can check it this May. But I understand how they could say one thing but mean another. I wonder he was just saying it nicely but actually meant another, like denying my position at the company.

I understand they are really busy with important matters but it seems strange to me that I never received anything. Three weeks ago, there was a brief phone call with the HR manager, discussed the salary, accepted the job offer, and I was told to give the 2-week notice to my current employer.

58,Electrical - Grid design and DC harmonic contribution from Solar Inverters,1429844200,"I work for an embedded generation design/installation company and have a fair amount of experience installing diesel and solar generators parallel with the network here in Australia.

I have an interesting request from a utility operator in Western Australia that we measure the DC current contribution that our newly installed inverters feed into the grid while exporting. 

We are allowed to contribute no more than 0.5 percent of the total rated inverter current as DC. (System total current will be in the order of 100's of amps)
Now obviously it is pretty easy to measure the DC offset/bias of an AC voltage with most multi-meters or even if you want to get really technical, an oscilloscope.

However to measure the DC offset of an AC waveform in a 90A/415V circuit is a little bit harder. 
A standard hall effect or clamp meter ranged for the correct AC current will be wildly inaccurate when trying to measure values to the order of 200mA DC per phase or less, but the thought of trying to design and install a shunt for series metering on an installation of this size is a bit terrifying. If I get it wrong I could cause a major fire in the switchboard or worse.

If you have any suggestions on how I can measure 200mA of DC in a 415V 200A AC circuit without dying, that would be wonderfully received!

Another did not take me because they, presumably, got someone more fit for the job (EE for an EE internship). 

As graduation seems to crawl closer, and me being stuck just taking graduate classes for summer just does not seem very bright for my future. Perhaps, I've been too selective with my choices for internships by sticking strictly to aerospace companies.

98,Very Hot Hydraulic Oil,1429714150,"I am experiencing very hot hydraulic oil temperatures on a hydraulic skid that runs at about 1500 psi.  The skid operates pressurized rolls in a paper-mill that essentially squish the paper going through it.  the hydraulics are working and do not see any sign of malfunction, but I am seeing a very constant high temperature of about 180F to 200F.  The system uses about 320 gallons of AW100 oil. 

I took a look at the oil and it looks really dirty and mucky.  It is of a dark brown/black and you cannot see through it at all.  

My question to you guys is:

1.  At this pressure, what is a normal operating temperature?

2.  What should I be looking for in terms of ""inefficiencies"" in the system itself to help determine where the heat is being generated from. 

3.  There is a heat exchanger on the system and has been running constantly for about 3-4 weeks.  What should I look for on this to help determine if the heat exchanger is working properly?

4.  Would old and nasty hydraulic oil be a root cause of this high temperature I am seeing (how significant is this in terms of oil temp)?

5.  What would the process be to clean out the hydraulic system?  I would like to have the system completely cleaned up and flushed.

6.  Not really a question but just wanted to let y'all know, you guys are awesome..... :)

UPDATE: After some additional research I found the water solenoid valve had a Cv value of 4 and the oil pump had a flow rate of about 12GPM.  I believe this is the main issue with cooling the oil down to a reasonable temperature.  While operational, the oil temp was only being reduced by about 10F while the water temperature was being increased by 45F.  The water retention time was not too long compared to the oils.  

The system was purchased a long time ago and was from another mill.  Upon installation, nothing was changed other than the additional tubing required to terminate the hydraulic pressure to the machine itself.  Because of the additional tubing and valves installed I think this added some friction to the tubing, increasing the overall heat load to the oil.  I since calculated the required heat transfer rate and specified a new heat exchanger and water solenoid valve.  I went with a worst case scenario for the oil heat load (230F cooled to 140F).  This allowed me to specify an exchanger that was capable to removing this heat via counter flow convection.

8,Stable job vs lucrative contract,1429703845,"This is going to be somewhat vague but wanted to get some opinions on people who may have experienced similar situations. 

I just started my first full time engineering job as a mechanical project engineer  at 25 yrs old making 58K. Full benefits. job is decent but I sit behind a computer CADing all day. My previous job I did everything design, procure, install and I loved it but it was part time and funding ran out. I'm not yet used to the drudgery of desk life. 

Without getting into it I have the opportunity to incorporate myself and get a engineering contract to work for myself and provide job shoppers for a 2 to 3 year ~150 K/yr budget. I would be fully capable of the work and could be paying myself to do that work and then could also be profiting on any extra contractors I hire. But I am no business person and have health problems so insurance would be interesting to deal with/pay for. 

Should I leave my 8-5 to work when I want, probably less hours and make ~50% more and the commute is shorter as well. I would also be doing more work like the last job, specing parts buying and installing. but have no gurantees after this contract is done. 

I know a lot of older guys retire and then start consulting but I could be starting out doing that but without the experience or nest egg.

I just did some back-of-the-envelope math and came up with a maximum point load in the center of the larger table of 7.6 lbf.  Though, it can't exactly be modelled as a simply supported beam, I figured it was close enough.

I didn't see any reinforcement in the concrete, so in that midspan I'll assume that the only thing resisting the tensile force in the bottom fibers is the concrete's tensile strength:

* ft ≅ 0.2 * fc^2/3

That bag of concrete has 2000 psi on the bag...

* ft ≅ 0.2 * 2000^2/3 = 31.7psi

My estimations on that member are using [LEGO dimensions found here](http://www.robertcailliau.eu/Lego/Dimensions/zMeasurements-en.xhtml):

* Length = 47 studs = 47 * 8mm = 14.8""
* Height = 5 studs = 5 * 8mm = 1.6""
* Width = 22 bricks = 22 * 9.6mm = 8.3""

A simply supported beam with a point load at its center has a bending moment equal to PL/4.

* My/I = (PL/4) * y/I = (PL/4) * y/(1/12*bh^3 ) = 31.7psi
* (P * 14.8"") * (1.6""/2) / (1/12 * 8.3"" * (1.6"")^3 ) = 31.7psi
* P = 7.6 lbf

It is not required to be able to make a quick reload or anything like that.. I need to be able to spray a liquid about 10-15cm away from the nozzle.

What I thought of was having a CO2 canister hooked up to a pressure regulator that pressurizes a pneumatic piston. That piston can output a constant pressure on a liquid tank that has its output connected to a solenoid(for turning it on/off) that leads to the nozzle.

My thinking was, modern digital video can be encoded very quickly, and buffered into memory.  An analog tape head could write digital information onto VHS as a storage medium, and since its no longer analog, the tape heads could be sped up considerably and a second set of heads could even be added to accomedate for write verification and error correction.  Without knowing the actual technological limitations of the VHS tape medium like the density at which a 1 or 0 could be read or written with an acceptable level of accuracy.. I went out on a limb and said that you could in fact record/play 4k video onto a cassette (perhaps only a few seconds worth) and it would require buffering.

If I now place a thin sheet of paper in between the conductors and repeat the experiment, the voltage that causes a spark to appear is much higher than in the previous experiment. As a matter of fact, the closer the piece of paper is to the excited conductor, the higher the required voltage for air ionisation is.

34,Humidity/Wet-Bulb measurements - any tips to speed it up?,1429602877,"Hey all!

I make a lot of process measurements, a key one being humidity of the process air inside ducting.. 

CurrentlyI use a K-type thermocouple with a long length of gauze wrapped around the tip and dunked in water for the wet bulb.. I watch the numbers on the thermocouple display creep up until they reach a plateau, and then note that down... This can take 10+ mins of standing there with my arms getting tired as I hold the wet-bulb in place, and I get bored.. and the meter switches itself off after 5 mins... 

Smaller bulb wrapping seems like the obvious answer, however we run at fairly fast air flows (15-40 m/s), moderate dry temps (100 - 250 deg. C), and highish humidity (up to 40 % vol.)... Small bulb will dry out quickly and make it easy to miss the plateau!

For the z-axis (the print bed's motion, a large flat platform for those unfamiliar) I'm using one lead screw for each side (it's a big printer) for motion, and two precision rods for guidance.

The lead screws have a straightness tolerance of +/- 0.5mm over their 1m length. If it weren't for the rods, then the outer walls of the printed object would carry this same tolerance and have a ""wavy"" appearance, which is bad. The lead screw is TR10x2 stainless steel and the rods are 12mm diameter hard chrome-plated steel (Misumi).

1) Will the rods be able to prevent the translation of the lead screw deflection to the print bed? I'm familiar with simple beam-bending theory, but have no clue on how to calculate the force here..

2) Even if so, is it recommended to have an [oldham coupling-like mechanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmMrsJ1Jmy8&amp;feature=youtu.be) to prevent excess friction and possible binding on the precision rods? I'm using 15mm long plastic sleeve bearings made by Igus.

77,How to analyze this volumetric efficiency data?,1429460466,"I own a 01 toyota celica for 3 years and ive noticed that the 1zz-fe engine has some interesting traits. It tends to have a sweet spot in the pedal, where if you push it to that spot the car will accelerate as if it is full throttle and pushing the pedal simply makes the car louder, not faster. Unfortunately the only way for me to find the sweet spot is by butt dyno. I've been trying to figure out a reason for this and decided to use my OBD logger to try to find an answer.

What I found is 3 things: according to the loggers calculations the car is the most volumetrically efficient at super low rpms because I was going up a steep hill and it was more efficient at the sweet spot (~60% throttle) in 4th gear than low throttle (25%) in 2nd. The cars volumetric efficiency also didn't change much as the rpms grew past its torque rpm and into its powerband, although the sweet spot gradually increased with the rpms. Lastly, even up near redline moving the throttle between the sweet spot and full had no obvious effect on the efficiency or the power being made. 

From what I know, this could mean a few things. For one, it could mean that the throttle is not the primary air restriction in the intake system, and that somewhere else chokes the engine of air so much that the throttle becomes a lesser restriction rather quickly. I figured the low rpms being efficient was due to the runner tuning, but it seemed a little extreme so I'm still very shakey on this. 

I'm trying to find a way to improve the cars performance based off of this data, but I'm not sure how. Do I have it backwards and a bigger throttle body will help the performance? Or maybe an intake manifold designed for higher flow rates and a different rpm? I also have larger injectors on it that the engines ecu is compensating for in its own. Could this be skewing my data? The more complex the answer the better, I really want to understand this. Thanks guys!",AskEngineers,skylin4,/r/AskEngineers/comments/334y5d/how_to_analyze_this_volumetric_efficiency_data/

Any advice would be appreciated. Here are a few of my considerations so far:

* 3PH motors are cheaper and easier to control than 1PH
* Definitely do not want to use a rotary phase converter
* Some VFDs convert single to 3 phase, have a CW/CCW capability, and control torque and RPM, but I can't find any above 4HP that can convert phase. If I could find a 15HP phase converting VFD that'd be perfect.

* enter a power generation firm and stay 10-15 years and maybe work my way into the government from there (I also dream of trying to solve some problems in our energy policy, I live in the PH)
* enter R&amp;D (energy storage)

* our country has some good features, any renewable source of energy: solar, wind, geothermal, water is viable within our 7,000 islands
* we rely heavily on foreign technologies; most of the players in the industry are either satellites of multinational ones or local private power producers partnering with foreign firms, so we really don't have much local firms with solid R&amp;D departments

10,[Canadian Mech Eng] What space-related opportunities are there for Canadians who complete a M.Eng Aerospace (Propulsion)?,1429300756,"Hi there, I was looking into pursuing a M.Eng Aerospace (Propulsion), hopefully focusing on rocket propulsion, at a Canadian University. I've looked into Canadian schools and have that stuff figured out, but now I want some advice on job opportunities that are available before I accept any offers for school. I completed a BEng Mechanical and have completed work terms at Oil and Gas companies, so I can always go into that field and just skip the MEng Aerospace if the opportunities are really that bleak.

So some questions:

* What rocket propulsion opportunities are there in Canada? I know I could always try to get a job at Bombardier or Boeing with plane propulsion, but not really what I was looking for. (Seems like most space related opportunities that I see online are within material QA/QC)

* Does NASA, or other American space-related companies hire Canadians? How about if you have American citizenship?

* Same as above, but ESA/Europe instead.

* Lastly, what is it really like in the day of a propulsion engineer? Is it fun, hard, enjoyable work? Or is it meant for a special kind of person that wants to work consistent 70+ hrs/week with no free time/family time?

Upon approaching him about it, he walked away from the conversation. How do I stop him from dragging me down with him, while maintaining a work appropriate relationship?

Hi all,

**Some background:** 
I started a job about 6 months ago, and have about 2 years work experience in the HVAC as a mechanical engineer. I am, by far, at the bottom of the totem pole, as a junior design engineer and new hire. 

My coworker, has been with this company 12 years, and has experience in the oil industry before this,. While he has much more experience, he has never developed professionally and is a junior design engineer as well, with very similar responsibilities. 

We have been working on this project since I joined the company. The project we are working on is quite large and will extend into 2019, maybe beyond. We will be working together closely (the engineering team is us two and a senior engineer overseeing our work) for years to come, which is why I need to nip any problems in the bud.

**The real story:**
The issues arise from the addition of an expedited package (EP). We had to add new sheets and phasing to our Revit model, to separate work which is to be completed sooner than originally planned. I have been working on this full time so far, set up the sheets, views, etc. for the regular package (RP), and phasing for the expedited set. My coworker was added to the project due to the increased load, and he went ahead and set up the sheets for the EP while I was away. I come back to find he has undone much of the work I had done by moving views (instead of duplicating) from the RP sheets to the EP sheets, and continuing work on the incorrect phase (drawings show now up incorrect\jumbled. I showed him the issue, the solution, and cleaned up the mess). There are other issues which have come up on this project since he was added, all of which are related to him taking shortcuts, being messy. The PE overseeing our work is not in the office (works at a different location) and does not see the day to day interaction, just what is on the paper. He does not know who has done what.

Today, I approached my coworker regarding the issues mentioned above, focusing on why the RP set has sheets missing views. I pulled him aside, asking if he knows why these sheets aren't showing up like I had left them. He owned up to moving the views, and told me this is not the correct approach to setting up the sheets. This is not true, as i spoke to the firm BIM manager to make sure I'm doing everything per the company standard before starting, and have gone back and forth with him since. When I told him that, I made sure this is how I was told to go about things, he raised his voice, told me that's not how he does things, and walked away.

I do not want my superiors associating me with my coworker's way of doing things. We are ahead of schedule, there is no need to take shortcuts, let quality decline, or screw each other over. At this point, this is not work that I want to put my name on. Since I have tried speaking to him and failed miserably, I think the next step would be to reach out to my superiors. I am afraid of sounding whiny, or just being dismissed altogether since my coworker has been with the firm much longer than me. What do I do?

**UPDATE:**
Emailed our boss explaining the issues, my attempt at resolving it, and asked for his advice on handling it (rather than asking him to fix it). We're going to lunch Monday to discuss this further, outside the office. He specifically asked for face to face rather than email (no paper trail?).

I also remembered a coworker mentioning he had trouble following the direction coming from a PE because he did not like following someone younger. Not sure if higher ups were aware of this.

26,Analytical solution for optimal control of a linear-affine system with control constraints?,1429223321,"I have a fairly basic system for which I'm trying to find a minimum-time optimal control policy. I know there are many ways to do this numerically, but since I'm trying to solve it very rapidly, I'm wondering if there is an analytical solution.

My system is a double integrator in 3-dimensions with the control inputs being acceleration. This system is affine because there is a constant forcing term (gravity - however this acceleration does not appear in the control accelerations). The control constraints are simply that the norm of the acceleration components our bounded above (i.e. there is a maximum total acceleration due to a maximum thrust of the system).

The cost function is just final time. I want to control my system from one state (A) to another (B) in a minimum amount of time while obeying my max acceleration constraint.

It looks very similar to a linear-quadratic regulator, which has an analytical solution. However, it is not a LQR because of the affine term and control constraints.

For those who do not study controls, this may be too esoteric. However for control engineers, there may be a commonly known answer of which I am unaware.

33,How best to install a solar panel on my truck?,1429206927,"I'm trying to create a solar energy system for living out of my truck this summer. I've already acquired the solar panel, charge controller, battery, and inverter. 
My main concern right now is how best to attach the solar panel I have to the top of my truck. As can be seen in these [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/MJY7N) I already have a cargo box and bikes taking up the camper shell portion of the truck. So it seems like the most sensible place for the panel is on top of the cab. 
I've done some research on how best to attach the panel and it seems there are three options for mounting. The first is to drill holes in the roof and bolt the panel down (which I am loathe to do for waterproofing risk reasons). The second is to use some kind of adhesive (VHB tape, Sikaflex, epoxy). I'm more inclined to go with the adhesive route (where you attach the mountings with adhesives to the roof and then bolt the panel to the mountings), but I'm worried about the potential for the panel to fly off when the truck is going at high speeds in high winds. And the third option would be to set up a rail system on the truck bed roof and attach the panel to the rails, but I feel like this would be a lot more expensive. 

The panel is about 26"" by 40"" and can fit on the cab roof in either orientation (short vs. long end facing forward). Whichever mounting strategy I use, I'm curious to know which orientation will be more aerodynamic / less likely to cause the panel to fly off.

So in summary, the questions I'd like answered are:

1. Which mounting strategy makes the most sense, as in, is most structurally sound and will not damage my vehicle too much? (Holes in roof + bolting; adhering mounts; or installing rail system; or something else I haven't thought of?)

2. Which orientation for the panel makes the most sense? A gain in aerodynamics / structural stability might mean a loss in sun access because of the shade caused by the cargo box. 

Also, would any other subreddits be better able to answer my questions? Thanks a bunch engineers!

In the above link, it states that an electrical engineer from india has invented a device to generate electricity. 

From The article

&gt;The concept that efficiencies cannot be greater than 100% is due to an incomplete understanding of the properties of space. The second law of thermodynamics must be modified to account for the fact that space is not empty, as has been taught for the last 150 years. The RLG operates at what has been called “over unity.” Many experienced electrical engineers engaged in the manufacture of AC generators have independently tested the RLG and confirmed the efficiency ratings that I have observed. It’s time for the physicists to get out of the way and modify their theories while the engineers go about the business of design and production.

It is in a bottle with say 600cm^2 surface area. I take it out to room temperature at 25Deg. The glass is 7mm thick.  Assuming wine has a heat capacity of water how long will it take for the bottle to reach 15Deg C.

from what i can understand  I need to find the average heat transfer in watts at the temperature difference and with the given surface area and thickness by:

Rate = k•A•(T1 - T2)/d


K= rate constant for the material;  A = Surf Area;  d = thickness
gives us the rate in W.

Then relate the heat transfer to the specific heat capacity of water
Q=mc dT

which gives us the total energy difference needed in J.

since W = J/s this would give us the time needed?

I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering and I am doing quite well at the subject, however I would like to direct myself towards Aerospace engineering. My supervisor has advised me to gear my final year research project towards the Aerospace industry and subsequently pursue my desired Masters from a more suitable University.

However I am now left in quite the dilemma, I have 1 month to propose my final year project and limited resources. Having a keen interest in space science I am well aware of multiple fields of research but I don't know how I could refine these projects to fit into a single year piece of research.

The projects I have already considered include: 3D printing in Micro-gravity, The development and complications of Centripetal Forced based artificial gravity, Single Stage Earth to Orbit Engines (primarily modelling the cycles of the SABRE engine), High Efficiency Turbine Compressors, The Principle of operation for the EmDrive, and many more.

However, between a lack of resources, a limited time span, and the over-complex nature of some of these titles I have almost ruled them out. Can anyone suggest more suitable areas of research that may redirect my course of study?

55,[Mechanics] Forces in Polar Coordinates,1429130667,"Hello, 
I posted this in another subreddit but thought of posting it here in the hope that it gets more visibility. 

I came across an equation that describes the forces developed when a material is deformed in the X-Y coordinate plane. I believe that the nature of the forces is elastic and restoring, but this is irrelevant in terms of the formulation. The problem that I'm having is understanding an equation.

Here is some background. Imagine you are deforming a piece of material in the x-Y plane. The deformation in cartesian coordinates are

- Xd
- Yd

The restoring forces in the X and Y directions in cartesian coordinates are gx() and gy().
In cylindrical coordinates there are 3 type of deformations:

- Tangential deflection (theta or t)
- Radial deflection or R
- And axial deflection (z)

The paper that I'm reading describes the forces in the radial and tangential directions as Ft, Fr and says:

- Fr = cos(theta)2 *gx(r) + sin (theta) 2 *gy(r)
and
- Ft = -cos (theta) * sin(theta) * gx(r) + cos(theta) * sin(theta) *gy(r)

80,How do you test a motor for bad commutators?,1429043445,"In the parts we make at our factory, they have brushed DC motors in them. Our current method of testing the commutators is suddenly not good enough for whatever reason. So I'm looking for a way to test the motor for poor commutator connections/bad coils etc. I was thinking I could apply a small pulse to get the motor spinning and then check for open continuity while it coasts to a stop or something, I don't know. 

Our current testing method is a very roundabout way of doing it. Basically, when our parts are fully assembled, the motor is in series with a power transistor, and the wiring harness gives me one motor connection, the power transistor connection, and a small wire through a resistor to the connection between the motor and power transistor. The test itself powers the motor through the transistor, and graphs the voltage drop across the transistor. It then finds a moving average, and does some ""sum of squares"" equation to measure how much the graph wavers from the average in the form of a single number. In a normal motor the graph looks kinda like a sine wave following the moving average line. In a bad motor the graph is more spiky. It has worked fine up until recently where I believe the supplier made a change and the brushes in the motor aren't as worn in as they were, which gives false readings unless you run the motor for a couple minutes, then it reads as normal.

I don't know, I'm mostly hoping the problem goes back to normal and everyone forgets about it, or any solution I come up with increases cycle time and is therefore unacceptable.",AskEngineers,zimirken,/r/AskEngineers/comments/32ls69/how_do_you_test_a_motor_for_bad_commutators/

1,Online Programming Certificate,1428971550,"Hello,
So I am hoping some of you can help me solve a personal issue. I have always been interested in programming, yet I never got around to learning how to do any serious programming. The most I have done is a little arduino work. 

I have an ME degree, and I am currently working as a field engineer in the power industry. My job does not need me to have any programming skills, so work will not pay for it. I also travel heavily in Fall/Spring and a little in the summer, so attending a physical class is not a possibility. 

In the past I have tried a few online tutorials here and there, but without a clear directive, I struggle with learning. The structure of a classroom (in terms of assignments, projects, etc) helps me to learn.

So at the end of the day I see my only option is online classes, and that brings me to my questions.

-

Hi structural engineers! I am in no way an engineer, so I apologize in advance for what will probably sound like a very stupid person talking. Rough diagrams linked at the bottom.

Myself and another student are building a structure, basically a frame for indoor recreation/exercise, with uses including aerial arts, slacklining, parkour, kickboxing, etc. As we are students we are on a budget, and so we're trying to build this thing as cheap as we can and still not have it collapse on us.

It would have been much easier to just build a big pyramid, but we couldn't make it tall enough to be practical for our purposes. Part of the reason we didn't use lumber was the extreme weight and bulkiness required to support the loads involved. We wanted it to be both cheap, light and strong, and so we tried to find the material that suited this best. We compared each kind of round HSS/pipe/conduit based on material type, weight, cost, and yield strength, and decided on the steel tubing found below.

We decided to use round HSS and did some questionable math to determine what OD+wall size pipe would maybe work to support most of the expected forces on all different directions of the cube. We decided on OD 1.660"" wall 0.134"" galvanized A500 steel [assuming grade B] for the cube's edges, which in theory should support around 320lbs bending yield strength per edge. We also decided on OD 1.900"" wall 0.145"" galvanized A500 for an X brace at the top of the cube, the center of which would in theory be capable of suspending up to 1960lbs before yield.

We also guesstimated a safe limit of ~2000lbs static load suspended from the center of the cube to account for dynamic forces of aerial arts (this limit is far above the forces i've anecdotally heard of from real-life dynamic drop testing).

In addition to the basic cube structure, we plan on adding 4' trusses of the same pipe to reinforce each face (except the bottom 'cuz we think it won't matter if the top has a giant X brace).

Finally: this needs to be able to break down, so it can't just all be welded together. It needs to bolt or screw together somehow.

People with money would normally just buy a bunch of pipe and then buy Kee Klamps to connect it all. But Kee Klamps are expensive; it would cost at least $200 for those connectors alone. The steel pipe for the cube + trusses + X brace is looking like it'll cost in the $600 and up range.

Our saving grace is we know people who have welders, plasma cutters, grinders, etc and we know how to use them. So if it's possible for us to just buy a little extra steel and save money by fabricating the connections ourselves, hooray!


-

Question 1: How would you fabricate the vertex joints for such a cube?

Question 2: How would you connect the X brace at the top of the cube together, and then connect it to the cube itself?

Question 3: For the trusses, does it make sense to use round HSS for the truss material, or should we just bolt on squares of steel at the corners, or longer pieces of rectangular steel?

Question 4: Is our estimation of the tolerances of this material utter crap and are we fooling ourselves that this thing will support being climbed on and swung  from?

Question 5: is using round HSS stupid? What other material should we use?

Thanks!

I am interested in designing a clamp/trap mechanism for a piece of smooth tubing, and prevent the tubing from translating along its longitudinal axis.

But besides intuition, is there  a way of analysis (theory, equations) that could help me answer questions like, ""how many teeth to have"", ""how big of teeth should be"", ""how sharp teeth need to be"", etc?

I contacted my local university about their graduate programs in biomedical engineering, but I am relatively lost on how to approach the undergraduate engineering prerequisites. My math is a little bit rusty, but I plan on taking differential equations and maybe linear algebra through my local community college this summer! However, that still does not help with the engineering prereqs that many of the programs look for. Do I have to go back to undergrad to accomplish this? I'm currently working full-time to support myself and am rather limited to night classes, which are few and far between at 4-year universities.

I was curious if anyone has done this successfully and maybe would be so kind as to share their experiences and advice. Thanks!",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/32eai6/postgraduate_career_change_sciencehealthcare_to/

33,Graphic Designer looking to become a Mechanical Engineer/Designer,1428878401,"Hello Engineers,

I am a graphic designer of almost 5 years. I've been mostly doing pre-press + dealing with pad printers, and all other types of printers, also fixing and maintaining these machines. I really enjoy the more technical brain crunching, making things work aspects then the actual creative process. Basically I like to make things work, and make them appeasing to the eye. As much as I enjoy doing this stuff, this is not going to create the future for myself, I make peanuts, and I am pretty discouraged. I feel that switching fields, would be more beneficial for future self.

My interest in becoming a mechanical engineer/designer began when I started to realize that I actually do not like to create business cards and brochures. I'd rather set up the printer to make it print perfectly. I recently took a few classes for autoCAD, and I enjoy doing dielines for parts, just I wish autoCAD was more functional. I enjoy making things work. Designing functional parts for anything, using the best materials for the job, etc. 

I also have been gifted a high detailed 3D printer, been really enjoying working it, and it makes me realize how much I would love to work these machines on a daily basis. Adding to this, I've been working with plastics for around 2 years now. It's mostly been, what type of curing process, and pre-setup would be best for this plastic for printing purposes.

My questions:
 - Have any of you worked in the field of mechanical engineering? What field do you work in, and what's a typical day like?
- Any online resources that would be helpful to becoming a mechanical designer?
- Thinking about going to a community college to help me better learn all aspects of this field. Is my thinking correct?
- Any graphic designers that work more with mechanical designing or vice versa?
- Anyone work in the 3D printing industry? How did you get into it?

51,engineering student in Canada looking for job market advice so plz plz,1428792228,"general first year at my school is almost over and its time to apply to specific fields of engineering. id be lying if i said money isnt a major motivator of my choice but before i go on let me just say,.. iv done very well in first year as far as grades go, and i love all forms of engineering. im only saying this so i don't get any ""you wont make it if your only in it for the money"" because I'm not and i hate how the money talk is like a taboo among engineer students (at least in my experiences).

so now, im debating between chemical, software, or electrical eng. chemical has been recommended to me by relatives and its usually has the highest mean salary but im thinking this is because alot of cheme's work in petroleum, and seeing how volatile that industry is its a bit disheartening. depending on who i talk to, they either tell me its a natural cycle and that petroleum work will never go away or its on its way out.

on the other end theres no denying that electrical and software eng's are in demand and have high salary themselves.

but what id really like to know is which fields of engineering (all fields not just the few iv mentioned) offer the greatest opportunity to ascend in pay. This is key because iv heard, for example, its rare for a software eng' to get past a senior engineer position whereas a chemical or mechanical have great capacity to work in management.

53,How do you figure out your market value when applying for jobs?,1428779021,"I am a mechanical engineer that graduated about 1.5 years ago and I am currently working in the auto industry in Detroit, MI. I am looking to move somewhere with warmer weather that is closer to the ocean so I can do water sports, I realize I will pay a premium for this.

I have applied to around 15 places in San Jose, San Fransciso, San Diego, and Los Angles but have not heard back from any of them, and I am worried that it is because I am asking for too much in terms of salary.

The formula I had used to calculate what to ask for was (amount i would be making currently based on cost of living index) * (1.13 [factor because of new jobs and as a buffer for salary negotiations])

This produced the following results for salaries I should be asking for in each city.

    Detroit					    $76840.00
    San Jose					$112338.54
    San Fransisco				$124995.63
    Los Angles					$100880.16
    San Diego					$101104.54

I really didn't think anything of it at the time, I knew California was much more expensive than the area I was living and just thought engineers would be compensated accordingly. Then while browsing glass door I noticed this is not always the case. Here are the average salaries for mechanical engineers in each city.

						            Average     Min         Max
    Detroit						    $70035.00	$59000.00	$86000.00
    San Jose				        $89522.00	$72000.00	$118000.00
    San Fransisco					$87601.00	$67000.00	$118000.00
    Los Angles						$71050.00	$58000.00	$96000.00
    San Diego						$73038.00	$55000.00	$102000.00

You will notice that the previous formula I used was generating some very high numbers for equivalent compensation. I decided go with a different approach, my data about salaries in each city was limited to min max and average so to compute a salary for the new area I decided to try to estimate what I would be making in the new city based on how far I am from the average engineer's salary in my current city and then adding the percentage for a raise to that value, that calculation produced much more reasonable results.

    Detroit										    $77989.78
    San Jose										$99690.16
    San Fransisco									$97550.97
    Los Angles										$79120.06
    San Diego										$81333.86

I will be using these new numbers on my application because I think they are more realistic. If anyone wants the spread sheet I used for my calculations I would be happy to try to provide it. If anyone has any better Ideas on what I should be asking for compensation or any other thoughts on the topic I would be happy to hear it.",AskEngineers,ElDiablo_Blanco,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3299b7/how_do_you_figure_out_your_market_value_when/

55,How do I manage my current career situation?,1428773485,"I posted in the main engineering career thread but no one has responded for days, so I figure I'd ask here. 

I graduated with a BS in electrical back in December, and my job search has ripened. I have three potentially very interesting situations. One is a company that is actually flying me in for an in person interview next week. Another is a company that was very encouraged by my phone interview last week, to where the hiring manager sent me a technical test to determine 'how much he has to train me' (paraphrasing, but I think important). The third situation is a government job, and I had a phone interview where the interviewer suggested an offer would be forthcoming in a couple of weeks (though of course nothing is guaranteed).

Company 1 is one of the largest public companies in the world and from what I understand an offer may follow while I am on site after I finish the interview and tour of their facility. The engineering involved is generalized but they do require electricals. Company 2 is a private company that is highly specialized and has potentially higher initial compensation due to the specialization required (which I have some experience in due to classes in school). I haven't heard yet back after sending in the technical assessment earlier this week but I expect to hear from them either tomorrow or early next week. And the last is the government job which I explained above.

I don't want to sour any of them from considering me, but I would like for company 2 to sort of move along in their decision if they want me to come in for an in person interview since the clock is probably going to start ticking on company 1 as soon as I finish my interview with them. Nothing is guaranteed but from my research I should be highly encouraged with company 1's commitment thus far.

I don't have exact numbers or specific benefits from any except the government job (due to public disclosure and all) but I'm looking for advice on how to manage this from more experienced engineers. I'd like the opportunity to see company 2 in person before I commit to anything.

I was thinking that I should let company 2 know that I'm going to be flying for a job interview soon. I don't think I should specify the company that I'd be interviewing with, but my thinking is that with the information that I'm in demand that they'll come to a decision faster on whether or not to have me come in person as well. I don't know how long I could delay in accepting an offer from company 1 in order to hear from company 2, and I'm ready to start my career and my real adult life.

EDIT: I just realized I should probably be a little more specific. All are locating in the US and I'd have to relocate for any of them. Company 1 is an automotive manufacturing company (though I don't want to jinx it by saying which one). Company 2 is an optical engineering company.

After power was restored from the 2003 blackout, suddenly I could watch cable tv channels like Cartoon Network and Disney Channel.

We are designing an Earthship/green home and I am working on the water supply system as we speak.  I'm going to be having a granular media filter installed on top of the roof covering the entire surface area and then running the filtered water to a cistern and treating it with chlorine from there.  I am concerned however that chlorine does not treat for cryptosporridium and I don't feel confident designing a UV system for it.  I'm wondering what your opinion is on the likelihood of it becoming a potential hazard.  Since it will be drawing water from the roof most animal contaminants won't be an issue aside from bird droppings.  Do you think this poses a significant enough risk to consider in the design?

consider boiling water being separated by a cyclon separator into two streams, one still being liquid water, the other being steam. What happens to the state variables of the inflowing water? Which are separated proportionally (my guess: internal energy and volume, so enthalpy as well) and which remain constant (my guess: pressure, temperature)? 

The cyclon separator does some work on the medium, so some energy due to the cyclon separator's work should be brought into it. But I guess I can neglect this additional energy in the first approximation. 

So, long story short (and simplified): when I separate an ideal medium in an adiabatic, closed system, say, at a 1:1 ratio, is it correct that:

* pressure remains constant
* temperature remains constant
* volume halves
* internal energy halves
* enthalpy halves (H = U + pV =&gt; H/2 = U/2 + p * V/2 )

That's all I can remember, resp. extrapolate from my understanding. Like I said... it's been quite a while.

The candles I’m looking at are simple LEDs and the run on CR3032 watch batteries, which are 3 Volts and 500 mAh. 

So, theoretically, couldn’t I crack them open and wire them all to a single battery pack using one or two 3V 1A batteries wired in parallel? Would it be a problem if I had20 feet of wire between the battery pack and the LED candles?

And, to make it a bit more complicated, could I just wire them to a transformer that outputs 3V DC instead? I assume the power coming out of that transformer would be save for a beginner like myself to monkey with, right?

10,Is 32 too late to go back for an Engineering Technologist career?,1428533956,"I am currently 31 and not really liking where my MA in Geography has taken me thus far.  Don't get me wrong, it's as much my effort as anything... But I am seeing the pay scales dwindle, and it am beginning to feel trapped.  Very few of my fellow graduates even use their degrees.  

Once many moons ago when I was 24-26 I was a surveyor for a civil engineering company. I enjoyed the work, and showed a real knack for it.  The owner even said he'd pay half if I went back to take civil engineering.  I chose not to, because I was passionate about an undergrad in planning (yes... Insert dumbest life decision ever in that column).  

My question is, is it too late at 32 to go back and take a diploma in engineering technology.  I live in Canada, and my local college is accredited, so with 2 years experience I could be a C.E.T.  However, given I start school next year I would be 32... A job outside at 34... Meaning I would be a C.E.T at 36. 

Now, I've done my homework and looked up pay scales.  I think it would pay off in the long run in lost income if I did go back... given it am hired immediately out of school.  But as engineers, what would you think of a 34 year old graduate in engineering technology?  Would I have a hard time competing against younger people?  In your opinion, as a career move, is it worth it?

13,Evaluation negotiation - Do my requests sound reasonable?,1428524880,"I'm due for a performance evaluation in the next couple weeks, and I was hoping for some advice on negotiating a raise.

Background: I've been with an aerospace company for the 2 years since earning my BSME. I have quickly gained responsibility as a design and test engineer. My notable accomplishments in the past year include leading the design of a flagship product and traveling to the two tradeshows that we attend yearly.I have also traveled a fair amount for customer support and product implementation (tradeshows/travel were not in the job description).

Company: 50 employees, 6 engineers, recently laid off ~5 production/admin employees, haven't gotten a lot of new business lately (although I've had plenty to work on)

Current (negotiable) compensation: $65k salary, no bonuses, $10k towards master's

I am working full-time and completing my master's in ME online. When I started the program in September, they agreed to give $10k towards school. The conditions are for every year I stay with the company, I do not have to pay back 20%. If I were to leave after, say, 3 years, I would only owe $4k. Effectively, they've given me a $2k/year loan, and if I stay for 5 years then I don't have to pay it back.

Since I have taken on the extra responsibilities of attending tradeshows, leading more complex projects, and generally being an asset to the company, I believe I deserve a raise and/or more help with school.

I want to ask for a 15% raise and another $10k towards school with the term reduced to 3 years. Is this reasonable? I figure it gives me bargaining room, but I don't want to be excessive. For reference, I started at $50k, and earned a $5k raise at 3, 9, and 15 months, which works out an 8-10% increase.

I have been keeping an eye on job postings, but nothing of interest has come up so I don't have any other offers to compare/leverage.

I really enjoy my job, but my biggest complaints with the company stem from minimal support with school  (degree will cost $40k), worrisome company performance, lack of mentorship, and lack of use of composites (focus of the degree). I don't want it to sound like a threat, but how can I articulate the conversation to communicate ""contribute more to my degree if you want me to slow my job search""?

Also have ~$7000 leftover from pursuing my math major at my current college and getting an excess of funds. 

I originally wanted to go to CU-Boulder. To my knowledge, it has the only aerospace program in the state, and it is quite a solid program from a national standpoint. In general, it seems to have a solid engineering program, and would offer me a fair amount of intern potential. On the other hand, it is pretty expensive. Estimated cost of living on campus is 29k a semester. I'm sure I can cut down on that, but Boulder is in general still an expensive place to live, and it is really off-setting to me.

On the other hand, CSU Fort Collins is another option, but I'm unsure of how solid it's engineering programs are. The estimated cost is far less, 24k a year is the estimated expenses (+ I believe cost of living will be in general far lower so I could lower this by living off campus) but I worry that it may not be the best choice for me.

The background here is that I want to build a climbing wall with 8'x12' climbing surface that can break down and fit in the trunk of a sedan.

I have parts of the design worked out, so I know a few pieces of information. First, the climbing surface is going to be made out of 3/4"" plywood (in 2'x4' sections). This will have to be bolted to an aluminum frame. Next, the wall needs to be overhung. Ideally, I want to be able to adjust the angle (15 deg, 30 deg, 50 deg).

So, there are two different types of aluminum I need. For the frame of the climbing wall, I need something that's easy to connect to other pieces at right angles where the connection won't compromise strength (because I don't want to have any pieces longer than 4'). And for the support structure, I'd like to have something telescoping that I can hold in place with a cotter pin or something similar.

We're running the actuator off a 12VDC battery. At max load, it draws 13A. To trigger the actuator, we are using a Carlisle DPDT momentary switch rated above 13A. 

What I'm looking for: A SPST NC switch, limit switch, or proximity switch that is rated above 13A at 12VDC. The problem: limit switches at this caliber are usually pretty expensive. This is a prototype for a cost-conscious consumer good, so I don't want to use an industrial-sized (and priced) Honeywell or other item. IP66 rating is preferred. 

I've looked into a few magnetic proximity switches (slick, but too low of rating), garage door limit switches, SPST NC button contact switches, and the whole gamut of industrial limit switches. Haven't found anything that fits our specs and wouldn't look out of place on a consumer-grade machine. 

Any ideas where to find our little switch? Or other clever ideas? A switch rated at 100VDC and 2A would get cooked, right? (higher power rating, but much lower current). Maybe a home-brew sprung blade connection, like the operator presence switch under a lawn tractor seat? 

We'd rather avoid using a solenoid or solid state relay for simplicity/ cost's sake, but it seems like that may be our only option. ",AskEngineers,a1gern0n,/r/AskEngineers/comments/31rrdh/looking_for_a_limit_or_contact_switch_high/

52,Is there a heavy-duty material out there that can mold to a shape when under pressure and then bounce back to original shape?,1428422864,"Hello all, 

I am looking to find a heavy duty metal material or a way to make a material that can mold to an object, when the object places pressure on the material, and then bounces back to original shape when the object is removed. 

For example if there is flat surface and a person steps on it with their shoe, the surface molds to their shoe and curls up into the sides of the shoe, and after the person removes the weight of their foot from it, the material bounces back to the original flat position. 

Here is an example that shows what I’m trying to describe, except instead of keeping the shape it would go back to being round:

http://technabob.com/blog/2013/06/12/they-may-look-uncomfortable-but-these-chairs-are-deceptively-comfy/


Similar to how a trampoline surface changes shape when you step into it and then regains shape when you are in the air or step off of it. Or how a very soft mattress molds to your body when you lay down, but then regains shape when you get off it.   


I was thinking some sort of metal mesh. Here are examples of what I found:

Is it possible to knit into them some sort of elastic to make them stretch under pressure and then rebound?

I’m looking for the material to support the weight of a person in the same way that bike pedals support the weight of a person when they put pressure on them. 

I hope what I’ve said makes sense and someone can give me an idea if what I’m looking for exists and or is plausible.

Any resources I can turn to for getting closer to find what I need?

54,"[Civil] In reinforced concrete sections, what happens if there is no bonding between concrete and steel?",1428421389,"Okay, so this question has been bothering me for quiet a long time. What happens if strain compatibility is not achieved? 
The way I imagine it is if we just 'place' concrete beam on steel reinforcement (as opposed to placing steel rods inside the body of concrete) there wont be much difference. As the load on concrete increases, the steel rods will bend and so will the concrete beam - thus achieving a faux 'strain compatibility' anyway. 
Could you please explain?

EDIT: The thing where we place the concrete beam on steel reinforcement is just to let you know that the bond between steel and concrete is absent. It just as well be like drilling holes in concrete and then inserting steel bars into the beam (the aim here is to not achieve any kind of bond).

* In an air-cooled system, the condenser has a fan blowing air over it which allows the refrigerant flowing through the condenser to reject heat to the atmosphere.

* In a water-cooled system, the condenser has water flowing through which is connected to a cooling tower, and the refrigerant rejects heat to the cooling tower water. 

* The compressor increases the condensing pressure (and temperature) so that the refrigerant temperature is high enough to reject heat to the atmosphere or to the cooling tower water. 

Either way, if the outside air temperature or cooling tower water temperature drops, the compressor does not need to do as much work to reject the heat (because it doesn't have to increase the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant as much as before).

The first part of this is just me toying with ideas, should this be feasible.  **I'm very curious about the ASME code compliance implications** with a project like this so anyone who has an idea as to where this kind of device would fall can skip to the bottom.

I have a number of concerns and questions so please correct/question me if something is unclear.  The weights are an estimate, but the strength of the lift system and all support members will likely be extremely over engineered for such a weight.

The basis of my plan is to build a small cellar which normally rests below ground and which is liftable to access its contents.  Contents will mostly be beer and wine, with the occasional 5gal beer fermenter when lagering a home brew.    Rough estimates on weight are:

- 1 x 5 gallon glass carboy filled with liquid:  ~50-60lbs
- 40-60 750ml bottles of wine, beer, or liquor.  I don't have the dimensions planned yet so I don't know exactly how many I'll be able to house.  The average corked with screw cap beer/champagne bottle weight 2.9lbs = 174lbs
- Weight of enclosure including flooring, shelves and support structure: estimated at ~60+lbs

Total estimated weight:  ~300lbs, but lets juice it to 350 for good measure.

The design of the lift and support system isn't the difficult part, I don't think.  I can build the frame and enclosure with materials I have on hand and most of the remaining existing parts are relatively cheap so cost isn't even an issue.  The rough idea of size so far is 3' by 3' by 3.5' deep or enough to maintain roughly 3 levels of shelving around the outside of the enclosure and a carboy in the middle.  I've come up with 3 ways to provide lift.

     1. Short throw pneumatic/hydraulic actuation with a distance multiplier.  

A:  A simple one or two pivot system (load and movement calculations yet to be done) should suffice but pneumatic doesn't likely have the load/force capabilities and hydraulic would require lines, compressor and possibly logic.  ~5000lb lift by 10"" throw.

B:  High cost.  Actuator, cost of steel/bearings, lines and compressor upwards of $500 + time spent engineering the lift angles and welding all connections.

C:  Likely runs on AC power.

     2. Long throw satellite actuator.  

A:  Linear (vertical) lift with no need for angle, load, or force direction calculations.

B:  ~ $75 each on ebay.  Only additional cost would be lateral support.

C:  Can be battery/solar operated.  Most operate at 12-36vDC

D:  Will need to design a logic or polarity reversal system

     3.  Marine winch and pulley system

I got this idea from the [drywall jack](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Choice-Products%C2%AE-Drywall-Contractors/dp/B002LCS54S) I've been using in our remodel and frankly it seems to be the most simple and elegant design.  Just one of [these](http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/product_200466652_200466652) has a line pull rating of 5000lbs, operates on a 12vDC system, and can be manually actuated in the event that power is not available.

http://i.imgur.com/96D3LM1.png?1

This is the basis.  I COULD include multiple pulleys for ease of lift, but frankly I think the whole thing is plenty over built.  Something that will need to be thought of for all methods would be lateral support.  If the system is hanging at the bottom of the throw the weight is being supported by the surrounding concrete floor and the winch cables.  When fully vertically extended, the side to side movement will need to be addressed. 

1. Telescoping tube stock, similar to the drywall jack.
2. 4 Stationary tubes with bushings mounted to the 4 corners of the enclosure, similar to what you'd see on a pulley driven weight machine at a gym.  Bushings will likely not even be necessary so long as I drill the holes to a tight enough tolerance.  I don't need this to be super silent/slick like a weight machine.
3. Steel ""T"" stock and the corresponding nesting stock on the sidewalls of interior floor.

At the moment, the lateral stabilization is probably the biggest design concern I'm running into

-----------------------------------

**Code!**
---
I believe that many safety codes are there for a reason.  NEC, ASME, etc are a result of people being injured or killed so I get it.  If I HAVE to get this approved (if that's even possible) by some sanctioning body I might consider it, but I don't find an imminent danger in this project at all.  That said, if you can think of a safety issue I've overlooked please speak up.  

I plan on making the tolerances as tight as possible to eliminate pinch points but of course with this  many moving parts there are inherent risks.  From what I've read about the codes, most of the requirements and definitions are pointing at dumbwaiters and other material lifts.  Dumbwaiters, for instance, are required to be no higher than the ceiling of the upper most floor and no lower than the lowest (implying they cannot run underground), but would this be considered a dumbwaiter?  Could I get dinged for this on a future home inspection when we go to sell?  What kind of weight limits am I looking at?

82,I cannot come close to my microphone without creating a strong buzz. When I Hold my microphone's cable this stops. Why and how to solve it?,1428339027,"I have a generic headset I like to use just for its microphone connected to my desktop pc. Now people have been complaining about a buzzing sound in the background but only today ive come close to finding out why.

When the headset is sitting on my desk these is no buzz, when I reach out to it with my hand it starts (before i touch it, 10-15 cm away) and increases all to way until i put it on my head.

Now these headphones have 2 jacks to plug into the pc, one for mic and one for sound. The sound one is not connected and hanging in the air (since i use my speakers on very low for sound). When I hold this second plug/jack in my hand all the buzzing dissapears instantly. When i plug it in to my pc there is buzzing. Tried connecting it to my phone and even my 100W guitar amp, still buzzing. Seems my body is the magic solution here.

I wrapped a thin copper wire around this connection pin for the headphones, and when i connect this wire to my metal watch on my arm the buzzing is gone again (obviously) but when i connect this wire to the ''grounding"" metal part in my wall electric plug, the buzzing continues.

Is my house (and plugs) not grounded at all? If not what might be causing this?

85,"Trying to improve a Tetris light set so that the pieces stay put, but still re-configurable. I think the logical step would be magnets, but I would love to read your comments.",1428329933,"Hey fellow engineers!

My brother gifted me for Christmas the following Tetris light set:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPsoJivz6D8

If you've gone through the whole video, you will see that since the contact between pieces is based on gravity. Sometimes, the light flickers and it's not very appealing. Also, the pieces are very light, and even though the look [cool as hell](http://imgur.com/cgH4qkk), the lightest brush against the holding surface will knock them out of position and [have them flicker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPsoJivz6D8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=245).

I've been thinking of opening each one of the pieces, and gluing rare earth magnets to each of the sides; but my worry is that with a fixed polarity I will greatly reduce the number of combinations possible, since any two sides with the same polarity will repel.

My latest idea would be to use Buckyballs (or generic equivalent) and glue them to the vertices. However, the only reason that I think this would work is that I've never seen BuckyBalls repelling each other. To be honest, and I'm kind of embarrassed to even admit this, I have no idea how the polarity of a single ball works when put into a ball array.

Do Buckyballs rotate physically to better suit magnetic equilibrium when arranged into different shapes? Or does the polarity change to adapt to the situation? If it was the former, I would have to ""entrap"" the magnet in each vertex in a way that allows some movement for the magnets to align themselves. If it was the latter, I could just glue and forget.

Assuming my understanding is correct, Is there an equation that relates all of this together?

It's been a long time since I've taken an EE class and I was wondering if you'd be kind enough to offer suggestions.  I have a 220v 3 phase transformer similar to the one pictured.  However, my shop has only 220v single phase.  The transformer was originally wired in delta configuration as shown in the schematic.  I know that I need to consider not only current in the coils, but also magnetic flux given that the transformers share a common core.  I think the common core is what's making me a bit unsure of myself.  

It's obvious that I could simply leave two of the transformers unused and just connect my mains to A1 and A2.  

Could I make use of a second transformer by connecting my mains to A2 and B2, jumping A1-B2 &amp;amp; B1-A2, leaving transformer C unused?  
(Or would it be any better/different to use A and C, leaving B unused?)  

Is there a way for me to use all three without doing something dumb?  What would you do?  

(Also, just looking for suggestions for what I described. I know about VFDs and rotary phase converters.)

This article is currently on the front page of r/all.

So I'm in a little discussion regarding the temperature a smartphone would reach being outside and not in use. I'm sure most (I don't want to generalize and say all) of you know that smartphones turn off, or go into a temporary unusable state when they reach a certain temperature to prevent the temperature from increasing and causing problems. 

Now to my question, let's say a person is a construction worker (or anyone who's outdoors) that either has their smartphone in their pocket or on a belt holster, and the outside temperature is 123°F (50.555°C) and let's say at 115°F (46.111°C) the phone has the temperature safety shut down. Will the phone shut down because the outside temp is 123°F (50.555°C) assuming the phone is powered on, but not in use?

Based on what I know my personal response would be ""No it won't"" also because I would think people who live in high temperature regions would get pretty upset that their phones are overheating when not used.

Of course, if I bend them with my hands, it does bend- but it will spring right back (of course I took it apart again to do this so I don't damage anything).  I even laid it across two pipes and stepped on it.  It bends far but springs right back.  I'm not gonna try that anymore because I'm afraid I'll shatter it or break it.

Any ideas?

17,Can voltage fluctuations trip a UPS?,1428112941,"Hello!

So, I just encountered this, and I'm really confused as to why it's happening. I have a little fan, rated at 120V and 0.5A. I have it hooked up in our loft because I have a fever but want to use the computer. It's hooked up to one socket, with a Raspberry Pi hooked into the same outlet but a different socket. (Not sure if I'm using the correct terms. The outlet being the overall thing in the wall, the socket being what you actually plug into.).

In another outlet, I have a UPS hooked up. I have some things on battery backup, some not. My monitor is on power backup simply because I ran out of plugs. So is our router and modem, with my tower and lamp not on the backup but still hooked up to the UPS.


Whenever I switch off the fan, the display on my monitor goes out. The power light stays on, but the actual display goes dark, only for a second. None of my other electronics are behaving the same way. Raspberry Pi doesn't even blink, my desktop acts as if nothing happened. My desktop draws far more power than my monitor, so I don't think it's an issue with there not being enough power.


Why does it do that? Does the UPS sense a voltage fluctuation from the fan suddenly going off and believe there to be a loss of power, and try to switch my monitor over to the battery? Or is it something else entirely?

18,We supplied 5V to a 4V max pressure sensor. Did we ruin it?,1428105119,"Hi everyone,

A friend and I are pursuing a project and trying to create our first prototype.  We ordered a set of [MS5803-01BA](http://www.meas-spec.com/product/Pressure/MS5803-01BA.aspx) pressure/temperature sensors and mounted them to [SSOP to DIP](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/497) conversion boards to break out the pins and attach headers.  Rather than use resistors and capacitors like we were likely supposed to, we just connected 3.3V, ground, clock, and data for an I2C connection.  This wasn't giving us the correct values, so we attempted to use one of the two with a 5V source of power.  Still didn't work, so we went back through the data sheet and saw that the max voltage supply was 4.0V.  We wanted to make sure that we didn't ruin one of our two sensors first before proceeding in trying to get them to work again.

27,How can I make the best use of a 3 phase power transformer with single phase power?,1428081140,"Hey guys...  It's been a long time since I've taken an EE class and I was wondering if you'd be kind enough to offer suggestions.  I have a 220v 3 phase transformer similar to the one pictured.  However, my shop has only 220v single phase.  The transformer was originally wired in delta configuration as shown in the schematic.  I know that I need to consider not only current in the coils, but also magnetic flux given that the transformers share a common core.  I think the common core is what's making me a bit unsure of myself.  

It's obvious that I could simply leave two of the transformers unused and just connect my mains to A1 and A2.  

Could I make use of a second transformer by connecting my mains to A2 and B2, jumping A1-B2 &amp; B1-A2, leaving transformer C unused?  
(Or would it be any better/different to use A and C, leaving B unused?)  

Is there a way for me to use all three without doing something dumb?  What would you do?

28,What is the relationship between size and frequency of a mechanical oscillator?,1428078692,"I've always just accepted that as you scale down a mechanical system the frequency and Q factor both increase. For example, [this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_system_oscillator) simply says that ""Small bells ring at higher frequencies than large bells"".

But for a driven damped harmonic oscillator, what is the exact relationship between size, resonant frequency, and Q factor?

[This PDF](http://www.ieee-uffc.org/frequency-control/learning/pdf/Kaajakari-MEMS_Resonators_v2b.pdf) states that a tuning fork scales:

ω_r ∝ 1/size

But how about a mass-spring-damper? Will this also scale the same as the tuning fork?

I'm trying to find out how the frequency and Q factor scale as you scale down MEMS oscillators, and the PDF above states that a MEMS oscillator can be modelled as a mass-spring-damper.

mx¨+cx˙+kx=F

If the oscillator can be modelled as above, can we use the same scaling law as the tuning fork? If we can, how can this be proved mathematically? If not, how will it scale?  I'm guessing it all depends on how *m*, *c*, and *k* scale with size. If this is complex, what is a fair assumption to simplify the problem? If the maths is still too complex, are there any rules of thumb of how mass-spring-damper frequency scales with size?

What kind of options exist?",1428004001,"I'm graduating this May from a big name US engineering school with my EE BS. I have been applying to positions in the greater Boston area and am trying to move there post graduation. I've been offered an entry level position in a post-undergraduate type program at an electric utility company. I would be starting in June at said company. I haven't received any calls for interviews at other companies yet, and I only had a week to consider this specific offer. I'm very conflicted because I feel like I should say yes (because I haven't gotten leads anywhere else right now), but I also do not want to be in the power or utility industry. (I had an internship at a utility company and found out there it wasn't for me, I ended up talking to the company in question at a career fair and sort of felt pressure by the post graduation job climate to keep moving forward with it/get interview practice). 

I want to be working in an industry related to signals&amp;systems, and that is where my elective coursework has been (DSP, controls, communications etc), and I feel like if I accept this job I'm going to kill my chances at being hired at a company to do anything unrelated to power/utility work because that's where my job experience will have been. 

If I accepted this position, I would feel inclined to still keep my job search going before my start date to see if I could get anything in the industry I actually want to be in. If that did happen I would have to renege this offer, which feels like a bad thing to do but I wouldn't mind burning bridges with this company since it's not the industry I want to stay in anyway. This company has a rather well known name and I don't think it'd be too difficult for them to replace me.

The other option is that I decline and risk not having anything set up after I graduate. My technical electives and junior/senior coursework is relevant to DSP/controls/communications type jobs that I am looking for, but my internship experience isn't. 

I am leaning towards accepting the offer and reneging if I was given an offer in the field relevant to where I want to be, but the repercussions of that worry me. If I took the position and didn't receive other offers/started working there, my backup plan then is to plan to stay for ~ a year, and apply to graduate schools for the 2016/2017 school year to get more experience in the signals/communications industry (a majority of positions I see posted for entry level signals/comm jobs ask for at least an MS so this doesn't seem like an objectively bad idea). Is this foolish?

I'm doing a little research into storm shelters. I'm looking at [http://www.depts.ttu.edu/nwi/research/DebrisImpact/Reports/DIF_reports.pdf](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/nwi/research/DebrisImpact/Reports/DIF_reports.pdf) where they fire multiple things, primarily 2x4s, at different types of walls to see how they hold up. I'm trying to figure out how that might translate to a car being rammed/thrown into the wall.

Using energy = 1/2 * mass * velocity^2:

If the 2x4 weighs 15 lbs and is traveling 100 mph then thats 5,014 ft-lbs. And if the impact area is 8in^2, then that's 626.75 ft-lbs/in^2.

If a car weighs 4000 lbs and is traveling 50 mph then that's 334,290 ft-lbs. And if the impact area is (guessing 4ftx1ft since the top half of the front end really just crumples) 576 in^2, then that's 580.36 ft-lbs/in^2.

I remember back when I took physics there being an example of a bowling ball and a bullet with the same amount of energy. Which would you rather be hit by? I guess it's the same idea. And in energy = 1/2 * mass * velocity^2 the fact that velocity is squared makes it make more important for the amount of energy in a system?

Am I overlooking something really important or is the impact actually milder with the car? Am I focusing on the wrong numbers?

75,Kinetic Sculpture Enthusiast Seeking Advice Regarding the Mechanics Behind Contraption,1427852940,"As an artist, I often see something work in my head before drawing out the plans for it. This of course is pretty problematic when physics gets involved. What I do know is that with two gears connected, the larger one with more teeth rotates slower than the smaller one due to gear ratios. If that smaller gear has attached to it a central shaft, could this shaft, if attached to it is a string and a weight, have enough energy that it winds up the string? The weight does not have to be very heavy. In fact, lighter the better so its weight would just = the amount required to pull the gear train in the opposite direction.

If this 'engine' works as intended, I could then attach other gear trains using ratchets that are only rotated when the mechanism is unwinding.

This cell is a White-type (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipass_spectroscopic_absorption_cells#White_cell), with the mirrors M2 and M3 that must be slightly adaptable to compensate for temperature dilatation and to adapt absorption path inside the cell.

My cell is double : one internal cell (White-type), which can be heated up to about 1,000 K, and an external one, that act as a thermal shield. The internal cell will contains various gases at low pressure (about 10^-5 to 200 mbar), while the space between the two cells will be maintained at about 10^-5 mbar (turbo-molecular pumping).

I have strong conditions : high temperature (~1,000 K), low pressure (~10^-5 mbar) and a slow motion. And I have, for our experiments to work correctly, to maintain the quantity of gas in the inner cell very stable, hence need a very impervious seal.

The wood post will just bend way beyond what it should.   
    
I created the model and assigned an appropriate material property (using the stiffness matrix) with values from the [Forrest Products Lab's Wood Handbook (ch. 4)](http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fpl_gtr190.pdf) for the modulus of elasticity, Poissons ratio, and shear modulus.

The object impacting the wood column is modeled as a block of mild steel, and I have successfully run the job and have results.  
      
The problem is that the wood part won't fail -- it'll bend like a piece of rubber and show extremely high distortion in the parts near the fixed end. I've gone through and enabled element deletion in the mesh settings, but I believe I need to specify the material properties which dictate the maximum level of stress (?) for which the material fails.

6,"[Question] What is the absolute most efficient type of small air compressor, in terms of electrical power?",1427738486,"I have something I'm trying to design, crudely, and it requires an air compressor with an accumulator on the output.  Problem is, I know jack s*** about air compressors.

When I say ""small"", I'm thinking in terms of packaging - I don't really want something humongous, but I do need a pretty decent flow rate out of the accumulator (something like 10k CFM at ~&lt;50 PSI).

Difficulty:

* Will operate in a cool environment with low humidity
* Will be static when in operation
* Must have limited vibration characteristics (so reciprocal designs might be out...)
* Ideally wouldn't use a liquid cooler
* Must operate via AC, and can't draw stupid amounts of current (either 120v or 240v, single phase, max of maybe 5 amps?)

I need a flow rate out of the accumulator of about 10k CFM, so I have no idea how realistic that is.

Can someone smarter than me tell me if this is possible in a package that meets the above limits and fits in a package not larger than 30""x20""x12""?

Edit: thanks for the replies everyone - I'm convinced now that my scheme won't work, largely based on the fact that the continuous flow would require an enormous compressor and similarly enormous amount of power to run it.  I suppose I'll go back to the fan/cowl idea!

9,Quitting my first engineer job. How to handle it?,1427734154,"Hello all
I've graduated with BS EE back in 2012 and I was able to found a job shortly after graduating.

I've been in this company for about 2 and half years and though this company has treated me fairly well, I feel I have to call it quits for various reasons:

- I am working as field service engineer. Essentially, I feel more like a technician than engineer
- The location where I am currently is not doing it for me. I've asked for relocation but no dice.
- I work with only one coworker and he and I don't get along at all. He has been relocated 3x in the past because of not getting along with people at work and with customers (lucky me).
- The language barrier. I work for a Japanese based company and I lack of reading/writing Japanese, as well communication engineers from Japan. This is probably a major concern for me in the long term.

That being said, there is not much growth for me in my current status. 
I have already plans on what to do after the transition, but this is my first time quitting an engineer job.

Should I give my boss a 6 week notice so that they have a chance to find a replacement? Or would that put me in a risk of getting boned that they will decide to cut me off 2 weeks?

17,Are there any studies or analyses addressing safety issues caused by bicyclists traveling at a much lower speed than prevailing traffic?,1427692360,"A defensive driving instructor once told our class that a vehicle moving slower than the prevailing traffic creates a choke-point and is thus a danger  both to itself and to those driving near it.

I am not an engineer, but this makes sense to me.

I have been unsuccessful in trying to find any studies applying this principle to bicycles riding with motor vehicles.  It is my understanding that bicycles generally manage an average speed of only 18 mph or so, and thus would provide a choke-point on surface streets leading to safety issues -- not just for the cyclists, but for the motor vehicles trying to go around them.

Seems like the impact of this speed differential would be a very important point to address in assessing the safety of mixing bicycles with motor vehicles, but my basic Googling has been unable to find any studies or analyses confirming it, denying it, or simply giving it serious treatment.

29,Problem with a stepper motor that is connected to a cryocooler.,1427659477,"
Update:  [THedman07](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/30qb69/problem_with_a_stepper_motor_that_is_connected_to/cpuuup9) has pointed out that it is a brushless motor, not a stepper.  


**The Device**

[This](http://i.imgur.com/fNenvz9.jpg) is a cryocooler.  (Not shown is a heatsink that shrouds the motor case that I have removed for visibility.)  It is a relatively simple device consisting of a compressor assembly on one end (left) and a DC motor on the other (right).

The compressor is Ricor model K526PT.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/34KJ7rX.jpg) is the end cap taken off the motor.  

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/NPGi7FV.jpg) is the compressor removed from the motor stator. 

The rotor is inside the chrome tube that is part of the compressor assembly and is inserted into the stator.  The compressor unit must remain sealed.

There are 2 wires, Red and Black that enter the end cap.  The inside of the cap and the stator looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/44CevqD.jpg). 

From the surface of the black area to the underside of the cap is 8mm.  On the surface of the black area is white writing that says 43-13 and HYB-009.  There are electronics housed in here to drive the motor windings.  I am unable to gain access to this area or remove the stator from its casing as I do not have small enough Allen wrenches (I need either 1.25mm or 1.3mm).  I have ordered these wrenches.

The cryocooler is rated at 24-28VDC and up to 3A.

I have been unable to find documentation on this device.  I have found documentation for a similar device, [here](http://www.ricor.com/wp-content/uploads/file/K562S%20Micro%20Miniature%20Rotary%20Stirling%20Cryocooler.pdf)

**The Problem**

I connected the motor wires to [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/261199359000?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) 24VDC, 10A power supply  like [this](http://i.imgur.com/MXIZdL3.jpg).

1st run:  The device ran for about 3-4 seconds before stopping.  I removed power to prevent damage.

Subsequent runs:  Any time I put power to the device, I hear the compressor run for approximately 250-500ms before stopping.  If the device is left plugged in, the motor area continues to head up so that if it were left plugged in for about 10 seconds it would be hot to touch. (I haven't left it plugged in this long, to prevent damage)  If I remove the compressor and just plug in the stator by itself, the back plate rises in temperature at a fast rate.  It would be hot to touch at 5-10 seconds.

**Possible Issues**

The problem lies in either the compressor or the stator.

There could be a problem with the compressor unit that causes the rotor to be unable to turn.  Since the motor is effectively stalled, this could explain the heat build up.

If there is a problem with the stator, I don't know what it could be.  It seems like it's connected to an appropriate power supply and nothing appears to be damaged from what I can tell.  I was thinking there could be a problem with the chip that is likely in the end cap that controls the windings, but I don't have a scope to tell and I can't gain access to that area until I get the proper Allen key.  I don't know how to determine that the stator is working properly, but I want to focus on this because if I can determine that the stator is functioning properly, that narrows down the possible problem to the compressor.  So, how can I ensure that the motor is good to go?

Any thoughts?

I'm a Civil PE and I have a few questions about the industry,1427467157,"My 13 year old son is talking about becoming a mechanical engineer.  I'm his step dad and only been around for three years so far.  He's mostly talking about being a mechanical engineer for two reasons i think.  One is that he's influenced by my career.  I'm a Civil PE working in commercial site permitting, design, and construction.  The only other thing he really cares about is cars and wants to get into car design and manufacturing.  

So, I only interact with mechanical engineers who do HVAC and plumbing systems for commercial buildings. I have a probably biased view that most MEs do this kind of work.  What are his chances of getting to work for a car company and where should we focus on improving his chances.

84,How do you keep motivated with busy work at work?,1427410265,"My employer is going through a bit of a crunch right now.

The flow of new clients coming in over-all utilization rate of the engineering firm is at an all-time low. Perhaps one-half of the workforce is billing their hours to our company, we do not have any billable projects at the moment.  Upper management is expecting things to be in a depression until min June, when work picks up again.

In the meantime, I have been assigned busy work, cataloging equipment and miscellaneous items we always purchase on projects.  The work is mind-numbingly boring. I despise coming to work to everyday. Prior to this busy work, I was finishing up a fantastic project that kept me busy for 50+ hours per week until the bitter end. Needless to say, my boredom has overcome me at work. I’m on Reddit, news websites, reading about new inventions, checking my sports teams out, etc. Doing everything but the work I was assigned.

I was assigned the busy work about 6 weeks ago. I estimate I’m probably 25% through with it. I have no idea when the deadline is, nobody checks up on me, management isn’t busy so they don’t come to work. I feel like I’m wasting away at work. Lots of people have quit for similar reasons (we’re performance based, no real work for ½ the year = poor salary). 

I’ve been asking everyone if they have projects I can help with. Nobody wants to give up their work.

How do you cope with boredom at work and keep motivated?

90,Which type of regulator do I need to control rotation velocity of a hydraulic motor driving a huge mass?,1427395567,"I have to regulate the rotation velocity of  a hydraulic motor. For this purpose I have 2 linear valves steering the flow of oil from 0%-100%. Each of them is for one direction. The problem is, a usual P-regulator doesn't work, because equilibrium of forces isn't known. Basically I don't know where the 0 point is. I don't want to use an linear integrator because the motor is driving a huge mass which is itself an  integrator for kinetic energy giving me easily a phase  of 360 degrees. 

The only solution I found was to open a valve with a single predetermined step each cycle until I reach a minimum. As soon I'm reaching a maximum I subtract 2 steps.

98,"Hopefully simple question about wiring a motor and speed controller to an outlet, from a newbie.",1427379557,"Hi all,

I'm new to any type of electrical work, and I'm interested in learning because making gadgets as a hobby is very appealing.  However my normal approach of trying, failing, then figuring out what went wrong seems like a potentially deadly way to enter this space.  So, I have a few questions to ask that will not only avoid any accidents, but hopefully make me more knowledgeable overall.

So, I ordered this cheap motor: http://www.zoro.com/i/G1611267/
and this motor control unit: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QV10548/ref=pe_385040_128020140_TE_3p_dp_1

My goal is simply to get a motor running at controllable speeds (it's all about baby steps :-) )

I thought I ordered compatible parts, but after looking closer I noticed some mistakes I made.  It seems the motor and the controller would work together, but the power supply on the controller wants AC 220V.  I assume my outlet is 110v, which leads to the questions:

1) If I were to plug this into a wall outlet, what would happen?  My guess is that everything would be under powered, but relatively functional.

2) Since I'm new to this, I don't have the terminology down and I'm having trouble finding a power cable that ends with exposed wires to attach to my experiment.  I figured I could just strip an off-the-shelf cable, but I can't imagine this is how professional engineers handle it.  What would you call  power cables with exposed ends?

3) If you look on the back of the motor control unit, there's six wiring spots.  The two on the left side have me confused.  I assume PW means power, and the line between the two represents an open switch.  Does this mean I need some sort of additional switch connected in this spot to make it function, or would this just be wired into an additional shut down switch?

3) For anyone that does this sort of thing, can you point me toward good sources of information for an electrical hobbyist?  My problem with most of the sources I found is while they provide a wealth of facts, they don't really get into what happens in non-ideal situations like the one I'm in.  My trail and error approach to learning doesn't like this; my frail, squishy human frame doesn't like the possible results of doing these things incorrectly  :-)  Also a good source to get materials outside of random Google searching would be appreciated too!

I hope these questions aren't too stupid!  Thanks for any info/advice you can provide!
