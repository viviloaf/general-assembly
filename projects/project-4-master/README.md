# Hackathon Project ðŸš€

Pick a tabular dataset and make a predictive model with it. 

## Timeline

- By 11:30am ET, Slack the instructional team what your 1-line problem statement and the name of your dataset. We will give you a thumbs up or ask questions/make suggestions.
- Commit regularly.
- By 4:30pm ET, make your final push to your GitHub submission repo. 
- At 4:30pm ET, we'll do 5-minute lightning talks where you'll tell the class what you found. No slides necessary - you can walk us through your Jupyter notebook if you prefer. 

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. We're not expecting anything as polished as project two or three, for example. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored.

If you have a big data file, keep it out of GitHub by using your .gitignore file.

## Datasets

You can pick any dataset you're interested in. 

Your dataset and problem do not need to be novel, but please do not pick a dataset that you have used before or that is extremely common in data science examples (such as Titanic, Iris, MNIST, etc.).

There are many curated collections of interesting datasets online. Here are a few links to get you started:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Reminder: do not duplicate someone else's work and give credit where credit is due.

## Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
